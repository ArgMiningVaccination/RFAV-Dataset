Acupuncture has been widely used in the treatment of migraines; however, few studies have examined whether its use reduces the risk of strokes in migraineurs. This study explored the long-term effects of acupuncture treatment on stroke risk in migraineurs using national real-world data. We collected new migraine patients from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2017. Using 1:1 propensity-score matching, we assigned patients to either an acupuncture or non-acupuncture cohort and followed up until the end of 2018. The incidence of stroke in the two cohorts was compared using the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Each cohort was composed of 1354 newly diagnosed migraineurs with similar baseline characteristics. Compared with the non-acupuncture cohort, the acupuncture cohort had a significantly reduced risk of stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.46). The Kaplan-Meier model showed a significantly lower cumulative incidence of stroke in migraine patients who received acupuncture during the 19-year follow-up (log-rank test, p < 0.001).

Introduction [1](#B1-ijerph-20-01690), [2](#B2-ijerph-20-01690)]. In addition to the unbearable unilateral, throbbing headache, a migraine may also be accompanied by symptoms, such as nausea and/or vomiting or photophobia and/or phonophobia, which often seriously affect a person's quality of work and life [ [3](#B3-ijerph-20-01690)]. Currently, migraines are mainly treated with pharmacological therapy. The treatment goal is to relieve the pain symptoms of acute headaches, and reduce the frequency of attacks and rate of recurrence, thus enabling the patient's return to normal work and life as quickly as possible [ [4](#B4-ijerph-20-01690)]. However, some patients have poor tolerance to oral medications, and the unpleasant side effects and lower-than-expected efficacy of these medications may lead to low treatment compliance and other complications, causing some patients to choose acupuncture therapy [ [5](#B5-ijerph-20-01690)]. [6](#B6-ijerph-20-01690)]. Even if a patient survives a stroke, he/she is usually left with some degree of neurological deficit, which often imposes a heavy life and financial burden on both patients and their caregivers. [7](#B7-ijerph-20-01690)]. A nationwide population-based study concluded that migraines are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, especially in young (age 45 years) women with migraines with aura [ [8](#B8-ijerph-20-01690)]. In another recent study, both a migraine without aura and a migraine with aura were associated with an increased risk of a stroke compared with non-migraineurs (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.49 and 1.63, respectively) [ [9](#B9-ijerph-20-01690)]. However, there is currently no direct evidence to support that the preventive medication treatment recommended for use reduces future stroke attacks in migraineurs [ [7](#B7-ijerph-20-01690), [10](#B10-ijerph-20-01690)]. [11](#B11-ijerph-20-01690)]. An overview of systematic reviews concluded that acupuncture leads to a higher reduction in the number of days with headaches and the use of pain medication, and is more effective at reducing headache frequency and severity, than the same parameters associated with Western medicine and sham acupuncture [ [12](#B12-ijerph-20-01690)]. A randomized clinical trial concluded that acupuncture treatment was more efficient than sham acupuncture or no acupuncture treatment in reducing long-term recurrent migraine in patients with migraines without aura [ [13](#B13-ijerph-20-01690)]. Furthermore, in one study, patients in the group receiving real acupuncture were significantly better at controlling pain levels and improving quality of life with chronic migraines than those in the sham acupuncture group [ [14](#B14-ijerph-20-01690)]. Another study revealed that preventive acupuncture in patients with chronic migraine significantly reduced the average number of moderate/severe headache days per month compared with the change associated with topiramate treatment [ [15](#B15-ijerph-20-01690)]. In addition, a growing number of clinical trials have shown that acupuncture, when used in stroke therapy, provides excellent complementary and alternative therapy for post-stroke rehabilitation; it also serves as a preventive strategy that induces cerebral ischemic tolerance [ [16](#B16-ijerph-20-01690), [17](#B17-ijerph-20-01690), [18](#B18-ijerph-20-01690), [19](#B19-ijerph-20-01690)]. Therefore, we investigated whether acupuncture could provide long-term protection against strokes in patients with migraines. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Source 2.2. Study Population [Figure 1](#ijerph-20-01690-f001). The primary outcome of the study was the incidence of stroke (ICD-9-CM 430-438 or ICD-10-CM: I60-I69), as diagnosed by a nationally certified neurologist. The follow-up period in both cohorts started from the index date until diagnosis with stroke, death, withdrawal from the National Health Insurance (NHI) program, or the end of 2018. Baseline comorbidities were considered to exist, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, head injury, Parkinson's disease, chronic kidney disease, and mental disorders. Medication usage was defined as the first prescribed medication after migraine and included topiramate), and amitriptyline. Patient medication usage was classified (into groups) as those taking 0-1, 2-3, or >3 medications, according to the accumulated number of medications prescribed throughout the follow-up. 2.3. Statistical Analysis 3. Results [Table 1](#ijerph-20-01690-t001)presents the baseline characteristics of both cohorts. In terms of sex, age, urbanization level, occupation, income, baseline comorbidities, and medication use, there were no significant differences between the cohorts. The ratio of females to males was about 7:3. Regarding the age subgroups, the highest proportion of migraine sufferers in both groups was in the 40-59 age group, with a mean age of about 47 years. The most common baseline comorbidities in both groups were mental disorders (44%), followed by hypertension (25%), and hyperlipidemia (14%). Most migraine sufferers (52%) took two to three different medications. The average follow-up time for stroke was 13.77 years in the acupuncture cohort and 9.71 years in the non-acupuncture cohort. [Table 2](#ijerph-20-01690-t002)shows the crude and adjusted HRs for stroke and covariates in migraineurs. Among patients with migraines, 387 patients (20.76 per 1000 person-years) who received acupuncture and 636 patients (48.38 per 1000 person-years) who did not receive acupuncture had strokes during the follow-up. In a Cox proportional hazards model, after adjusting for sex, age, urbanization level, occupation, income, baseline comorbidities, and medication use, migraineurs receiving acupuncture had a significantly lower risk of strokes than acupuncture non-users (aHR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.35-0.46). There was no significant difference in the risk of stroke development between males and females with migraines (males vs. females: aHR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88-1.17). Among patients with migraines, the risk of a stroke exhibited a dose-dependent increase with advancing age (aHR, 2.55; 95% CI, 2.1-3.09 for patients aged aHR, 4.93; 95% CI, 4-6.09 for patients aged >59 years vs. 20-39 years). Hypertension, coronary artery disease, head injury, Parkinson's disease, and mental disorders were baseline comorbidities that increased the risk of a stroke. Patients with migraines who took more medications had a dose-dependent lower risk of a stroke (aHR, 0.18; 95% CI, for 0-1 medication). [Table 3](#ijerph-20-01690-t003)displays the incidence rates and HRs of strokes in acupuncture users compared to acupuncture non-users stratified by sex, age, urbanization level, occupation, income, baseline comorbidities, and medication use. The beneficial effect of receiving acupuncture treatment on stroke incidence was observed in both female and male migraine patients (aHR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.32-0.43 for females; aHR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.25-0.41 for males). Acupuncture reduced the risk of strokes in patients in all age groups and in patients who did or did not have baseline comorbidities. Patients in the acupuncture cohort using any drug doses were less likely to have strokes than those in the non-acupuncture cohort. [Table 4](#ijerph-20-01690-t004)show that, compared with non-acupuncture patients, patients who received acupuncture had a lower risk of these types of strokes. [Figure 2](#ijerph-20-01690-f002)shows that\u2014using the Kaplan-Meier analysis\u2014the cumulative incidence of strokes in patients with migraines was significantly lower in the acupuncture users than in the acupuncture non-users during the 19-year follow-up period (log-rank test, p < 0.001). 4. Discussion [20](#B20-ijerph-20-01690), [21](#B21-ijerph-20-01690)]. The Central Health Insurance Bureau has been building the NHIRD since 1998 and has provided value-added services for its data to facilitate related medical and public health research since 2000. The NHIRD provides a large population sample: real-world evidence that can eliminate bias from limited sample sizes. In addition, the database presents a long-term follow-up window of more than 10 years, which makes it easier for researchers to study the development of chronic diseases and the risk of related diseases. In Taiwan, traditional Chinese medicine treatment, which includes acupuncture, is only performed by qualified traditional Chinese medicine doctors after complete training and national certification. In clinical practice, this modality is completely complementary to modern medicine and ensures that patients are provided with the most suitable diagnoses and treatments. The relevant treatment records are included in the NHIRD. Therefore, we consider this database to be a trustworthy research tool from which we developed unbiased real-world evidence for our study. [10](#B10-ijerph-20-01690), [22](#B22-ijerph-20-01690)]. We speculate that several reasons are behind this. Most studies report that female migraine patients are more prone to ischemic strokes than their male counterparts, but the relationship with hemorrhagic stroke remains controversial [ [23](#B23-ijerph-20-01690), [24](#B24-ijerph-20-01690), [25](#B25-ijerph-20-01690), [26](#B26-ijerph-20-01690)]. However, our study evaluated all types of strokes, which might have influenced our results. The prevalence of migraines in men is approximately one-third that of women, and the association with strokes is more uncertain in men than in women [ [27](#B27-ijerph-20-01690)], especially in our limited paired sample. In addition, we did not include migraine-free male and female populations with strokes for comparison, which might also have led to different results. However, acupuncture was associated with reduced stroke risk in both male and female patients with migraines. Patients with migraines in the present study who were aged 40-59 years and >59 years had a higher risk of strokes than younger populations, suggesting that the risk of a stroke increases with increasing age. This finding is similar in general populations without migraines [ [28](#B28-ijerph-20-01690), [29](#B29-ijerph-20-01690)], indicating that aging may be a pivotal factor that increases the incidence of strokes in the migraine population. We found that acupuncture significantly reduced the risk of strokes in all age groups of patients with migraines and that patients of older ages had a higher risk of strokes. Thus, we infer that acupuncture treatment offers a very good and substantial protective benefit to older patients with migraines. [30](#B30-ijerph-20-01690), [31](#B31-ijerph-20-01690)]. Previous studies have shown that a substantial proportion of stroke patients have preclinical coronary artery disease and that there is a clear relationship between cerebral and coronary atherosclerosis, both in terms of location and burden [ [32](#B32-ijerph-20-01690)]. A meta-analysis showed that traumatic brain injury was an independent risk factor for strokes, regardless of the severity or type of trauma [ [33](#B33-ijerph-20-01690)]. A nationwide cohort study found that the head injury group had a significantly higher stroke risk than the control group (adjusted HR 1.65). Moreover, in the head injury group, the cumulative incidences of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were higher than those in the control group (8.9% vs. 5.8% and 2.7% vs. 1.6%, respectively), indicating that a head injury is an independent risk factor for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes [ [34](#B34-ijerph-20-01690)]. Similarly, another study calculated an HR of 2.37 for strokes in the Parkinson's disease group compared with the non-Parkinson's disease group during 3 years of follow-up, indicating that patients with Parkinson's disease have a significantly increased risk of ischemic stroke [ [35](#B35-ijerph-20-01690)]. A meta-analysis of 17 prospective studies involving 206,641 participants showed a significant positive association between depression and the subsequent risk of a stroke after adjusting for potential confounders [ [36](#B36-ijerph-20-01690)]. Additionally, in a systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies including 950,759 patients, researchers observed a 24% increased stroke risk in people with anxiety disorders compared to the general population [ [37](#B37-ijerph-20-01690)]. We found that acupuncture could potentially reduce the incidence of stroke in patients with these underlying comorbidities. Many clinical and experimental studies have been published that show the benefits of acupuncture treatment for treating hypertension [ [38](#B38-ijerph-20-01690), [39](#B39-ijerph-20-01690)], coronary artery disease [ [40](#B40-ijerph-20-01690), [41](#B41-ijerph-20-01690)], [42](#B42-ijerph-20-01690), [43](#B43-ijerph-20-01690)], Parkinson's and [47](#B47-ijerph-20-01690)]. Since the above-mentioned potential comorbidities of migraines increase the risk of strokes, and acupuncture shows an independent benefit for patients with these comorbidities, we can consider acupuncture as a treatment that can reduce the risk of strokes in patients with migraines, perhaps by aiding in the control of any accompanying comorbidities. Moreover, while no existing preventive medication for migraines reduces future strokes, our study found that participants who took more medications for migraines had a lower risk of stroke. This result deserves further clarification and may be related to the fact that patients who took more medication, either because they experienced more pain or because they had less control, were likely to return more often for medical advice and to make more aggressive changes to their diets and lifestyles. The habit of taking care of the body in this way may prevent strokes and other cerebrovascular diseases. Nevertheless, we determined that regardless of the quantity of migraine medication taken, it has a positive effect on stroke prevention when combined with acupuncture. [48](#B48-ijerph-20-01690)]. Another study mentioned that the hypoperfusion of the brain that occurs during a migraine attack can lead to electrical abnormalities that cause a phenomenon called \"spreading depression\", which can lead to strokes [ [49](#B49-ijerph-20-01690)]. Acupuncture treatment has been proven beneficial in the clinical treatment of migraines [ [50](#B50-ijerph-20-01690), [51](#B51-ijerph-20-01690)], and in effectively reducing stroke risks in patients with depression [ [18](#B18-ijerph-20-01690)], and fibromyalgia [ [52](#B52-ijerph-20-01690)]. Since migraines and strokes are heterogeneous cerebrovascular diseases with common mechanisms, it is reasonable to hypothesize that when acupuncture is used to treat patients with migraines, it would be beneficial in reducing the risk of a stroke. [7](#B7-ijerph-20-01690)]. We did not divide patients with migraines into subgroups with and without aura. Therefore, studies including larger datasets are necessary to test whether acupuncture leads to an overestimation of stroke risk reduction due to the selection bias resulting from using it more in migraineurs without aura than in those with aura. (2) In addition to the listed comorbidities associated with migraines affecting the risk of a stroke in this study, some factors deserve special consideration. The lifestyle and behavior patterns of migraine patients are also important factors affecting the risk of a stroke. For example, smoking and oral contraceptive pill use are known major contributors to the high risk of strokes in migraineurs [ [24](#B24-ijerph-20-01690), [53](#B53-ijerph-20-01690)]. However, we did not include these as comorbid factors that could have affected the outcome. The association of these behaviors with seeking acupuncture treatment also remains unclear. The Taiwan Biobank is a large biomedical research database that has collected rich lifestyle factors and genetic variant data from more than 130,000 participants and can be linked with the NHIRD [ [54](#B54-ijerph-20-01690), [55](#B55-ijerph-20-01690)]. Further analysis on this basis is warranted in the future. (3) In Taiwan, acupuncture treatments provided by a small number of traditional Chinese medicine doctors are self-paid and, therefore, not covered by the NHI. If patients sought these services, bias may have been introduced in our data analysis. (4) Clinical indicators are very important for evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture. Unfortunately, since the acupoints are not recorded in the database, it is impossible to analyze the correlation between the choice of acupoints in patients with migraines and the risk of stroke. Although a number of systematic reviews have reported the benefits of acupuncture for migraines, many of the studies were considered to be of low or critically low quality based on the assessment of multiple systematic review (AMSTAR) criteria [ [56](#B56-ijerph-20-01690)]. We believe that rigorous large-scale prospective clinical trials should be conducted in the future. In addition, further animal experiments are needed to elucidate the mechanism through which acupuncture achieves its efficacy. 5.
