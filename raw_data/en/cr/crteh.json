Story King County has contributed $1 million in capital funds to help open a new detox facility that will offer integrated treatment for mental health and substance-use disorder - including opioid addiction - that prioritizes bed space for people who are homeless. The facility located in Seattle's Beacon Hill neighborhood will offer 33 detox beds and 40 intensive inpatient treatment beds. It will welcome residents who are at the city of Seattle's [Navigation Center](https://www.seattle.gov/humanservices/funding-and-reports/funding-opportunities/navigation-center-rfq), a dormitory-style facility for people who are homeless and need treatment for substance-use disorder. \"The partnerships we are creating will save lives and connect more people to the effective treatment they need to once again live a healthy, productive, meaningful life,\" said King County Executive Dow Constantine. \"We are doing more than providing additional beds. We are connecting entire systems so we can better confront challenges in mental health, addiction, and homelessness throughout our region.\" Recovery Place Seattle at Beacon Hill, which will be operated by [Valley Cities Behavioral Health Care](http://www.valleycities.org/), will be the first detox facility in King County to offer treatment for co-concurring disorders. That will make it possible for the staff to better address the underlying cause of the client's behavioral issue, whether it's mental health or addiction. In addition to prioritizing beds for people who are at the Navigation Center, the staff will coordinate with county-funded outreach teams that engage with people who are homeless to connect them to the integrated treatment they need to transition to safe, permanent housing. Offering a wide range of treatment options Beginning in early November, the staff at Recovery Place Seattle at Beacon Hill will provide detoxification, medication-assisted treatment, residential treatment, and recovery services for people who are homeless and people who earn a lower income who also face mental-health crisis, substance-use disorder, and/or opioid addiction. There will be about 100 full- and part-time employees working at the facility next year when it is operating at full capacity, with a total of more than 70 detox and treatment beds. The facility will provide an alternative to hospital emergency rooms for police and first responders in Seattle, Renton, Tukwila, SeaTac, and Kent. The staff will also connect clients to outpatient services to help them succeed once they leave the facility. Valley Cities is a nonprofit community behavioral health organization that has served South King County for more than 50 years.
