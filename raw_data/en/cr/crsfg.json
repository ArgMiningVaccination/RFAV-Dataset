Yes. The vaccine's safety was studied in approximately 3,100 children ages 5-11 who received the vaccine and no serious side eects have been detected in the ongoing study. The FDA has determined that the Pzer vaccine has met the criteria for emergency use authorization based on the scientic evidence available. Is the vaccine eective? Yes. According to the FDA, after receiving the vaccination, the immune responses of children 5-11 years of age were comparable to those of individuals 16-25 years of age. Studies presented to the FDA found the vaccine to be 90.7% eective in preventing COVID-19 infection, and 100% eective in preventing hospitalization from COVID-19. How is the vaccine administered for children ages 5-11? Is the dosage dierent? Do kids receive the same vaccine as adults? The Pzer vaccine is administered as a two-dose primary series, three weeks apart, but is a lower dose (10 micrograms) than what is administered to individuals 12 years of age and older (30 micrograms). The vaccine itself is the same vaccine as adults receive but the dosage for vaccines is based on age, which is dierent from other pediatric medications where dosage is based on a child's size or weight. What are the side eects in children? The most common side eects are injection site pain, fatigue and headache. Other less common side eects are injection site redness and swelling, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and decreased appetite. More children reported side eects after the second dose than after the rst dose. Side eects were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days after vaccination, and most went away within one to two days. By every measure, the potential side eects of the vaccine-as unlikely as they are to occur -are far less risky than contracting the disease itself.How can we be sure the vaccine is safe for kids in the long-term? Vaccines have been well-developed and trusted tools of medicine and public health for generations, and adverse events are reported infrequently for all of the leading childhood vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccine for children is no dierent as the FDA testing process did not reveal any serious adverse events during the trial or for the two months following the vaccination. A benet-risk assessment is an integral part of the vaccine review process to ensure that the risk of the disease is greater than the risk of the vaccine. Given the potential harm of COVID-19, the benet of the vaccine improves a child's overall safety. Should children who will soon turn 12 years old wait to get the higher dosage? No. Kids are encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as they are eligible. If a child is 11 years old at the time of the rst vaccine, then the second dose would be the same as the rst shot. There is no need to wait for them to turn 12 to receive the \"stronger\" dose. Can my child get other immunizations when they get the COVID-19 vaccine? Absolutely. Ensuring that kids are current on all immunizations is key to helping them stay healthy and safe. Kids can receive routine childhood immunizations-including their annual flu shot-at the same time they receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine does not eliminate the need for their annual flu shot. How do I get my child vaccinated? Parents can contact their child's primary care provider or visit MyTurn.ca.gov to schedule an appointment or nd a COVID-19 vaccine clinic, including those held at Valley Children's Hospital. Other resources include your local pharmacy, health clinic or county health department.COVID-19 vaccines are safe and eective in preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death for those 12 years of age and older. The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization of the Pzer-BioNTech vaccine for children 5-11 years of age, extending protection from COVID-19 to approximately 28 million children across the country. Based on safety and ecacy data presented to the FDA and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Valley Children's is in alignment with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendation: everyone 5 years of age or older who is eligible should get vaccinated.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), since the start of the pandemic, approximately 1.9 million children ages 5-11 years have been infected with COVID-19. Federal data also shows more than 8,300 have been hospitalized, and 94 have died-a number that puts COVID-19 in the top 10 causes of death for children 5-11. Most recently, the AAP, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Children's Hospital Association joined together to declare a national emergency in children's mental health due to the toll of the pandemic.
