Some autistic people find it difficult to wear facemasks for a variety of reasons, such as sensory sensitivities, coping with change and difficulty communicating while wearing a mask. To read tips and tricks, find out about mask exemptions and exceptions download this Autism Tasmania information sheet on [Mask Wearing & Social Distancing](https://www.autismtas.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Mask-Wearing-Social-Distancing.pdf). If you can wear a mask, you should. If you can't, don't panic. Even in places where wearing face masks is mandatory, there are exceptions and lawful reasons not to wear one. If a person has a condition where the wearing of a mask is not suitable, they will need to carry a medical certificate that states this fact. This applies to both adults and children over age 12. Note that the certificate does not need to state the condition - only the unsuitability of mask-wearing for the person. Autism Tasmania is working with Tasmanian Public Health officials to develop community education that fosters the understanding that there are highly legitimate reasons why someone might not wear a mask and to be assured that that person is not a risk because they are taking all other precautions.
