The Healing Process Ayurveda and natural healing takes time. Our clients often start feeling better within the first two weeks of starting their protocol, but complete resolution and physical and mental balance come with time. It could take 3 months or a year, depending on the duration of the illness and commitment from the client. Our strategy is to find the root cause and then address it. This kind of healing works by acting on the dhatus (bodily tissues) to ensure their correct and harmonious function. For example, many skin conditions are linked to aama (toxins) in the blood (rakta dhatu). The root cause is aama. To address it we need to purify the blood tissue with a specific protocol to detox (eliminate toxins), strengthen (agni function), and then purify (rakta dhatu). At your first health consultation, we will evaluate the root cause, weak dhatus, and dosha imbalances, along with obtaining a complete medical history and review of symptoms. We'll discuss your lifestyle and diet habits, stress factors, and past traumas. Depending on the complexity of your case, you'll receive an Ayurvedic natural treatment protocol to follow at the same appointment or you'll be asked to come in again a short time later. Once you start the protocol, observe the changes that occur with your physical body, mental activity, mood/emotions, and overall state of being. Some clients find it helpful to keep a diary of these to discuss at their next visit. Follow ups are critical to your success. We encourage you to come in and report on how you're doing and where you need further guidance. At follow up visits, your Practitioner will make adjustments to your protocol where needed. Our goal is to tell you, \"My exam indicates that your doshas are balanced. Your protocol is now complete - enjoy the new YOU!\" We say this over and over again in our clinic as we see our clients heal from all kinds of health issues. The more committed the client is to the treatment protocol, the faster they see positive results. Once your protocol is complete, you'll receive a Maintenance Pack that includes a Rasayana supplement and Tejas Tea for longevity, a free gift from us to keep you motivated and dedicated to your health. If you are committed to your Self, meaning you've made your health the #1 priority in your life, and you have faith in your body's innate intelligence to heal, then you're a prime candidate for Vedic Health and we will support and guide you until you feel vibrant, healthy, and liberated.
