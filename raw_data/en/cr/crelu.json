L. Rev. (2020): Women outlive men, and, as a consequence, comprise the majority of residents in both the home health and nursing home long-term care settings. Their caregivers are also overwhelmingly-women -- 91% of nursing assistants in nursing homes, for example. And those caregivers are largely non-white. Long-term care has long been regarded as \"women's work,\" beginning with its slavery antecedents in the home setting. This article explores the connection between the devaluing of long-term care, which is largely state-funded through Medicaid, and the gender and race dynamics of long-term care.

Gender & L. (2021, Forthcoming): This short essay, prepared for a symposium on menstruation, is an initial effort to catalogue various legal approaches to menopause and to set out areas for further analysis. It argues for consideration of menopause in the movement for menstrual and gender justice. It briefly explores cultural images of menopause and post-menopausal women, including the ubiquitous hot flashes and a sexuality, analyzes potential legal claims based on age, sex, and disability for menopausal justice, and suggests the interrelationship between such approaches and social attitudes towards menopause, menstruation, and gender. It suggests that \"normalizing\" menopause, acknowledging its realities, is one means for removing the associated stigma and disabilities and might result in reinterpreting existing laws and future legal reforms.

Building vaccine record verification (VRV) systems that are robust and ethical will be vital to reopening businesses, educational institutions, and travel. Historically, such systems have been the domain of governments and have relied on paper records, but, now, a variety of non-profit groups, corporations, and academic researchers are developing digital verification systems. These digital vaccine passports include the CommonPass app developed by the World Economic Forum to verify COVID-19 test results and vaccine status, as well as similar systems several major tech companies are actively exploring. VRV systems present both opportunities and risks in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. They offer hope of more accurate verification of vaccine status, but they also run the risk of both exacerbating existing health and economic inequalities and introducing significant security and privacy vulnerabilities. To mitigate those risks, we propose a series of principles that ought to guide the deployment of VRV systems by public health authorities, policymakers, health care providers, and software developers. In particular, we argue that VRV systems ought to align with vaccine prioritization decisions; uphold fairness and equity; and be built on trustworthy technology.

As read by the Federal Circuit, the law unconstitutionally restricts speech, discourages the entry of generic drugs, and helps keep medicine prices high. Under current doctrine, a generic drugmaker is liable for induced infringement if its drug label so much as hints at using a product in a way that is covered by a patent. This is true even when there is no evidence that prescribers read generic drug labels and in cases when only an in-depth inquiry into the language of the label might promote infringement. This doctrine flies in the face of a simple reading of the statute. And by restricting lawful and non-misleading speech for such an attenuated purpose, it also violates the First Amendment. This doctrine, already unlawful, took a yet more radical turn in the Federal Circuit's recent decision in GlaxoSmithKline v. Teva. Under GlaxoSmithKine, a generic drug manufacturer may be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars if it truthfully states that its product is bioequivalent to a brand-name drug. If the decision stands, the law of patent inducement not only threatens to unconstitutionally prolong drug monopolies\u2014it will also undermine a key statutory path to generic competition.

First, this paper critically discusses and compares the criteria used by the EU Commission and the General Court of the European Union (the \"General Court\") to analyse the side-deals that were part of the patent settlements in the Servier case, which is currently pending on appeal. Second, the main points of the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"CJEU\") in the Generics UK et al. are briefly outlined, focusing on the CJEU's analysis of the side-deals that were part of the patent settlements at issue. The core suggestion of this article is that the decision of Servier regarding the Krka settlement will need to be revisited by the CJEU upon appeal, to restore legal certainty regarding the analysis of side-deals as part of pharmaceutical patent settlements.

J. 280 (2020): The United States is the foremost innovator of pharmaceutical therapies in the world. That innovation, however, comes at a price\u2014literally. Americans pay more for their medications than any other country. In a country without universal healthcare, the topics of economics, human rights, and healthcare intersect at the crossroads of pharmaceutical pricing. In contrast to most other countries, the United States has no regulations on pharmaceutical price control. One major argument against government regulation is its inherent opposition to the free market system: the heart of the American economy. Further still is the argument that profit restriction would create a chilling effect on the industry, stifling the pharmaceutical industry's cutting-edge (but expensive) innovations and jeopardizing the United States' leading position in the global pharmaceutical industry. The most basic argument for profit control is to prevent pharmaceutical price monopolization so Americans can afford the care prescribed to them. This Comment summarizes some of the unique issues in the pharmaceutical industry, major arguments for and against profit control, and the current climate in United States' politics and laws regarding this issue for a possible solution. Proposed solutions herein include policy changes to enhance Medicare's ability to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, limiting drug companies' ability to raise prices without confines or explanation, and making reimbursement contingent on drug performance to ensure that new medications provide measurable benefits. This multipronged approach would not only make medications more affordable, but it would also increase the quality of new formularies.

This Article submits that courts should adopt an expansive reading of this program access requirement, imposing an obligation on governments and grantees to offer something of benefit to everyone, no matter the nature of that someone's disability. The text of the federal regulations, relevant caselaw, and persuasive analogies require this reading. Moreover, this energetic interpretation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 regulations resolves some of the thornier problems of current disability discrimination law: limits on reasonable accommodation and the distinction between access and content for legally required accommodations. Applied to the recent case of A.H. ex rel. Holzmueller v.

CHI studies offer a fast and costeffective way of generating new scientific insights, prioritizing investigational products for clinical testing, and reducing the risk that large numbers of people are exposed to ineffective or harmful substances in research or in practice. Yet depending on the pathogen, CHI studies can involve significant risks or burdens for participants, pose risks to individuals or communities not involved in the research, and lead to public controversy. It is therefore essential to ensure that the risks of CHI studies are justified by their social value\u2014that is, their potential to generate benefits for society\u2014and that public trust can be maintained. In this paper, we aim to clarify how research sponsors, research ethics committees and other reviewers should judge the social value of CHI studies. We develop a list of relevant considerations for making social value judgments based on the standard view of social value. We then use this list to discuss the example of potentially conducting dengue virus CHI studies in endemic settings. We argue that dengue virus CHI studies in endemic settings would fall on the higher end of the spectrum of social value, mostly because of their potential to redirect all fields of future dengue research. Drawing on this discussion, we derive several general recommendations for how reviewers should judge the social value of CHI studies.

L. Rev. (2021): This Article focuses on the litigation arising out of contaminated drinking water in Flint, Michigan, lead paint in public housing in New York City, and harms to young people from the impacts of climate change. At the heart of each case is a claim that state officials violated the plaintiffs' substantive due process rights by creating or enhancing an environmental danger and then deliberately failing to mitigate the risk to the plaintiffs. Although the plaintiffs characterize their claims in similar fashion, the three cases are not likely to enjoy the same success as they move through the courts. The scholarly commentary thus far does not offer satisfying answers to why plaintiffs might state a claim against officials for contaminated drinking water but not for an unstable climate. Although these cases involve novel applications of substantive due process doctrine, scholars have yet to examine exactly if and how they depart from other substantive due process cases. To fill this gap in the literature, this Article seeks to situate these cases in existing doctrine. In doing so, it exposes doctrinal confusion regarding which standards and tests apply to state-created danger claims. In addition, to provide courts with necessary guidance, the Article proposes a framework for state-created danger claims, limited by established common law principles and grounded in the important distinction between challenges to official misconduct and challenges to governmental law or policy.

L. (2021): Over the past 50 years, multidistrict litigation (MDL) has quietly revolutionized civil procedure. MDLs include the largest tort cases in U.S. history, but without the authority of the class-action rule, MDL judges\u2014who formally have only pretrial jurisdiction over individual cases\u2014have resorted to extraordinary procedural exceptionalism to settle cases on a national scale. Somehow, until now, this has remained below the surface to everyone but MDL insiders. Thanks to the sprawling MDL over the opioid crisis\u2014and unprecedented opposition to it\u2014MDL is finally in public view. State attorneys general have resisted the opioid MDL's intense nationalism, its relentless drive to global settlement, its wild procedural innovation, its blurring of differences across state law and its dramatic assertions of jurisdictional authority. Opiates is the most extraordinary MDL yet, but most big MDLs share many of its features, and Opiates is already the roadmap for the next mega-cases.

Since that time news on the world's most lethal infectious disease is not good\u2014the 2019 WHO TB report shows 1.2 million people died from TB, a number that has fallen just 11% since 2015, less than one-third of the way towards the End TB Strategy milestone of a 35% reduction (to about 850 million deaths) by 2020. The same number of people, 10.0 million, are estimated to have fallen ill with TB in 2018 as in 2017. The stubborn persistence of TB is attributable to glaring gaps in case detection and treatment. While case detection has increased in recent years, there is still a significant gap between the 7 million new cases reported and the 10 million incident cases estimated in the most recent WHO data\u2014and treatment success continues to hover at only 85%. There has long been a call for a shift toward a \"human rights-based approach\" in TB\u2014building policies and programs explicitly on the norms and values set out in international human rights law, treating people with TB as rights holders in their interaction with the state and the health system, and working to overcome stigma and discrimination. Yet laws in high TB-burden countries (HBCs) have not been reformed to include basic rights protections. This helps explain the lack of progress, as individuals who fear discrimination and coercion may avoid diagnosis and treatment. Thus, TB stands in stark contrast to HIV/AIDS, for which the international community has moved far more decisively to recognize and protect key rights, even as more progress is needed. At the UN, heads of state committed to removing discriminatory laws and policies against people with TB, protecting and promoting their human rights and dignity, as a key part of a strategy to improve the TB response and end the epidemic. Here, we analyze key areas of law with particular importance for TB, focusing on five aspects of compulsory public health powers in law and on laws related to migration. We identify significant gaps between core human rights norms and existing legal environments.

L. 27(2) (2020): In the Novartis Farma SpA case (Case C-29/17), the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) held that the decision of a Member State (Italy) to reimburse a drug used off-label (Avastin), and for that purpose submitted to repacking procedures, is not in violation of European law, even if there is a duly approved therapeutic alternative (Lucentis) on the market and the procedure is solely to reduce health care expenditures. This was not the CJEU's first ruling on off-label drug use. The novelty of the Novartis Farma SpA case is the economic element attached to the assessment of off-label prescriptions, even though the Court failed to consider this essential feature of the case. This paper analyses the Court's ruling in light of two main principles of European pharmaceutical law: the imposition of marketing authorization for drugs used in the European market; and the predominance of public health concerns over economic considerations. The paper concludes that the Court failed to identify a major issue in the Italian policy - the reimbursement of off-label drug used when there is a properly approved therapeutic alternative on the market - at the risk of undermining the entire European pharmaceutical framework and endangering public health.

To promote better planning and preparedness for transition, many transition readiness assessment tools (TRAs) have been developed in recent years. The goal of this study was to identify and review existing TRAs to better understand the current landscape of how such tools are being used and the potential gaps among the currently available tools. There are several key limitations among existing tools. There are also many areas of overlap between tools, as well as clear gaps among the current tools available. For example, limited consideration has been given to emerging challenges for transitioning countries, such as demographic and disease transitions (e.g., aging populations and a shift in the burden of disease from infections to non-communicable diseases). Many critical health interventions, including vaccines and maternal and child health services, are ignored by current TRAs. Donors are the financial and technical \"drivers\" of all the TRAs, and so these tools are not being shaped by transitioning countries themselves. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether or not the TRAs as designed will address the most critical needs of transitioning countries. Additionally, the role that in-country stakeholders are expected to play in the assessment process is not clearly defined and the methodologies of TRAs are not publicly available, thereby potentially limiting their usefulness to users.

Sci. No. 4 (2020): East Nusa Tenggara's culture is deeply-rooted in patriarchy. It is more common for women to engage in the private sphere, rather than the public sphere. However, the women of East Nusa Tenggara have recently defied this expectation. In the 2014 Provincial Legislative Election, six women were elected as legislative members for the 2014-2019 period, reflectinga 100 percent increase in the number of women elected as representatives. This event became an important phenomenon, marking the history of women's representation in the parliament. It also became the basis of two questions. First, how the six women managed to enter politics amidst the strong patriarchy in East Nusa Tenggara. Second, the roles of the six women in formulating policies that are gender-responsive. This study focuses on local regulations relating to maternal and child health, the environment, and labor in order to have a holistic view on gender-responsive policies. This study is qualitative in nature and is centered on case study, while information was gathered through an in-depth interview with each of the six female representatives. Furthermore, the administrators of six political parties, namely were also interviewed. The principal findings of this study show that the election of these women in 2014 are connected to their \"acting for\" substantive representation and the support given by their families.

Rev. (Forthcoming): The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust vaccines in the forefront. Undoubtedly, vaccines are far from a new phenomenon. Over two centuries ago, Edward Jenner was credited with inventing a vaccine to prevent smallpox. Other notable vaccines include Pertussis (1914), Diphtheria (1926), Tetanus (1938) combined at DTP in 1948. The licensing of the polio vaccine in 1955 was cause for celebration. Fast forward to early 2020, the dire necessity for a vaccine to combat COVID-19 became apparent as an unprecedented pandemic infiltrated the United States. To comprehend the issue of the right to refuse a vaccination for COVID-19, the past is examined by the United States Supreme Court decision of Jacobson. This decision impacted the right of an individual to refuse a vaccine versus compulsory vaccination under state police power to protect the public.

Contreras](https://faculty.utah.edu/u0989706-JORGE_L_CONTRERAS/hm/index.hml) (University of Utah), [The Open COVID Pledge: Design, Implementation and Preliminary Assessment of an Intellectual Property Commons](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3780850&dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_public:health:law:policy:ejournal_abstractlink), Utah L. Rev. (Forthcoming): Early during the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of widely-publicized incidents gave rise to concerns that holders of patents and other intellectual property (IP) rights could hinder the development, manufacture and distribution of essential medical devices, protective equipment and biomedical products. The global response to these concerns was swift and included the issuance of compulsory licensing orders by several national governments, as well as the proposal of a technology pool by the World Health Organization (WHO). Alongside these efforts, a group of scientific, engineering and legal experts created a lightweight, open framework under which IP holders could voluntarily pledge not to assert their rights against those responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. This effort - known as the Open COVID Pledge (OCP) - attracted significant participation from some of the world's largest IP holders, with nearly 500,000 patents and patent applications, as well as significant copyrighted material, pledged to date. The OCP has also been adopted as part of the framework of the WHO's COVID Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), a multinational initiative to make particular biomedical innovations more accessible around the world. This article describes the development of the OCP, including the design choices that shaped its legal structure and implementation. It also assesses the adoption of the OCP across market sectors including biopharmaceuticals, diagnostics, medical devices, protective equipment and digital innovations. It finds that while pledges in the biopharmaceutical sector have been infrequent, many other critical technologies in the fight against COVID-19 have been made broadly available to users through this and related pledging mechanisms, creating a favorable environment for open innovation, new market entry and equitable access to technology. As such, the OCP may both help to address the current pandemic and serve as a useful model for IP sharing platforms to address to future public health emergencies.

We study how a public sector (such as a government) designs an R&D contract and offers it to pharmaceutical enterprises. A simply agency-theoretic model is employed to explore the contract whose terms are an upfront grant as a fixed fee and a sales tax credit as an incentive tool. Examining how the values of related parameters affect contract term determinations, we found conditions that increase or decrease the tax credit and fixed fee. Unlike the general arguments from existing studies of incentive contracts, the role of a fixed fee outweighs the role of a tax credit for new vaccine development under pandemics. We also found that risk averseness and an in ated approval likelihood play significant roles in terms of the tax credit and fixed fee, respectively.

Penn. J. L. & Innovation (Forthcoming, 2021): This essay examines the main characteristics and shortcomings of mainstream social media responses to vaccine misinformation and disinformation. Parts I and II contextualize the recent expansion of vaccine information and disinformation in the online environment. Part III provides a survey and taxonomy of ongoing responses to vaccine misinformation adopted by mainstream social media. It further notes the limitations of current self-regulatory modes and illustrates these limitations by presenting a short case study on Facebook\u2014the largest social media vehicle for vaccine-specific misinformation, currently estimated to harbor approximately half of the social media accounts linked to vaccine misinformation. Part IV examines potential ways to improve stringency of ongoing modes of self-regulation of vaccine misinformation, as well as the creation of cooperative monitoring and mutual assistance networks dedicated to addressing issues specific to the field of vaccine misinformation.
