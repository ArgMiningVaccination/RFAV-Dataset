Like, [lavender is good for sleep](https://sleepfoundation.org/bedroom/smell.php) and ... actually, that's where the knowledge ends for most of us. Being the vegan, hemp-loving hippie who grew up near Berkeley that I am, I've been curious for awhile about the little tubes I saw in [natural health and beauty stores](http://wellandgood.com/2014/11/06/the-best-natural-beauty-stores-from-coast-to-coast/), but have never really been sure [which essential oils are worth buying](http://www.instyle.com/news/four-essential-oils-you-need-how-use-them). After all, aromatherapy has been proven by researchers to [aid anxiety and depression](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/expert-answers/aromatherapy/faq-20058566) and improve quality of life \u2014 and all by simply smelling, diffusing, or applying these unaltered, natural oils. Considering a new report released this week by Women's Voices for the Earth found that [ the safety of fragrance chemicals](http://www.womensvoices.org/report-unpacking-the-fragrance-industry/) \u2014 AKA the synthetic fragrances in most perfumes, shampoos, & more \u2014 is not being safe-guarded by any governmental agency globally, we should all probably be a little more concerned about the less-than-natural products we're using. In fact, the report found, many of the chemicals used to make fragrance are also listed as \"chemicals of concern\" by the U.S. National Toxicology Program. Considering the fact that [ what we absorb through our skin is just as potentially dangerous to our systems](https://www.bustle.com/articles/83591-are-tampons-safe-7-reasons-we-should-be-concerned-about-the-ingredients-in-feminine-hygiene-products) as what we eat, we might all do better to [ safely use pure, essential oils](https://www.naha.org/explore-aromatherapy/safety/) instead of synthetic fragrances when we can. So when I found out that Amy Galper, founder of the [ New York Institute of Aromatherapy](http://www.newyorkinstituteofaromatherapy.com/about-amy/), was offering custom aromatherapy consultations, I jumped at the chance to smell my way to better health. As someone who doesn't like synthetic fragrances \u2014 but loves natural scents like pine and almond \u2014 I was excited to see what Galper would make for me. Since her business is centered on [teaching wellness practitioners and businesses about aromatherapy](http://www.newyorkinstituteofaromatherapy.com/calendar-view/?view=calendar&month=November-2015) (classes are open to the public, by the way), I knew she'd have me covered. First, Galper asked me about my concerns, desires, and what I was looking for in an essential oil. Although I'd never thought about it before, I found I had plenty of requests: I wanted an oil that I could put on my face at night to moisturize my skin, but that would also make me calm, relaxed, and sleepy. She nodded and pulled out several vials, and had me smell them in several different combinations. At first, I didn't like any of them \u2014 they smelled too much like soap \u2014 but as we got closer to my \"custom fragrance\" by combining lots of different scents, I started feeling mighty relaxed. When we'd finally found a combo I liked, she revealed to me what was in it: [ Clary Sage](https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/health-benefits-of-clary-sage-essential-oil.html) (for balancing hormones & sedating, also \"great to your muscles [Blood Orange](https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/orange-essential-oil.html) (good for balancing skin; quieting central nervous system because \"whenever we can look at things more positively, it de-stresses us\"); [Ylang Ylang ](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/essential-oils/singles/ylang-ylang-essential-oil)(for the and [Atlas Cedarwood ](http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/atlas-cedarwood-oil.asp)( good for \"grounding\" added the \"carriers\" [Argan & JoJoba oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067MUF2I?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3569-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B0067MUF2I), which help the essential oils absorb more into the skin, while staying relatively dry, and voila \u2014 I had my new face serum. [Argan & JoJoba Oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067MUF2I?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3569-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B0067MUF2I), $10, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067MUF2I?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3569-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B0067MUF2I) I have to say, I've been testing it for the last week, and if nothing else, the ritual of putting it on each night right before bed has had a mighty fine Pavlovian effect. Smelling such relaxing, natural fragrances seems to signal to my body that it's bedtime, and I have indeed been feeling more relaxed before I go to sleep. I'm officially an aromatherapy convert \u2014 and my skin is as soft as ever. Look at me, I feel so pretty and well-rested that I'm even taking duck-faced selfies! In an effort to understand more about nature's yummy-smelling medicines, I decided to look to [AromaWeb, a website](http://aromaweb.com/default.asp) Galper recommended as credible among the sea of hippy-dippy sources out there, in order to learn more about [which essential oils are good for what ailments and desires](http://aromaweb.com/recipes/default.asp).

I haven't tried all of these scents yet, but I can tell you that those I have tried have been pretty comforting, pampering, and powerful. If you (understandably) don't want to have to buy every oil on this list, it seems like there are a few most essential of these essential oils that keep repeating throughout: Lavender, Chamomile, Clary Sage, Peppermint, Citrus Oils, Ylang-Ylang, [Bergamot](http://www.aromaweb.com/essentialoilsaf/bergamot.asp), and [Frankincense](http://aromaweb.com/essentialoilsaf/frankincense.asp) all seem like the main defenders.
