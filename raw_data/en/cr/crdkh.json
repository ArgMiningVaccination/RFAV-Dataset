Due to the nature of practicals classes (e.g., tutorials, labs, etc.), attendance, preparation and active participation are imperative and cannot be made up. Each syllabus will define the course attendance requirements and will stipulate the number of permitted class absences . Students absent more than the permitted number may be subject to a reduced grade or failure of the course. Faculty may take into account the level of participation and habitual tardiness when calculating a course grade. Students are responsible for being aware of, and for meeting, their faculty's attendance expectations, which are detailed in each course syllabus. Students who believe they have a disability that inhibits their attendance and participation in class or clinic are encouraged to contact the Center for Academic Success to discuss potential accommodations. The clinical attendance policy is outlined in the Student Clinic Section of the student handbook. 4.3 Absence Policy Within the context of an adult learning higher education environment, NUN M understands that life events outside of student control happen occasionally. Possible reasons for missed courses include , but are not limited to , minor or major illness of students or their dependents, family emergency, bereavement , religious holiday/obs ervation , and preapproved attendance to academic conferences . In an effort to reduce undue burden on students, supporting documentation is not required as long as the absence does not exceed the attendance threshold set by faculty. Faculty will exercise discretion on absences within the established attendance requirements for their course as outlined in their syllabus. Faculty may require the student to make up missed sessions, establish make -up assignments , and/or expect that the student will independent ly study 26 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 the material that they missed. Faculty decisions on absences can be appealed to the appropriate program dean. Students who are expecting a longer absence (i.e., military deployment, hospitalization) for factors outside of their control should con tact the Center for Academic Success to discuss a Leave of Absence or Withdrawal. 4.4 Examination s and Completion of Assignment s Students are required to complete all examinations and assignments on schedule. An unapproved absence from an examination will generally be granted a grade of zero. Please note that NUNM does not accommodate a student's desire to take final examinations early due to travel arrangements or other reasons that are not outside of reasonable control. Students who miss an examination for reasons outside reasonable control must contact the instructor (ND students contact the course director) in charge of the course within 24 hours. The faculty /course director may approve or deny this request. If they ap prove, students will schedule their missed exam with the Center for Academic Success and follow steps as outlined on Moodle . There may be associated costs with make -up examinations. Students whose applications are denied will not be allowed to take a make -up examination which may result in failure of the course. Students whose missed examination applications are denied may submit an appeal to their program dean (or designee ) along with supporting documentation. The d ean (or designee ) may grant or deny this appeal at their discretion. If the appeal is granted , the student will be required to make up an equivalent examination. This examination will be equivalent in content but may be different in structure and style than the originally scheduled examination. Assignments submitted after the deadline will be graded according to the policy stated on the course syllabus. Students who believe they have a disability that inhibits their ability to complete examinations or assignments should contact the Center for Academic Success to discuss potential accommodations. 4.5 Religious Observance Policy The NUNM community is enriched by individuals of many faiths who have various religious observances, practices and beliefs. The university recognizes that, on some occasions, classes, exams, clinic shifts or other required academic activities may conflict with a student 's religious holiday observance. NUNM will work with the student to develop a reasonabl e accommodat ion. The following guidelines apply to all students who wish to miss or be excused from a clinical or academic requirement for a religious observance or restriction : 1. A student requesting to be exempt from requirements , or who seek s an academic modification , for religious observances must submit a written request to the Center for Academic Success the term prior to the required academic activity that conflicts with the student 's religious observance. The Center for Academic Success will consider whether the requested accommodation would result in an undue hardship for staff, faculty, students or others in the NUNM community. 2. A student who is requesting to be absent from clinic rotations due to a religious holiday observance must follow the clinical excused absence policy in the Student C linic section , 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 27 which includes notifying the faculty member , the associate registrar , and finding a substitute. See the Clinic Attendance and Absence Policies in the Student Clinic section for more information . 3. Requests to reschedule OSCE exams for religious observation purposes must be submitted the term prior to the quarter in which the OSCE is being held, due to the difficult nature of scheduling these exams. 4. Students requesting time off from classes to observe a religious holiday should refer to the corresponding absence policy. Students are encouraged to contact the director of academic success and access or the dean of students if they have any questions about religious holiday observance and these guidelines. Please see the absence policy in this handbook . An absence does not negate the student's responsibility for material or assignments due during the period of absence. 4.7 Weeks 11 and 12 Policy During fall, winter and spring terms, instruction at NUNM is delivered in 12 -week quarters. As outlined in the course syllabi, faculty have the discretion to either hold classes during weeks 1 -10, reserving weeks 11 and 12 for review/testing \u2014OR deliver ne w material during all 12 weeks of the course. If new material is delivered in all 12 weeks of the term, the final exam will be given on the last day of the course . If a class is canceled during the first 10 weeks due to inclement weather, faculty illness, or other acceptable reasons , students should expect that missed material will be presented weeks 11 and 12. As material may need to be delivered during weeks 11 and 12, students are expected to be available for makeup cl asses held during those weeks, even if all of their course syllabi denote week 11 and/or 12 as optional. 4.8 Student Collaboration on Class work A \"take -home exam\" is to be the student's own work exclusively. Sharing of answers is not permitted and could be a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy as outlined in the handbook . A \"homework assignment\" may be a collaborative effort, depending upon guidelines set by the faculty. For laboratory write -ups the faculty member must clearly set the guidelines. In summation, \"exam\" means no collaboration; \"assignment\" means collaboration may be permitted. SECTION 5: GRADING AND PROMOTION 5.1 Grad ing NUNM maintains high standards of scholarship, and recognizes its responsibility to provide each student the best opportunity to complete their program(s) successfully. At the beginning of each course, the instructor is required to define clearly for class members the objectives of the course and the standards and methods by which student achievement will be measured. Students are responsible for checking their grades online in SONIS. Courses that are graded using the \"P/F\" grading system are not included in a student's GPA. For students enrolled in any program (fall 2015 or later) , at the end of each quarter, each student's course performance is reported to the registrar using the following letter grading system. A student's grade -point average will be cal culated using the following chart: 28 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Grade Percentage Points A 90-100 4.0 B 80-89 3.0 C 70-79 2.0 D 60-69 1.0 F 59 or less 0.0 W/WF N/A Not calculated A (SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE): passing B (SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE): passing C (MARGINAL PERFORMANCE): passing D (UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE): not passing for graduate -level courses, passing for undergraduate F (FAILURE): not passing, permanent grade P (PASS): satisfactory performance W (WITHDRAWAL): student withdrew from course WF (WITHDRAWAL, FAILING): student withdrew from course while failing I (INCOMPLETE): course requirements not yet completed, due only to serious illness or bereavement (temporary grade) T (TRANSFER): course re ceived approved transfer credit. Transfer credit does not apply toward overall GPA calculation AU (AUDIT) IP (IN PROGRESS) R (REMEDIATION REQUIRED): marginal performance (temporary grade) - graduate level only RP (REMEDIATED PASS): grade given for a pa ssed medical clinic rotation, but with required skills remediation - graduate level only RC (REMEDIATED C): pass remediation exam - graduate level only For students enrolled in the ND or CCM programs prior to fall 2015 , at the end of each course, each s tudent's performance is reported to the registrar using the following pass/fail grading system: H (HONORS): superior performance; equivalent to \"A,\" not available for all courses P (PASS): satisfactory performance; equivalent to \"B\" or \"C\" FR DIATE): \"C -\" F grade); equivalent to \"F\" I (INCOMPLETE): course requirements not yet completed, due only to serious illness or bereavement (temporary grade) W (WITHDRAWAL): student withdrew from course WF (WITHDRAWAL, FAILING): student withdrew from course while failing 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 29 AU (AUDIT) CMP (COMPLETE): used for courses that are not graded, but attendance is required and a specified nu mber of hours need to be completed, such as preceptor hours T (TRANSFER): course received approved transfer credit. Transfer credit does not apply toward overall GPA calculation NC (NOT COMPLETED): hour requirement or attendance not met IP (IN PROGRESS) 5.2 Grade of \"R/FR\" \u2014 ND/CCM only \"R\" (remediation required) or \"FR\" (fail remediate) is a temporary grade. Students who fail a course may receive an \"R/FR\" grade rather than an \"F\" (fail) , if they meet the criteria , and have the opportunity to take a remediation exam to pass the course. \"R\" grades are converted to either a n \"RC\" (remediated \"C\") if the remediation exam is passed or a \"D/F\" if the remediation exam is failed . \"FR\" grades are converted to either a n \"RP\" (remediated pass) or \"F\". A grade of \"R\" or \"FR\" cannot be converted to a \"P\" or an \"H.\" Grades of R/FR are not eligible for grade appeals. An R/FR grade that has not been remediated by the end of the second week of the following term (for a spring term course by the end of the third week of summer term) will automatically be converted to an \"F.\" 5.3 Grade of \"RC/RP\" \u2014 ND/CCM only Students who pass a remediation exam will earn a permanent grade of \"RC (remediated \"C\") /RP (remediated pass). - ND/CCM only ND: A permanent grade of \"RP\" will be given when an ND student passes a clinical rotation, b ut is required to attend a clinical skills enhancement course to attain an adequate level of clinical proficiency . An \"RP\" grade will also be given if a student receives a passing grade on a clinic rotation but was recommended for remediation more than once. CCM: Grades of \"RP\" are given when a supervisor believes a clinical weakness exists and has not been adequatel y improved upon by the end of the rotation. The CCM student will be required to remediate with either the associate dean of clinical education or the supervisor in order to attain an adequate level of clinical proficiency . 5.4 Grade of \"D/F\" \u2014 Graduate Le vel For graduate -level student s, a letter grade of \"D\" or \"F\" is reconsidered a failing grade. A failing grade in a required course (including clinical rotation s), requires the student to repeat the course/clinic rotation the next time it is offered, usual ly the next year. If it is an elective course that is failed, the student is not required to retake it \u2014however, the student is strongly encouraged to do so as they will remain on probation and/or can trigger an academic suspension if further courses are failed. The student is prohibited from continuing in any courses for which the failed course is a prerequisite. The student will repeat the course at the current per -credit rate. Any naturopathic student failing a clinical rotation will be required to register for and attend skills - building. 30 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 5.5 Grade of \" F\" \u2014 Undergraduate Level When an undergraduate -level student receives a failing grade, the course /rotation must be repeated the next time it is offered, usually the next year. The student is prohibited from continuing in any courses for which the failed course is a prerequisite. The student will repeat the course at the current per -credit rate. 5.6 Grade of \"I\" When a student cannot complete a course in t he term in which it begins, an incomplete (\" I\") grade may be considered. The granting of an \"I\" grade is at the discretion of the faculty member and used in exceptional circumstances. Faculty may cons ider the grade of \"I\" petition when the following criteria have been met: The student has satisfactorily completed a minimum of 80% of the course requirements; and The student is passing the course; and The student is unable to complete the course during the term the course is offered. While these criteria must be met, their fulfillment does not entitle students to an incomplete grade. The instructor of a course has the final decision regarding appropriate awarding of a n \"I\" grade . To request an incomplete grade, the student is responsible for contact ing the faculty of the course (ND students should contact the course director for that block) to discuss the circumstances around why the student is unable to complete the course during the term the course is offered. If approved , the student is responsible for submitting to the Registrar's Office an approved \"Grade of Incomplete Petition \" form, which can be obtained from the Registrar 's Office or the Center for Academic Success. To complete the form, a student must: Meet with the faculty member to complete the form and discuss the remaining course assignments to be submitted to change the grade of \"I\"; and Use the supplemental worksheet attached to the \"Grade of Incomplete Petition\" form to create a timeline for completion of course requirements; and Return the completed petition form to the Registrar 's Office. A grade of incomplete should be completed within the first two weeks of the next term in which the student is enrolled , with an extension of no more than two quarters. Failure to complete the required course work by the timeline on the contract will result in a failing grade. When the student completes the work required to change the \"I\" grade, the faculty member will submit the \"Grade Change \" form to the Registrar 's Office. If a grade of \"I\" extends beyond two (2) quarters due to ongoing c ircumstances, the student may be required to take a leave of absence and will be allowed to co mplete the course material upon return from leave. Students who apply for a leave of absence and have not completed 80% of the coursework will receive a grade of \"W\" for the class, and will need to repeat it upon return from leave. A withdrawal will affect the student 's ability to continue in certain co urse sequences in subsequent quarters. Multiple \"I\" grades in one quarter may result in the inability to petition for incomplete grades the subsequent quarter. A student requesting a grade o f \"I\" in a course that is a pre requisite for a subsequent course may not enroll in the subsequent course until the grade of \"I\" is resolved or complete a petition to deviate (see the Petition to Deviate policy in the student handbook ). Registration may be denied 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 31 for a student 's final professional field experience (e.g. , fieldwork, internship, capstone, etc.) if an \"I\" grade has not been resolved . Incomplete grades are not included when calculating GPA or total credits completed; however, \"I\" grades may affect a student 's satisfactory academic progress. Students requesting \"I\" grades should meet with the Financial Aid Office to examine the effects on their financial aid award. An incomplete will not be awarded when a student is failing a course for the purpose of giving additional time to complete late assignments. Any student who is failing a course after week eight is not eligible to request an \"I .\" Grade of \"I\" - Graduate -Level Clinical R otations A grade of \"I\" will be given to students who are passing a clinical rota tion but have missed up to 2 shifts (8 hours) during an 11 - or 12 -week term. Students must make up any missed shifts by the end of the following term in order to convert an \"I\" grade to a \"P.\" If missed shifts are not made up by the deadline, an \"I\" grade will convert to an \"F.\" See Sections 6 and 7 of the Clinic section of the student handbook for more detail. 5.7 Grade of \"CMP\" This grade (complete) is used for courses that the student is required to attend, but no evaluation is given. Examples of such courses include, but may not be limited to, ND Preceptorships , community education or new student orientation, for which the student is required to complete a certain number of hours. 5.8 Grade of \"IP\" This grade designates a course is in progress; temporary grade. Once the faculty member submits the grades , the \"IP\" grade will be changed to the appropriate rating. 5.9 Grade of \"W\" \"W\" ( withdrawal) is a grade used to indicate that a student has withdrawn from a course. A \"W\" is recorded on a student's transcript but not included in GPA calculation. A \"W\" grade is, however, considered part of the course s attempted calculation as per the satisfactory academic progress policy. 5.10 Remediation \u2014 Graduate Level Only Students who receive an \"R/FR \" are eligible to sit for remediation exams and/or projects . All remediation exams and/or projects must be completed and grade changes submitted to the Registrar's Office by the end of week two (2) of the following term (spring term grades have until week three of summer term). For students who receive an \"R/FR \" grade in spring quarter and have already made verifiable travel plans that interfere with this remediation schedule, they may, with the approval of the programmatic dean, be allowed to complete the remediation by the last week of the summer term. ND Program ND students who earn a 6 7-69% (\"D\" range or \"R/FR\" grade) in lecture courses are eligible to remediate a final e xam. Labs and tutorial courses may offer remediation exams at instructor discretion , based on the course material and the feasibility of offering a remediation exam. An \"R\" grade will be recorded on their transcript until a remediation exam has been taken and a permanent grade is entered into SONIS. In order to have the \"R\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus . 32 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 CCM Programs CCM students who earn a 6 0-69% (\"D\" range) for their final grade may be eligible to remediate a final exam if, in the judgment of the instructor, it is likely that the student could pass the course by successfully taking a remediation exam. An \"R\" or \"FR\" grade will be recorded on their transcript until a remediation exam has been taken and a permanent grade is entered into SONIS. In order to have the \"R\" or \"FR\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus. SGS Programs SGS students who earn a 67-69% ( \"D\" range) for their final grade may be eligible to remediate a final exam if, in the judgment of the instructor , it is likely that the student could pass the course by successfully taking a remediation exam. If a remediation exam is availab le, an \"R\" grade will be recorded on their transcript until a remediation exam has been taken and a permanent grade is entered into SONIS. In order to have the \"R\" grade as an option, faculty must include it in their syllabus. 5.11 Clinic al Remediation Students who require extra support in meeting minimal levels of clinical competency are counseled and referred for additional instruction by their clinical supervisors or the program dean. ND Clinical Skills Enhancement Tutorial Clinical skills enhanceme nt courses are generally scheduled over a six -week period of time; students may be referred to this course at any point during the term. The clinical skills enhancement instructor carefully assesses each student's abilities and works with them directly throughout the duration of the course . At the end of the course , the instructor reassesses the student's abilities and determines if the student should continue with the course . A faculty member may require or recommend a clinical skills enhancement course , even if a student receives a passing grade, if the faculty member feels the student needs additional help to remain on track in their clinical education. When a ND student receives two or more grades of \"Pass with Clinical Skills Enhancement Recommended\" during their academic career, the clinical skills e nhancement course becomes a requirement and the student will be registered for it the next term. ND Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE ) Tutorial An ND student who fails a n OSCE exam twice will be referred to an OSCE Skills Tutorial for three sessions, and a fail ing grade will be recorded on their trans cript. Upon successful completion of the OSCE Tutorial, the student must then register to retake the OSCE exam. Any student who fails a n OSCE exam three times will be placed on academic suspension. CCM Clinical Skills Remediation Clinic al evaluations of CCM student performance are done during week six (6) of the term to provide feedback and identify areas of weakness, including those that must be remediated before the end of term in order for the student to pass the clinic rotation. The clinical supervisor, in collaboration with the CCM associate dean of c linical education and the CCM dean, can assign remediation work, which can include attendance at weekly clinical skills tutorial labs run by a CCM resident. CCM Clinic Entrance Examination All CCM students take a practical point location examination at th e beginning of the winter quarter prior to starting their internship year. Students failing this examination are given the 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 33 opportunity to remediate this exam later in the same term. If the student fails the remediation exam, they must enroll in the Advance d Point Location course in the spring quarter. CCM students also take a written clinic entrance examination during the first half of the spring term prior to becoming an intern. The written examination covers the foundational course material needed to ass ume responsibility for direct patient care. Students who fail this examination are given the opportunity to remediate the exam later in the same term. A remediation fee is applied. Should a student fail the written examination for a second time, their entrance into the clinic is delayed for a term, during which the student will have time to address weak areas. Another written exam will be given toward the end of this term. 5.12 Grade Appeals Students have the right to appeal a failing grade if they perceive that there has been an error in the grading procedure, or if there is a perceived lack of clarity about the faculty member's expectation for passing a course. The appeal must be made within two weeks of receipt of the grade . Grades of \"B\" or bette r cannot be appealed to receive a higher grade or a grade of \"honors. \" A student may request a review of a grade given in an exam or a final grade for a course only in the following manner : A written request by the student, for a review of the grade, must be submitted to the faculty member. This appeal must be within two weeks of the posted grade. The faculty member will advise the student in writing of the decision within seven days of receipt of the request. The student may appeal the faculty member's decision in writing via a \"Grade Appeal \" form. The completed appeal form will be submitted to t he registrar . This appeal must be made within seven days of the faculty member's written notice to the student regarding the decision. The written appeal to the registrar must be accompanied by appropriate written documentation as to why the student feels the grade is in error, and what the outcome was of the discussion and appeal with the faculty member. The registrar will forward the appeal to the Academic Appeal and Review Committee (ARAC) . ARAC will review the documentation , may have a discussion with the faculty member , and issue a recommendation to the program dean. The recommendations from ARAC may include upholding the grade as submitted or requiring the student to remediate an exam. ARAC may not recommend a passing grade to be substituted in place of a failing grade. The program dean will review the recommendations and make a final decision. The student and faculty member will be notified in writing of the final decision. The decision is final and may not be appealed to higher authority. ND OSCE Ex am Appeals ND students who have a non -passing first OSCE exam result may not appeal , since a failing grade is not given until the second exam attempt is unsuccessful . A failed OSCE exam grade appeal must be submitted to the a ssociate dean of clinical education within two (2) weeks of the posted grade , and will be referred to the Program and Student Assessment Committee for review . The c ommittee will notify the student in writing of the decision within 14 days of receipt of the request. 34 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 SECTION 6: ADVI SING, LEAVE OF ABSENCE, WITHDRAWAL 6.1 Academic Advising The Center for Academic Success administers academic advising for all students. Students who are pursuing any track other than the standard published track s must confer with the Center for Academic Success to ensure all requirements are met. Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress are required to meet with the Center for Academic Success . The Center for Academic Success is responsible for advising students on the following: Academic probation (meet with all students on academic probation) Changing tracks (four - to five -year, etc.) Leave of absences or withdrawing from a program or institution Questions regarding concurrent track optio ns Assistance with the g rade appeals process General questions regarding academic progress and success 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 35 6.2 Advising and Support Chart ADVISING and SUPPORT DEPARTMENT CONTACT DESCRIPTION Academic Advising Center for Academic Success Director of academic success and access , academic advisor Program and course information and changes, petitions to deviate from standard curriculum , concurrent track options , excused a bsences , academic contracts , faculty -referred academic concerns, academic probation Academic Support Center for Academic Success Director of academic success and access , academic a dvisor Study skills , learning styles, and strategies resources , including time management and test - taking techniques .

Students taking less than a full academic year off may not be allowed to continue with a full class load due to the sequenc ing of courses and prerequisite s. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track that must be approved by the Center for Academic Success or program dean . The program deans and/or academic advisor can guide students through a new schedule. Students who take a leave of absence or withdraw during the course will earn a grade of \"W .\" If the student wi thdraws with 80% or more completion of the course, the student may be eligible to petition the faculty member for an incomplete grade. See the Incomplete p olicy in the handbook . Students who are on a leave of absence or withdrawn cannot participate in any academic activities, including remediating incomplete grades or exams, and/or participating in clinical rotation shifts, including preceptor rotations . For concurrent students who choose to take a leave from their primary program only and wish to continue the series of courses in their secondary program for the remainder of the academic year, the following conditions apply: There may not be an option of continuing in their secondary degree program at a full - time status , nor adding core (required) courses due to prerequisites and requirements of the program Concurrent students who elect to continue in their secondary degree program while on a leave of absence from their primary program are not eligible for Title IV financial aid. Students may be revi ewed for aid eligibility in the next academic year. The Center for Academic Success must be advised of a student's intention to return to NUNM prior to 30 days of intended return, and before the beginning of the quarter for which the student plans to register. The Center for Academic Success will instruct the student to fill out and submit a \"Returning Student Notification \" form to be approved by the following offices: Registrar, Financial Aid, and Center for Academic Succes s. The form should be returned to the Registrar's Office when it is completed. If a student does not return within one year, the student will be considered administratively withdrawn from NUNM and will be required to submit a new application for admission . The student will need to satisfy admission requirements in effect at the time of reapplication, but may request that the application fee be waived. Students are not allowed to take more than one year (four quarters) of absence from NUNM during their ac ademic career. 6.4 Involuntary Leave of Absence This policy is designed to maintain the health and safety of all campus community members. A student may be restricted from campus or subject to an involuntary leave of absence when, due to a mental, emotion al, physical or psychological health disorder, their continued presence at the university poses a significant risk of substantial harm to themselves or others , or is creating a substantial disruption to the educational environment . A significant risk is based upon an individualized assessment and constitutes a high probability of substantial harm that cannot be mitigated by reasonable means. In most situations where a student 's medical, psychiatric or psychological condition poses a threat to themselves or to others, the student will be highly encouraged by the dean of students (or 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 37 designee) to voluntarily accept a leave of absence (LOA). However, if the student does not take such a voluntary leave, the involuntary leave of absence (ILOA) process may commence. If a student has taken actions that are identified as being a significant risk to the health or safety of oneself or others, or is creating a substantial disruption to the educational environment; the dean of students (or de signee) acting on behalf of NUNM and in consultation with the Crisis Assessment and REsponse Team (CARE Team) , may initiate the ILOA process as set forth below. The significant risks may include, but are not limited to, acute danger/loss of life, inability to independently manage daily tasks, or inability to cooperate with necessary support services, etc. If the decision is made to place the student on an ILOA, the student is prohibited from participating in any academic or non -academic NUNM activities , including remediating incomplete grades or exams, and/or participating in clinical rotation s and preceptor rotations. The student may be subjected to actions including, but not limited to: A temporary ban from campus; Withdrawal from class attendance or ex periential learning (i.e., preceptor rotations, community education, university -sponsored travel, etc.) ; An interim suspension of participat ion in any campus or off -campus NUNM activities; Completion of a mental health, substance abuse, or other necessary evaluation conducted by an appropriate off -campus li censed health provider Students will receive a written description of the details of the ILOA pertaining to them , including the appeal procedures as outlined in the student h andbook. The letter regard ing the ILOA will be placed in the student's file with a copy sent to the program dean(s), director of academic success and access , registrar, director of financial aid, and the provost . The Registrar's Office will notify course instructors of the student' s leave status. A student who wishes to return from an ILOA must provide to the dean of students (or designee) adequate documentation as outlined in the initial letter from the attending physician or mental health professional demonstrating the student's fitness for returning to NUNM . Students taking less than a full academic year off may find, upon their return , that the appropriate course load required to stay on track will not qualify them for full -time financial aid. In such instances, the student may be required to enter a new educational track , which must be approved by the Center for Academic Success . Students who take an ILOA will earn a grade of \"W\" for enrolled courses at the time the leave is instated. If the student has completed at least 80% of the course at the time of the withdrawal, they may be eligible to petition the faculty member for a grad e of \"Incomplete .\" See the Grading policy in the student handbook . 6.5 Withdrawal from School Students may initiate formal withdrawal by meeting with the Center for Academic Success . Students withdrawing from school at any time during the school year mus t complete an exit interview with the Office of Financial Aid and submit a completed \"Leave/Withdrawal\" form to the Registrar's Office . Failure to attend for any quarter is considered a withdrawal, and the student will need to submit a new applica tion and application fee for re admission.

Degree completion within the maximum length of study (defined as 1.5 times the length of the l ongest undergraduate program); and Taking a minimum of 12 credits each term (excluding summer , unless applicable), unless on an approved deviated track . Students are considered not making satisfactory academic progress who : Earn a term GPA of less than 2 .00 and have a cumulative GPA below 2.00, or 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 41 Earn a term GPA of less than 1.50 The Academic Progress Committee meets twice per academic term to determine students' academic progress (refer to the student handbook for academic standing categories ). If a student is not making satisfactory academic progress during a course prior to the end of the term, the faculty member may request the student to access tutoring ; and may share con cerns with the program dean and /or the Center for Academic Success . This ma y include, but is not limited to, classroom attendance, performance on examinations, as well as any other factors that may impact the student's success in the course. Financial aid recipients who fail to make satisfactory academic progress in any term will be subject to the terms and conditions outlined in the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policies in place for that office (see Criteria for Continued Student Eligibility in the student handbook ). These policies are separate from the instit ution's satisfactory academic progress policies.

Stude nts who are permitted to continue their program beyond the one and one -half (1.5) times the length of the longest published enrolled program may be required to follow the university catalog of the year of their extended program. These students are subject to the graduation requirements of their program listed in that catalog and are required to sign an academic contract. Students must enroll in courses per published and/or approved curriculum layouts. A minimum enrollment of one credit is required to main tain student status. Any student who does not enroll in a minimum of one credit each quarter will b e considered withdrawn, must re apply, and will be subject to graduation requirements under the new catalog (this does not apply to standard summer breaks). Students who have met all graduation requirements, except for the capstone/internship, must register each term for one credit of \"Graduation Completion\" until they have completed their requirements (students will not be aid -eligible at this point); with a maximum of two academic terms. Failure to register each term for the graduation completion credit will constitute a withdrawal. 7.3 Academic Standing \u2014 Undergraduate Programs The Registrar's Office monitors student GPAs (both term and cumulative) for academic standing and credit completion at the end of each term (including summer) to determine sufficient progress toward degree completion.

The student should include a personal assessment of their poor performance, an d a plan of action for successful completion of their NUNM degree. 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 51 NUNM may impose the following requirements upon re admission for a student who was academically suspended : 1. Student must m eet with the Center for Academic Success to sign and comply with all conditions of an academic contract ; and 2. Return on academic probation until the student e arns a minimum term GPA of 2.50 and has a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00 . Expelled students are inel igible for reapplication or re admission to NUNM. Completing these steps does not guarantee readmission to NUNM. These are the criteria for consideration for reapplication. Questions regarding this policy may be directed to the director of admissions, the program dean or dean of students. SECTION 8: CHANGE OF TRACK , CHANGE OF DEGREE , AND GRADUATION Students are admitted into program(s) with a corresponding track (curriculum layout). 8.1 Change of Track Students are admitted to a specific program and on a specific track (i.e., four year, five year). Students should contact the Registrar 's Office for a listing of available tracks . Students are required to follow their educational track. Within a track, students are not allowed to drop required courses or take required courses ahead of schedule. After matriculation, students may request to change track s to any of the standard educational tracks by submitting a \"Track Change\" form, approved by the Center for Academic Success, to the Registrar's Office. Once processed by the Registrar's Office, students must follow their new educational track. All track r equests must be completed by week eight of the quarter prior to the quarter in which the change takes effect. Due to the timing of some deviations or track changes, a student may lose their full -time status. Adjustments to individual tracks may be requir ed due to course conflicts. Students who deviate from their approved educational track may be required to take a leave of absence or fall under a new course catalog curriculum. 8.2 Deviation A student may request to deviate from a standard educational t rack for the following reasons: 1. Approved and documented disability accommodation 2. Leave of absence/withdrawal 3. Transfer credits 4. Failure of a required course 5. Adding a second program 6. Scheduling conflicts between required courses (including, but not limited to, a previous deviation, failed courses, being enrolled in multiple programs, etc.) Requested changes may not compromise established curriculum policies or affect minimum or maximum required numbers (i.e., clinical rotations, preceptorships/inter nships, electives). Deviation requests must be accompanied by the appropriate documentation before approval can be given. Students seeking to deviate from their standard educational track are required to meet with the Center for Academic Success to discuss options and approval; if the reason for the request is outside the identified areas, students may appeal to the Petition Review Board. 52 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Future adjustments to individual layouts may be required due to course conflicts created by the original approved curri culum modification(s). Some deviations or curriculum mod ifications may also result in the student not meeting full-time status ; therefore , a Petition to Deviate also requires a signature from the Financial Aid Office, since there is a likelihood of award m odification . Students petitioning curriculum modifications or deviations from policy must submit their requests no later than the end of week two of the term before the request would take effect. Exceptions to this will be made if: A course is cancelled that was previously confirmed by the institution A request is based on information that was not known prior to the deadline (additional documentation may be required) A situation that is deemed an emergency by the director of academic success and access and/or designee Students approved for deviations must maintain institutional and financial aid Satisfactory Academic Progress within their program (s) and the institution (see the catalog for details ). Deviations or modifications to curriculum may also delay advancement in courses, qualification for licensure board exams, OSCE, etc. NUNM is not liable for delays or financial implications. 8.3 Change/Addition of Degree(s) Students who wish to withdraw from one degree program and enroll into another must formally withdraw through the Center for Academic Success . Once the student appl ies through the Office of Admissions, and is admitted, the program dean will approve and inform the student , the Center for Academic Success , and the Registrar's Office regarding potential transfer credit and challenge exam options ; and the Center for Academic Success will develop a new curriculum layout if needed . Students must meet with the Office of Financial Aid, since there is likelihood of award modification to the student. Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress in their original program may not be aid eligible for their new program. Students who wish to add an additional degree (i.e., become a concurrently enrolled student in two degree programs) must formally apply through the Office of Admissions. Once admitted, the student will work with the Center for Academic Success to establish a new curriculum layout . Students must meet with the Office of Financial Aid, since there is likelihood of award modification. Students may pursue no more than two degrees concurrently. Students who matriculate into a second degree program will do so under the catalog corresponding to the year in which the student begins the new degree. See the handbook sections regarding challenge exams and transfer credit petitioning . 8.4 Graduation Requirements Candidates for graduation must complete the following within the same calendar year as the commencement ceremony they participate in : Satisfy all courses in t he degree program curriculum Satisfy clinic requirements , if applicable to the student's degree program Demonstrate competence in all t echnical standards For clinical degree students, d emonstrate satisfactory professionalism for a health professional 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 53 If a transfer student enrolled in a clinical program , at least three years of professional training must be complete d as an enrolled as a student at NUNM If a second professional degree student, complete at least two years of professional training enrolled a s a student at NUNM Satisfy thesis or capstone project if required for degree Satisfy all financial obligations to NUNM A diploma will not be issued to students until all clinical, academic and financial requirements have been met.

DSOM Capstone Project Students are required to complete the three portions of the doctoral capstone project \u2014written report, project presentation, and professional practice vision statement \u2014by the end of the final term of their last year. The Imaginal and Experiential Inquiries I -XIII course s support the choosing of a via ble capstone topic. The Doctoral Capstone Tutorial in the summer of the final year prepares students to write their capstone report. In the Doctoral Capstone Mentorship, the chair of the student's capstone committee guides the completion of their capstone project. Information about the doctoral capstone project, including a timeline of all requirements, is available on the Capstone Moodle course page. MSiMR Master's Thesis Students are required to complete a master's thesis by the middle of the final term of their last year. Information about the master's thesis is available on the Capstone Moodle course page. Undergraduate Capstone Undergraduate s tudents are required to complete a capstone project by the middle of the final term of their last year. Information about the capstone project is available on the Capstone Moodle course page. 8.5 Participation in Commencement Ceremonies NUNM holds a celebratory commencement ceremony once a year at the end of the spring term. Any student who completes , or is projected to complete , their degree requirements in the same calendar year may participate in the commencement ceremony . All students must submit a \"Petition to Graduate\" form by end of fall term prior to the calendar year they anticipate graduating . Participation in a commencement ceremony does not indicate a fulfil lment of all degree requirements resulting in a diploma . A diploma will not be issued to students until all clinical, academic and financial requirements have been met \u2014regardless of participation in a commencement ceremon y. ND students are ineligible to sit for clinical licensure examinations until all required work is completed. MSOM and DSOM students are not eligible for licensure until all required work is completed. All Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements, as noted in the handbook, are in effect for students who are participating in commencement but have not yet completed all requirements for degree completion . Students who do not complete their graduation re quirements by the end of spring term must submit a \"Status Change\" form to extend beyond spring term. Students who fail to complete graduation requirements by the end of the spring term must remain registered for a minimum of one credit to maintain stude nt status. Students who have registered 54 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 and paid for all required courses and electives will need to register each term for a graduation completion course ( one credit) or thesis /capstone completion ( one credit) until they have completed their requirements (students will not be aid -eligible at this point). Students may take one additional year to complete their degree requirements from projected date of graduation. Any student who does not enroll in a minimum of one credit each quarter will be subject to an administrative withdrawal and the reapplication process through the Admissions Office. Any student who is reapplying will be subject to all degree requirements in place at that time if readmission is granted. 8.6 Elective Credits Each program has a mini mum number of elective credits required to graduate. Master and doctoral students may take elective credit from any NUNM graduate -level degree program as long as they meet the prerequisites. Undergraduate students may take any elective course in the underg raduate program s and cross -listed courses in graduate programs as long as they meet the prerequisites. In addition, undergraduate students can take core courses in other undergraduate programs for elective credit (maximum of 18 credits). The number of elec tive credits will vary based on degree program and credits transferred toward the degree. 8.7 Community Education (ND and CCM only) Students may begin accumulating community education hours upon matriculation to NUNM . All activities not sponsored by NUNM must be pre approved by the ND associate dean of clinical education or the CCM community education coordinator , and must have a designated NUNM faculty or staff advisor /supervisor . A tracking form must be signed and filed with the Registrar's Office upon co mpletion of the event. Activities that qualify for community education hours must be designed to enhance the student's ability to present oneself professionally to the public or other professionals outside of their respective fields while increasing the awareness of naturopathic and classical Chinese medicine in the community. Community e ducation opportunities are plentiful and may be of the student's own design , or may be pre planned events such as health fairs, community events and professional association activities where students are educating the public about natural medicine. Projects that educate the NUNM campus community are also appropriate, as long as the skills gained are applicable to becoming a naturopathic physician or a practitioner of Chinese medicine. In addition to public speaking, students may earn community education hours for conducting research and/or producing written materials that increase community awareness of naturopathic and classical Chinese medicine. These events are not to be used as forums in which students practice medicine, give specific medical advice or diagnose disease. Students may earn a maximum of 10 hours of community education per activity (including the combination of time needed for preparation and delivery) , and are encouraged to gain experience and develop skills in as many different types of professional outreach as possible. Twenty -four total hours of community e ducation are required to meet ND and DSOM requirements for graduation. Twelve total hours of community e ducation are required to meet MSO M requirements for graduation. ND/MSOM students are required to complete 12 hours of commu nity education for each program. SECTION 9: FINANCIAL POLICIES AND FEES Refer to the current NUNM catalog for the most updated financial policies and fees. 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 55 SECTION 10: FINANCIAL AID AND CONSUMER INFORMATION Refer to the current NUNM catalog for the most updated financial aid and consumer information. SECTION 11: DRUG -FREE CAMPUS POLICY 11.1 Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act , Drug -Free Workplace Act, and Oregon Health Authority NUNM is committed to prov iding a drug -free environment. Alcohol and/or drug abuse compromises the student's ability to learn and to practice as a health provider and thus is considered unprofessional conduct . In compliance with the Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act, as amended by Public Law 100 -297, and the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, Public Law 103 -382, the federal Drug Free Work place Act of 1988 and the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Administrative Rules 409 -030-0100 , NUNM is legally required and professionally committed to prevent illicit or recreational drug use and the abuse of alcohol by both students and employees. 11.2 Illicit Drug and Alcohol Policy Students are prohibited from unlawfully possessing, using or distributing , or be under the influence of or inebriated by alcohol or drugs, whether prescribed , illicit , or used recreationally , or any other intoxicant on university property or at any university event. The sale or transfer of prescription and look -a-like drugs is also a violation of university policy. Students and employees are also prohibited from consuming alcohol or drugs on campus or at NUNM -sponsored e vents, (except when the event i s authorized by special permit; s ee the Exemption Request for Alcohol at University Events and Receptions policy ) or from being on university -controlled property while under the influence of alcohol or intoxicants . In additio n, students may not attend class or clinic under the effect of alcohol or drugs. Violation of this policy by a student will result in sanctions up to, and including, suspension or expulsion from NUNM and referral for prosecution for violation of local, state and federal laws. If state and federal law differ in establishing which drugs are illegal, NUNM follows federal law in determining whether a substance is illicit. Any s tudent found in violation of this policy may be subject to sanctions as set forth in the Student Conduct Code. 11.3 Drugs /Intoxicant Violation Any student believed to have any detectable amount of alcohol or drugs in their system , whether prescribed , illicit , recreational or any other intoxicant , may be required to undergo a rapid urinary drug screen (RUDS). If the RUDS is found to be positive, the results will be confirmed by a second testing method completed at a DHHS -certified lab. If this testing also shows \"positive,\" the student will be remo ved from class or clinic shift and subject to sanctions as set forth in the Code of Conduct. If the RUDS demonstrates the presence of a prescription drug, a valid prescription for the drug must be provided, and disciplinary measures may be invoked if the student is visibly inebriated or suffering cognitive impairment while on the medication. The university 's initial and foremost response to reported or observed violation is counseling in and conjunction with other disciplinary actions. 56 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 11.4 Alcohol Viol ation Any student whom NUNM has reasonable grounds to believe is intoxicated will be required to undergo a blood alcohol test that will be administered at a facility designated by NUNM . Refusal to take this blood alcohol test can result in immediate suspension from NUNM . If the student is working a clinic shift, having a test that shows any alcohol in the student 's system will result in immediate remov al from the clinic shift and subjec t to sanctions as set forth in the Code of Conduct. 11.5 Legal Consequences There are both state and federal sanctions regarding the possession or distribution of illegal drugs. Oregon has strong laws that allow the seizure and forfeiture of vehicles used to transport illegal drugs by law enforcement agencies. Alcohol is an illegal drug for those under age 21. For drivers under age 18, any detectable amount of alcohol is grounds f or losing an operator's license until age 18. Most \"recreational\" drugs are illegal , and criminal conviction may bar a student from their chosen career path. 11.6 Education and Rehabilitation Students who may be having difficulty with alcohol and/or drugs are encouraged t o seek appropriate counseling. In addition, i n compliance with federal law, NUNM is prepared to educate and inform its students and employees of the health risks associated with the use of various illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol. NUNM is also prepared to refer students to counseling and treatment resources, and to inform students of legal penalties of noncompliance. Students are encouraged to avail themselves of an appropriate counseling, treatment or rehabilitation program. NUNM aims to share concern for those struggling with substance abuse and support their decision to enter counseling or recovery programs. Even so, drug and/or alcohol use and abuse is not tolerated on campus because of the inevitabl e effects on others. Resourc es concerning treatment and rehabilitation programs are available in the Office of Student Life. University officials may consider a student's participation in such a program when applying sanctions for violations of this policy. 11.7 Drug Testing In com pliance with the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Administrative Rules 409 -030- 0100, as of July 1, 2015, all incoming students are required to undergo a drug screen prior to matriculation at NUNM . Students enrolled prior to July 1, 2015, are required to undergo a drug screen prior to any clinical rotations or field -work experience. Incoming students must submit a urine sample at a Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) -certified lab in the 30 days prior to the beginning of their NUNM matriculati on date. Refusal to take the required substance test will result in a revocation of the offer of admission to NUNM . The student will forfeit the enrollment deposit. Students are responsible for paying for the drug screening when they arrive at the lab. Currently enrolled students may be required to undergo a drug screening prior to their first clinical rotation or field work experience. Refusal to take the required substance test may result in an interim suspension from NUNM and a referral to Honor Counci l, and will prohibit the student from participating in clinical rotations or fieldwork at NUNM or any of its affiliates . The 10 -panel urinary drug screen must include t he following eight substances: a mphetamine Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 57 For incoming students, a refusal to take the required substance test may result in a revocation of the offer of admission to NUNM . For current students, a refusal to take the requ ired substance test may result in an interim suspension from NUNM , which prohibits the student fr om participating in courses, clinical rotations, or fieldwork at NUNM or any of its affiliates. Drug Screening Results for Current Students Students who receive a urinary drug screen that is \"dilute -positive ,\" \"dilute -negative ,\" \"positive \" or \"invalid\" in any way, are sent to a Medical Review Officer (MRO), an independent third -party licensed physician who is responsible for receiving and reviewing lab res ults generated by the urinary drug screen process. The MRO will contact only student s with a test result other than a negative screening result. A prescription for any medications that may appear on the 10 -panel urinary drug screen can be submitted to the MRO. NUNM does not accept medical prescriptions for marijuana. Any urinary drug screen result that is \"dilute -positive ,\" \"dilute -negative ,\" \"positive \" any way \u2014is considered void /invalid . The student is responsible to take a subsequent drug test within 30 days of the void /invalid result. The student will be put on interim clinical suspension until a negative drug result is received. Failure to complete a subsequent urinary drug screen within this time period will result in clinical suspe nsion and a referral to Honor Council. Students who have had a void or invalid drug screen may be required to undergo a rapid urinary drug screen (RUDS) at any point during their academic or clinical career, with or without cause . If the RUDS is found to be positive, the results will be confirmed by a second testing method completed at a DHHS -certified lab. If this testing also shows \"positive,\" the student will be removed from class or clinic shift and subject to sanctions as set forth in the Code of Con duct. Refusal to take the required substance test may result in an interim suspension from NUNM and will prohibit the student from participating in classes, clinical rotations, or fieldwork at NUNM or any of its affiliates. Possession of marijuana, in any quantity, on any NUNM property or during classes, clinical rotations, or fieldwork is against NUNM policy and federal law. In addition, failure to comply with federal laws and regu lations on marijuana possession and use on c ampus jeopardizes the university 's continued receipt of federal funds. Thus, NUNM does not accept medical prescriptions for marijuana. Costs Students will be financially responsible for all drug screening fees. For current students, the lab fee for the urinary drug screenings will be added to each student's account. Record Retention The Office of the Chief Medical Officer will maintain a database recording that the student has complied with all clinical entry requirements stipulated in OAR 409 -030-0100. This information can be shared with affiliated hospitals, clinics, and fieldwork sites that request this information to prevent students from having to comply with further drug testing at their facility and to assure affiliated hospitals, clinics, and fi eldwork sites that the student has complied with the policy. Students who wish this information to be released to affiliated hospitals, clinics, and fieldwork sites can s ubmit a Release of Information f orm to the Chief Medical Officer's Office. 58 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 If a stud ent receives a positive result from the confirmatory drug screening , the report will be forwarded to the dean of student s for review and referral to the Honor Council. 11.8 Policy Review NUNM 's Drug and Alcohol Abuse Program will be reviewed biennially to determine its effectiveness. Changes will be made as appropriate. The president will ensure that these disciplinary sanctions are consistently enforced through regular review of managers. 11.9 Exemption Policy for Request for Alcohol at University Events and Receptions NUNM complies with the Drug -Free Work Act of 1988 , the Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989 , and State of Oregon laws. NUNM prohibits the consumption or distribution of alcohol on university properties, whether or not it is an NUNM -sponsored event , and at off -site university sponsored events .

SECTION 12: OTHER STUDENT POLICIES 12.1 Academic Freedom NUNM faculty and students are free to question, discover and test all knowledge appropriate to their discipline as judged by the academic community in general. 12.2 Relationships \u2014 Faculty /Staff and Students Faculty, staff and student interaction is encouraged to help maintain communications throughout the NUNM community. Faculty/staff and student contact is encouraged to provide role models for students; faculty members are expected to be available to students at regular hours for consultation reg arding classroom material. However, t here are situations when dual relationships within the NUNM community may occur, such as when faculty/staff and students have both a professional and social relationship , also known as a dual relationship . A dual relationship occur s when students and faculty/staff engage in two or more of these situations , including teaching, evaluation, advising, mentoring, program administration, or a privileged therapeutic relationship (doctor/patient or counselor/client). The complexity of these dual relationships is challenging and can obscure perceived or actual objectivity, and create a conflict of interest due to inherent power differentials. Therefore , close personal relationships between faculty/staff and students, in the presence of a conflict of interest where the student could be favored or discriminated against at NUNM, either of which would be in violation of the NUNM policy on discrimination, are strongly discouraged. In addition, a breach of confidentiality and prof essional ethics could occur, also resulting in violation of NUNM policies. For these reasons, romantic/sexual relationships between faculty /staff and students are strongly discourage d. Any relationships between faculty/staff and students that result in favoritism or discrimination are strictly prohibited . In the event that a faculty/staff member and a student are contemplating a sexually intimate relationship , the student and employee are required to disclose the potential relationship prior to entering a romantic/sexual relationship to the ir immediate supervisor and H uman Resources (employee) and dean of students (student) . All measures will be taken to ensure that any actual or potential conflict of interest is addressed. C orrective action may includ e employee withdrawal from all supervisory, evaluative or other authoritative relationships with the student , and will remain in effect until the student has completed their training, irrespective of whether the relationship continues or not. 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 61 For faculty, this includes, but is not limited to, withdrawal from any study committee on which they serve with the student, not participating in faculty evaluations of the student, and withdrawal from examination, supervision, class teaching and thesis eva luation of the student. In the case of an administrative staff member, the staff member will also withdraw from any position involving a conflict of interest, such as granting scholarships or supervising work -study positions. Romantic or sexual relations hips that occurred prior to either the faculty/staff member or a student becoming affiliated with NUNM must also be disclosed by the faculty/staff member to their direct supervisor, the program d ean(s), and to Human Resources . In the case of a past relatio nship, the faculty/staff person must still withdraw from all supervisory, evaluative, or other power relationships with the student as above. Students should report romantic or sexual relationships with faculty/staff that occurred prior to matriculation to NUNM to the dean of students . All cases will be managed on an individual basis. 12.3 Student Practice Policy Being a student of medical student carries with it a professional responsibility. To the general community, students are a representative of NUNM and the profession. To maintain high standards for quality, the following policies apply to each student enrolled at NUNM : NUNM defines \"practicing medicine without a license\" as diagnosing, treating , advising and advertising without licensed supervision or licensure. For professions that are regulated by Oregon state licensure (including medicine, acupuncture, massage, etc.): No NUNM student shall practice, advertise to practice, or accept compensation of any type for practicing these professi ons unless the student has obtained the required license in the state of Oregon. For healing modalities that are not licensed in Oregon (iridology, herbalism, homeopathy, etc.): No NUNM student shall practice medicine , advertise to practice, or accept comp ensation of any type for practicing any unlicensed healing or diagnostic modality. Students shall not offer their status as an NUNM student as a qualification to perform healthcare modalities, except within the scope of university -approved programs under t he direct supervision of professionals recognized and appointed as supervisors by NUNM . Students are allowed to practice skills enhancement of techniques learned as part of their curriculum. A violation of the above policies will subject the student to sa nctions set forth in the Student Conduct Code, including suspension from NUNM . 12.4 Students as Patients Policy Students as Patients \u2014ND and Nutrition Programs In the event of down time on a clinic shift, students who are registered on that shift may act as a patient in the following circumstances. The foundational principle is that students at NUNM should not feel pressured or receive inducement to participate a s a simulated or actual patient, and may only \"opt in.\" 1. Scenario 1 - Role Playing a. If the student is portraying a case/condition/presentation that is not their own (i.e., they are role -playing), the case may be taken in a non-private/group setting. b. A stude nt who opts in to participate may change their mind at any time without having to explain themselves. 62 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 c. Even in this situation, there is risk of harm ; for example , if the scenario is similar to a student 's past experiences or triggers past trauma. This risk of harm cannot be anticipated in advance , thus a standard participation consent must be completed prior to commencing. This consent form will stipulate that there are potential harms and that the studen t accepts this risk and may cancel th eir opt-in without cause and without fear of negative consequence. 2. Scenario 2 - Portraying Own Case a. If the student has a medical condition and opts in to having a real visit, they may be added to the clinic schedule ; and must be treated as an actual clinic patient, with all HIPAA, informed consent, and medical documentation policies in place. The doctor -patient relationship must be clear and established, and discussion of the dual roles/power differential this creates (doctor and supervisor) should occur. Students as Patients \u2014CCM A student participating in a clinic rotation may serve as a patient on that rotation on an as -needed basis according to the following parameters: 1. All students must be informed that when a sup ervisor of a shift treats them as a patient on the same shift, the nature of their relationship fundamentally changes in a manner that the student may not anticipate and in ways the student cannot always understand at the time. 2. The student must be reminded of this change in relationship prior to any formal treatment being delivered , and must sign an informed consent in which this information is included. 3. The student may not schedule the visit in advance, but rather during the shift when there is an open sl ot or patient no -show. The student will sign a release of information form stipulating: a. The extent of treatment (e.g. , general/extensive vs . limited/c ondition -specific ) be treated ( if condition -specific) , e.g., back pain c. That the student is aware they are under no obligation to divulge information they are uncomfortable sharing. 4. That the student knows they may elect to end the interview and/or treatment at any time. The visit will be formally scheduled at the clinic front desk and charted in EPIC using the dot phrase for abbreviated visits. The dot phrase includes billing for one unit of acupuncture (97810) and no more. a. Note: a \"point lab,\" in which an instructor demonstrates how to needle one or more points , is not considered a formal tre atment and is not subject to the same stipulations as a formal treatment as described above. 5. A student volunteering to be treated on shift in a formal capacity cannot be seen for a new patient visit. The student's case will be discussed, as long as the ab ove is observed, according to the shift structure, as follows: a. For observation rotation shifts, the case will be discussed by all participants. b. For clinical mentoring rotation shifts, the case will be discussed by all participants. c. For intern shifts, the c ase will be discussed by the treating intern(s) and the supervisor. Students a s Patients \u2014MSiMH Students in the MSiMH program may not serve as patients during MSiMH clinic shifts . 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 63 12.5 Appearance and Dress on Campus NUNM expects its students to present themselves in a manner consistent with their future profession. Students should be neat and clean. Although we want to continue to foster the individuality of each student, it is important to remember that visitors and clin ic patients frequent our halls. Therefore , extreme or immodest dress should be avoided , and shoes must be worn at all times (unless the wearing of shoes conflicts with classroom participation) . All student s who register for a clinic shift must abide by the clinic dress code whenever working in the NUNM Health Centers or community clinics . Closed -toe shoes must be worn in all laboratory /clinical settings. Please , also see the Fragrance -Free Campus p olicy in the student handbook .

If a student uses phrases, graphs, logos, pho tographs or drawings from published material, it must reference the original source or it will be deemed plagiarism. Violation of copyright and/or plagiarism will be subject to disciplinary sanctions as described in the Code of Conduct (refer to the student handbook). 12.13 NUNM Compliance with the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) Peer -to- Peer File Sharing Requirements H.R 4137, the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA), is a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. It in cludes provisions that are designed to reduce the illegal uploading and downloading of copyrighted works through peer -to-peer (P2P) file sharing. These provisions include requirements that: Institutions make an annual disclosure that informs students that the illegal distribution of copyrighted materials may subject them to criminal and civil penalties , and describes the steps that institutions will take to detect and punish illegal distribution of copyrighted materials. Institutions certify to the Secretary of Education that they have developed plans to \"effectively combat\" the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material. Institutions, \"to the extent practicable,\" offer alternatives to illegal file sharing. Institutions identify procedures for periodically reviewing the effectiveness of the plans to combat the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials. Annual Disclosure NUNM uses a variety of methods to inform its community about copyright law: At the beginning of each fall term, the NUNM community receives notification regarding illegal distribution of copyrighted materials. This information is also posted on the university 's website. Plans to \"Effectively Combat\" the Unauthorized Distribution of Copyrighted Material Steps taken by NUNM to combat unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material include, but are not limited to, the following: 66 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 NUNM blocks all commonly known P2P ports at the network's border firewall. NUNM blocks all known P2P in coming and outgoing traffic at the network's border firewall. NUNM will respond promptly to all Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notices of unauthorized copyright use. Plan to Offer Legal Alternatives for Illegal File Sharing There are many legal sources for copyrighted material such as music and movies. EDUCAUSE offers an updated website of legal sources of online content at educause.edu/legalcontent . Review of Effectiveness of Copyright Infringement Deterrence Plan The IT department will monitor DMCA takedown notices to watch for unexpected increases that would require additional measures. Digital Millennium Copyright Ac t, Notice and Takedown Procedures Notice: The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Notice and Takedown Procedure s document the steps to be followed when the IT Compliance Office receives a complaint from a copyright holder or agent of a copyright holder. NUNM 's designated DMCA agent must comply with the proper form of a DMCA notice as described below. According to the DMCA, a claimed infringement notification must be a written communication (email or hard copy letter) to the designated agent of a service provider. When notifying the NUNM DMCA agent of an alleged copyright infringement, the following mus t be provided: A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner, or the person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner; A description of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed; A description of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to allow NUNM to locate the material; Information reasonably sufficient to permit NUNM to contact the claimant , including name, address, telephone number and email address; A statement by the claimant that they have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the claimant is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner If the notice is deemed v alid, the NUNM designated DMCA a gent will proceed with the takedown procedure. 12.14 Human Models for Instruction As part of the education of our students, there are various tim es when genital examinations or other sensitive examinations must be performed. NUNM will hire models for the learning exercises from fees paid by all students. 12.15 Fragrance -Free Campus NUNM requests that students, staff and faculty be aware of fragrances and aromas that can cause allergic reactions for some; this includes but is not limited to cigarette smoke, body odor and essential oils. NUNM requests students, staff and faculty refrain from using fragrance products (i.e., perfume , scented soaps and personal hygiene products, scented fabric softeners) prior to 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 67 arriving or while on campus, at a clinic or at any NUNM event. NUNM also requests that students, faculty and staff refrain from using solvent -based highlighters, as the solve nts used in the markers cause allergic reactions for some individuals and are toxic. 12.16 Marketing and Communications The Marketing and Communications Office is responsible for protecting and promoting the NUNM brand and advancing its reputation as an i nternational leader in natural medicine education, research and patient care. The office oversees marketing and communications brand management for NUNM's markets, a broad cross -section of internal and external constituencies.

Students , faculty and staff are hereby advised that NUNM.edu, and NUNM's official social media accounts may elect to post and reproduce university -related social media content generated in the public domain and found on Instagram, and other social media platforms. 12.17 Immunization and TB Test Compliance As an NUNM healthcare worker, students and residents must comply with NUNM immunization and health screening requirements , which are obligatory by Oregon state law (OAR 409 -030- 0100 to 409 -030-0250). Students and residents must obtain and provide documentation of appropriate immunizations and TB clearance and/or documents of positive serology, as well as a negative 10 panel u rine drug screen prior to matriculation (students) or starting a clinical assignment (residents). See the student handbook for greater detail on NUNM 's drug testing policy. Students and residents must maintain compliance with all applicable immunization a nd health screening requirements throughout their program (s). Individual requirements may vary depending on training location. Students and residents who do not meet the initial immunization and health screening requirements by their scheduled start date w ill not be permitted in the clinical environment until all requirements have been met. Students will have a hold placed on their registration. If it is determined that a student or resident does not meet these requirements at any point in time, i t is the r esponsibility of the c hief medical o fficer, w ith the support of the program dean, to remove the student or resident from clinical service until they have met all immunization and health screening requirements. Immunization Requirements: 1. Complete an \"Immu ne Status \" form prior to matriculation. 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 69 2. Provide documentation of immunity . Incoming students must provide the following documentation of immunity to the relevant vaccine preventable diseases to NUNM prior to student or resident orientation. The deadline for students starting at the beginning of the academic year is Sept . 1. For residents starting later in the academic year, paperwork must be submitted no later than one month before the appointment start date. Evidence of immunization may be demonstrated t hrough the following: A document appropriately signed or officially stamped and dated by a qualified medical professional or an authorized representative of the local health department, which must include the following: a. The month and year of each dose of each vaccine received; or b. Documentation of proof of immunity to the disease via titer; or c. Written documentation by a qualified medical professional indicating the month and year the diagnosis of the disease was confirmed. An official record from the Ore gon ALERT Immunization Information System. 3. Exemptions: Individual student medical exemptions from specific immunizations will be maintained by the office of the chief medical officer as part of the overall record of the student. Documentation for medical exemption requires a written statement of exemption signed by a qualified medical professional. Medical exemption statements must include the following: Student's name Birth date Medical condition that contraindicates vaccine List of vaccines contraindic ated Approximate time until the condition resolves, if applicable Healthcare provider's signature Healthcare provider's contact information , including the phone number Non-medical exemptions from immunizations are not allowed under Oregon state law for students in healthcare profession programs. 4. Specific vaccines required: a. Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) For students and residents born after Dec . 31, 1956, one of the following is required: Documentation of two properly administered immunizations Immune titers for measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella Healthcare provider documented disease history Students and residents born before Jan. 1, 1957, must meet one of the following requirements: Documentation of one dose (each or as MMR) of live measles, mumps and rubella vaccines given after 12 months of age Positive measles and mumps IgG serology Students and residents born before Jan. 1, 1957, with the exception of women who can become pregnant, are considered immune to rubella b. Varicella Students and residents must meet one of the following requirements: Documentation of two doses of live vaccine given after 12 months of age (Recommended interval is 4 -8 weeks between doses) 70 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Varicella titer indicating immunity if the student has previously had the chicken pox c. Hepatitis B Students must meet one of the following requirements: Documentation of the three -dose vaccine series Positive anti -HBs serology d. Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis Documentation of single dose of Tdap vaccine and/or Td booster within the pas t 10 years. T dap vaccine can be administered without concern for the length of time since the most recent Td vaccine. If it has been longer than 10 years since the T dap, a Td or T dap booster is required. e. Vaccines recommended , but not required: Polio: NUNM follows CDC recommendations. The CDC recommends the polio vaccine for healthcare workers treating patients who could have polio , or hav ing close contact with a person who could be infected with the polio virus. Influenza: Currently, Oregon law (ORS 433.407) states that facilities employing healthcare workers must offer the flu vaccine, but may not require employees or students to be immunized unless a state and federal rule requires it. Required Screenings: 1. Tuberculosis Screening Tuberculosis screening must occur at NUNM during orientation , or prior to student or resident matriculation. Screening consists of Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA). The two IGRAs that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are: QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold In -Tube test T-SPOT\u00ae TB test Students testing positive for TB by either of these methods must undergo further testing with a chest X-ray. Students with a current or prior positive chest X-ray are required to provide documentation from their healthcare provider , including the following: TB test result Chest X-ray report Determination by the healthcare provider if results are latent TB infection or active TB disease Treatment, including what treatment entails, when started, when complet ed, etc. Students who have active TB disease will be restricted from school and patient contact until certified free of disease, in accordance with CDC and Multnomah County Health Department policy. 2. 10-Panel Drug Screen In compliance with ORS 409 -030-0100, student s and residents must obtain a valid 10 -panel urine drug screen and receive a negative result within 30 days of matriculation at NUNM. See the drug testing policy in the student handbook. 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 71 TB Test Compliance Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly infectious, serious disease that is prevalent among certain populations in the United States and other countries, and presents a significant risk to healthcare workers exposed to patients who may have contracted TB. Healthcare facilities are required to ensure that employees exposed to at -risk populations are free of TB to prevent transmission of the disease. They are also required to identify employees who may have been exposed to TB prior to being hired. NUNM applies this testing policy to students, employees and volunteers, as the risk of working in a medical setting may be high. Incoming new students, students returning from over one year of leave , and students who have spent more than two weeks traveling to areas of the world where TB is endemic must be tested with the T-SPOT\u00ae TB or Quan tiFERON -TB Gold In-Tube blood test, which is to be completed during new student orientation and before matriculation in classes. The TB Spot and QuantiFERON test s demonstrate the presence of antibodies in the blood to the tuberculosis bacteria, indicating exposure, but not necessarily active disease. If an employee, student or volunteer has a positive blood test, they will be asked to have a chest X-ray to rule out active pulmonary disease in order to protect the university community. Students and volunteers must perform the testing, including the chest X-ray if necessary, at their own expense. If the chest film is negative for active pulmonary disease, the individual will be allowed to remain on campus unless they develop clinical signs of active disease. Individuals with active pulmonary tuberculosis will not be allowed on campus until certifie d free of disease, in accordance with CDC and Multnomah County Health Department policy. The TB Spot and QuantiFERON test s are approved by the CDC as reliable alternative s to the traditional skin testing , and have been adopted by NUNM as its preferred sur veillance method s. NUNM reserves the right to change its policy in light of public health developments. In certain clinical rotations, annual testing may be required due to increased risk. NUNM recommends that anyone who has spent time in high -risk countri es, or extended time with at risk populations, be retested 8 -10 weeks after exposure. A list of both high -risk countries and at -risk populations can be found on the CDC website. 12.18 NUNM Mailbox Policy NUNM will communicate with students through a varie ty of formats. Information sent to students from NUNM via university mailboxes is considered official communication and should be treated as such. To ensure the security of student mail within the NUNM community, all students will be assigned an NUNM mailb ox and code during new student orientation. Students will maintain the same mailbox through their tenure at NUNM . However, students who take a leave of absence will have their mailbox reassigned. No outside solicitation mailings are allowed in student mailboxes. The Registrar's Office maintains the official list of mailbox assignments and combinations. A student who forgets their mailbox combination should contact the Registrar's Office. Students are responsible for checking their mail regularly, and reading and responding to all mail in their mailboxes, including any announcements, correspondence from university offices, and other official university business. All mail (including exams and papers) must include both the student's name and mailbox numbe r. Mail without a student's name or mailbox number may be delayed in delivery, returned to sender, or destroyed. Mail distribution occurs one time daily, Monday through Friday. NUNM mailboxes are for internal mail only. Students should not receive any type of mail from the U .S. Postal Service or 72 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 recei ve vendor products. If a student is receiving vendor products on behalf of a specific office, arrangements are made with that office to receive the products for the student. In addition, stu dents are not allowed into the faculty/staff mailroom unless accompanied by a n NUNM employee. 12.19 Student Health Insurance NUNM does not require students to carry medical health insurance coverage as a part of their enrollment at the university. Students who do not qualify for the Oregon Health Plan are eligible to enroll in the health centers' Compassionate Care Program, which offers discounts based on household income for medical services. 12.20 Insurance for Experiential Learning , Internation al Electives and Global Health Fieldwork Students who travel as a part of their program requirements are required to have a personal medical insurance policy that is in effect prior to the date of departure of their trip. NUNM provides emergency medical ex pense, evacuation and travel assistance coverage for travel courses. In case of emergency, university officials will coordinate a response plan in conjunction with the insurance provider. This coverage is in effect during NUNM -sponsored trips and fieldwork , and when traveling between the city of origin and the trip destination. Coverage is not provided for personal trips taking place in conjunction with NUNM sponsored trips. 12.21 No Smoking Policy NUNM is a smoke -free campus. Smoking is not allowed on an y part of the campus grounds, including the NUNM Health Centers . 12.22 Use of Candidate Status in Student Email Signature or Business Cards Due to regulations of the Oregon Office of Degree Authorization (ODA) and the Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine (OBNM), students are not allowed to claim unearned degrees in Oregon. As a state -approved institution of higher education, NUNM is only allo wed to confer earned degrees, not candidacy. The use of this terminology constitutes a violation and can have effects on the accreditation status of NUNM . Therefore, students are not to use the following \"degree candidate,\" \"ND3,\" \"ND/M SiMR projected graduation date 2015,\" or similar as part of their email signatures, on their resumes and/or business cards. Instead, students are permitted to refer to: The program in which they are enrolled, \"NUNM Naturopathic Medicine Program, Class of 2016 \" The expected graduation class they are on track to meet, \"NUNM College of Classical Chinese Medicine\" A combination of these two things, \"NUNM Master of Science in Integrative Medicine Research, Class of 2015\" Or, students may refer to themselves as a Naturopathic Medical Student (NMS) or Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Student (AOMS) in combination with their class year, such as \"NMS3\" or \"AOMS2 \" Students who fail to comply with the policy will be counseled appropriately. Failure to comply after in itial counseling will result in a referral to the Honor Council. 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 73 12.23 Online Testing Verification Some NUNM courses have exams and quizzes that are administered in an online learning format. For those quizzes and assignments, students may need to compl ete a \"Statement of Authentication\" attesting that they completed their own quiz and/or assignment and follow ed the directions provided by the faculty member. 12.24 Proctored Online Exams There are times when an online course may require a proctored midterm and/or final exam. Faculty can offer no more than two proctored exams per quarter. Dates or date ranges for the proctored exams will be provided by the faculty member on the syllabus , which is posted on Moodle at least two weeks prior to the beginn ing of the term. For on-campus students , pre-arranged time(s) will be arranged by the faculty member when students may take exams in -person /in-class . If the student is unable to attend the exam at the pre - arranged time, the student must arrange for a volu nteer proctor or arrange to take the test with a proctor.

SECTION 13: GENDER DISCRIMINATION AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT POLICY 13.1 Gender Discrimination , Harassment and Title IX NUNM is committed to providing a healthy learning and work environment for its students, staff and faculty. Discrimination, harassment and retaliation are forms of misconduct that fundamentally compromise the integrity of human relationships, affect morale and performance, and threaten an individual's se nse of security and well -being. They may also violate the law. NUNM works to prevent such occurrences and to remediate situations that are found to constitute discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct. All persons who are employed by , or enrolled at NUNM , should be able to work in an environment free from all prohibited forms of harassment and discrimination including (but not necessarily limited to) harassment or discrimination based on gender, race, color, religion, national origin, political ideology, a ge, marital status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran or military status, or any other applicable legally protected category. NUNM is committed to the prohibition of discrimination in the work place, as covered under Title VII of 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 75 the Civil Rights Act of 1964. No NUNM student, faculty, staff, administrator, or board member is exempt from this policy. In addition, NUNM prohibits gender discrimination and harassment as delineated in the Title IX regulations. Title IX law states that \"no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance .\" NUNM has identified the dean of students as the Title IX coordinator. NUNM also has identified two deputy coordinators : the vice president of human resources, and director of security. All deputy coordinators are authorized to take reports of harassment and discrimination. All reports taken are forwarded to the Title IX coordinator who oversees the Title IX investigative process. A full description of the responsibilities of t he Title IX coordinator can be found in Section 1.4 of the NUNM student handbook. NUNM assures it will take steps to prevent reoccurrence of sexual misconduct. The Title IX coordinator is responsible for ensuring that the reporting party (complainant) is aware of resource s such as counseling, advocacy, academic accommodations, and safety planning, if needed. Any reports of sexual misconduct toward, or of , a minor MUST be reported directly to campus safety and security and/or the Portlan d Police Bureau immediately . There are no exceptions to this policy. Harassment or discrimination in violation of this policy by students, faculty, staff, administrators, board members and other employees or non -employees, including vendors and visitors, is specifically prohibited. Any reports of potential violation of this policy will be reviewed, regardless of the status of the reporter (heretofore: \"complainant\") or the alleged harasser (heretofore: \"respondent\"). Retaliation against any individual who in good faith brings a complaint to the attention of the university and/or who participates in investigations regarding such complaints is also expressly prohibited. If a student has been f ound in violation of sexual misconduct and wishes to appeal the sanctions, all sanctions will remain in effect during the appeal process, including removal from campus and classes. If an order of protection or a restraining order is filed with a local law office, the university encourages the defendant to notify the Office of Safety and Security, Office of Student Life and/or Human Resources, regardless if it is against an NUNM community member or not. This allows the university to assist in the enforcemen t of the order within the university property. 76 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 13.2 Discrimination Discrimination is defined as any act , or failure to act , that is based upon an individual or group's actual or perceived status ( gender, race, color, religion, national origin, political ideology, age, marital status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran or military status , pregnancy status, or other protected status) that is sufficiently severe , persistent and pervasive that it limits or denies the ability to participate in , or benefit from , NUNM educational programs or activities. 13.3 Sexual Misconduct Sexual misconduct is defined as any non -consensual sexual contact or act that violates the rights of another. Sexual misconduct typically involves acts that are severe, persistent and pervasive, but also may be a one -time occurrence. Examples of sexual misconduct include non -consensual sexual contact, rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, intimate partner or relationship violence, sexual e xploitation, b ullying , stalking, cyberbullying and sexual harassment. Consent (pure consent) is defined as when a person voluntarily, knowingly, intellectually and clearly gives verbal permission for a sexual transaction on the part of the person who is offering and the person who is taking/receiving in the sexual interaction. Consent may be given and withdrawn at any point during a sexual encounter, but not after these exchanges have already occurred, in cases such as regrettable sex. If consent is grant ed with terms of agreement, and the terms of agreement are not met during the sexual transgression, a violation of consent is warranted. Silence or absence of resistance does not imply consent. Consent cannot be given in circumstances when there is coercio n, force, threat, intimidation, or incapacitation during a sexual activity. 13.4 Sexual Exploitation Sexual exploitation occurs when a person takes non -consensual or abusive sexual advantage of another for the individual's own advantage or benefit, or to benefit or advantage anyone other than the one being exploited (and that behavior does not otherwise constitute another sexual misconduct offense ). Examples of sexual exploitation include, but are not limited to , invasion o f sexual privacy; prostitution of another person ; non-consensual recording or broadcas t of sexual activity; going beyond the boundaries of consent (such as letting someone hide in the closet to watch you having consensual sex); engaging in voyeurism; knowingly ex posing another to an STI or HIV; exposing one's genitals in non -consensual circumstances; inducing a nother to expose their genitals; and sexually based stalking. B ullying and cyber -bullying may also be forms of sexual exploitation. Bully ing is defined as the repeated use of aggressive behavior or threats to intimate, control, or humiliate another individual ; someone who has a perceived or real power over another. 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 77 13.5 Sexual Harassment and Hostile Environment Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that unreasonably interferes with, limits or deprives a person of the ability to benefit from opportunities to learn or to participate in activit ies. Forms of sexual harassment may include quid pro quo (typically based on po wer differentials; e.g., sexual favors for improved grades), hostile work environments and retaliation. Sexual harassment also includes severe and pervasive sexual verbal or visual overtures, including vulgar or crude jokes, comments, innuendo, gestures, pictures, car toons, artic les or pornography. All NUNM students, faculty and staff are responsible for respecting the rights of one another. No NUNM student, faculty, staff, administrator or board member is exempt from this policy. Any student who believes that they are being or m ay be subjected to sexual harassment, discrimination or misconduct in violation of this policy should immediately report it to any one of the following: dean of students, vice president of human resources , director of security , or a program dean. Reports c an also be filed online at : nunm -advocate.symplicity.com/public_report/ . This report can be found on the page footer of the NUNM website . In situations where an NUNM community member suspects that discrimination or harassment may be occurring, even when no one has made an individual complaint, NUNM will investigate the matter, and any findings of discrimination or harassment could result in disciplinary sanctions. To ensure a prompt and effective response to allegations of sexual harassment and sexual violence, complaints will be investigated and conducted in a fair and equitable manner. Although confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, complaints will be handled as disc reetly and privately as practicable. If the university determines that there has been a violation of this policy, appropriate corrective or disciplinary action will be taken for all parties involved, up to and including expulsion. Hostile Environment A hostile environment caused by sexual harassment is assessed using the perspective of a \"reasonable person\" \u2014defined as a person who would act or feel the same as the person claiming the hostile environment , considering all the circumstances. The more severe the conduct that interferes with , or limits , the complainant 's ability to participate or benefit from educational programming, the less need is required to show a repetitive series of events to prove a hostile environment caused by sexual harassment. This is particularly true if there is conduct of a physical nature. Therefore, a single or isolated incident of sexual violence may create a hostile environment. Stalking Stalking is a form of sexual harassment when there is behavior directed toward a specif ic person over time (repetitively and menacing) by a specific individual , which is both unwelcome and would cause a reasonable person to feel fear. 13.6 Reporting and Resources Reporting to the Portland Police is NOT required for any victim of sexual assault, domestic violence or interpersonal violence , with the exception of child or elder abuse. However, reporting to the Portland Police is always an option . 78 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Any repo rts of sexual misconduct toward, or of , a MINOR MUST be reported directly to campus safety and security and/or the Portland Police Bureau immediately. There are no exceptions to this policy. The Portland Police Bureau's non -emergency phone number is: 503.823.0000. Any student who believes that they are being or may be subjected to sexual harassment, discrimination, or misconduct in violation of this policy should immediately report it to any one of the following: dean of students, vice president of human resources, director of security, or a program dean. Reports can also be filed online at nunm -advocate.symplicity.com/public_report/ . This report can also be found on the page footer of the NUNM website : \"Community Equity and Center (for confidential advisor services): 503.552.1780 NUNM Health Centers (for confidential advisor services with a doctor): 503. 552.1555 Dean of Students (Title IX report submitted online ( nunm -advocate.symplicity.com/public_report/ ) should include a summary of the incident ( anonymous reports are accepted ) and resources/ referrals provided to the reporter within 24 hours of interaction to the Title IX coordinator , a deputy coordinator or program dean. Information should not be shar ed with ANY department, faculty or administrator , unless requested by the student or determin ed by the Title IX coordinator . Upon receipt of the report, the Title IX coordinator will determine if there is a campus safety issue and act accordingly, as well as determine next steps of action. Confidentiality Reports are kept private unless risk of safety to student and/or campus community is determined by the Title IX coordinator . Confidential reporting is only available during client/therapist meetings at the Counseling Center and during a patient visit at the NUNM Health Centers . NUNM will take into account the complainant's individual wishes regarding inquiries/investigations to the greatest extent possible. Informed Consent NUNM 's responsibility is to care for and protect NUNM community members from sexual assault and misconduct. Received reports will be summarized and submitted to the Title IX coordinator. The reporting individual will be invited to consider whether or not they would like names to be included in the summary, allowing them to determi ne the level of anonymity within the report summary.

The purpose of the inquiry into the incident is to assess if there is enough information to warrant a further, more comprehensive investigation and to provide immediate remedies and support. Any findings could result in di sciplinary sanctions. NUNM will take remedial actions during the inquiry and investigation, which may include interim suspension, chang ing student course/lab section s, no-contact o rders, etc., pending the results of the investigation. NUNM uses a prepo nderance of evidence or a \"more likely than not\" standard in determining if sexual misconduct has occurred. Complaints will be promptly investigated and conducted i n a fair and equitable manner by trained Title IX investigators . Although confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, reports will be handled as discreetly as practicable. The complainant and respondent (s) participating in an inquiry or investigation may have an advisor or advocate of their choice during the interview process . Advisors ' sole purpose during the investig ation process is supportive in nature. Advisors are not allowed to speak or otherwise participate in the proceeding or participate in the investigation . Title IX Investigators NUNM has selected and specifically trained staff to serve as impartial investigators when a report requires a more comprehensive investigation. The investigators are charged with meet ing with the involved parties (including any witnesses ) to gather informa tion, testimony and evidence; assessing the information and evidence gathered for merit and credibility ; render a decision regarding a ny policy violation; and determine, in conjunction with the dean of students , if any sanctions are applied. Investigator s will provide both parties with detailed and written notice of allegations , and each policy that has been alleged to be violated. The investigators will use the following determination thresholds for making any determinations of sexual misconduct. Stude nts are allowed advocates of their choice to be present during the investigative process. In addition, the university will provide a Title IX campus process advisor so that both parties have equal access to someone who can aid in understanding the univers ity's processes in investigating complaints. Determination Thresholds Whe n assessing if sexual misconduct has occurred, NUNM will use the following three thresholds in its determinations . Sexual misconduct will be considered as occurring if one or more of the following threshold s have been met. The three thresholds are: consent, incapacitation and force. 1. Consent has not been given as defined in the Sexual Misconduct section of the handbook 2. Incapacitation: a. Incapacitation is defined as t he state of a person who is in a diminished capacity and receiving harm. Examples include : 80 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 i. Too drunk or drugged ( examples: Blackout or completely out of it , vomiting, inability to walk ) ii. Lacking the capacity to give reasonable consent due to mental or physical disability iii. Under the age of 18 (s tate of Oregon statute) 3. Force: a. Force , in terms of sexual misconduct , is defined as unlawful affect or control over someone involving violence or threat. Examples of force include: i. Threat: Overtly doing or saying whatever is needed in order to get a person to do what you want them to do when they have stated otherwise. Feeling as if harm will be done if the person doesn't go along with the request. ii. Intimidation: An implied threat iii. Coercion: The pressure to have sex with someone ; an unreasonable application of pressure. Coercion is measured in terms of: 1. Intensity: HOW was the pressure used 2. Frequency: H ow OFTEN was the person asked 3. Duration: How LONG had the person been asking 4. Isolation : Attempting or complete ly separating a person from others. Cred ibility Investigators are charge d with weighing the accuracy and integrity of evidence in determining credibility of evidence gathered, including testimonies of witnesses interviewed. They will evaluate sources, the content of the information presented, an d the plausibility of the evidence in light of all the information gathere d during their investigation. The investigators will assess for consistency, plausibility, reliability, cooperation, reticence , and motivation to lie in determining why someone or something is or is not credi ble. When the source, plausibility of the eviden ce, and the content are all strong, then credibility is strong. In using a preponderance of evidence standard of more likely than not, the credibility of the information and evidence must meet a \"50.1% threshold .\" Information is not considered credible whe n it does not meet the more likely than not standard , and will be disregarded as irrelevant to the investigation. The following things do not add to, nor take away from , the credibility standard of the respondent: Character witnesses Student o r employee popularity on campus Lack of past determinations of misconduct Academic performance The following things do not add to, nor take away from , the credibility standard of the complainant: Clothing choices Appearance Flirting behavior Gender identity Sexual orientation 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 81 Outcome of Investigation If the university determines that there has been a violation of this policy, it will take r easonable, timely and effective corrective action, including steps tailored to the specific situation for all parties involved, up to and including expulsion. Both the accused student(s) and the reporting student will have the opportunity to review all evidence and information in the form of a draft investigation report, used to render a finding (either in writing or oral ly) prior to final determinations being made. At this time, either party will have an opportunity to address the allegations, evidence and information that will be used to make a final determination. After b oth the accused student(s) and the reporting st udent have had an opportunity to review the draft report, the investigators will notify them simultaneously in writing regarding the final investigation outcome (s) via a Findings and Determination Report . The report will be issued at the conclusion of the investigation and will include the following: The fa ctfinding investigation ; The investigation outcome and determinations , including the reasons and rational e in making the determinations based on the evidence presented on each a lleged violation ; The plan to eliminate, remediate and prevent reoccurrence, including sanctioning . The aforementioned plan normally concludes within a 60-calendar -day period . If an investigation process is anticipated to e xceed the normal 60 -calendar -day period , both parties will be notified of the delay, the reasoning, and an anticipated completion date. The accused student(s) and the reporting student have the right to appeal the sanctions of the Findings and Determination Report as described below. 13.8 Appeal Procedure for Sexual Misconduct When the outcome of an investigation results in a violation of the sexual misconduct policy, the sanctions (only) may be eligible for an appeal by the accused student(s ) if there is merit to the appeal request. In addition, the complainant has the same right to appeal as the respondent. Based on the Findings and Determination Report, student (s) found to be in v iolation , of the sexual misconduct policy or the complainant, have three options: 1. If the student accepts the findings and determination, then an appeal is unnecessary. All sanctions outlined in the final determ ination letter will be in place with outlined completion dates. 2. If the student accepts the findings and determinations in part, but disagrees with other parts, the student is entitled to request a formal appeal hearing process to address the contested pieces. Only the contested sanctions of the agreed upon findings and determinations are appealable . 3. If the student rejects the findings and determinations in its entirety, the student is entitled to request a formal appeal hearing process with access to any information that will be sent to the hearing board. Request for Formal Appeal Hearing An accused student who has been found in violation of sexual misconduct , who rejects part or all of the final Findings and Determination Report sanctions , has a right to request a formal appeal hearing process. In addition, the complainant has the right to request a formal appeal hearing process . Appeals are not intended to be full re -hearings of the grievance. In most cases, appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation or record of the original hearing, and pertinent documentation regarding the grounds for appeal. 82 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 The hearing boa rd is composed of the c hair of the Hon or Council and two other trained Title IX investigators. Only sanctions are appealable. The chair of the Honor Council serves as the chair of the appeal hearing board and is gatekeeper of the appeal hearing process. Appeals granted based on new evidence sh ould be remanded to the original investigators for reconsideration. The request for an appeal will be sent to the appeal hearing chair , who will then notify the complainant and investigator(s) who submitted the Findings and Determination Report . Within three business days from the date of the Findings and Determination Report delivery , the appealing party(s) must notify the appeal hearing chair of intention to appeal. The request for an appeal will be sent to the appeal hearing chair, who will then notif y the complainant and investigator(s) who submitted the Findings and Determination Report . The student will then have seven calendar days to complete and submit to the appeal hearing chair a written request for review , including any corroborating evidence to be considered . The request must include the following: 1. Name, address and phone number; 2. Description, date(s) and place(s) of alleged act(s); 3. Date, and by whom, discipline was levied as found in the Findings and Determination Report ; 4. Disciplinary sancti ons assigned , and circumstances under which that the appeal merit s review is based on one or more of the following: A procedural error or omission occurred that significantly impacted the outcome of the investigation (e.g., substantial bias, material devia tion from established procedures , etc.). The sanction s imposed are grossly out of proportion/alignment with the severity of the offense . Information relevant to the decision that was not available to the investigators for consideration during the investigation , including unknown or unavailable information that could substantially impact the original findings or sanctions. A summary of this new evidence and its potential impact should be included in the appeal request. Intentional failure to provide information during the investigation is not grounds for an appeal. 5. Objective of the appeal, i.e. , reduction of the sanction, severity, or change in the case decision ; 6. Signature and date . As part of the review of the appeal request, the appeal hearing cha ir will request a Response Memorandum from the investigators for the appeal request and share it with both parties. The Request Memorandum should address the points brought forth in the appeal request . After receiving the Response Memorandum, t he appeal hearing chair has seven calendar days to determine if the appeal request has merit. The student will r eceive the appeal hearing chair's decision in writing. If it is deemed that the appeal has merit, the ap peal hearing chair will convene a form al appeal hearing . The appeal hearing board will convene and review the information regarding the appeal, including the Findings and Determination Report , the Response Memorandum, and the evidence provided as a part of the appeal for error. The appeal hearing board will use the \"Preponderance of Evidence\" standard and make a final findings and determinations. The hearing board's decisions are final and not subject to appeal. Both the respondent and complainant will receive a simultaneous written notific ation of the decision within five business days of the appeal hearing . 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 83 All outcomes of the formal appeal hearing process are final and may not be appealed. 13.9 No-Contact Orders During the incident review and/or investigation, it may be determined that a no-contact order may be put in place as an immediate remedy for an on -going review. A no -contact o rder prohibits the involved and named parties from having any contact with one an other until the no-contact order has been lifted. Contact includes, but is not limited to : Intentional visual or physical presence of the other person ; Communicat ion with the other person in a ny written form, including hand -written notes, electronic mail or text messages ; Communicat ion with university *, business or government entities with the intent of affecting some right or interest of the other person; Communicat ion with the other person through a third person ; and/or Commit ting a crime against the other person or their property *Exception: Both students may communicate with university staff who \"have a need to know\" about the university no -contact order and other legal documents, such as a restraining/stalking protective order. 13.10 Amnesty Provision In order to encourage proper and timely reporting of sexual assaults, NUNM will not adjudicate or sanction the victim of the alleged assault /harassment for the admitted use of alcohol or drugs in the course of events of the alleg ed interaction, which otherwise may have been found in violation of campus policies , if the person reports being a victim of sexual assault/harassment and reports the incident to one or more of the following administrative staff members: the dean of studen ts; vice president of human resources; director of security; or a program dean. 13.11 Retaliation The university expressly prohibits retaliation , defined as any intentional or adverse action taken against any individual who in good faith brings a complaint to the attention of the university or who participates in any resulting investigation. Any act of retaliation that is directed against a complainant, respondent, witness or participant in the pro cess, by any party, will be treated as a separate and distinct charge. If the university determines that a student has engaged in retaliation, appropriate corrective or disciplinary action will be taken, up to and including expulsion. In addition, the university will not retaliate against anyone who brings forth a Title IX com plaint with the school, or any state or f ederal agency , or for participating in an investigation or proceeding. If any person feels that their rights under the non -discrimination statement may have been potentially violated, they may contact the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) with or without working with NUNM to correct the issue. Information regarding O CR complaints can be found at: www2.ed.gov/ocr/complaintintro.html . 13.12 Prevention Education The university , in cooperation with the Office of Student Life, the Counseling Center and the Office of Safety and Security, conduct s campus safety program ming . This program ming is designed to inform and educate the campus of various ways to avoid, interrupt and address safety issues on campus, including bystander intervention, reporting of violent crimes, and a description of personal safety measures. The campus safety programming addresses issues, prevention of, and training related to domestic violence, se xual assault dating violence and stalking, as required 84 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 by Title IX laws and the Campus SaVE (Sexual Violence Elimination) Act. The educational outcome of the events is an understanding of how to prevent these issues from occurring, how to intervene if you witness an event occurring, and information as to how to reduce and recognize signs of violence. These presentations occur annually and are open to all community members . SECTION 14: STUDENT DISCIPLINARY RECORDS, CODE OF CONDUCT , HONOR CODE , AND ARREST POLICY 14.1 Student Disciplinary Records The Office of Student Life shall maintain records and files of student disciplinary charges, investigations and proceedings in a secured manner.

The faculty member will assign a grad e for the class or assignment , including a ny grade penalty as outlined below if warranted . The faculty member will then submit all documentation for a referral to the Honor Council , including any recommendations and/or grade penalties assigned . The Honor Council cannot assign or change any grade penalties given by the faculty member. 14.7 Grade Penalties Examples Any of the following may be assigned as a grade penalty by a faculty member who determines that a student has engaged in academic dishonesty: No violation found Reduction of a course grade An \"F\" for the assignment or exam Failure of the e ntire course or clinical experience which would result in academic probation Required remediation Other action deemed appropriate by the faculty member Any of the above sanctions with the inability to withdraw from the course 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 89 14.8 Procedures in Determining Code of Conduct Violations Allegation of Misconduct The student conduct process at NUNM is not intended to punish students; rather, it exists to protect the interests of the community and to challenge those whose behavior is not in accordance with our policies. Sanctions are intended to challenge students' moral and ethical decision - making a nd to help them bring their behavior into accord with our community expectations. When a student is unable to conform their behavior to community expectations, the student conduct process may determine that the student should no longer share in the privile ge of participating in this community. Students should be aware that the student conduct process is quite different from criminal and civil court proceedings. Procedures and rights in student conduct procedures are conducted with fairness to all, but do n ot include the same protections of due process afforded by the courts. Due process, as defined within these procedures, assures written notice and a hearing before an objective decision -maker. No student will be found in violation of NUNM policy without information showing that it is more likely than not that a policy violation occurred and any sanctions will be proportionate to the severity of the violation and to the cumulative conduct history of the student. Any student, faculty or staff member of NUNM may present a written allegation to the dean of students if they believe a student has engaged in conduct proscribed by this code. Allegations may not be anonymous unless it is associated with behaviors outlined in Section 13. A student facing an alleged violation of the Code of Conduct or Honor Code is not permitted to withdraw or take a leave of absence from NUNM until all allegations are resolved . If a violation has been found, and if the sanction is suspension or expulsion, the dean of students shall also inform the student of the appeal process , including the period of 10 calendar days to appeal the sanctions to the provost or the provost's designee. Other sanctions may not be appealed. The provost may refer an appeal to the Student Appeals Committee and will include instructions regarding the method and scope of appeal. Suspension and expulsion appeal procedures can be found in the handbook . Procedures 1. The dean of students reviews the incident report and determines if it should be referred to the Honor Council or will be heard administratively . 2. The student will be notified of the allegations and charges and if it been referred the Honor Council or if the student will be meeting with the dean of students . If referred to the Honor Council, the student handbook outlines the proceedings. 3. The dean of students shall investigate the facts underlying the allegation. The investigation shall include contact with the student that allows the student to present a written and/or oral explanation of the facts and circumstances underlying the alleged conduct. 4. All physical evidence, written statements, and notes of oral statements taken in any investigation shall be maintained in the case file rele vant to the matter. 5. If the dean of students does not find probable cause to believe that conduct constituting a violation of this code has occurred, the charge shall be dismissed with a written finding of lack of probable cause. 6. The finding of suspension shall be placed in the case file, with copies delivered to the student, and a notification sent to the complaining party. 90 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Status of Affected Student Pending Proceedings During the investigation related to charges and while pending resolution, a student shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of a student in good standing; except that the dean of students (or designee ) may find that the student's presence at NUNM constitutes an unreasonable threat to the safety, health or welfare of t he NUNM community, and suspend the student from NUNM pending resolution of the charges. An interim suspension from NUNM Health Centers does not permit the student to attend clinic shifts pending resolutions of the charges. Investigation If the dean of st udents finds probable cause to believe that conduct occurred constituting a violation of this code, the dean of students will further investigate the allegation. A determination of responsibility is based on preponderance of evidence that conduct constituting a violation occurred or that it did not occur . The dean of students will provide written findings and conclusions to the accused student . A student who is being interviewed as a part of the investigation may bring an advocate /advisor to the in terview. Advisors sole purpose during the investigative process is supportive in nature. Advisors are not allowed to speak or otherwise participate in the proceeding or participate in the investigation. I f a student needs assistance in identifying an advoc ate, the student may contact the Office of Student Life . As the investigation is not a legal proceeding, attorneys are not allowed to be present for non -sexual violence cases as outlined in the Gender Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy section of the handbook . Setting of Sanctions If the dean of students does find a violation, they shall then investigate all data relevant to the imposition of a sanction, including the data of the incident and disciplinary record of the student. The dean of students shall record and file all the results of the investigation in the manner prescribed by this code. Based upon these investigations, the dean of students may assign any of the sanctions set forth below under \"Permissible Disciplinary Sanctions.\" Filing of Findings Following findings as to a violation or its absence, and the appropriate sanction, if any, the dean of students shall file the findings, with a subsequent explanation, and deliver copies to the student.

Suspension and expulsion appeal proced ures ca n be found in the student handbook . Any sanctions set by the dean of students shall remain in effect during the appeals process. 14.9 Student Honor Code The NUNM community functions according to an honor system which promotes integrity in learning and evaluation. All members of the NUNM community participate by committing to, and agreeing to, uphold the Honor Code. The Honor Code charges all community members to assume responsibility for the privileges and benefits associated with self -regulation. This agreement aims to maintain a high standard of honor in all academic matters, decorum at all times, and the recognition of the Honor Council as the body responsible f or self -regulation. All 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 91 community members are responsible for maintaining optimal conditions for scholarly and clinical endeavors by acting honorably and reporting dishonorable behavior. Honor is an acknowledgement and acceptance that our own personal act ions help to define our community. Participation in the NUNM community requires being honorable and expecting such veracity from fellow students, faculty, staff, clinic staff, administration and board of directors. An honorable community upholds a standard of excellence when individuals are engaged in honesty, responsibility, fairness, respect, integrity and trust. Honesty means being truthful, straightforward and foll owing through with agreements. Responsibility means taking action against wrongdoing even in the face of peer pressure, fear, loyalty or compassion. Fairness evolves from respecting and protecting the fundamental rights, dignity and worth of all people. Respect is accepting that other individuals have the right to hold beliefs, attitudes and opinions that differ from our own. Respect holds and exhibits regard for all members of our community. Integrity is consistency in thought, word and behavior. Integrity is a commitment to function from the highest ethical standards of the community, the profession and ourselves. Trust occurs when members of our community operate from a place of integrity. Trust naturally flows when there is a commitment to honesty, accountabi lity, participation, expression and respect. To live by this Honor Code requires a personal commitment to integrity, authenticity and self - growth. To this end, a primary responsibility of all community members is to encourage honorable behavior from each other, report a known violation, and work toward resolution. As each community member is accountable for these values, we have a common ground upon which to meet and engage one another, to commit to this learning opportunity, and to maintain high standar ds of competence. 14.10 Honor Council The Honor Council is a standing committee composed of faculty, residents, students and staff representatives. A minimum of one faculty member (including residents ), one student representative , and one staff member is considered a quorum for an Honor Council hearing board . Hearing board members will be pulled from the members of the standing committee. The committee meets monthly when necessary to review written complaints and performance reports referred to them from the dean of students that reflect failure of a student to maintain behavioral standards according to the Honor Code and Code of Conduct . Behavior standards include, but are not limi ted to, honesty, respect, interpersonal skills, deportment and demeanor, learning skills, professional behavior , and communication skills. The committee reviews reports that may be submitted by faculty, staff or students. The Honor Council, depending on th e nature and severity of the report, may request the dean of students to conduct a formal Code of Conduct investigation. The committee does not accept anonymous reports. After reviewing all information , the committee will sched ule a meeting with the student t o discuss reported problems. The committee makes recommendations to the dean of students who then makes the final determination and notifies the student, in writing, of the outcome. The dean of students reviews all reports submitted for Honor Council review, and on occasion, may choose to expedite the process and make a determination without submitting the information to the Honor Council for review. If the Honor Council determines that the frequency of r eports, an 92 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 accumulation of non -academic violations, or the seriousness of a report demonstrate a problem , they may recommend a more severe sanctio n such as probation, suspension or expulsion , which may interfere with a student's ability to complete their a cademic program. Thereafter, any reports forwarded to the Honor Council may serve as a basis for the committee to recommend suspension . Meetings of the Honor Council are not legal proceedings. No attorneys may be present at any meeting of the committee. A student may bring a faculty member or a member of the Office of Student Life as an advisor or advocate. Advisors sole purpose during t he investigative process is supportive in nature. Advisors are not allowed to speak or otherwise participate in the proceeding or participate in the investigation . After reviewing a student file, the committee may recommend disciplinary sanctions that include, but are not limited to, any of the following sanctions to the dean of students : The student is found not in violation . No further action is required. A letter of reprimand or warning outlining policy, with a reminder to adhere to the policy or procedure. Referral for required areas of deficiency , and remedial work may be required. This may include, but is not limited to, counseling, tutoring, meeting with an advisor or mentor, repeated course work, or restricted enrollment in certain courses . Restitution Community service or educational programming Disciplinary probation for behavioral reasons. The student does not currently demonstrate the appropria te behaviors, attitudes, skills or knowledge required for the program . A student placed on disci plinary probation for behavioral reasons may be required to perform remedial work , which may alter the ir course of study. In this case , any additional reports forwarded to the committee showing concern may result in suspension from the program. A recommen dation for suspension or expulsion from NUNM The committee may provide any additional recommendation it believes is suitable to address the issue at hand. Reports and letters outlining decisions made by the Honor Council , and/or dean of students , are maintained in the student's files in the program dean's office and the Office of Student Life . Honor Code reports do not affect a student's academic record unless the outcome is suspension or expulsion from NUNM. C opies of reports and letters are main tained in complianc e with NUNM 's Record Retention p olicy, as noted in the student handbook . 14.11 Patient Safety Monitoring Board The purpose of the Patient Safety Monitoring Board (PSMB) is to apply a systematic, objective review process to adverse clinical events, and to provide formative feedback about clinical policies, procedures and educational practices with the goal of improving pati ent care and clinical quality. The PSMB serves as a subcommittee of the Honor Council . Once a student has been referred to the Honor Council for a clinical violation, the PSMB conducts a root cause analysis using the fishbone /cause and effect method to audit NUNM systems . The information is presented to the Honor Council, which deliberates as to whether there was a patient safety issue , as well as makes recommendations for the prevention of future similar problems . 14.12 Honor Council and Student Appeal s Committee Recusal Policy All Honor Council and/or Student Appeal s Committee (collectively, \" committee\") members shall, prior to each hearing, disclose to the committee all actual or potential conflicts of interest 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 93 that may impact any committee members ' ability to provide an impartial determination. A committee member has an actual conflict of inte rest with respect to a hearing whenever: The individual appearing before the committee is a family member or business partner; Committee member was directly impacted, in any manner, by the actions causing the individual to appear before the committee; or A committee member has accepted any gift, entertainment or other favor where such acceptance creates the appearance of influence on the committee member. A committee member has a potential conflict of interest with respect to a hearing whenever an action or association of a committee member may give the appearance of a conflict of interest described above. Students should bring all perceived conflicts of interest to the committee's attention prior to th e commencement of the hearing. If, in its sole discre tion, the committee determines that a committee member's actual or potential conflict of interest prevents the committee member from providing an impartial determination, the committee member will be recused from the hearing and the remaining committee will render a decision. 14.13 Permissible Disciplinary Sanctions One or more of the following sanctions may be imposed upon any student for any single violation of the Code of Conduct or Honor Code. Sanctions may be imposed separately or in conjunction with any other sanction(s).

Restitution Restitution may be sanctioned in cases involving damaged, stolen or misappropriated property (including money). This could include situations such as failure to return a reserved space in proper condition. This is not a fee/fine but, rather, a repayment for labor costs and/or value of property destroyed, damaged, consumed or stolen.

In appropriate cases, additional conditions of probation may be imposed when the circumstances of the student's misconduct do not warrant suspension. A probationary period will be delineated. If a student is found to violate the Code of Conduct or Honor Council while on probation, the student may face suspension or expulsion. 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 95 Clinic al Probation Clinical probationary status allows a student a 30 -day opportunity to correct behaviors that have been identified as being problematic. If, after 30 days, the student has demonstrated improvement, the dean of students, program dean or chief medical officer may elect to remove the student from clinic probatio n. If, after the initial 30 -day probationary period, the student has not demonstrated improvement, the dean of students, program dean , or chief medical officer may elect to either extend the student's probation for an additional 30 days or to suspend the s tudent from clinic.

Expelled students are ineligible for reapplication or re admission to NUNM . 100 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Students who have been suspended cann ot submit an application for re admission to NUNM for a minimum of one calendar year from time of suspension , unless noted differently in the suspension letter. A suspended student who wishes to apply for re admission to NUNM must meet one of the following criteria at the time of dismissal : 1. The student had a serious illness or medical issue. 2. An event or series of events occurred that prohibited the student's academic performance due to high levels of stress. Examples would include a death in the family, divorce or separation from a long -term partner, assault. 3. Documentation of a disability that can be, but has not been previously or reasonably accommodated. 4. The student experienced any other serious problem that significantly affected academic performance. Documentation may be required to prove that the situation leading to suspension has been remedied. NUNM may impose the following requirements upon re admission for a student who was non-academically suspended du e to conduct violations : 1. Complete remedial work prior to readmission, typically outlined in the letter of suspension. 2. The need to repeating some courses and/or clinic shifts. 3. Meet with the Center for Academic Success to review curriculum layouts. The student may also be required to sign and comply with all conditions of an academic contract. 4. Submit and pass an additional drug screening and/or background check. A student who was suspended due to conduct violations will return on disciplinary probation upon re admission for the remainder of the student's NUNM career . Students who have withdrawn, either administratively or voluntarily, from NUNM must wait one application cycle to apply for re admission. Withdrawn students are required to follow the application process as outlined by the Admission's Office.

The student will remain on academic probation until all previously failed courses have been resolved. 4. Submit and pass an additional drug screening and/or background check. Completing these steps does not guarantee readmission to NUNM . These are the criteria for consideration for reapplication. Questions regarding this policy may be directed to the director of admissions, the program dean or dean of studen ts. 14.16 Arrest Policy The intent of this policy is to ensure the safety of patients and other members of the university . Violations of local, state, and/or federal law are subject to university action. A student who has pleaded guilty to, or otherwise accepted responsibility for, a violation should be aware that the university may also sanction the student. Regardless of a plea , the dean of s tudents must be notified within 72 hours if a student is arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense other than a minor traffic violation. Once notified, the dean of s tudents will schedule an appointment with the student to discuss the incide nt. 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 101 Following the inquiry, the dean of s tudents may ref er the student to the Honor Council, with possibl e sanctions as outlined in the student h andbook. If a student is unable to meet the 72 -hour deadline, the student may be placed on an involuntary leave of absence p ending a conversation with the dean of s tudents. A student may be suspended immediately, pending a conduct hearing, when an arrest involves an act of violence, the illegal sale, manufacture or delivery of drugs, or when the continued presence of the student on -campus poses a threat to the safety o r the rights, welfare, or property of another. If found in violation, a student will be subjected to disciplinary sanct ions as outlined i n the student h andbook, up to and including expulsion. If a matriculating student has been charged with a criminal offense between the time they submitted an application and the time they arrive at school, the student must in form the Admissions Office and dean of s tudents prior to arrival. If the university later discovers that a student has withheld disclosure of a criminal charge, they may be subject to immediate suspension. If a student is convicted of an offense and allowed to remain enrolled at NUNM , the student will be required to meet with the dean of students , chief medical officer, and program dean(s) to discuss possible ramifications for clinical rotation and licensure requirements. 14.17 Retaliation The university expressly prohibits retaliation, defined as any intentional or adverse action taken against any individual who in good faith brings a complaint to the attention of the university or who participates in any resulting investigation. Any act of ret aliation that is directed against a person filing a complaint, the accused person, witness or participant in the process, by any party, will be treated as a separate and distinct charge. If the university determines that a student has engaged in retaliatio n, appropriate corrective or disciplinary action will be taken, up to and including expulsion. In addition, the university will not retaliate against anyone who brings forth a complaint with the school, or any state or federal agency, or for participating in a n investigation or proceeding. SECTION 15: STUDENT COMPLAINT AND RESOLUTION POLICY Preamble Students at NUNM have the right to an education free from prejudices, bigotry or other egregious actions or behaviors that hinder their ability to learn. NUNM is committed to effectively resolving student grievances through an efficient, fair and systematic process. This process is to be used when a student feels that decisions, differences, misunderstandings or problems that have arisen with fac ulty, staff, administration or other students have hindered their ability to learn or otherwise adversely affected them. NUNM seeks to cultivate an academic environment that encourages tolerant, respectful and non -discriminatory behavior from all of its in habitants. The purpose of NUNM's Complaint and Resolution Policy is to resolve student grievances in a manner that allows for constructive relationships to be maintained across the institution, while ensuring that any violation of school policy and/or issues of harassment or discrimination are appropriately addressed and do not reoccur. The policy is designed to create an environment that responds promptly and with sensitivity to the needs of the accuser, respects the rights of the accused, and addresse s the concerns of the community. All grievance records are private in nature and will be treated with the utmost discretion. 102 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 15.1 Informal Process NUNM values opportunities to exercise conflict resolution and self -advocacy skills , and recognizes both as fo undational skills of professionalism. For this reason, any student with a NUNM -related problem involving academic or administrat ive policy, procedure, decision or conduct should make an attempt in good faith to resolve the problem through one or more discu ssions with the person or persons most directly involved. Any safety concerns should be brought to the attention of the dean of students, director of the office of equity and inclusion, or director of security. The student with the complaint may choose to enlist the assistance of another member of the campus community (e.g., a member of the faculty, student life , or a fellow student) to help support them through the process. If the problem cannot be resolved in this most direct way, the student should then seek the assistance of the administrator most directly involved (faculty member, dean , or other supervisor). If the complaint is still not resolved to the satisfaction of the student after discussion at these informal levels, the student may proceed to the formal grievance procedure. 15.2 Grievances The NUNM Stude nt Complaint and Resolution p olicy provides a means by which a student may seek an equitable and orderly resolution regarding a complaint against an employee, while the employee was acting in an official capacity (e.g., faculty member, administrator, staff member, or another student). An unresolved complaint is raised to the level of a formal grievance when the student submits a written Student Grievance (see the Formal Grievance Process in the handbook for details). A grievance is an educational matter, personal issue or condition that a student believes to be unfair, inequitable, and/or a hindrance to their education. A grievance may be filed for an alleged violation of campus policy or procedu re that adversely impacts the student. In order for a grievance to be formally considered, actions against the student must have occurred in relati on to an NUNM policy, procedure or established practice that were arbitrary, capricious, unequitable, bigot ed, malicious or otherwise professionally inappropriate in natu re. Due to the difficulty of pursuing details after many days or weeks have passed, students are encouraged to bring grievances forward as soon as possible. All grievances begin by consulting w ith the dean of students, director of the office of equity and inclusion, or an appointed administrative substitute if neither of those two people are available (appointments are made by the dean of students) . Students should allow up to 10 business days t o receive a response in writing or in person to their complain t or grievance. All proceedings conducted under this policy are closed. The student may bring a support person (not an attorney, as this is not a legal proceeding) to any proceeding if so desire d, but such person is not permitted to participate in any part of the discussions. Exemptions from this policy : The following matters are not handled as student grievances within the scope of this policy, but may be directed for attention as follows: Grade appeals. Students may not file a grievance for a grade appeal, except when the student believes that the faculty has displayed unethical, illegal or improper conduct within the context of a grade given. For more on grade appeal processes , see the Grade Appeal Policy of the student handbook. Incidences of gender discrimination or (sexual) harassment. Sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, or any complaint concerning gender discrimination are governed under the Gender Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct P olicy in the student handbook. Mistreatment or discrimination based on race color or national origin. These complaints are governed under t he Office of Equity and Inclusion and should be directed there. 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 103 If a student is unsure of next steps for any grievance that falls under these exemptions, they may consult with the dean of students or director of the office of equity and inclusion for guidance. Retaliation: No student will be penalized in any way for attempting to resolve problems in good faith through this procedure. By initiating and pursuing a grievance resolution, a student is obligated to proceed in candor and good faith at all times. Retaliation for attempting to resolve a conflict in a respectfu l manner is strictly forbidden at NUNM and is subject to severe sanctions. 15.3 Formal Grievance Process If, and only if , the student has made a good faith effort to resolve the matter in question and is dissatisfied with the outcome of the Informal Con flict Resolution process, the student may file a formal written grievance with the Office of Student Life. Grievances regarding the dean of students may be filed with the provost. Written grievances can be sent via email or in person, or through the online community reporting form to the dean of students and should include as much detail as possible, any existing evidence, and an outline of the desired outcome to bring satisfactory resolution. The dean of students (or appointed designee) will consider the written account and determine whether the alleged incident is able to be grieved based on information and documentation provided by the student. A grievance meets the appropriate threshold for a formal grievance procedure under the following examples: Inappropriate or unprofessional handling of a written NUNM policy, procedu re or established practice Actions taken that are arbitrary, bigoted, capricious, malicious or other wise egregiously unprofessional Treatment or consideration based on class or catego ry rather than individual merit; partiality or prejudice founded in gender identity , age, religion, sexual orienta tion, body shape, or disability If it is determined that the allegation meets the above standards, the dean of students will investigate the a llegation or assign the grievance to the appropriate university official for resolution. The dean of students (or appointed administrative substitute) will advise the student of the decision in writing within five business days as to whether the issu e will be investigated further. The investigation process will include interviewing the student and respondent, and other fact - finding actions as deemed appropriate. The designated official will report the outcome to the student no later than ten business days following the notice of investigation, not including weekends or established holidays, based on assessment of the information provided after receiving the grievance. In the unforeseen event the dean (or appointed administrative substitute) needs additional time to review the evidence, the dean (or appointed administrative substitute) will notify the student in writing of the deadline extension. After the investigation has concluded and a decision rendered in writing, all materials will be immediately return ed to the dean of students to be placed in the appropriate fi les. Student conduct files are kept under strict confidentiality and only shared on a need to know basis. 104 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 15.4 Grievance Outcome Appeal Process In most instances the decision of the designated official is final; however, under certain circumstances a grievance may be appealed to the provost in writing. Within three business days from the decision date rendered by the dean of students (or appointed administrative substitute) the student must notify the provost (or designated administrative substitute) of intention to appeal. The student will then have seven calendar days to complete and submit to the provost (or appointed administrative substitute) a written request for review. The provost (or appointed administrative substitute) will respond with a final decision within ten business days, not including weekends and published holidays that the university is closed, based on assessment of the informat ion provided by the dean of students and the investigation of procedure. An appeal to the provost must be based on the following grounds, either individually or in combination: Additional information relevant to the grievance is now available for consideration that was not initially available to be considered by the designated official; The investigation was not conducted in accordance with this procedure; Implementation of the remedy proposed by the designated official would be illegal or constitute a violation of written NUNM policy, pro cedure or established practice The provost (or appointed administrative substitute) may elect to uphold the decision of the dean of students ( or appointed administrative substitute) ; reverse the decision ; or request a different resolution in light of new information that was previously not available to, or considered by, the dean of students (or appointed administrative substitute).

National University of Natural Medicine is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universi ties (NWCCU) . Accreditation of an institution of higher education by the NWCCU indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality evaluated through a peer review process. An accredited university or university is one wh ich has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the NWCCU is not partial , but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. Inquiries regarding an institution's accredited status by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities should be directed to the administrat ive staff of the institution.

Housed within the Office of Student Life is the dean of students, director of counseling services, mental health counselor(s ), campus events and activities coordinator , and the student life administrative coordinator . The director of academic success and access and Center for Academic Success report to the dean of students. The Office of Student Life assists students with day -to-day questions providing direction to internal and external resources, which may impact overall student success on a practic al, academic, or personal level . Students are encouraged to drop by this office with any concerns or needs they might have regarding their educational goals. 16.2 New Student Orientation New Student Orientation is a required course that provides students with the opportunity to become oriented and familiar with the campus and their peers ; meet with essential faculty, staff and administ rators ; and learn the rights, responsibilities and expectations of being a student at NUNM . Any student who is enrolling in NUNM half time or greater is required to attend New Student Orientation prior to the first term of enrollment. At that time, stude nts will be assessed the New Student Orientation fee, which is charged to their student account. Attending New Student Orientation is a requirement for graduation from NUNM . A student who matriculates into an additional program during their academic career is exempt from participating in a second New Student Orientation course. Students who complete New Student Orientation will receive a grade of \"CMP\" for completion. Failure to attend all of New Student Orientation will result in a grade of \"NC\" and the student will be required to retake the course the next time it is offered. Students who miss New Student Orientation will not be refunded the fee. Students readmitted to NUNM must make an appointment with the Office of Student Life to determine if re orien tation is required. Non-degree seeking students are not required to attend New Student Orientation, however, they are required to familiarize themselves with NUNM policies and should contact the Office of Student Life with questions. 16.3 Emergency Contact Information Students are required to provide an update d emergency contact in SONIS . This information can be updated by using the \"Change of Address\" form found on the Registrar's page of the NUNM website. In the event of an emergency, family and fr iends may leave messages with the Office of Student Life at 503.552.1601. Every attempt will be made to locate a student in the classroom. If that attempt fails, a message will be left in the student's mailbox. 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 107 16.4 Identification and Key Cards Identific ation Cards To register, students must have an NUNM identification card with picture. This can be obtained during new student orientation and during hours posted for producing IDs by the Security Office. This card can be used to receive student discounts at movies, museums, etc. ID cards are used to create library accounts, which allow students to access library resources. ID cards must be presented at the clinic for services. There is a $10 replacement charge for lost ID cards and does not include t he replacement charge for Tri Met passes . Key Cards Key ca rds will be issued to all applicable students and placed in the students' mailboxes at the beginning of the term in which access to a restricted area is required. Currently, the only restricted area requiring key card access is the EPIC computer lab. A one -time $10 refundable fee will be added to the student's account for that term. In order to further promote sustainability, students will be asked to return their key cards when they are no longer needed. For example, when a student graduates, takes a leave of absence, withdraws, or is no longer enrolled in a course that requires access to the EPIC computer lab. The student will then be refunded the $10 fee and the key card recycled. 16.5 Disability and Accommodation Services NUNM and the Center for Academic Success are committed to following Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) as amended in 2008 (ADAAA), and other applicable federal and state regulations and university policies which prohib it discrimination on the basis of a disability. Under these laws students with a documented disability have a right to receive reasonable accommodations. Students also have responsibilities under these laws. Students are responsible for turning in reques ts for accommodations within an appropriate time frame, submitting adequate documentation from a qualified medical practitioner, as well as meeting and maintaining NUNM satisfactory academic progress and technical standards. Students seeking an accommoda tion must schedule an appointment with the director of academic success and access and complete the \"Disability and Academic Accommodation \" form available online . An accommodation request must be supported by adequate documentation. Adequate documentation must: Be from a qualified professional , where diagnosis of the disability is within their scope of practice and licensure Include a brief history of the student's disability, a description and evidence of impairment and any current treatment plans if appli cable Demonstrate how the disability affects/impacts a particular delivery system, instructional method, or evaluation criteria Identify requested accommodation(s) and provide rationale for the requested accommodation(s), clearly explaining why each recomm endation for accommodation is appropriate Be no older than five years prior to enrollment at NUNM The Center for Academic Success will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the request in a timely manner but cannot guarantee that an untimely request can be met; untimely requests may result in delay, substitutions or denial of accommodation. 108 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Upon approval of accommodations, t he Center for Academic Success will provide the student an official accommodation letter with which the student will share with necessary parties (i.e., faculty, security, facilities, program deans, etc.). Information about the disability is confidential however anonymity is not guaranteed. 16.6 Service Animal Policy In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), service animals are permitted in campus facilities for persons with a physical disability (including but not limited to psychiatric, cognitive, mental, communication, physical and sensory disabilities ). The disability must limit one or more daily life activities and the pers on must be regarded by a health care practitioner as having such a disability that requires the use of a service animal. The ADA recognizes only dogs ( no weight, size or breed limitations ) as service animals. The service animal must be housebroken, on a leash or harness , and individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individua l with a disability . The service the animal is providing must be directly related to the person's disability (i.e., retrieve medicine, offer stability, alert to seizures, etc.) . Dogs that meet this definition are considered service animals under the ADA re gardless of whether they have been licensed or certified by a state or local government. Dogs whose sole purpose or function is to offer comfort and/or emotional support do not qualify as service animals. Under law, NUNM and its members are not allowed t o ask an individual about the nature/extent of the ir disability; require documentation proving that the animal is an assistance animal, or; require that the individual pay any fee for the assistance animal. However, to ascertain if the animal presented on campus is a servic e animal, the university may ask: Is the animal required due to a disability? The nature of the work/task that the animal is trained to do/perform. Care and Maintenance of Service Animals The student handler of a service animal must be in full control of the service animal at all times , including but not limited to basic obedience commands and control of leash/harness. The care and supervision of a service animal is solely the responsibility of its s tudent handler and cannot be handed over to another person . Care and maintenance includes but is not limited to : Ensuring the animal is housebroke and all/any of the animal's waste elimination is done in appropriate areas ; Always carrying equipment sufficient to clean up the animal's waste whenever the animal and handler are on university property; and Be responsible fo r the proper disposal of the animal's waste and for any damage caused by the waste or its removal.

SECT ION I: OVERVIEW OF THE NUNM TEACHING PROGRAMS 1.1 Fulfillment of Mission The mission of the NUNM academic medical clinics is to provide quality health care to the public and quality clinical education to medical students and residents. The mission and the clinical training objectives of both the ND and CCM programs are fundamentally aligned with NUNM 's overall mission: \" to educate and train physicians, p ractitioners and pre -professionals in the art , science and research of natural medicine .\" In addition to the school's global mission, the College of Classical Chinese Medicine has the specific mission of \" transmitting the art, science and spirit of Chinese medicine to cultivate clinical practitioners rooted in the ancient tradition of the medical scholar. \" ND Program The university provides training that allows graduating students to become well -versed in the underlying principles and philosophy of naturopathic medicine as it applies to supporting the healing process. This training allows students to obtain skills necessary to be ab le to perform as competent entry -level primary care physicians with sole responsibility for patient care as demonstrated through proficiency in demanding clinical and academic programs. Students are given the opportunity to master entry -level knowledge in differential diagnosis, laboratory and diagnostic imaging interpretation, preventive medicine, botanical medicine, homeopathy, clinical nutrition, physical medicine, musculoskeletal therapies, hydrotherapy, minor surgery, lifestyle counseling , and the use of pharmaceutical medications. Graduating students are given the opportunity to become well prepared for the national licensing exams. CCM Programs In accordance with the CCM mission, students receive lineage -based training that emphasizes transmission a nd mentoring as major methods for promoting personal and professional cultivation. They have the opportunity to become well-versed in the principles , philosophy , and practice of classical Chinese medicine . Graduates will have demonstrated proficiency of knowledge and skills in Chinese diagnostic techniques, acupuncture, herbal medicine ( DSOM and MSOM only), Asian massage, qigong, Chinese dietetics and lifestyle counseling. Students also receive instruction in biomedical pathophysiology and recognizing clinical red flags. Graduating students have been trained to assume sole responsibility for patient care , and are given the opportunity to become well -prepared for the national licensing exams , as well as collaborate with other medical provide rs. 1.2 Clinical Faculty NUNM Health Centers host both adjunct and full -time faculty members. Each has completed a rigorous application and hiring process, and has been selected based on their clinical acumen measured by their level of expe rience, patient care, expertise and passion for natural medicine, as well as their c ommitment to NUNM 's patients, students and education. The practitioners in the CCM program have also been recruited and selected on the basis of their commitment to training students in t he art, science and spirit of classical Chinese medicine. 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 127 1.3 Student Participation in Clinical Training Attendance at, or participation in , clinical training is permitted only for those students who are in good standing at NUNM . Any student who is suspended or expelled from NUNM is not permitted to attend clinical training sessions or have contact with NUNM 's clinical patients. Any student for whom clinical privileges are suspended is also excluded from attending clinical traini ng sessions or having contact with NUNM 's clinical patients. 1.4 Stages of Clinical Training \u2014 ND Program Students assume the role of patient care provider gradually as they progress through well -defined stages with increasing levels of responsibility. Clinical Observation - year one Clinical observations provide students with observational learning experiences under the mentorship of licensed physicians in practice. During this first -year series, students are assigned to NUNM clinic shifts where they will observe the application of routine clinic policies and procedures, communication between doctor s and student s and between students and patients, diagnosis and treatment discussions , application of therapeutic modalities, and referral management. Hydrotherapy/Massage T echnician - year two In the second year, students are assigned to the role of hydrotherapy/ massage technician . At this stage of clinical training, students administer hydrotherapy and massage to clinic patients. This stage provides students with their first hands -on experience treating members of the patient population at our academic medical clinics , and provide s an important introduction to certain aspects of responsibility for patient care . Students continue in this role while a vigorous academic schedule prepares them for the next formal stage of clinical training, that of the secondary. Secondary - year thr ee Students become secondaries at the beginning of their third year after passing their OSCE 1 exam. A secondary functions as an integral member of a patient's treatment team, formed when the attending doctor, and the primary and secondary students join the patient in the healing process. The secondary's main responsibility is to observe and learn about all aspects of patient care, under the direction and supervision of the physician and in cooperation with the primary, who leads the student team. Secondary duties include, but are not limited to, scrubbin g charts for health maintenance; reviewing medications, allergies and problem lists with the patient ; enrolling the patient in MyChart ; assisting the primary intern during patient visits ; contributin g to discussions regarding patient assessment and management; and taking vital signs. Primary - year four The final formal stage of clinical training begins after the third year when the student assumes the role of primary, after passing the OSCE 2 exam. With a fourth -year course load focused on clinical readiness , students are able to devote much of their time to providing naturopathic medical care to patients in the NUNM Health Centers . Primary duties include taking a patient history ; performing an appr opriate physical examination and diagnostic evaluation ; developing differential diagnoses and a working diagnosis ; and composing an individualized treatment and management plan that includes appropriate preventive recommendations and anticipatory guidance (in conjunction with the clinical supervisor and secondary). Students receive expert guidance from a diverse group of skilled naturopathic physicians during their primary rotations . Although patient care is coordinated and organized by the primary, the att ending physician oversees each case. As fourth year progresses, students are expected to develop greater clinical skills, to act with more confidence and, in keeping with the clinic's mission, begin to assum e a 128 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 role of responsibility with regard to the del ivery of naturopathic health care. At no time does the primary act independently without formal authorization from a supervising licensed naturopathic physician. Community Experience Preceptorships (ComEx) - all years ComEx preceptorship rotations afford students the opportunity to follow healthcare providers in practice, providing students with additional exposure to naturopathic medicine, conventional medicine and allied health fields in the surrounding community. Students meeting ComEx program requirements are eligible to begin their preceptorships the summer after their first year. Requirements for the ComEx component of clinical education are reviewed annually. Entrance Into and Advancement through Clinical Training In order for ND students to advance through clinical training, they must meet the following requirements: A.

The OSCE 1 examination (clinic entrance examination) is taken and passed no more than six months before the student may be allowed to begin secondary rotations . The OSCE 2 examination (primary status examination) must be passed no more than three months before a student is allowed to begin primary rotations , and successful completion of the OSCE 3 exa mination (exit examination) is required to graduate from the program. A student is eligible to take the OSCE 3 exam after successful completion of eight primary clinic rotations if they matriculated prior to fall 2015, or after successful completion of six primary clinic rotations if they matr iculated in fall 2015 or after. 1.5 Stages of Clinical Training \u2014 DSOM and MSOM Programs The goal of CCM clinical training is for students to transform into competent practitioners through the following components of the clinical program. The timing described below assumes that the student is on the four -year track. Clinical Observation starts in the third year of the five - year track. Introduction to Clinic - year one In the spring quarter of their first year, student s are intro duce d to the fundamentals of working in the CCM clinics. Topics include HIPAA compliance, clinic policies and procedures, hygienic standards including Clean Needle Technique , charting protocols , patient confidentiality and multicultural awareness. Students learn how to create a patient timeline as preparation for writing patient case reports. Observation - year two In clinical o bservation five s tudents per rotation learn as they watch seasone d faculty supervisors treat clinic patients. Over the course of the year, students become more familiar with clinic policies and procedures , practice the diagnostic skills learned in the first year of the program, and relate their classroom learning to the clinical situation. Through their observation of patient - practitioner interactions and their involvement in discussions regarding patient diagnosis and treatment, students build their clinical knowledge, skills and attitudes, and become familiar with the different styles and interests of the clinic faculty. At the discretion of the faculty supervisor, students may participate in the delivery of certain aspects of patient treatment, including moxibustion, massage, cupping and/or needle removal. Students create at least one pat ient timeline on each of their o bservation rotations. Clinical Mentoring - year three In the third year of the program , students continue to gain clinical experience and become more familiar with the different lineage styles of the clinic al faculty . Participating in two clinical mentoring rotations per quarter, students become more involved in the process of diagnosing and treating patient s under the direction and supervision of the clinician . Students write case reports on patient cases t hey have followed in the clinic. Pre-Internship - year three In spring quarter of the third year, students begin the pre -internship rotation, where they learn the role and responsibilities of the intern by shadowing the current interns . Clinical Case Presentation I -III - year three Students apply their didactic learning to clinical scenarios through case -based discussion and presentation. 130 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Internship - year four In the final year of the program, students become interns and assume a gradually increasing level of responsibility for direct patient care. They continue to refine their clinical skills and understanding , and build their confidence as proficie nt practitioners. They become more fully involved in the diagnosis of increasingly complicated cases, and in the creation and delivery of integrated treatment protocols that typically include needle insertion and the prescription of herbal formulas. Studen ts receive training and guidance from a diverse group of skilled practitioners of classical Chinese medicine and are encouraged to choose a clinical mentor , with whom they do at least one rotation per quarter during the fall, winter and spring quarters . At no time does the intern act independently without formal authorization from a supervising licensed practitioner. By the end of the year, each student will have created a case report on one of their patient cases. Internship Case Presentation I -III - year four Students present their clinic cases to fellow interns and a faculty supervisor for discussion and feedback.

SECTION 3: CLINICAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS The Registrar's Office records clinic attendance, clinic hours and patient contacts for each student on the basis of the student time sheet , and hour and contac t totals from the student's clinical supervisors. At the end of each term, students receive individual Student Clinical Status Reports that track the student's progress toward meeting the clinic hourly requirements outlined below. Clinic requirements are r eviewed annually. Students will track their own clinical hours via the student timesheet provided by the Registrar's Office , which includes an up -to-date summary of patient contacts . The student timesheet constitutes the primary evidence regarding how many shifts were attended in a given rotation . The registrar provides clinic status and proficiency objective reports quarterly. 3.1 Summary of Clinical Hour Requirements ND hour requirements Foundational Curriculum (matriculated before fall 2015) Requ irement Timing Hours Intro to Clinic 1st year 12 Hydro/Massage One 48 -hour rotation and 24 observation h ours 72 Clinical Educatio n 2nd year spring 18 Secondary Rotations Begins summer before 3 rd year, or fall of 3 rd year 192 (total of four graded rotations) Primary Rotations Begins spring of the 3 rd year 720 (total of 15 graded rotations , plus 24 holiday hours) Senior Lab Post 4th year summer 12 Community Education Any year of attendance 24 Preceptor ship Hours Preceptor ship rotations can begin 2 nd year 240 Grand Rounds 3rd year 60 Grand Rounds 4th year 60 ND hour requirements Redesigned Curriculum (matriculated on or after fall 2015) Requirement Timing Hours Observation I 1st year 20 Observation II 1st year 20 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 135 Hydrotherapy/Massage One 48 -hour rotation during 2nd year 48 Secondary Rotations Begins summer before 3rd year, or fall of 3rd year 180 (at least three graded rotations) Primary Rotations Begins summer before 4th year 780 (at least 13 graded rotations) Preceptor ship Hours Can begin winter of 1 st year 216 Note: There are 1,264 required clinical hours involving patient contact, performed in observation, hydrotherapy, secondary, primary and preceptorship roles. Additional clinical coursework is didactic in nature, providing orientation to and assessment of clinical activities, an d does not include clinical patient contact. These activities include healthcare provider -level CPR (years 1 and 3) , the Clinic Observation (year 1) and Introduction to Clinic (year 2) course s (which include HIPAA and OSHA training), and Grand Rounds (years 3 and 4) . DSOM and MSOM hour requirements Requirement Timing Hours Intro to Clinic 1st year 18 Observation Begins fall of the 2nd year 144 (total of three graded rotations) Clinical Case 3rd year 72 Presentation I-III Clinical Mentoring 3rd year (total of six graded rotations) 288 Pre-Internship 3rd year ( one graded rotation) 48 Internship Case 4th year 72 Presentation I -III Internship 4th year (total of 9 graded rotations) , plus 24 hours holiday (non-graded) 432 There are a total of 1,098 clinical hours , of which 1,074 are required. The 24 holiday requirement hours are designed to maintain continuity of care for patients and may be used as make -up hours. 144 of the total hours are classroom hours spent in the refinement of clinical reasoning skills throug h the analysis of patient cases from the clinic. Concurrent -degree students are required to do a total of 24 community education hours. 3.2 Description of Clinical Requirements ND Requirements The required ND Clinical Education curriculum is outlined in Section II, 1.4, with the hour breakdown listed in Section II, 3.1. It shou ld be noted that as part of primary and secondary rotation requirements , ND students must work 144 summer hours and 24 holiday hours. The Registrar's Office reserves the right to alter these requirements in conjunction with the program deans to ensure that sufficient student participation is maintained to operate the NUNM Health Centers. CPR Requirements Prior to beginning clinical rotations, ND students are required to complete healthcare provider - level CPR training, including the hands -on and written components. For ND students, training must be completed during the first year, prior to beginning hydrotherapy rotations in year 2 . 136 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 CCM Requirements The required CCM Clinical Education curriculum is outlined in Section II, 1.4, with the hour breakdown listed in Section II, 3.1. It should be noted that as part of the internship requirement, MSOM and DSOM students must work 144 summer hours and 24 holiday hours. The Regist rar's Office reserves the right to alter these requirements in conjunction with the program deans to ensure that sufficient student participation is maintained to operate the NUNM Hea lth Centers. CPR Requirements Prior to beginning clinical rotations, CCM students are required to complete healthcare provider - level CPR training, including the hands -on and written components. For CCM students, this applies to observation rotations. Introduction to Clinic and Clinical Observation I & II For CCM students, these course s provide an overview of clinical education requirements. They are designed as an orientation to duties and responsibilities for clinic rotations. CCM students are intro duced to the fundamentals of being an observer in the CCM clinics . Topics include HIPAA compliance, clinic policies and procedures, hygienic standards including Clean Needle Technique, charting protocols, patient confidentiality and multicultural awareness . Students take this course in the spring quarter of the first year of their program. Summer and Holiday Internship Each DSOM and MSOM intern is required to work 144 summer hours and 24 holiday hours. The Registrar's Office reserves the right to alter these requirements in conjunction with the program deans to ensure that sufficient student participati on is maintained to operate the NUNM Health Centers . Clinical Case Presentation I -III Students apply their didactic learning to clinical scenarios through case -based discussion and presentation. Internship Case Presentation I -III Students present their clinic cases to fellow interns and a faculty supervisor for discussion and feedback. 3.3 Patient Contact Requirements Each ND student must participate in a minimum of 510 patient visits at NUNM Health Centers or at an approved, affili ated community clinic. Of the 51 0 visits, 225 visits must be those for which the student serves as the primary. The remainder of each student's patient contacts must be obtained at the clinic, at one of NUNM 's other approved clinical training programs , or on a preapproved preceptor rotation. Each DSOM and MSOM student must participate in a minim um of 350 patient visits at NUNM Health Centers or at an approved, affiliated community clinic between intern and clinical mentorship rotations . A maximum of 72 patient contacts can be obtained on clinical mentoring rotations. 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 137 3.4 Additional Requirements for Graduation ND Case Analysis Papers Students will be required to submit six case papers to their supervising physicians based on clinical cases that they have managed during their last year of clinical training at NUNM . Students in their final four (4) terms of clinical education will submit one or two case papers per quarter. Cases selected will be from different shifts, and submission will begin in summer or fall quarter of the final year for four -year students. Students on the five - year plan or in the concurrent degree program may spread the requirement for six case papers over the final five quarters of their clinical education. Case papers are submitted to the student's clinical supervisor on the shift where th e patient was seen. Completed papers must be turned in by Friday, 5 p.m. of the end of week 9 of the quarter. This allows time for the supervising faculty to evaluate the paper, return it for corrections if necessary , and submit a grade before the end of the quarter. If the paper is not adequate, the supervising physician will return the paper to the student with comments by the end of week 10 . The student will make the required changes and resubmit the paper by the en d of week 11 . The supervising physician will evaluate the papers, grade them, and submit the grade forms to the Registrar's Office with their term grading sheets. Late papers will not be accepted . Students will select cases from their clinic shifts. It is preferable to select cases for which the student has had a follow -up visit. In certain instances, students may select patients to write up that they have seen once, but who were not able to return to the clinic to see that student . In these instances, the student will clear the case selection with their supervising physician on the shift before writing the case paper. The physician will determine if the patient is appropriate for the purpose of this educational requirement. Requests for chart copie s must be submitted , on the provided request forms, to NUNM Health Center s' medical records department. Students must allow at least one week for the chart copy request to be fulfilled, so plan accordingly. Clinic al Proficiency Objectives (CPOs) In order to receive credit for clinic al proficiency objectives (CPOs) , students will submit a completed \"Clinic al Proficiency Objective \" form to the Registrar's Office (there are drop -off boxes located in the health center conference rooms as well). Forms are availabl e at NUNM Health Center s-Lair Hill and at the Registrar's Office . Students may record more than one completed objective on each form, but each objective must be initialed by the supervising physician, as well as having the supervisor sign at the bottom of the form. Students may not receive credit for completing CPOs while working with preceptor physicians , unless the preceptor is also a supervising physician at NUN M Health Center s. The Registrar's Office supplies students with an up -to-date record of completed CPOs at the end of each term. Students are responsible for keeping the yellow copy of the CPO form for their records , and should notify the Registrar's Office of any discrepanc ies between their records and the clinic al proficiency status report. 138 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 SECTION 4: CONTACT INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS Effective methods of communication between students, faculty members, patients, clinic administrators and university employees are vital to the provision of high -quality patient care and student education. The following policies have been established to facilitate efficient communication with students as they progress through the stages of their clinical education. 4.1 Personal Contact Information Each student's personal contact information (telephone numbers, mailing address and email address) must be accurate and kept up-to-date, especially once a student enter s the clinic . Any changes in contact information must be submitted to the Registrar's Office, using the \"Change of Address \" form found on the NUNM website. It is the responsibility of the student to verify that change has occurred. 4.2 Campus Mailboxes Students are pro vided with mailboxes in the Academic Building that are routinely used for hard - copy information sent via NUNM 's inter -office mail and courier system. Mailbox es must be checked regularly and consistently. 4.3 Student Email and Moodle Student email is NUNM 's primary system for communication. Email is used to relay information about university policies, procedures and programs . Students must check their student email regularly. All academic and clinic forms and schedules are posted on the registrar's Moodle page. All students are required to maintain a Moodle account, and to check it regularly and consistently. 4.4 Voice mail and Patient Communication NUNM voicemail extensions are assigned to ND primaries and CCM interns. These extensions are used for patie nt, clinic and university communications. Each student is provided with directions for setting up voicemail, and is given a sample message script when assigned a voicemail extension. Each student is responsible for checking their voicemail extension in the following manner: Voicemail messages must be checked at least once every 24 hours. If desired, the IT department can set any student's voicemail to page personal cell phone s whenever a message is received. However, students are still required to check the ir voicemail regularly, whether a page has been received or not. It is important that no patient call is missed because of phone system inattentiveness. To provide proper patient care and for institutional liability purposes, all incoming NUNM patient call s must be routed through the institution. It is against NUNM policy for any student to provide personal cell phone number s as a means of communicating with patients. NUNM is not responsible for charges incurred for forwarding messages to personal devices. Whenever a student contacts a clinic patient, they should have the patient's clinic chart available and know that the supervising faculty member is immediately accessible. All patient calls must be charted in the patient's electronic medical record at the clinic within one (1) business day and routed to the attending physician for review and signature . Patient calls must be returned on the same day if possible, or within 24 hours . This is true even when the patient's concerns cannot be addressed without fu rther research or discussion with the supervising faculty. In such a case, the patient must be informed that the message was received, and told how the follow -up will occur. 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 139 When contacting a patient via telephone or electronic chart , students may not provide any medical advice prior to obtaining permission from the supervising faculty . The student should listen well, ask thorough questions, take good notes, and then contact the supervising faculty member. All patient advice and care must be under the d irection of a licensed practitioner . Full confidentiality and HIPAA -compliance practices must be followed at all times, including when patients are called from outside the clinic. *67 should be used to block outgoing phone number s. Patient phone number s should be immediately deleted from the student's cell phone after the call is complete . The manner in which each clinical supervisor manages calls may vary. When there is doubt about the best way to respond to a patient call, the student should be conscientious of the policies listed above and check with the supervising practitioner about personal practices, guidelines and requirements. 4.5 Electronic Mail, Social Networking and HIPAA NUNM 's policy on electronic mail is based on HIPAA regulations that govern patient -protected health information (PHI). The current policy is designed to protect the privacy rights of patients and to protect NUNM against litigation. NUNM does not provide a secu re electronic mail system to students, staff or faculty. NUNM uses the OCHIN Epic system for electronic health records . MyChart is the patient portal within Epic and is the only approved electronic method to communicate with patients. A student or faculty member may not communicate with a patient via NUNM or personal email. Students must use their NUNM email account when communicating with faculty about patients. Students may not communicate with patients on any social network sites (e.g., Facebook , Twitter, Instagram, etc.) Students may not give any medical diagnostic or treatment information to any other person on a social website. Students may not discuss any patient cases on social media, regardless of patient de - identification . Failure to follow these guidelines will result in disciplinary action. SECTION 5: SCHEDULING OF STUDENTS FOR CLINICAL ROTATIONS 5.1 Clinic Registration Students register for their clinic rotations by submitting a clinic registration form (available on the registrar's Moodle page) to the associate registrar during the clinic registration period following academic registration . The registration timeline is announced to all students at the beginning of each quarter . Every attempt will be made to honor students' requests , but this may not be possible. All clinical rotations must have adequate student coverage to ensure quality of patient care. Fixed rotations for primaries and interns (see below) will be assigned before the registration period for the upcoming term begins ; this helps to ensure that class conflicts are prevented . Students have the opportunity to trade rotations with classmates after the clinic schedule s have been posted, as long as the re gistration deadline is strictly observed . The deadline to 140 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 request a change to clinic schedules is four weeks prior to the beginning of the following quarter , and is published at the top of all clinic schedules. For more information, refer to \" clinic sched ule adjustment period\" under the Add/Drop Policies . 5.2 ND Priority Registration for Primaries The associate registrar schedules ND primary clinic rotations according to a priority registration system that allows all students equal access to the faculty and shift times. Every student is given first -priority status for one quarter of each academic year. Th e priority registration process optimizes the likelihood that the student will receive most of their requested rotations. However, due to the limited number of spaces available on each rotation, NUNM cannot guarantee that every student will be assigned their first choice of clinic rotation . ND students will be required to complete a community clinic rotation in th eir first - priority term. During another quarter, each student will have second -priority status. Registration requests are scheduled after those of first -priority students. Many students with second - priority status receive requested rotations. During the re maining quarter, the student will have third -priority status. Registration w ill be scheduled after students having first - and second -priority status. ND students will also be assigned a term in which they will be required to complete a Saturday rotation as a primary. 5.3 Add/Drop Policy for Clinic Rotations Students have a three - to five-day schedule adjustment period , after the clinic schedule s with assignments have been posted , to add or drop rotations without being charged. This provides the opportunity for students to trade clinic rotations. Students must contact the as sociate registrar to coordinate these schedule changes. After the clinic schedule adjustment period, students must use the following procedure to change their cli nic schedule: In order to add or drop a clinic rotation, students must contact the associate registrar directly. A final deadline for changes is included on the clinic schedules , posted on the registrar's Moodle page. ND primary and CCM interns who wish to add or drop any clinic rotations after the clinic schedule final deadline must complete the \"Petition to Deviate from Current Policy or Requirements \" form and submit it to the Registrar's Office. It will then be submitted to the progra m dean , a decision will be made, and the student will be notified of the outcome by the associate registrar. While awaiting a decision, students are required to attend all scheduled clinic shifts and adhere to all current clinic policies. All fees concerning clinic rotations will continue to apply. A $50 add/drop fee will be charged for any rotation changes after the deadline date. 5.4 Scheduling of Holiday Clinic Shifts NUNM Health Centers recognize holiday periods that correspond with breaks in t he academic schedule. Students have a holiday clinic requirement of 24 hours (CCM) or 30 hours (ND) that is fulfilled during these holiday periods. These hours count toward missed shift makeup hours and are not part of the total hour requirement. In order to provide continuity of patient care, students are scheduled consistently with their regular academic clinic schedule as often as possible. Holiday shifts are required for all ND primary and CCM intern students. 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 141 Students request the weeks that they would prefer to fulfill their holiday requirement in order of preference. Based on this information, the Registrar's Office schedules students for specific days and times. Scheduling is completed in the fall term, in order to allow sufficient time to make holid ay travel arrangements. Students are required to attend all of their assigned holiday shifts. Trades are allowed as long as they are communicated to the Registrar's Office at least four weeks prior to the clinic shift. 5.5 Scheduling of Special Clinic O pportunities Chinese Medicine Fixed Rotation CCM students have the opportunity to apply to have a fixed rotation with a clinical faculty member of choice. If approved, students are scheduled for one rotation per term with their mentors throughout fall, winter and spring quarters of their internship year . This focused time studying under the tutelage of one faculty supervisor is found to be beneficial by many students. In many cases, s tudents have the opportunity to request to mentor with the same faculty supervisor who teaches their Traditional M entorship Tutorial classes in the final year of the program. Fixed Rotation Guidelines The fixed rotation is highly encouraged, but optional. The application process for the fixed rotation occurs in the spring term prior to the final year of clinical education. If selected, a student is assured a rotation with that faculty member for three sequential terms (fall, winter, spring). In some cases, fixed rotation s begin in the \"required summer\" term. Students can ap ply to do their fixed rotation with a faculty supervis or at any clinic location \u2014NUNM Health Centers or the community clinics. If applying with a faculty member who supervises at multiple locations, the student should request a location preference. To preserve the opportunity for students to work with a variety of practitioners, a minimum of two \"non -fixed\" slots are maintained for each internship rotation. A student may participate only in one fixed rotation . Fixed Rotation Application Process Fixed rotation applications include a simple paragraph or essay regarding the student's desire to work more closely with a specific clinical supervisor . They are submitted directly to the clinic supervisor, who communicates their selections to the associate registrar. The associate registrar will notify students of fixed rotation assignment s and coordinate scheduling prior to general clinic registration. Students are encouraged to contact faculty directly for more information about their specialties and pract ices before applying to work with them. Students may apply to do a fixed rotation with more than one attending physician or supervising practitioner, but if accepted by more than one faculty member, must choose only one. Fixed rotations are scheduled prior to all other clinic scheduling. Fixed rotation confirmations are posted by the associate registrar . 142 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Fixed Primary Care ND Clinic Rotations : Each student is assigned two, two -term fixed rotations during their year(s) as primary medical intern. Fixed rotations provide increased mentorship to students, they increase the experience of patient management and follow up, and they improve patient continuity and clinic access. Fixed Rotation Guidelines Students will complete two, two -term fixed rotations during their clinical experience, i .e., four out of 13 rotations (15 for stu dents who matriculate prior to f all 2015) . Ideally, one fixed rotation will be at NUNM Health Centers -Lair Hill or NUNM Health Centers - Beaverton , and the other rotation will be at one of NUNM 's community health centers . For scheduling purposes this is not always feasible and students may be assigned two fixed rotations at an NUNM Health Center or two at community clinics. Stand -alone ND students will be registered for on e fixed rotation for the first half of the final clinical year (Summer/Fall = SF ); the other will be the second half (Winter/Spring = WS) of the year. Concurrent degree (ND/MSOM) students will complete one fixed rotation during their required summer (continuing through fall) and the second fixed rotation in winter/spring of the final year. Final decisions will be made by the registrar and d ean's office , which will attempt to accommodate students' top choices. Fixed rotation placements on shifts will happen prior to first priority clinic registration \u2014 students will automatically be registered for fixed rotations to ensure they do not conflict with required classes. Fixed rotations do not count as a priority term request . Everyone will be registered for fixed rotations and then priority registration will proceed after that. As previously mentioned, there are a limited number of fixed slots available per doctor (typically no more than three per rotation ) to allow all stud ents the opportunity to work with a variety of physicians. SECTION 6: CLINIC ATTENDANCE AND ABSENCE POLICIES For each rotation scheduled during the academic year, students are required to complete 12 individua l shifts in order to receive a p assing grade ( 11 during summer term). Up to two absences are allowed during an 11 - or 12 -week rotation , which must be made up before the end of the following term. Students will be given a grade of incomplete until those absences are made up. Holidays and unexpected cl osures due to inclement weather are included in the total number of absences for that rotation . Exceptions may be made by the program dean if there are an unusually high number of unexpected clinic closures. In the event of a failed rotation, any patient contacts and hours accrued will be recorded and used as makeup hours if needed. In the event of prolonged sickness, a medical leave of absence may be obtained. It is the student's responsibility to keep the associate registrar updated on any planned absenc es or schedule changes. 6.1 Clinic Attendance and Shift Tracking Procedure Students track their own clinical hours via the student timesheet provided by the Registrar's Office , which includes an up -to-date list of patient contacts. The student timesheet constitutes the primary evidence regarding how many shifts were attended and patient contacts were accrued in a given rotation. 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 143 To track clinical attendance, students must use the following procedure : One time sheet is given per rotation. Students should keep a copy for their own records . Each week, the student enters the time in and time out for the shift, the total hours, number of patient contacts, and maintains a patient log on the reverse side. At the end of each week's sh ift, the student gives the time sheet to the supervisor (faculty or resident) to v erify and initial the hours present and patient log. The supervisor/resident will continue to record the student attendance hours and patient contacts in the attendance records binder each week. If a student misses a week due to a holiday/clinic closure or an absence and makes it up during the same term, those hours are entered at the bottom of the timesheet, and the supervisor from the makeup shift will initi al it. At the end of the 12 -week rotation, the student keeps a copy for their own records and gives the original hard copy to the supervisor. At the end of the rotation, the clinical super visor turns in the student time sheets along with their clinical eva luations to the registrar. For s tudents who began clinical rotations prior to summer 2017 Students who began clinical rotations prior to summer 2017 , and have missed shifts on a rotation for which they have already received a \"P\" grade , will have until graduation to make up those specific misses . This only applies to those specific missed shifts prior to summer 2017. Any missed shifts beginning summer 2017 will r esult in an incomplete grade that must be made up by the end of the following term. 6.2 Clinic Absences Students are expected to attend all clinic rotations. More than two absences per clinic rotation will result in a failing grade . These include days missed because of clinic closures due to inclement weather or holidays. Students are no t allowed to \"guest \" on clinic shifts, but must make up all hours missed through substitutions or scheduling extra holiday shifts. During the first week of clinic rotations only illness, bereavement and family emergencies will be considered for approved absences through the associate registrar . All absences, whether planned or unplanned, must be made up by the end of week 12 of the term following the absence (or by the end of any holiday weeks that are scheduled immediately following week 12 of a term) . Planned Absences These may include vacations and/or seminars. Students must request from their supervisor a planned absence and discuss with them the best way to approach their patients' care, and follow through with the agreed upon plan , if approved . Planned absence notification must be submitted to the associate registrar no less than two (2) weeks in advance using the \"Clinic Substitute Request \" page on the registrar's Moodle page (see Section 6.3 below) . As long as a clinic sub stitute is found , the associate registrar will notify the faculty supervisor , resident and clinic staff of the excused absence. If no sub stitute is found, students are required to submit a clinic absence approval form to the associate registrar with the supervising doctor's sig nature . If approved, s tudents are responsible for obtaining a substitute unless otherwise approved in writing (via the \"Clinic Absence Approval \" form or email) by the supervising 144 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 practitioner. All absence approvals without substitutes must be submitted to the associate registrar, who will notify the clinic front desk staff or community clinic staff . The supervising doctor has the authority to approve or deny a planned absence request. A request may be denied if there have been prior absences or if clinic closures are anticipated due to holidays or inclement weather. All miss ed clinical shifts MUST be made up to pass the clinic rotation by the end of the following term. Appeals Process for Denied Planned Absences If a planned absence request has been denied, the student may appeal the decision by completing an \"Absence Request Appeal \" form and submitting it to the program dean . Appeals must be received at least 10 business days prior to the requested da te of absence. Students should give themselves a four -week turnaround time on the entire process if they feel as though their absence request may be denied. An absence appeal must be requested before the student takes time off from clinic. It will be approved or denied based on the following factors: the availability of substitute coverage; makeup hours planned ; and at the discretion of the clinical supervisor and based on patient care needs . If the request is denied, the student will be ex pected to attend the shift(s) in question or the absence (s) will be unexcused. Unplanned Absences These include illness, family emergencies, or attending a birth (for students obtaining a natural childbirth certificate) . In the event of illness or an emergency, students must notify the associate registrar, their faculty supervisor , the resident (if applicable), and the clinic front desk staff (or the community clinic supervisor for a community clinic rotation) via phone or email as soon as possible prior to the beginning of their shift. They must provide a detailed explanation for their absence and leave a telephone number where they can be reached for any necessary follow -up. In the event of prolonged sickness, a medical leave of absence may be obtaine d (refer to the student handbook). A medical excuse must be provided for shifts missed during the first week of the term. Due to the short notice that typically occurs with such absences, the student is responsible for the following: Contacting the super vising practitioner about the absence. If unable to reach the supervisor directly, the student may leave a voicemail /email message. Notifying the associate registrar , resident (if applicable), and the appropriate front desk staff or community clinic repres entative of the absence. Reviewing the patient schedule for that day. The student is responsible for consulting with the rotation's supervising faculty to determine which, if any, patients should be rescheduled with the student for another time and which, if any, patients should be seen that day with an alternate student. This is an important step in quality patient care and it is the student's responsibility to ensure that it happens. When missing a shift to attend a birth (as part of an educational requirement), the student must provide supporting documentation to the associate registrar. If requesting an absence during week 12 (or week 11 during summer term) , arrangements must be made with the student's clinical supervisor to review and sign the fin al clinical evaluation. 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 145 Unexcused Absences An unexcused absence is one in which neither the associate registrar nor the clinical supervisor were informed and the below steps regarding the absence were not taken. These are unprofessional and create hardships for patients, faculty, staff and peers. Students will be referred to the Honor Council and may be docked 20 clinic hours for any unexcused absences. 6.3 Clinic Substitute Procedure Students who will be absent from a clinic shift must enter their absence and request for a substitute on the \"Clinic Substitute Request \" page, located on Moodle under \"Clinic Resources .\" Once a student signs up to substitute on a shift, they are respo nsible for attending the shift. If a student is unable to attend the shift for which they agreed to substitute, that student is responsible for finding a replacement. In either event, all clinic absence policies apply. Failure to find a substitute for a clinic shift will result in an unexcused absence , including docked clin ical hours and referral to the Honor Council ( see Section 6.6 below ). 6.4 Inclement Weather and Clinic Closure On occasion, Portland weather can present dangerous traveling conditions. If this happens, administrators may deem it necessary to close the university and clinic (s) for the day. In some cases, when the weather is expected to improve , the university may be closed and classes cancelled, but the clinics may open during the latter portion of the day. Students are expected to pay careful attention to closure information. Unexpected clinic closures are factored into graded attendance unless there are an unusually high number of them. Students should r efer to the emergency closure procedure in the student handbook for more specifics about inclement we ather closure notifications. 6.5 Make up and Holiday Shifts Any student needing additional shift hours in order to convert a grade of \"incomplete ,\" or to meet the graduation requirement , can make up the hours by substituting or completing extra holiday shifts. Students can find makeup clinic shift opportunities on the \"Clinic Substitute Request \" page on Moodle. All hours completed that are not part of a student's regular schedule must be documented on the timesheet for their assigned rota tion (if making up hours within the same term that they were missed), or on a \"Holiday Hours and Make up Shift \" timesheet. Timesheets must be submitted by the end of the term in which the hours were completed or they will not be accepted. See Section 6.1 fo r further detail. 6.6 Tardiness It is both disruptive and disrespectful to supervising faculty, patients and fellow students to arrive late. Students are expected to arrive early and remain through the end of the shift, even if there is no patient, and t o utilize the time in clinic constructively. Students should arrive at clinic at least five minutes before the shift begins and be ready for the shift at the time it is scheduled to begin. Students should take transportation and parking into consideration when planning their schedules. If a student is 15 -30 minutes late to shift or leaves more than 15 minutes early, it will require one hour of shift time to be made up. Tardiness or leaving early by more than 30 minutes will require the entire shift to be ma de up. A student may fail a rotation or be referred to the Honor Council for repetitive tardiness. 146 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 SECTION 7: GRADING AND EVALUATION OF CLINIC ROTATIONS 7.1 Grading Students earn graded credit for each of their required clinic rotations . Students are req uired to complete and pass all of their assigned clinic rotations, even when they have already fulfilled their patient contact and hourly requirements. Clinical rotations are graded using a pass/fail system. Grade of \"P\" (Pass): The student has met the requirements to pass the rotation on their clinical evaluation and has completed a total of 48 hours (12 shifts) or more (or 44 hours/11 shifts during the summer) . The student may not have missed more than two shifts on their graded rotation, and any misse s must be made up as noted in Section 6.2 above . These hours will change accordingly with any future changes to clinic shift length. Grade of \"I\" (Incomplete): The student has met all requirements for passing the rotation according to their final clinical evaluation, but is missing up to eight hours/ two shifts on their timesheet. o Any missed shifts are required to be made up by the end of the following the term. o Shifts made up the following term are logged in the \"Holiday and Make up Shift \" timesheet, initia led by the supervisor for that makeup shift, and submitted to the registrar by the student by the end of week 12 of the term. Once the needed shifts are made up, the registrar will convert the \"I\" grade to a \"P.\" o If missing shifts are not made up by the en d of the term following the receipt of an \"I\" grade, the \"I\" will be changed to an \"F\" (Fail), and the student will be required to complete an additional rotation. Grade of \"F\" (Fail): The student has not met the clinical and/or attendance requirements for passing the rotation. Grade of \"RP\" (ND) or \"R\" (CCM): The student has been required to complete a clinical skills building course (remediation). This grade may be given even if a student has missed up to two shifts during the term, as outlined in the Gr ading Policies section of the student handbook . If students have more than two absences on a single clinic rotation, they cannot be accurately graded by their faculty supervisor and will receive a failing grade for that rotation . Exceptions may be made in the event of multiple clinic closures beyond the student's control. 7.2 Clinical Learning Objectives At the beginning of each term, supervising faculty will provide students with an orientation to the rotation by clearly defini ng their expectations of students, the objectives of that clinic rotation, and the manner in which they will measure student achievement. This orientation is provided so that students have an understanding of their learning objective s on that shift, and th e manner in which they will achieve these objectives and be graded on them. 7.3 Evaluation Process Naturopathic Medicine Program Proficiency Examinations ND students are required to pass a n OSCE before moving forward in each stage of clinical training. The OSCE 1 examination (clinic entrance examination) is taken and passed before the student becomes a secondary intern . The OSCE 2 examination (primary status examination) must be passed before the student becomes a primary intern , and successful completion of the OSCE 3 examination (exit examination) is required to graduate from the program. 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 147 Midterm Evaluation During the sixth week of each term, students meet with their clinical supervisors to disc uss their clinical performance. The evaluation covers clinical skills, knowledge, thought processes and professional behavior. The meetings are designed to give students constructive feedback, identify areas of excellence or concern, and assess students' o verall progress in an informal, supportive atmosphere. Week six reviews may be provided to students in written form, but are not tracked through the Registrar's Office. Final Evaluation Final evaluations of all ND students are conducted during either week 11 or week 12 of each term. Supervising faculty meet with each student individually to discuss their evaluation of the student's performance over the duration of that clinic rotation. St udent grades are based on the student's overall clinical performance as reflected in their final evaluations. Grades are submitted on the pass/fail grading system . Students must repeat a failed rotation , and the faculty member must document areas the stude nt will need to further develop during their required skills -building course . Evaluation of Supervisors At the end of each quarter, students complete evaluations of their faculty supervisors. The evaluations are reviewed by the dean of the College of Naturopathic Medicine , with input from the associate dean for clinical education and the chief medical officer. Classical Chinese Medicine Programs Clinic Entrance Examination All CCM students take a practical point location examination at the beginning of the winter quarter prior to starting their internship year. Students failing this examination are given the opportunity to remediate this exam later in the same term. If the student fails the remediation exam, they must enroll in the Advanced Point Loca tion course in the spring quarter. CCM students also take a written clinic entrance examination during the first half of the spring term prior to becoming an intern. The written examination covers the foundational course material needed to assume responsib ility for direct patient care. Students who fail this examination are given the opportunity to remediate the exam later in the same term. A remediation fee is applied. Should a student fail the written examination for a second time, their entrance into the clinic is delayed for a term, during which the student will have time to address weak areas. Another written exam will be given toward the end of this term. Evaluation of Clinical Rotations Faculty evaluate students during week 6 using a form that asses ses achievement of level -specific clinical competencies. They discuss their evaluation with students in a one -on-one meeting, during which they identify any \"critical non -performance\" issues that must be corrected by the end of term for successful completi on of the rotation. F inal evaluations of students are conducted during e ither week 11 or 12 of the term. Supervising faculty meet with each student individually to discuss their evaluation of the student's performance over the duration of that clinic rotat ion. Student grades are based on these evaluations. In addition, students do a self -evaluation prior to meeting with their clinical faculty member. Grades are submitted as pass or fail. Stud ents must repeat a failed shift. Clinic Exit Examination During the final quarter of their training, interns perform an intake and examination on an actual patient or a patient -actor, and then determine a diagnosis (with differential) and devise a treatment approach. Students provide oral and written explanation s of their findings and plan. An 148 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 evaluation rubric is used to grade the student. This practical examination tests whether the student has mastered the level of clinical knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to graduate and become a practitioner with sole responsibility for patient care. Students who do not pass have the opportunity to remediate the exam later in the same quarter. A remediation fee is applied. Evaluation of Supervisors At the end of each quarter, observers and interns complete evaluations of their faculty supervisors. The evaluations are reviewed by the associate dean for clinical education and the program dean with input from the chief medical officer. 7.4 Clinical Remediation Students who require extra support in meeting minimal levels of clinical competency are counseled and referred for additional instruction by their clinical supervisors or the program dean. ND Clinical Skills Enhancement Clinical skills e nhancement courses are generally scheduled over a six -week period of time; students may be referred to this course at any point during the term. The clinical skills enhancement instructor carefully assesses each student's abilities and works with them directly throug hout the duration of the course . At the end of the course , the instructor reassesses the student's abilities and determines if the student should continue with the course . A faculty member may require or recommend a clinical skills e nhancement course , even if a student receives a passing grade, if the faculty member feels the student needs additional help to improve their clinical competency . OSCE Skills Tutorial ND student s who fail an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) twice will be referr ed to an OSCE skills t utorial for three sessions. If the student passes this course, the student may re -take their exam. CCM Clinical Skills Remediation Clinic evaluations of CCM student performance are done during week 6 of the term to provide midterm feedback and identify areas of weakness, including those that must be remediated before the end of term in order for the student to pass the clinic rotation. The clinical supervisor, in collaboration with the CCM associate dean of clinical education and th e program dean, can assign remediation work, which can include attendance at weekly clinical skills tutorial labs overseen by the clinical supervisor, associate dean of clinical education, and/or the AOM resident. SECTION 8: OTHER CLINIC POLICIES 8.1 Conf identiality and Medical Records Each student must hold all information regarding the business of NUNM Health Centers , medical records information, patient interactions and clinical consultations as confidential. In the course of the student's medical educ ation at any NUNM health center , all information concerning patients, students, staff, employees and physicians should be treated with the same sense of confidentiality. All staff, faculty and students working at the clinics are required to sign a confiden tiality statement. Confidentiality and HIPAA The Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was established to protect patients by preventing the inappropriate use or transmission of patient healthcare information. Special consideration was given to the technological advancements d eveloping within healthcare 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 149 professions, and the level of confidentiality associated with ever -changing methods of communication. Students will receive training about HIPAA and NUNM 's confidentiality policies b efore beginning as clinicians at NUNM Health C enters . As an additional prerequisite to clinical work, students will be provided with NUNM 's confidentiality policy and must agree to uphold the conditions of the policy. Confidentiality and the Rule of \"Need to Know \" In order to provide patient services , clinic employees and clinicians have a need to know some patient health information. Those affiliated with the clinic in providing patient services only access the patient information that they need to know, and only to the extent that they need to know it, for provision of patient services. This information is then maintained in strict confidence and is only shared with others who, like them, have a need to know in order to provide services to the patient. In order to further protect our patients' confid entiality, discussion of patient information must be avoided in public areas. Please refer to NUNM 's confidentiality policy for more information about confidentiality, HIPAA and protected health information. Breach of confidentiality is an extremely serious violation and may result in immediate termination of a student's educational agreement and/or other sanctions as appropriate. Medical Records All individuals engaged in the collection, handling or dissemination of patient health information shall be specifically informed of their responsibility to protect patient data and of the penalty for violation of this trust. Proven violation of confidentiality of patient information shall be cause for immediate termination of access to further data , and imme diate termination of any student. This policy shall be made known to all students at the time clinical training begins , and each student shall indicate their understanding and willingness to comply with the policy through a signed statement at the time of clinic orientation. The statement shall be kept with students' clinical record (see \"Confidentiality Agreement \" form) . NUNM Health Centers use the Epic electronic health record system. This system include s patient management (scheduling and billing) and electronic medical record components. In order to maintain a high standard of protection, clinical faculty, students and clinic employees are the only people with access to this secured system. Regarding medical records: The patient owns the ir chart information and may access any of its content at any time. NUNM is the custodian of the chart. Confidentiality of all patient health information is legally protected. Requests for patient charts not accessible in Epic, on paper and electronic archives, ar e submitted in writing on chart pull-slips to the clinic services representatives and medical records personnel. Chart pull-slips are used with out -cards to track the paper cha rt's location in the clinic, and the person responsibl e for the chart, until it is refiled on medical records shelves. Paper charts and any patient documentation are not to be left unattended or in unsecured areas including clinic conference tables. Paper c harts and any patient documentation must be kept on clinic premises at all ti mes. 150 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Students may request copies of patient charts to be used for educational purposes, such as case presentations and theses, by submitting a \"Student Chart Copy Request \" form to medical records. All other chart copies require patient authorization for re lease of information and must be submitted on a HIPAA -compliant \"Authorization for Release of Medical Records \" form by the patient. Please ask for these forms through the medical records department. Unauthorized chart copying is illegal and will be handled through the campus judicial process. Sanction may include suspension from the clinic and/or NUNM . In order to further protect the confidentiality of our NUNM community, students must obtain the authorization of their supervising faculty mem ber (on the chart pull-slip) to pull any of the following patient charts: 1) their own chart; 2) another student's chart; or 3) an employee's chart. 8.2 Professional Attire at NUNM Health Centers The intent of NUNM guidelines for attire and hygiene is to present a safe and professional appearance to patients and their families; it is not to inhibit personal freedom or style. Medical students have an important and unique role in the clinical encounter, and appearance has an impact on that role. At NUNM we strive to provide excellent patient care. A large part of developing an effective rapport is to make the patient as comfortable as possible. Many studies have shown the impact the appearance of a physician has on a patient. Additionally, adherence to NUNM policy on professional attire is a reflection of respect for the faculty. A student who is not in compliance with the below listed policies will be asked to leave the shift , and will lose credit hours as appropriate as an unexcused absence from the shift. The student may return to the shift once the violation has been corrected. Dress Code Policy It is the responsibility of all students, faculty and staff to maintain person al dress and cleanliness consistent with patient care and OSHA regulations. Enforcement of these regulations is the responsibility of all faculty, staff and students. Students must follow the established dress code for all NUNM Health Centers : An NUNM identification badge in a visible location is required AT ALL TIMES. Students must wear clean , neat, unwrinkled and appropriate professional attire, which includes pressed dress shirt with a tie, dress pants or slacks, dresses, skirts, and close -toed dress shoes. Skirts or dresses should touch the top of the knee or longer when seated. Shirts and blouses must have sleeves. Tank tops or other sleeveless tops are not allowed unless a white coat is worn over the shirt . NUNM has a scent -free (natural and synthetic) policy that must be observed by students (refer to the NUNM university policy for details). Offensive odor s, including body odor and strong smelling breath, will be addressed. Earrings are limited to no more than two per ear, and must be studs or short dangling earrings. Dangling earrings more than one inch long are not appropriate. Holes in ears should be lim ited to 2mm in diameter. A student who has matriculated at NUNM with large ear holes may seek an exception to this rule. Ear piercing and single nose piercings with small studs on a single side are permitted. No other visible body piercing, including, but not limited to, tongue piercing and eyebrow rings/bars are permitted. 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 151 Hair must be clean, well groomed, and worn in a manner that will not interfere with patient care or comfort. Hair past shoulder length should not be able to touch patients. This may mean that it be required to be tied back or kept under a head wrap if necessary. Facial hair must be kept clean and trimmed to no longer than one inch, or put into a clip. Hats, with the exception of religious head coverings, are not appropriate. Makeup may b e worn in moderation. Fingernails must be kept short, clean, neatly manicured, and not extend more than one - quarter inch past the fingertips. Artificial nails and nail jewelry are prohibited per health department regulations in any patient care role. Artif icial nails are defined as any application of a product to the nail to include, but not limited to, acrylic, overlay and tips of silk wraps (does not refer to nail polish). Chipped nail polish is not permitted. Shoes must be close d-toe and non -skid and of low or moderate heel (2 \u00bd inch maximum). Clean athletic shoes may only be worn with scrub attire. Any visible tattoos with nudity or expletives must be covered. Other tattoos, that may be considered offensive by patients, may be requested to be covered. Clothing should not e xpos e the chest, abdomen or back . Supervising faculty may have additional dress requirements as appropriate to their specific shifts. Naturopathic Medical Students (in addition to the above) At NUNM Health Centers , all ND students will wear an NUNM -logo white coat identifying them as part of the provider team. Solid blue or green s crubs may be worn by hydrotherapy students. 8.3 Probation and Disciplinary Policy In the event that a student's conduct in clinic is inappropriate, the clinic supervising faculty may document the incident by submitting a n incident report . A copy may be forwarded to the student and other administrators, such as the chief medical officer and program dean. Doctors may , at their discretion, report the following issues and b ehavior s of any students who they believe have violate d any NUNM rule or policy including, but not limited to, the following: Arrival to shift unprepared for treatment plan/assignment Missing/late for patient appointment by more than five minutes Missing/late to case preview/review by more than five minutes Not following the clinic absence/substitute policy Being unavailable while on a scheduled clinic shift Acting without the attending physician's perm ission Not following the clinic protocols/standards Not following the physician instructions Inappropriate dress Unprofessional behavior or conduct such as the following: o Inappropriate remarks o Improper draping o Breach of patient confidentiality o Diagnosing/treating a patient without supervising faculty approval o Not following supervising faculty's recommendations o Other professional misconduct Violation of, or failure to comply with, any other rules or policies of NUNM 152 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Note: Any incident that may v iolate NUNM 's discrimination and/or harassment policies must be immediately reported , as provided in the Gender Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct policy addressed in the student h andbook . All non -academic reports are reviewed by the dean of students , with a possible referral to t he Honor Council as outlined in the s tudent handbook. 8.4 NUNM Campus Clinic Parking Policy The parking lot at the clinic is for patients only. NUNM students, staff and faculty may not park in the clinic lot unless they are being seen at the clinic as a patient or as a customer of the lab or medicinary. 8.5 Internal/ External Referral Policies and Procedures Policy (Internal Referrals) In accordance w ith its mission to provide outstanding medical care t o its patients, and because NUNM Health Centers have extraordinary expertise and talent amongst its practitioners, NUNM Health Centers encourages the internal referral of patients for specific treatments. Procedure (Internal Referrals) If an NUNM Health Centers location uses an electronic health r ecords system, referrals are made electronically. Hard co py referrals are accepted from community clinics that are not on an electronic h ealth record system. Clinical supervisors fill out the NUNM referral form , hard copy or electronic, for all patients being referred to other internal medical departments (e.g., Chinese medicine, IV shifts, physical medicine, homeopathy shifts, etc.) . Referrals use the SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment and Reason ) format for referral or recommendation. Clinicians use this structure to standardize communication. It is required that the treating practiti oner communicate findings and treatments to the referring practitioner(s). This is common in private practice and is expected as a basic courtesy by most referring physicians. The physician answers any questions the patient may have regarding the internal referral process. For hard copy referrals, any findings and treatments from the referral physician are to be summarized in one or two paragraphs and forwarded back to the referring physician and primary on a continual basis in a timely manner. A copy of this communication is kept in the patient's medical record. For electronic referrals the r eferral physician will document directly into the patient's electronic health record. Policy (External Referrals) If an NUNM Health Center location uses an electronic health records system, referrals are made electronically. Hard copy referrals are accep ted from community clinics that are not on an electronic health record system. Each clinical supervisor will ensure that the appropriate referrals occur for clinic patients as necessary . Procedure (External Referrals) NUNM Health Centers ' referral protocol are: The clinic physician recommends a referral doctor and/or location to the patient and sends a referral request to the referral coordinator at NUNM 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 153 Health Centers -Lair Hill. The clinician documents that the referral was recommended and discussed with the patient in the patient's chart using the SBAR format (Situation, Background, Assessment, and Reason for Referral). An electronic referral, phone call or standard office form is initiated by the Referral Coordinator using the information obtained from the clinician. In the event of the need for a patient referral, it is the responsibility of the clinical supervisor doing the referral to sign any referral letters or orders regarding the patient's care. The clinical supervisor will fully explain to the patient in person why a referral is needed or advised, and will address any concerns the patient may have. The clinical supervisor will ensure that all documents require d from the patient is communicated to the patient, and that the referral will not be processed without the required documentation. For referrals between NUNM Health Centers , the NUNM fee schedule will be discussed with the patient. In the event that the patient refuses the referral, it is the clinic supervisor's responsibility to ensure the refusal of referral is documented in the patient's medical chart. 8.6 Referrals for Diagnostic Imaging Policy NUNM has negotiated arrangements with diagnostic imaging companies where uninsured patients can get a discount on certain imaging services when re ferred by NUNM Health Centers. The amount of the discount is subject to change. Currently, the rate is discounted by 20% at Epic Imaging. If a patient has insurance, the patient will be asked to use it for payment and the insurance company 's preferred imaging vendor . Most a re contracted with Epic Imaging . To make a diagnostic imaging referral, follow the guidelines below. Procedure Uninsured: Complete the EPIC Imaging referral form completely and give to the medical records department for faxing to EPIC , or give it to the patient directly (after making a copy) . EPIC referral forms can be found in health center conference r ooms and the Lair Hill \"handout filing cabinet .\" Insured: Follow the same procedure as above , but confirm with the patient's insurance provider t hat Epic Imaging is acceptable. If not, make the referral to the appropriate imaging center, e.g. , Providence requires their plan members to get imagi ng services at Providence. SECTION 9: CLINIC ROTATION RESPONSIBILITIES 9.1 Time Requirements Most clinic rotations are scheduled in four -hour increments, but some may be scheduled for as long as six hours. Care is taken to schedule clinic rotations around required academic courses. Students will need to sp end additional time researching patient cases , responding to patient inquiries, and following up with patients outside of the assigned time in clinic. ND Student Clinic Expectations Hydrotherapy technicians can expect to fulfill clinic rotation requirements in approximately four hours per week. 154 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Secondaries can expect to fulfill clinic rotation requirements in approximately 8 -12 hours per week. Primaries can expect to fulfill clinic rotation requirements in approximately 15 -20 hours per week. Other clinic -related activities such as preceptorship, community education, outreach, grand rounds and case reports are not included in these estimates , and should be added to the hourly commitments listed above. CCM Student Clinic Expectations Observers can expect to work in the clinic approximately four hours per week. Clinical m entoring students can expect to work in the clinic approximately 4 -5 hours per week per rotation. Pre-internship students can expect to work in the clinic approximately four hours per week per rotation. DSOM and MSOM interns can expect to work in the clinic approximately 5 -6 hours per week per rotation, for a total of between 2 -4 rotations per quarter. 9.2 Clinic Preview and Review Students report to assigned clinic shifts p rior to the shift start time by gathering in a conferencing area where patient assignments for the shift are given. In preparation for the shift, the attending physician, resident or practitioner conducts a case preview session in which cases for the day a re briefly discussed. Once case preview is completed, students begin their patient visits under the direct supervision of the clinical faculty me mber to whom they are assigned. The clinical supervisor oversees all student clinical activity while the stude nt is on shift, and although the intern has responsibility for patient care, authorization from the clinical supervisor is always necessary before the student proceeds with exams, treatment plans or other integral components of patient care. At the conclus ion of each four -hour clinic shift, a case review session is held, during which clinical supervisors and students discuss the day's cases. Students' prompt arrival at clinic shifts is imperative. Tardiness will result in the loss of clinic hours (see Section 6. 6 Tardiness) . 9.3 Student Scope of Authority Students are authorized to participate in clinical activities, including care and treatment for patients in NUNM Health Centers and NUNM community clinics, including but not limited to, taking patient 's history, performing physical exam s, and participat ing in diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of patient care , which is directed and supervised at all times by an attending physician or practitioner. 9.4 Time Management on Clinic Rotations In order to best serve patients during their appointments, it is the responsibility of students and clinical supervisors to be on time with patient appointments. Proper time management reinforces the development of good practice -building skills. It is espe cially important to be on time with the last appointment of the day to ensure proper and timely clinic -closing procedures. The clinical supervisor will decide how much and how long the case discussion should occur in front of the patient, and how much sho uld be in the privacy of the clinic conference room. The clinical supervisor ensures that case discussion with each student is as timely as possible, so that the patient is not left unattended for more than 10 minutes. 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 155 No patient should wait for any service related to their visit for more than 10 minutes, with the exception of waiting for an herbal formula to be filled. 9.5 Maintaining Safety in the Clinic Setting In the event of an emergency, accident or security issue, students are required to contact their clinical supervisor or clinic administrator immediately. The appropriate code as noted in the Acute Care Emergency Manual should be initiated as soon as possible. NUNM Emergency Contact Numbers 911 for police, fire or medical emergency After -Hours Security Pager - 503.830.3613 Exposure Control Officer - 503. 380.7694 Facilities and Safety Supervisor - 503.552.2014 Evening/Weekend Security Guard - 503.830.3613 First Response Security: after -hours alarm r esponse and security service - 866.686.1886 After -Hours Physician On -Call pager - 971.266.9344 Please refer to the \"NUNM Acute Care Emergency Manual \" book for specific emergency response procedures. For the safety of all clinic community members, it is vitally important that each student be familiar with the potential health risks of clinical medicine and the proper protocols for lessening those risks. Any procedure that involves breaking the skin cr eates an opportunity for exposure to infection. Appropriate precautions must be used whenever there is a potential for exposure to blood, other bodily fluids (e.g., saliva, mucus, weeping lesions) or body tissues. Due to a possible risk of exposure to bod y fluids, students, faculty and staff must adhere to the following guidelines in all clinical treatment areas (treatment rooms, laboratory areas and medicinary): No food or beverages are to be present Avoid having to insert contact lenses, apply makeup, brush teeth or do any other personal procedure that unnecessarily exposes mucus membranes to potential infection Clinical treatment areas must be equipped with appropriate sharps containers and biohazard containers Areas must be fully stocked with gloves and other personal protective equipment at all times Closed -toe shoes must be worn at all times by clinicians while seeing patients Hand -washing facilities are available either in the room or an immediately adjacent room Hand -washing is the most important single procedure for preventing infection in a healthcare setting. Hands should be washed according to current standards for medical providers: Before and after each patient After contact with blood or body fluids, or obvious environmental contaminants At the end of a treatment or procedure After maintaining personal hygiene 156 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 All students should be aware and conscientious when performing any and all clinical procedures \u2014from inserting acupuncture needles or performing an exam, to cleaning and disinfectin g the treatment room afterwards. Special care must be taken to avoid accidents. In the event of an accident, the clinical supervisor must be contacted immediately and the blood borne pathogen exposure protocol should be initiated. The protocol is as follow s: use the online incident reporting system to record the exposure and the individual involved. Contact the CMO (contact information is available in the online incident reporting system and in the hardcopy needle stick packets). Follow the instructions in the hardcopy needle stick packet, available in every clinical conference room. Needle stick packets are also found behind the clinic front desk and in the clinic hallway near the acupuncture supply cabinets. Needle stick packets can also be found online th rough the \"Exposure and Incident Forms\" link at the bottom of every page of the nunm.edu website. Each health center is equipped with first aid kits, an AED (defibrillator), body fluid spills kit, biohazard bags and containers, and fire extinguishers. The clinics also house OSHA manuals and MSDS manuals for reference. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is provided by the clinic for laboratory, minor surgery and other procedures where the potential for exposure is high. Specific CCM Safety Needs NUNM classical Chinese medicine safety protocols are based on, and wholly consistent with , the information in the most recent \"Clean Needle Technique for Acupuncturists \" manual. Please refer to the most recent CNT manual for current information and instruction about the following: care of instruments, pain or trauma upon insertion, pain after insertion, positioning the patient, skin disinfection, depth of needle insertion, safety and electrica l stimulation, and moxibustion. Acupuncture Needle Protocols Some of the most common clinical tasks facing CCM students are the insertion and removal of acupuncture needles. Handling needles may be hazardous; students should work with them slowly, carefully and cautiously. Insertion of acupuncture needles: Care must be ta ken to avoid contamination when removing needles from the sterile packaging. Needles must not be touched by the bare finger during insertion. All opened needles, whether or not they have been used, must be discarded in the sharps container as they are no l onger sterile. For this reason, needle packages should be opened only at the time of use. Gloves, finger cots and cotton balls should always be available to prevent exposure of the hand that places pressure on the insertion site. Disposal of used acupunct ure needles: Disposable needles must immediately be discarded in sharps containers. Needles should not be gathered in small bunches as they are removed; they should be dropped individually into the sharps container directly after they are removed. Alternatively, they may be transported to the sharps container in a kidney basin or other impervious container. Used needles should be handled as little as possible in order to minimize the possibility of an accidental needle stick. 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 157 Use of moxibustion: Patients must be thoroughly counseled regarding the procedure, risks and alternatives , and be given time to ask questions prior to the use of moxibustion. Extreme care must be taken when lighting and using moxa in the clinic. Treatment doors must remain closed during and after moxa treatment. Fireproof bowls are provided and must be used when lighting and transporting moxa. Moxa sticks and matches must be extinguished and disposed of properly. Failure to follow appropriate safety guidelines may result in disciplinary action. 9.6 Maintaining Cleaning Standards in the Treatment Room After each and every patient visit, the students and clinician(s) who treated the patient are responsible for cleaning the treatment room in accordance with the following proto cols. These are institutional protocols that have been set to meet federal and state safety regulations. General Cleaning Treatment rooms should be left clean, tidy and ready for the next patient and clinician. Used exam table paper should be removed. Tab le paper is thrown in the garbage if it has not been contaminated with body fluids. If it has been contaminated with body fluids, it must be discarded in the biohazard container in the treatment room. Used linens are removed in accordance with the followin g instructions: o Linens such as towels and sheets that have not been exposed to body fluids are to be placed in a green laundry bag. These bags are located in the linen storage areas on each floor of the clinic. o Linens that have come into contact with body fluids or open wounds must be sealed in a biohazard bag and placed into the regular laundry sack for proper processing. Students are advised to use good judgment in these scenarios. Linens that are saturated with a patient's body fluid require this process. Linens with a small drop of blood do not. The faculty supervisor should be consulted if there is any question. Biohaz ard bags are stocked in each patient treatment room. When the green linens bags become full, it is the students' responsibility to transfer the bags from their stations throughout the clinic to the large, green rolling bins in the general storage area on t he first floor. Be certain that any garbage in the room ends up in the garbage bin, not the biohazard container. Be certain that all biohazard waste ends up in the biohazard container. Tidy up counter areas, shelving units and cabinets in treatment rooms b y returning medical supplies to their original spot. Return shared clinic equipment to appropriate storage location, so that the next person can find it. Clean surfaces by wiping them with Caviwipes. Instruments All disposable instruments and materials that have come into contact with body fluids must be properly disposed of in the appropriate biohazard container. All non -disposable instruments that need to b e cleaned and sterilized for re use must be placed in the Cidex bucket to be cleaned and autoclave d by the clinic staff. o The Cidex bucket is located on the counter in the clinic operations hallway. 158 2019 -2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 Gloves Gloves must be worn any time there is a reasonable possibility of hand contact with blood, body fluids or broken skin (exposed tissue). Gloves that have been contaminated with body fluids should be immediately removed and placed in the biohazard can located in the treatment room. Care should be taken to avoid touching anything in the treatment room with the gloves. When students need assistance with d epositing the gloves in the biohazard can they should ask a fellow student, faculty member or clinic staff for assistance in the treatment room. They should not leave the treatment room with the gloves. Contaminated gloves are not to be worn outside of the treatment room under any circumstances. Use of Caviwipes as Disinfectant Caviwipes are the disinfectant used to clean and decontaminate treatment rooms and common areas throughout NUNM Health Centers . Students are required to disinfect treatment rooms an d surfaces that may have been exposed to contamination. This should include the following times: At the beginning of every clinic rotation At the end of every clinic rotation Any time there is visible body fluid contamination The following application procedures must be followed completely in order to ensure proper, effective disinfecting ; and meet OSHA standards : Every surface that may have been exposed to or come into contact with body fluids, including sneezes and coughs, must be disinfected. When bo dy fluid contamination is visible, disposable gloves should be worn for the clean -up process. If body fluid contamination is not visible on a surface, it is not necessary to wear gloves while disinfecting. When body fluid contamination is visible, that surface should be cleaned with Caviwipes first. When an NUNM -approved tuberculocidal disinfectant is not available, a chlorine bleach solution should be used to disinfect as follows: o The solution should be 10% chlorine bleach and 90% cold water o The solution must be fresh (i.e., made within the past 24 hours) o All surfaces should be sprayed with chlorine bleach solution and left wet for five minutes All treatment room doorknobs should be treated with Caviwipes at the end of every clinic rotation. If there has been any potential for exposure, clipboards used in the treatment room should also be cleaned with Caviwipes. Pediatric Area Cleaning In recognition of the more sensitive nature of our pediatric patients, a hydrogen peroxide antimicrobial disinfectant is used instead of Caviwipes to clean the surfaces in the pediatric - designated clinical areas. Body Fluid Spills Each clinic is equipped with a kit to be used for clean up of major body fluid spills. The faculty supervisor or a clinic employee can be consulted for information about its location. If further instructions are necessary, an MSDS book is available at NUNM Health Centers . 2019-2020 NUNM Student Handbook | Revised 1/16/20 20 159 Burnt Materials (Moxa) Stainless steel b owls must be used to hold and extinguish burning materials in the treatment room. Moxa extinguishers should be used for moxa sticks whenever available. Give burnt materials sufficient time to cool thoroughly in the stainless steel bowl before being emptied into the trash. Cups (for Chinese medicine cupping treatments) Students are to place cups into the Cidex bucket on the counter in the pass -through hallway for cleaning by the clinic operations coordinator. 9.7 End of Clinic Shift Checklist 1.
