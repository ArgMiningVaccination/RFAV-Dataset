And not just because they're cheap or free... but because you know they are made of ingredients that are perfectly safe for you and your children. Not to mention that they really are great products that you genuinely love because they: smell nice, give you the results that they promise, and have this overall happy effect on you. I have a a lot in our home and that's because of the goodness of [Human Nature](https://humanheartnature.com/). I don't claim to be a loyalist of all-organic products because let's admit it, they are a bit pricey compared to the products that you can find in your local supermarkets. But there are products that I buy because the benefits far outweigh the price tag. And that's where my love for the products of Human Nature comes in. A short background: [ Human Nature](https://humanheartnature.com/) is a company that started in the Philippines by sisters Anna and Camille Meloto and Anna's husband, Dylan Wilk, a British national who has since considered the Philippines as his home. The Meloto sisters are daughters of Tony Meloto, the founder of Gawad Kalinga (which means to give care), a poverty-alleviation and nation-building movement that first gained support by building homes for the poor and the needy. Human Nature, under the company Gandang Kalikasan Inc. (literally translated as beautiful nature or the beauty of nature), is an intricate cobweb of beautiful stories. Anna was a first time mother, who decided to use cloth diapers and grew frustrated for not finding products that are natural and environment-friendly. Camille, the younger sister, is a make up enthusiast and with her Ate (older sister) set up Human Nature to translate her passion into action. To me, Human Nature is also the Meloto's offsprings forward move to their father's challenge to build social enterprises that aims for sustainable development. Human Nature runs by the tagline \"pro-poor, pro-environment, and pro-Philippines\". And it is exactly what this tagline says. The ingredients used in each product are mostly locally sourced from different provinces and town in the Philippines, and are grown by farmers who are justly compensated and works hand in hand with the company. [Manila Elemi](http://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/content/manila-elemi-magic), for instance, an ingredient in their balancing facial wash is the same ingredient found in expensive beauty products such as Ralph Lauren, Marc Jacobs, and Chanel. I was introduced to Human Nature in 2012 - before I got married and made babies - and I have been hooked since then. I am beyond happy that they have an office in California because I can order the products online and have them delivered here in Montana. It's free shipping for orders above $50! My recent stash arrived early August and Yam of their California center was also kind to provide me with two samples of the baby shampoo/baby wash and strengthening conditioner. Thanks Yam! I am sharing this post for all readers out there who are yet to try their products. I have three years of experience in the \"user department\" so allow me to present my top 10 favorites: 1) Natural Feminine Wash How this delicate product evolved from the look down to the variants is a joy to behold. While most multinational companies bombard consumers with endless advertising of their \"hypoallergenic and safe pH levels\" promise, there are several of these products in the market that don't really deliver the results that they claim to provide. This one made on the top of this list because I yet have to discover a feminine wash that is especially gentle to that intimate area. Trust me, I fearlessly try all kinds of products. Human Nature's feminine wash is safe and irritant-free. This one comes in different variants but my favorite is chamomile fresh. It's great especially when you're pregnant - and for those who have been down the pregnancy road, you know what I'm talking about. They just came out with a new product specifically for the red days too! I haven't tried it yet, for obvious reasons, but I will sure add that one in my shopping cart soon in preparation for my delivery. 2) Balancing Facial Wash The texture of this facial wash may feel weird to first-time users because of the fine bamboo scrubs in the mix but really, it doesn't hurt you. If anything, it just makes you feel \"cleaner\" after your daily ritual of washing your face. [Manila Elemi is a main ingredient in this product that promises to pamper your face and help prevent breakouts and oily skin.](http://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/content/manila-elemi-magic) I have been loyal to this for three years now and for someone with acne-prone skin, this one is a major life saver! 3) Natural Day and Night Moisturizers A kind reminder: don't buy one without the other because these two work as a team. The day moisturizer is infused with beetroot extract and can retain moisture for long hours. No silicone or other harmful products that pretends to make the skin feel silky, smooth, and soft. The night moisturizer is just as a good as it allows your skin to breathe with ingredients such as jojoba oil and plant collagen. It's promise lives on: phthalate-free, paraben-free, and silicone-free. 4) Massage Oil My current obsession and I will explain why in a little bit. In the Philippines, I get a massage twice a week. Here in the US, I haven't had any. Why? Because it's freaking expensive! I just can't justify $70 for a one-hour massage -and it's not even a great massage! So my action plan was to teach my husband basic massage techniques. [Read about the 'massage training' in 5 ways to involve the hubby when you're preggy.](http://www.readingruffolos.com/5-ways-to-involve-the-hubby-when-youre-preggy/) I do love heating oils and pain relieving cream specifically for muscle pains but massage oils - especially the ones that rejuvenates and calms the senses - are my weakness. I only discovered this product recently as it was on promo with the [detoxifying mask and scrub](http://humanheartnature.com/us/index.php/face/detoxifying-mask-and-scrub.html) but it has been working wonders on my cabin fever and my mood swings. I know I sound like a lunatic - and yes, maybe I am. This massage oil saves me from going mad. I remember they used to have a massage oil with strawberry scent back in 2012 (or was that 2013?) which I really love too but I haven't seen it in their catalogue so I guess they phased that out. 5) Sunflower Beauty Oil I have been using this for three years now and I bet your money's worth on it! This is one beauty oil you won't regret buying. You can use it as make-up remover, hair serum, body oil, and even put it on your stubborn acne bump and it will go away! The benefits are tremendous. It's the real beauty in a bottle! A little goes a long way because you don't need that much amount for magic to happen. Just be sure to check the expiry date. As with any organic product, the more natural ingredients used, the less preservatives they put to ensure good quality, so the shorter the shelf life. 6) Kids' Natural Shampoo & Body Wash Mothers, unite with me! We all want to get the job done especially when the house is just messy. I don't know with you but during my twins' shower, I take major attention on the product that I use on them namely body wash and shampoo. I prefer one product that does both functions because I don't like opening two bottles. This product is IT! If you check the US site, they only have the tangerine variant but if you happen to be in the Philippines, you're in for a treat because you can choose variants specific for boys and girls. 7) The Baby Care Trio (oil, wash, lotion) The picture I used below is from the Philippine website because I couldn't find a photo in the US website of the three products. But yes, they're all available for ordering in the US. The baby wash, lotion, and oil are your bestfriends as you start your newborn's journey in the mortal world. I know exactly what I am talking about because this is the trio that my twins used (thank God, I didn't have triplets!) when they were newborns. My top favorite is the baby oil because it's the cure to every baby worry related to skin care that I encountered as a first-time mother. Yes, that includes dry skin, red patches, diaper rash. I swear! I gave up the nappy creams we bought because they didn't work and settled on the healing powers of this organic baby oil. 8) Hand sanitizer My husband still prefers frequent handwashing over any hand sanitizer product. But when you're out and about, it's a challenge to look for a faucet and soap to do the washing. This hand sanitizer saves you the hassle. I use it for myself but I don't think there's any harm to have your toddlers and your older children to use them too. There are also [hand sanitizers for children](http://humanheartnature.com/us/index.php/kids-and-baby/kids-spray-sanitizer-cosmic-clean.html) so be sure to check that out! 9) Smoothing Hair Serum I did say that the sunflower beauty oil (see number 5) can be used as a hair serum too. So why have a separate hair serum product? Because I have long black hair that needs specific attention. I am not always kind to my hair but having the hair serum in our bathroom makes me less guilty. It also offers the best help when you need a quick fix during date nights (which my husband and I have every week) or just for you to look put together even during a regular playdate with the kids of your neighborhood. 10) Hand and Foot Salve Once upon a time I was employed in a job that was ultra stressful that even going to a massage center to get the much-needed back rub was a chore. Then the heavens made this hand and foot salve - and it made me and my equally hand-and-foot-salve addict of a brother totally hooked. We love the strawberry variant but the eucalyptus one is not that bad too! Human Nature is a growing company which takes pride in research and development. They often come out with new and exciting products for you and your family. If you're in the Philippines or the United States (or even the United Arab Emirates), you're blessed! Online shopping makes it possible for these products to be available to you. For those living in other countries - special shoutout to my wonderful Ate Sheila Lehmann who lives in Switzerland - they also offer worldwide deliveries and sends through FedEx International Economy.
