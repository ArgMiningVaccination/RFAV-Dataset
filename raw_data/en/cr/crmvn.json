So many of us deal with pain on a daily basis. Do you want to lose weight? It's such a common goal in various stages of life. If you've been suffering from pain or added weight that is preventing you from leading an active lifestyle, then you'll want to know about homeopathic injections. For pain, it's likely been recommended you take steroids, anti-inflammatory medications or even narcotics. But if you're interested in a natural approach, without side effects, alternatives such as arnica injections and traumeel injections could help you. For weight loss, sometimes to be motivated to work out you need to up your energy. You might find yourself turning to products with caffeinated ingredients but there is a better way. Vitamin B12 injections can help jumpstart your energy which can boost your metabolism without revving you up. Traditional Pain Treatment Side Effects Why consider homeopathic injections? Because of the sometimes-severe side effects of traditional anti-inflammatories. Unfortunately, because pain treatment methods are so readily available, sometimes their side effects are taken for granted. But when used appropriately, going the homeopathic route offers treatment without any side effects. To understand the severity, consider that [steroid side effects](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/4934-steroid-injections/risks--benefits) can include infection, allergic reactions, local bleeding, rupture of a tendon, and skin discoloration. While frequent, repeated steroid injections can cause the bone, ligaments, and tendons to weaken. [Side effects of anti-inflammatory medications](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/11086-non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-medicines-nsaids) also called (NSAIDs) include feeling bloated, gas, heartburn, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, plus you could experience dizziness, lightheadedness, balance problems, difficulty concentrating or headaches from taking NSAIDs as ongoing treatment. As for [narcotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18443635), also known as opioids, they've created a \"well-known phenomenon of psychological addiction.\" Plus, common side effects of opioids include sedation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, physical dependence and respiratory depression. So, what alternatives exist for pain and weight loss? Here are just a few options to consider. How Can Traumeel Injections Help? Traumeel is a safe and natural alternative to cortisone and anti-inflammatory medications like NSAIDs. Since they can help reduce inflammation, it has become quite appealing to athletes as they often need a quick recovery to resolve lingering inflammation. Made up of a natural blend of botanical and mineral extracts, traumeel can be used to treat various types of pain, including inflammation, degenerative processes, bruises, sports injuries, muscular pain, soft-tissue injuries (muscular, tendons, ligaments), arthritis, tendinitis, bursitis as well as minor aches and pains. If you're an athlete or a very active person, using a natural approach with traumeel injections helps your body rebound quickly, so you can get back to the sport and active lifestyle that you enjoy. How Can Arnica Injections Help? You're probably familiar with using arnica on the skin for muscle aches and bruising since it's been used medicinally since the 1500s. What may be new to you, however, is using it as an injectable. When injected, arnica helps stimulate the body's ability to heal. Some have used it as a [replacement for cortisone](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/injectable-arnicathe-new-hydrocortisone-a-new-medical-discovery-175016451.html). Injected arnica can be used for muscle pain and stiffness as well as bruising and swelling due to overexertion. Arnica is also well known for pain caused by osteoarthritis and surgery recovery. How Can Vitamin B12 Injections Help? With highly processed convenience foods so readily available in our food supply, it's not uncommon for people to develop vitamin deficiencies. Especially since malabsorption is often the cause of B12 deficiency, which is directly related to what we eat. It's estimated that some 50% of Americans are deficient in B12. And a deficiency can have significant health implications for multiple body systems. Vitamin B12 is required to synthesize DNA and red blood cells, and it assists in the production of myelin which protects our nerve cells. It is also critical for energy production and metabolism. If you're taking B12 supplements and not feeling any different, it could be a function of malabsorption in your digestion. By using injections you're bypassing the need to digest and absorb them. If you find that you are constantly running low on energy, B12 injections could help you. When it comes to weight loss, you need energy to move your body in order to boost your metabolism. And your metabolism is what runs your vital body functions, including the number of calories that you burn. This makes your metabolism the most important factor when it comes to your weight. Boost energy and you'll boost your metabolism, which can help you lose weight. And B12 injections are a great way to do that.
