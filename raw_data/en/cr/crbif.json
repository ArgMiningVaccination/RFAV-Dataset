What's the difference between a psychologist, a therapist, and a counselor? [Therapists, psychologists, and counselors](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy/psychologist-vs-therapist-vs-counselor)are all licensed mental health professionals. In the US, psychologists have earned a doctoral degree. The terms \"therapist\" and \"counselor\" are used somewhat interchangeably, but generally therapists offer longer-term, mental health care, while counselors offer shorter-term care that may focus on one domain, such as marriage, career, or academic challenges. What type of therapist is right for me? Clients should consider factors such as insurance coverage and their primary reason(s) for seeking therapy to determine the type of professional best suited to their needs. Someone struggling with mental health challenges such as depression or anxiety, for example, may wish to seek out a clinical psychologist or therapist, while someone navigating career obstacles or marital upheaval may benefit from seeing a counselor who can offer short-term, targeted support. Is everyone in the Psychology Today Therapy Directory a licensed therapist?

The [type of therapy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy/therapy-types-and-modalities)best suited to a particular individual depends on several factors, including their primary reason for seeking therapy, their preferred timeline (some therapy types last for a set number of sessions, while others are open-ended), and their personality and preferences\u2014some may prefer a more structured approach. For many individuals, multiple types of therapy could provide a good fit. Is online therapy cheaper than in-person therapy? Many therapists charge the same amount for online therapy as they do for in-person therapy\u2014though clients may still find this cost-effective if it cuts down on their transportation costs. Health insurance plans often offer equivalent coverage for online and in-person therapy; indeed, in many places, they are legally required to do so. Text-based or on-demand therapy apps may be cheaper than traditional one-on-one psychotherapy; however, the practice may be less effective and is not likely to be covered by insurance. "}
