The loss of two key histidine and glutamic acid residues prevented the binding of cofactors zinc and a single water molecule leading to drastic attenuation of native toxicity (unpublished data). Valine was also introduced at position 1 to add amino terminal stability to the recombinant protein. In vivo toxicity testing suggested ciBoNT/D is ~5,000,000 fold less toxic than the native BoNT toxin (unpublished data) and no longer has the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety.

Poster presentation at Toxins 2015 meeting, Lisbon Portugal January 14-17 and at the Interagency Botulism Research Coordinating Committee (IBRCC), Frederick, MD, October 25-28 Botulinum neurotoxin type C atoxic derivative (BoNT/C ad) (effective December 23, 2014) Three mutations were introduced in the light chain construct (E446>A; H449>G; Y591>A) of a modified BoNT/C ad, resulting in a modified protein demonstrated to be significantly less potent or toxic than the wild-type. The three original amino acids (E446; H449; Y591) are conserved among BoNT serotypes and represent part of the catalytic core of the light chain metalloprotease, responsible for cleavage of the substrate(s). Data (unpublished) showed that cleavage of substrates syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 were undetected in neuronal cell based assays, when hippocampal neuronal cultures were exposed to 500 nM BoNT/C ad. The non-catalytic protein was also tested for in vivo toxicity in a mouse bioassay. The LD50 of the BoNT/C ad is > 100 ug/protein per ~20 g mice, which is ~10,000,000-fold more than the LD50 of wild type BoNT/C (data unpublished). Fusion proteins of the heavy-chain domain of BoNT/translocation domain of diphtheria toxin (effective 07-28-2011) Fusion proteins consisting of the heavy-chain domain of BoNT and the translocation domain of diphtheria toxin (no catalytic domain); however, the reconstitution of the BoNT holotoxin would be considered a select toxin.

Recombinant catalytically-inactive botulinum A1 holoprotein (ciBoNT/A1 HP) (effective May 7, 2010) Active site mutations were created at h223>a and h227>a positions, which renders the catalytic domain unable to coordinate the zinc atom needed for catalytic activity, and position e224>a, a mutation which renders the active site unable to bind the water molecule needed for hydrolysis. Full length toxin was confirmed to be catalytically inactive using immunological assays. Purified native BoNT/A1 toxin at 69nM yielded an average specific activity at 15.8 \u00b5mol/min/mg, while the ciBoNT/A1 HP, at the same concentration, failed to produce any detectable SNAP-25 peptide cleavage products. Increasing the ciBoNT/A1 HP concentration from 69nM to 104nM failed to elicit substrate cleavage, indicating the ciBoNT/A1 HP had no detectable proteolytic activity at the levels tested (data not published). The catalytically inactive BoNT/A1 showed no toxicity in mice (data not published).

BoNT protein (BoNT/A1 purified protein (BoNT/A1 atoxic derivative, ad, E224A/Y366A) that has been expressed from recombinant DNA constructs is non-catalytic and non-toxic as a result of a double mutation introduced into the region of the gene encoding the light chain. Recombinant Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (R362A, (R362A, Y365F), termed BoNT/A(RY), is a product of two amino acid substitutions engineered into the light chain of Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A). Arg362Ala (three base substitution) and Tyr365Phe (two base substitution) yields a protein that does not cleave SNAP25 (the mutated toxin is >1000-fold less catalytic than native protein). One microgram of recombinant Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A BoNT/A (RY) is not toxic in the mouse model of BoNT intoxication. Reference(s): - Rossetto O, Caccin available experimental evidence, most known conotoxins (i.e.,\"conopeptides\") do not possess sufficient acute toxicity to pose a significant public health threat, and many are employed as useful research tools or potential human therapeutics. However, currently available data demonstrate that the sub-class of conotoxins generally called \"short, paralytic alpha conotoxins,\" exemplified by -conotoxin GI and -conotoxin MI, do possess sufficient acute toxicity by multiple routes of exposure, biophysical stability, ease of synthesis, and availability. The conotoxins that remain on the HHS list will be limited to the short, paralytic alpha conotoxins containing the following X5 known toxins -MI and -GI (shown above) as well as -GIA, Ac1.1a, -CnIA, -CnIB; - C = Cysteine residues are all present as disulfides, with the 1st and 3rd Cysteine, and the 2nd and 4th Cysteine forming specific disulfide bridges; - X1 = any or Des-X; X2 = Asparagine or Histidine; - P = Proline; - A = Alanine; - G = Glycine; - Des X; - \"Des X\" = \"an amino acid does not have to be present at this position.\" For example if a peptide sequence were XCCHPA then the related peptide CCHPA would be designated as Des-X. The short, paralytic alpha conotoxins containing the following amino sequence X1 CCX2 PACGX3 X4 X5 X 6 CX 7 will be considered a select toxin if the total amount (all forms) under the control of a principal investigator, treating physician or veterinarian, or commercial manufacturer or distributor exceeds 100 mg at any time.

Two additional mutations, L48R and D70R, reduced binding to 1%. The biological activity of the triple mutant in cellular assays was highly attenuated. Human T-cell recognition by the mutant SEA was reduced a million fold (106) in comparison with that by the wild-type SEA. SEB triple mutant (L45R, Y89A, Y94A) (effective: January 16, 2014) Studies of SE type B triple mutant produced in E. coli cells demonstrated a lack of super-antigen activity, using human, primate and pig leukocyte cultures. The results of immunization of non-human primates and pigs with this mutant SEB in research of efficiency of the protein as anti-SEB vaccine confirmed its non-toxic status. The triple mutant of SEB was expressed in transgenic soybean seeds, and lack of toxicity of the soybean-derived mutant SEB was shown. SEC double mutant (N23A and Y94A) (effective: January 16, 2014) Absence of toxicity of a single mutant SE type C (N23 important for binding to TCR had been replaced with A23) and a double mutant SEC (N23 was replaced with A23 and Y94, important for binding to MHC-II, was substituted with A94) was shown in experiments on mice in efficiency studies of these mutants for protection against S. aureus infection.
