Beside, influenza vaccination is the most effective way of influenza prevention. Numerous jobs (including healthcare workers, police officers and house workers) have a risk of occupational exposure to influenza and may transmit the infection to other people and co-workers. The aim is to determine influenza vaccination rates, vaccine effectiveness and factors influencing vaccination decisions. A cross sectional survey was conducted during the influenza vaccination campaigns. The study concerns a representative sample gathering a population of 50,000 workers who belong to a large distribution of occupational branches. Workers were asked to complete, during their occupational medical examination, a brief questionnaire containing a list of reasons for being vaccinated or not and also to get information about flu vaccination effectiveness. Questions included awareness of zoonotic influenza risk in relationship with the working tasks performed. The rate of annual influenza vaccination was quite low for all the workers groups. Education about the risk of flu contamination, in relationship with the characteristic of the jobs was not frequently offered. The main reason given for being vaccinated was selfprotection; one of the most common reasons for not being vaccinated was concern about injection??s sick effects including problems bound to adjuvants. The occupational medical staff failed to influence the decision to be vaccinated against the flu. The low rate of flu vaccination indicates that most of the workers were susceptible to get an infection. Also, international data shows highly variable vaccination rates. The most important tool in making decision about influenza vaccination is the internal communication. This low coverage achieved is an occupational and public health problem. These findings confirm the importance of a comprehensive approach to the influenza vaccination ensuring that workers are correctly informed about the flu vaccine and that it is convenient to receive it.
