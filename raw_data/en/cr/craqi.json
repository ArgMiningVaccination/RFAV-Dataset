Figures should be in limited numbers, with high quality art work and mounted on separate pages. The captions should be placed below. The same data should not be presented in tables, figures and text, simultaneously. Types of papers Research Article Research Articles report on primary research. They must describe significant and original observations. Consideration for publication is based on the article's originality, novelty, and scientific soundness, and the appropriateness of its analysis. Research Articles are reports of original work. Authors are asked to prepare voucher number from an authentic herbarium certainly if they work on a special herb. Prior approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or an Ethics Review Committee is required for all investigations including experimental and human studies. Original researches need to have sections of Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion and Conclusion in the main text. Review Article Review Articles are considered reviews of research or summary articles. They are state-of-the-art papers covering a current topic by experts in the field. They should give evidence on and provide answers to a well-defined aspect or question in a particular area. Review Articles must include a critical discussion of the reported data and give a clear conclusion with potential impacts on the standard of care. The organization and subdivision of review articles can be arranged at the author's discretion. Systematic Review/ Meta-Analysis Systematic Reviews are literature reviews focused on a research question that synthesizes all high-quality research evidence relevant to that question. Systematic Reviews should be presented in the Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion format. The subject must be clearly defined. The objective of a Systematic Review should be arrived at an evidence-based conclusion. The Methods section should give a clear indication of the literature search strategy, data extraction procedure, grading of evidence, and kind of analysis used. We strongly encourage authors to comply with the [Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.](http://www.prisma-statement.org/) Case Reports/ Case Series Case Reports can present a case study, case report, or other description of a case. Case Reports present significant new insights or cases with an unusual and noteworthy course. Submissions can be based on a case or a number of similar cases. The most important aspect of the presentation is that it should provide a new perspective on a recognized clinical scenario or may represent an entirely new clinical condition. The novelty of the case(s) may lie in the phenotype, the presentation, the investigation, and/or the management. We strongly encourage authors to comply with the [CARE guidelines](http://www.care-statement.org/) and upload the filled form. The manuscript must include a statement detailing that written informed consent for publication was obtained and from whom (e.g. \"Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\"). If the patient has died, consent for publication must be obtained from their next of kin. If the patient described in the case report is a minor or vulnerable, then consent for publication must be obtained from the parent/legal guardian. The completed consent form must be made available to the Editor if requested, and will be treated confidentially. Editorial Editorials are discussions related to a specific article or issue written by an editor or other members of the publication staff. Letter to the Editor Letters are encouraged if they directly concern articles recently published in the journal. If accepted, the editors reserve the right to submit such letters to the authors of the articles concerned prior to publication, in order to permit them to respond in the same issue of the journal. In exceptional cases, Letters may also address general subjects related to matters discussed in the journal. The letters should contain no more than 1000 words with up to 10 references and 2 figures and/or tables. They should not be divided into sections. Clinical Trials Reports of randomized clinical trials should present information on all major study elements, including the protocol, assignment of interventions (methods allocation to treatment groups), and the method of masking (blinding), based on the [CONSORT Statement](http://www.consort-statement.org). Clinical trials done in Iran should be registered first via (www.irct.ir/) because no RCT articles are accepted unless it contains the official registered code. History of Medicine Researches in the field of history of medicine, biography of medical scientists, evidence based researches on historical aspects of medicine and roots of traditional approaches of medical sciences are categorized in this type of manuscripts. These studies should contain Introduction, Main Body of the paper (including sections of the results), Discussion and/or Conclusion.
