Examples could include recruitment a ids, extracts from the college or school's catalog, brochures, screenshots from the college or school website; data on student employment after graduation; and curricular outcomes data correlated with admissions data. 2) College or School's Self -Assessment: Use the checklist below to self -assess the program on the requirements of the standard and accompanying guidelines: S N.I. U 16.1. Enrollment management - Student enrollment is managed by college or school administration. Enrollments are in alignment with available physical, educational, financial, faculty, staff, practice site, preceptor, and administrative resources. 16.2. Admission procedures - A duly constituted committee of the college or school has the responsibility and authority for the selection of students to be offered admission. Admission criteria, policies, and procedures are not compromised regardless of the size or qualit y of the applicant pool. 16.3. Program description and quality indicators - The college or school produces and makes available to the public, including prospective students: (1) a complete and accurate description of the professional degree program; (2) the program's current accreditation status; and (3) ACPE -required program performance information including on -time graduation rates and most recent NAPLEX first - attempt pass rates . 3 16.4. Admission criteria - The college or school sets performance expectations for admission tests, evaluations, and interviews used in selecting students who have the potential for success in the professional degree program and the profession. Applicant performance on admission criteria is documented; and the related records are maintained by the college or school as per program/university requirements. 16.5. Admission materials - The college or school produces and makes available to prospective students the criteria, policies, and procedures for admission to the professional degree program. Admission materials clearly state academic expectations, required communication skills, t ypes of personal history disclosures that may be required, and professional and technical standards for graduation. 16.6. Written and oral communication assessment - Written and oral communication skills are assessed in a standardized manner as part of the admission process. 16.7. Candidate interviews - Standardized interviews (in -person, telephonic, and/or computer - facilitated) of applicants are conducted as a part of the admission process to assess affective domain characteristics (i.e., the Personal and Professional Development domain articulated in Standard 4). 16.8. Transfer and waiver policies - A college or school offering multiple professional degree programs, or accepting transfer students from other schools or colleges of pharmacy, establishes and implements policies and procedur es for students who request to transfer credits between programs. Such policies and procedures are based on defensible assessments of course equivalency. A college or school offering multiple pathways to a single degree has policies and procedures for stud ents who wish to change from one pathway to another. 3) College or School's Comments on the Standard: The college or school's descriptive text and supporting evidence should specifically address the following. Use a check to indicate that the topic has been adequately addressed. Use the text box provided to describe: areas of the program that are noteworthy, innovative, or exceed the expectation of the standard; the college or school's self - assessment of its issues and its plans for addressing them, with relevant timelines; findings that highlight areas of concern along with actions or recommendations to address them; and additional actions or strategies to further advance the quality of the program. For plans that have alr eady been initiated to address an issue, the college or school should provide evidence that the plan is working. Wherever possible and applicable, survey data should be broken down by demographic and/or branch/campus/pathway groupings, and comments provided on any notable findings. Admissions and enrollment Information, highlighting how specific requirements of the standards and guidelines are met, including those for early admission agreements or policies, if applicable How admission evaluations of students are documented and how records are maintained. A description of the college or school's recruitment methods A description of methods used to assess verbal and written communication skills of applicants to the program How enrollment is managed in alignment with available physical, financial, staff, faculty, practice site, preceptor and administrative resources How curricular outcomes data are correlated with admissions data The number of transfer students, including (i f applicable) international students or graduates of other professional degree programs admitted with advanced standing, and an assessment of the 4 correlation between the criteria in the transfer policy and success in the program. If applicable, comparativ e performance data should be provided. How the college or school is applying the guidelines for this standard in order to comply with the intent and expectation of the standard Any other notable achievements, innovations or quality improvements Interpreta tion of the data from the applicable AACP standardized survey questions, especially notable differences from national or peer group norms Admission Requirements A complete and accurate description of the professional degree program is included within the Pharmacy School's Handbook and is available to prospective students at https://workspaces.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/pharmacy/documents/Handbook_2018 -2019.pdf . The Director of Outreach and Engagement and the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development (ADSA&FD) regularly represent the program at national and local recruiting fairs. They also attend university -sponsored recruiting events and provide ac ademic interest sessions for prospective students and families. Informally, the staff takes telephone and email inquiries from prospective students who have found our website and are interested in applying to the program. All admissions standards, polici es, and processes ( Appendix 16A) including technical standards ( Appendix 16B) are found in the Student Handbook, the College of Health Professions and School of Pharmacy Policy manual (Appendix 16C ), and re -iterated in supporting documents on the program's webpage @ https://www.ndsu.edu/pharmacy/pharmd/ . This information clearly states academic expectations, required communication skills, types of personal history disclosures that may be required, and professional and technical standards for admission and progression through the program. All admissions informa tion is handled with the same FERPA -compliant procedures and policies that govern the management of all other academic records, and as described in previous standards. Per School of Pharmacy Policy 2.24, program capacity is limited to 85 students per year , and the pharmacy program reserves the right to limit enrollment below this threshold if a quality applicant pool or a paucity of resources are not available to support enrollments. The maximum capacity is based on considerations including, but not limited to, the availability of institutional pharmacy sites, preceptor availability, and human resources. As noted in Appendix 16 D, the Pharmacy Admissions Committee has admitted fewer than 85 qualified applicants to the Doctor of Pharmacy program in each of th e last few years; evidence that admissions decisions are based on the quality of the pool, not filling a pre- defined enrollment target. The School has a transfer policy, which also contains procedures for the transfer process (Appendix 16 E). The policy a lso outlines the procedures used to ensure defensible determinations of course equivalencies. The policy is infrequently used with only 2 transfer students in the past 7 -10 years . The policy also does not typically allow transfer students of any sort, to transfer into NDSU's Doctor of Pharmacy program with advanced standing. Enrollment Management Student enrollment is managed through t he auspices of the CHP and School of Pharmacy Dean's Office. Admission to the NDSU Doctor of Pharmacy program is determined by the Pharmacy Admissions Committee . This committee is chaired by the ADSA&FD , and has representation from both the Department of Pharmacy Practice and t he Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, as well as an external 5 stakeholder (Table 16.1) The current Admissions Committee also has representation from the Office of Experiential Education, which has been very valuable in ensuring that admissions decisions fit with resource constraints (for example, to prevent a mismatch between the number of admitted students and the availability of experiential sites). Table 16.1 School of Pharmacy Policies 2.21 through 2.28 govern the roles, responsibili ties and autonomy of the Committee and Policy 2.23 empowers the Committee to make autonomous decisions and ensures that admissions decisions are not compromised (Appendix 16C ). The Admissions Committee collects, analyzes and interprets a wide array of admissions criteria that indicate the potential for success in the program, including grades in pre-professional coursework, essays, PCAT exam scores (including the writing score and the composite percentile ranking score), critical thinking (Health Sciences Reasoning Test) scores, multiple mini interviews covering 10 -12 \"soft skills\" necessary for success in the program, among other factors. Performance is documented and stored i n the College of Health Professions Deans Office in a manner that is consistent with other student files, as explained in the previous standards. Oral communication skills are assessed through the interview process, as described below. Written communica tion is assessed using the PCAT scored essay as well as grades earned in 100 -level and 300 - level composition courses. One notable improvement in this area is the development of an upper division writing course that is specifically designed for our pharmacy students, and includes both the technical and professional aspects of writing. Examples and course deliverables specifically prepare students for writing in the first professional year in the program Applicants to the professional pharmacy program who m eet our academic standards for admission are interviewed. We utilize multiple -mini -interviews, similar to other ACPE accredited pharmacy programs and medical schools. The interviews are in-person and cover an array of characteristics (self -awareness, conflict management, teamwork, ethics, personal responsibility, etc.) as outlined in standard 4. Quality Assurance The ADSA&FD has recently developed a model that correlates admissions data with success in the first year of the professional program. A desc ription of that model is included with this report (Appendix 16F ). Results indicate that the vast majority of pre -professional admissions criteria correlate significantly with success in the first year of the professional program, although different admis sions requirements correlate differently with different first year professional courses. Thomas Christensen Pharmacist Mark Dewey Pharmacy Practice Daniel Pharmaceutical Sciences Sanku Mallik Pharmaceutical Sciences Jullia Muzzy Williamson Pharmacy Practice Elizabeth Skoy Pharmacy Practice Teri Undem Pharmacy Practice Ross Wilhelm Pharmacy Practice Pharmacy Admission Committee6 Innovations Over the past five years, the number of program applicants has declined. On a percentage basis, the decline is less than the national trends reported by P harmCAS. However, with a small population base, this was concerning to the program. Over the same time frame, our pre- professional curriculum has expanded, especially its chemistry content, which required six , 3 credit didactic chemistry courses to be eligible for admission to the professional program. To market our program, we must offer students 2 year pre-professional curricula (as well as a 3 -year curriculum). The former is where we draw our best applican ts, and it requires students to complete Organic Chemistry 1 and 2 over a single summer session. This is problematic from a student learning perspective. It is also problematic because it became increasingly difficult to ensure that these courses were off ered sequentially at NDSU and surrounding colleges/universities. To address these issues, the Pharmacy Admissions Committee, with the support of the faculty in the School of Pharmacy, made three major changes to its admissions and pre -professional requirem ents: 1. Move applications to PharmCAS to ensure a larger applicant pool. 2. Add an early assurance program - which has been named the Early Admissions Pathway (EAP) - with a streamlined, guaranteed 6 year path to a Doctor of Pharmacy degree. This included bringing some courses \"in house\" including the upper division writing course, the organic chemistry courses and the biochemistry courses, and teaching them \"in house\". To pay for these changes, differential tuition is assessed for the last 5 years of the p rogram (rather than the last 4). Efforts were made to ensure that the financial impact on students was as neutral as possible. 3. Maintain the traditional admissions pathway, but exclusively as a 3 year pre -professional track (7 years to the Pharm.D. on total ). While each pathway has its own interview day, e fforts were made to ensure that learning outcomes (as they relate to pharmacy education) were consistent across the two tracks. People who move off the EAP and other students who do not qualify for the EAP, can still use this path for entry into the last four years of the professional pharmacy program. A notice of substantive change was filed with ACPE. The changes were approved. We were asked by ACPE to continue to monitor these changes to ensure that co nsistency exists across the two tracks. Because this is the first year using both paths, we will continue to monitor and assess students learning as required by ACPE in substantive change letter. The changes made to identify at risk students, and to monit or student progression through the program (as will be explained in the next standard) will be crucial in implementing our monitoring plan for this standard. 4) College or School's Final Self -Evaluation: Self -assess how well the program is in compliance wi th the standard by putting a check in the appropriate box : Compliant Compliant with Monitoring Partially Compliant Non Compliant No factors exist that compromise current compliance; no factors exist that, if not addressed, may compromise future compliance. No factors exist that compromise current compliance; factors exist that, if not addressed, may compromise future compliance /or Factors exist that compromise current Factors exist that compromise current compliance; an appropriate plan exists to address the factors that compromise compliance and it has been initiated; the plan has not been fully implemented Factors exist that compromise current compliance; an appropriate plan to address the factors that compromise compliance does not exist or has not yet been initiated /or 7 compliance; an appropriate plan exists to address the factors that compromise compliance; the plan has been fully implemented; sufficient evidence already exists that the plan is addressing the factors and will bring the program into full compliance. and/or there is not yet sufficient evidence that the plan is addre ssing the factors and will bring the program into compliance.

We are excited th at you are a student in our professional program and I want to provide for you some informa tion that I hope will be of assistance to you during your academic journey with us. A very important person during yo ur time with us is your adviso r. This individual is available to assist you in planning your program o f studies and answer questions ab out future career options. I urge you to meet regularly with your advisor especially if you have any questions, concerns or need help with any academic, College, or campus issues. Faculty and staff are prepared to work with you on an individual basis and help guide y ou through your journey with u s. Additional career information can also be found in our Administrative Offices in Fargo - Sudro 12 3 and by attending our Annual Career Fair in September at the FargoDome. The professional curriculum is designed to challenge you and to teach you to become an independent learner and to work in collaborative interprofessional healthca re teams. Therefore, students are expected to take a very active role in their education and take responsibility for their own learning. Student active learning is a major emphasis of our program. You will be asked to apply your knowledge, dig for the answers to questions, comm unicate both v erbally and in writi ng, critically think and problem-solve through case discussions, practice team-based care with students from other disciplines, and participate in numerous experiential activitie s. I encourage you to ask questions in class and to learn by understanding and applying the material p resented rather than by simply memorizing factual information. The goal of our curriculum is f or you to achieve the necessary life- long learning skills which will bec ome important to you in your future career as a health professional to be able to \"keep up\" with the plethora of new information as sociated with our rapidly changing health care system. Your ultimate su ccess will be determined by the am ount of effort you are willing to put into your academic studies. So work hard and give your best eff ort in all that you do. If you give us your best, you will receive the best in your educational experi ence with us. It will also be important that you learn more than just the tec hnical skills of practicing in your discipline but that you also learn what it means to become a health professional and practice professio nalism in every and all situations. You will need to learn how to practice ethically, responsibly, with honesty, integrity, and good moral character and treating others (e specially your patients) with c ompassion, caring, understanding, and respect which is expected of any health professional. These wil l be the keys to your future success as a health professional. We desire to provide a positive learning environment for all st udents here within the College and we strive to continually improve our program. Students are a very important part of this process and we actively solicit your input and ac tive participation through va rious formats. Students are elected from each class to serve on the Dean's Student Liaison Committee. Th is committee meets with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development throug hout the year to bring student concerns to the att ention of the administr ation. In addition, t he College holds a Deans' Open Forum each semester to allow students an opportunity to interact dire ctly with the Dean (and his administrative leadership team) on matters of interest and conc ern to students. And I also want you to know that my door is always open to you, so pleas e don't hesita te to stop by my office if you need my assistance for anything. We encour age you to use these sources as well as visits with faculty, or any of the members of the staff in our Administrative Offices whene ver you have issues that need to be brought to our attention. In addi tion, I encourage you to becom e actively involved with your profession by joining one of our student pro fessional organizations. This is a great way to learn about what's going on within your profession and begin contributing to the a dvancement of your future professional career and practice. This \"Handbook\" is devoted to academic information to help enha nce student success within our program. We hope you find it helpf ul to you. I wish you much su ccess in your educational pursuits with us and in your later pr ofessional practice. Best wishes to you fo r a successful year! Charles D. Peterson, Pharm.D. Dean, NDSU College of Health Professions 4 GENERAL FAQ AN INFORMAL GUIDE: The following is a series of inform al responses to ques tions most frequently asked about rules and procedures at NDSU. For further information, please refer to the current NDSU Bulletin ( www.ndsu.edu/bulletin/ ), your adviser, Administrative O ffice in Sudro 123, the Office of Registration & Records in Ceres 110, or One Stop in the Memorial Union. ACADEMIC ADVISERS Who is my adviser? Students in the pre-pharmacy and professional pharmacy progra m are assigned an adviser. It is important to m eet with your adviser on a regu lar basis to receive updated curricular information. Advisers help student s learn how to complete the registration procedures. Students are responsible for the course and program selections which they ma ke. However, an adviser is a valuable source for acquiring in formation about the advisabilit y of student choices. (If you desire a change of adviser, please contact the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development, School of Pharmacy, 231-7601.) Do I need to see my adviser about my semester schedule? Yes, make an appointment with your adviser during advising week to plan your schedule of classes. Dates for advising and registration are available on the Office of Regi stration & Records web site ( www.ndsu.edu/registrar ) and \"The Spectrum,\" published twice per w eek when full semester classes are in session. CREDITS How many credits do I need to be a Sophomore, a Junior and a Se nior? You need 27 credits to be classified as a Sophomore, 60 credits to be classified as a Junior, and 90 credits to be classified as a Senior. To graduate, you must successfully complete all g eneral education requirements, the requirements in your major, and with a minimum of 2.0 grade poi nt average. A complete list of University requirements for grad uation is in the current NDSU B ulletin. What is the limit on the number of credits I can take per semes ter? Full-time students will carry from 15 to 19 credits per Semester. Registration for more than 20 credits is not recommended. Special permission from your adviser and a grade point average of at least 3.0 are required to register for more than 20 credits. You mu st obtain a \"Petition to Enrol l in More Than 20 Credits\" form under the link, \"Over 20 Cr edits Petition,\" at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . How many credits will I lose when I transfer to NDSU from anoth er school? O r d i n a r i l y y o u shouldn't lose any. However, a \"D\" grade in any course does no t transfer to the College of Health Professions. Some technical courses may not fit your degree pr ogram and in this case some extra work may be required. For eva luation of transfer credit see cu rrent NDSU Bulletin. How many credits can I transfer from a junior or community coll ege? All college-level credits from regionally accredited institut ions transfer; however, not all may apply to the particular degree program you have selected. To obtain a baccalaureate degree yo u must complete at least 60 semester credits at a four year college or university. At leas t the last 37 of these credits must be at the junior or senior level . (See current Bulletin.) 5 How do I challenge a course? A student who is currently registered may seek credit by chall enging a course. A course challenge usua lly consists of a special com prehensive examination; however, additional types of performance may be required for some course s. A course challenge is only permitted for courses in which t he student has not received tra nsfer credit or has no previous academic record. Prior registrations are allowable if course was dropped prior to the No Record Drop deadline in a given term. Student must be registered at NDSU during the semester in which you wish to challenge a course (see current NDSU Bulletin for complete desc riptions). Procedures for pursuing a course challenge may be found at: www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/regist rar/forms/challenge.pdf Is it possible to obtain college credits by taking examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board (CLEP and AP)? Yes. Students may demonstrat e evidence of college-level achievement through the use of n ationally standardized tests. Competency to write these examinations may have been gained th rough intensive preparation in high school, extensive reading in a particular field, or other types of formal or informal pre paration. A student may not repeat by proficiency testing a course t hat has been previously taken or failed at NDSU or another accredited institution. Score reports must be sent directly to NDSU from the awarding agency/board. School reports and student-issued grade r eports are not considered off icial for purposes of awarding credit by examination. DEGREES (CURRICULUM REQUIREMENT) How do I petition for a waiver or substitution of a curriculum requirement? To petition, you must obtain a \"Request to Waive or Substitute Courses\" form under th e link, \"Substitute/Waive a Course\" at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . In this petition, which is presented to the Academic Affairs Committee of the College of Health Professions, you state exact ly why you think you should have a waiver. The Committee will revi ew your petition and you will b e notified of their dec ision. (Petitions should be submitted onl y when special circum stances make it vir tually impossible for you to meet the regular degree requirements.) Only departmental and college requirements may be waived. University requirements may not be waived. GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS Who must complete the General Education Requirements? The General Education Requirements apply to all students. What are the General Education Requirements? The General Education Requirements are listed in the current NDSU Bulletin. A l ist of the courses approved f or the different categor ies is provided at www.ndsu.edu/regist rar/academics/gened. General Education transfer with the ND University System. Students who plan to transfer from one institution to another in the ND University System should c heck with Office of Registration & Records in Ceres 110 or One Stop in the Memorial Union. GRADES AND ACADEMIC STATUS What is the G.P.A.? Grade Point Average. For each credit of \"A\" you receive four (4) honor points; three (3) for each credit of \"B\"; two (2) for each credit of \"C \"; one (1) for each credit of \"D\"; and zero (0) for each credit taken in which a grade of \"F\" is received. The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of honor points earned at NDSU by the total number of cr edit hours in which honor points were recorded. For example, a person with a G.P.A. of 3.00 has a grade average of \"B.\" The minimum GPA of 2.00 is required for graduation. Developmental courses do not count toward graduation requirements. 6 If I do not do well in a course, may I take it over again? Yes. The second grade, whether higher or lower, will replace the first grade in computing the GPA. B oth grades are listed on your Permanent Record. To replace a grade for a course taken at NDSU, that course MUST be repeated at NDSU. The one exception is that NDSU students may regi ster for a Tri-College course to repeat a course previously taken at NDSU. NOTE: PROFESSIONAL COURSES IN THE PHARMACY PROGRAM - please refer to Policy #3.24, Repetition of Professional Course s, in the College Policy Manual. NOTE: PRE-PHARMACY CORE COURSES, Policy #2.21.1 - The total number of pre-pharmacy core courses which may be repeated shall be lim ited to three. The grade received during the student's final attempt for any core pre-p harmacy course will be us ed in evaluation for admission. A withdrawal is not c onsidered an attempt. A core course is one that is included in the GPA for admission purposes. CURRENT COMPETENCY, Policy #2.28 - Coursework in the areas of science and mat hematics must be no more than seven years old at the time of application to the pr ofessional program. Coursework presented in these areas t hat is older than seven years must have current competency demonstrated.

STUDENT ACADEMIC AND CONDU CT STANDARDS POLICY 3.01 (revised October 31, 2018) Introduction The mission of the NDSU College of Health Professions is to edu cate students and advance research and professional service in pharmacy , nursing, allied sciences, and public health. The College has established professionalism and ethics as two of its core values. Pharmacists, nurses, allied health care professionals, public h ealth professionals, and pharmaceutical scientists must live up to the hi gh ideals of their profession. Their lives must be guided by the principles of honesty and integrity, in order to ensure that the public can r egard their words and actions as unquestionably trustworthy. To develop an understanding of and respect for these principles of honesty and integrity as applied to the academic work of pharmacy, nursing, allied science, and public health students, the College of Health Professions has developed this student conduct policy. This pol icy is applicable to anyone enrolled as a student in the College, including those in the pre-professional , professional, and graduate programs. This policy also applies to any student taking a course for credit i n the College. Acceptance of this policy is required as a condition of admission to the College. Academic Standards The academic standards of the College of Health Professions dif fer from those of the University. Any student who fails to meet or exceed the University standards ma y be placed on University probation or suspension (see the current NDSU Bulletin for university inform ation on academic deficiencies). Semester Grade Point Average (All Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all undergraduate and professional students shall maintain a se mester grade point average of 2.00 or above for each semester enrolled in the College of Health Profe ssions. All graduate students are expected to maintain a 3.0 grade point average as well as any o ther academic policies outlined by the graduate school. Any student who fails to attain a semester GPA of 2.0 or above may be placed on College probation. Students who have been placed on academic probation for two (2) consecutive or three (3) non- consecutive semesters shall be suspended from enrollment in the College. After two suspensions, 20 students will be terminated from the College. (Termination from the College does not prohibit the student from registering elsewhere in the University provided t he academic standards of the alternate college of registration have been met or exceeded.) A student who is suspended and desires readmission into the Col lege m u s t f i l e a r e q u e s t f o r r e - admittance with the Senior Associate Dean at least 60 days prior to the be ginning of the semester in which readmission is sought. In addition, professional students must seek readmission to the professional programs in Pharmacy, Nursing, Allied Sciences, an d Public Health through the Admissions Committee of t heir respective program. Minimum Grade Requirement (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all students enrolled in the professional programs of the Colle ge must complete all required courses within the College with a grade of \"C\" or above. Studen ts are encouraged to refer to program- specific policies related to minimum grade requirements which c an be found in the College Policy Manual at www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions/college_information /policy_manu al/. Graduate students are expected to uphold policies and procedures consistent with the graduate school and to maintain a 3.0 grade point average. Students Enrolled in College Aff iliated Educational Training Pr ograms (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all student s enrolled in College affiliated internships, clinical, or experiential training programs are al so required to uphold the academic standards of that affiliate and will be subject to the terms of probation, suspension, and termination of the affiliated program. Student s failing to meet affiliated pro gram academic standards may also lead to termination from the College. Conduct Standards High standards of professional c onduct are expected from all st udents, both to facilitate the learning of all students and to promote professional values. Individuals are ex pected to represent the College, professional program, or profession in a positive, professional manner. Students conducting clinical experiences, rotations, and/or in ternships must also uphold the specific policies of their clinical site. All students are held responsible for exhibiting the following professional attributes : honesty, integrity, accountability, confidentiality, and professional demeanor. Aca demic dishonesty and professional misconduct are unacceptable. If there is doubt about whether or not academic or professional conduct is appropriate, individuals should query the Dean's Office. Examples of unprofessional conduc t include, but are not limited to, the following: Academic Misconduct: 1. Cheating, includes but is not limited to, the following: a.

Reporting Process Academic Misconduct 1. Students are required to report any academic misconduct to t he Senior Associate Dean within 7 days of the occurrence. Failure of the student to report violat ions within the required time could result in immediate expulsion from the College and/or its progr ams. Graduate students must also report to the Department Chai r of the graduate program. 2. The course instructor who suspects that academic misconduct has occurred in their course or other instructional context has an initial responsibility to: a ) inform the student(s) involved of his/her suspicion and the suspicion's grounds; b) allow a fair opportun ity for the student to respond; and c) make a fair and reasonable judgment as to whether any academic misconduct occurred. 3.

A copy of the Student Academic Misconduct Tracking Form will be placed in the student's academic file. Professional Misconduct 1. Professional misconduct issues may be more likely to happen outside of the classroom and have broader implications for the well-being of students, faculty, a nd staff in the College. Hence, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development has the initial and primary responsibility for administeri ng and enforcing professional mis conduct issues. 2. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Developme nt will work collaboratively with the Department Chair (and where appropriate, individual instructors ) to resolve professional misconduct issues.

Incomplete Disciplinary Process Students with pending disciplinary or legal actions, with sanct ions for which an appeal has been submitted but not resolved, or whose sanc tions have not been successfully fulfilled, will not be allowed to graduate from NDSU with a degree, major, or program of study offered by the College of Health Professions. In such cases, the College reserves the right to place a hold on a stud ent's graduation until the case has been successfully resolve d and the sanctions hav e been successfully fulfilled. 24 Annual Pledge, FERPA Not ification, and Signature I have read and understand the above policy. I agree to accept and abide by this Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy of the College of Health Professions. I understand that possible violations of this policy and sanctions imposed, as well as information used to su bstantiate violations (including, but not limited to, criminal background ch ecks and drug screens), may b e shared with College affiliated educational training programs, clinical sites at which I may complete progr am-specific experiential requirements, licensing and/or certification boards relevant to my program of study, clinical sites at which I work for non- academic reasons (i.e., for pay or to volunteer), and other fac ulty, staff or administrators within the College of Health Professions and North Dakota State University who hav e a legitimate interest in my education. I understand that I have the right to revoke the College of Healt h Professions' ability to share this information at any time. Should I revoke the ability of the College of Hea lth Professions to share relevant information with the aforementioned parties, I also understand that I am im mediately ineligible to complete a degree offered within the College of Health Professions, and I volunta rily (and immediately) withdraw from my major or program of study within the College. I understand that withd rawing from a major or program of study within the College of Health Professions does not prevent me fr om pursuing another major at North Dakota State University. I am also awa re of and assume responsibility for following other College and Department policies as stated in my major or program of study's student ha ndbook. STUDENT COMPLAINT POLICY 3.28 The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), at the behest of the U.S. Secretary of Education, requires all accredit ed pharmacy programs to establi sh, implement and assess a formal complaint policy for students. Mor e specifically, all accredit ed colleges or schools of pharmacy must establish a comprehens ive policy with a sim ple set of procedure s whereby all students enrolled in the College (and the pharmacy program in particular) can submit and resolve a complaint about the educational process. While such procedures do not always produ ce an outcome that meets the student's preferences, they do ensure that students have access to an equitable and efficient means to remediate their complaints. The complete set of ACPE standa rds regarding student complaint policies can be found on pages 38-39 (Standar d 20) of the follo wing The NDSU College of Health Profe ssions takes student complaints very seriously. Our goal is to ensure that students have access to transparent, due process in a manner that leads to an appropriate resolution of the complaint. To that end, a copy of the NDSU C ollege of Health Professions policy relating to this issue is available on its website at www.ndsu.edu/heal thprofessions . Students who have difficulty accessing this webpage may also obtain a copy o f the complaint policy in the Dean's Office (Sudro Hall 123). A discussion of this policy shall tak e place annually during the orientation process for first profe ssional year students. Each student complaint will be appropriately documented and inv estigated. A chronological record of each complaint, including the nature of the complaint, written records of the complaint procedure and the final outcomes of the resolution process shall be maintaine d in the Office of the Dean of the School of Pharmacy, and shall be available for review by ACPE or its r epresentatives upon wr itten request or in the process of an on-si te evaluation visit. Student complaints generally fall within two major categories: complaints about unfair grading and all other, non-grade-related complain ts. Student complaints about grades are generally handled at the level of the University, since grades are usually administered through the NDSU Office of Registration and Records. Other student complaints remain under the purview of the individual colleges within NDSU. 25 Student Complaints Regarding Grades University Grade Appeal Policy 337 NDSU has an establis hed policy regarding complaints about gradi ng, otherwise known as \"grade appeals\". The full grade appeal policy, which includes hearing procedures, is available at www.ndsu.edu/fileadm in/policy/337.pdf . While students actively considering a grade appeal are referred to the aforementioned we bsite for the s pecific details of the policy, a summary of the policy is outlined below. With the exception of i ncomplete grades, a course grade is cons idered final unless an appropriate appeal is filed by the student. Gr ade changes are also consider ed only for those students who have not yet earned a degree for whic h the course in question was ap plied. For a student who has reason to believe that they have been iss ued an incorrect or inappropriate grade, he/she must initiate a request for a change of a grade w ith the instructor within fifteen (15) instructional days of the first day of the semester immediately following the semester in which the grade was awarded. For Spring Semester courses, the request may be made within fifteen (15) instructional days of the start of Fall Semester. A grade appeal is formally initi ated when the student presents the Grade Appeal Form to the instructor. If there is an unsatisfactory dec ision, the student must consul t the Department Head, and the Dean or a designated college committee, p roceeding from one level to th e next only after an unsatisfactory decision of the conflic t at that level. In the event that the i nstructor is also t he Department Head or Dean, he or she need onl y be consulted in t he capacity of instr uctor. In the event of an unsatisfactory decision within the college, the student may submit a formal wr itten appeal to the Grade Appeals Board Chair. Such an appeal shall be m ade within fifteen (15) instruc tional days after conclusion of the college proceedings a s stated above. Non-Grade Student Complaints Pre-professional and professional pharmacy students who have a non-grade-related complaint can seek resolution of t hat complaint through the following procedu res. It is important to note that these procedures represent the sole av enue for student complaints reg arding non-grade-related issues, including (but not limited to) ACPE standards, policies and pro cedures. Additionally, because the pharmacy program spans multiple departments, the non-grade comp laints are handled through the Dean's Office, rather than by the departments themselves. 1. The student(s) or, in cases where student anonymity is requ ired, their advocate (also known as the \"plaintiff(s)\") will file a formal written complaint (de livered through the postal service or NDSU email) to the Dean's Office in the NDSU College of Health Professions. 2. The written complaint must include a description of the pol icy, procedure or ACPE standard in question. It must also summarize the argument of the plaint iff (including the grounds for the appeal or complaint) and provide a reasonable amount of evi dence supporting the claim. 3. Upon receipt of the written complaint, the complaint will b e assigned to either the Senior Associate Dean (as the Chair of the College Academic Affairs Co mmittee) if the complaint is primarily academic in nature, or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development (as the Chair of the College Student Affairs Commit tee) if the complaint is primarily non-academic. The plai ntiff(s) will receive email no tification (via NDSU email) within forty-eight hours of the receipt of the complaint concerning th e identity of the Associate Dean handling the complaint. 4. The Senior Associate Dean (or, if a non-academic issue, Ass ociate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development) shall c onvene a meeting of College Acade mic (or, if a non-academic issue, Student) Affairs Committ ee to review the complaint. Bec ause the procedures for both Associate Deans and Committees are similar in procedure, they w ill henceforth be referred to generically as \"Associate Dean \" and \"Committee\", respectivel y. The Committee meeting shall occur within thirty days from the time that the Associate Dean receives the written complaint. 26 5. Once the Committee has met, t he Associate Dean shall prepar e and submit a formal, written reply to the student(s) based on the recommendation of Committe e. The reply shall include an evaluation of the complaint, a description of any violations , and a proposal for any necessary corrective action. The reply will be sent through off icial NDSU delivery methods (i.e., the postal service, campus mail and/or the NDSU email sy stem) within fifteen business days from the time that the Co mmittee makes a decision. 6. Decisions of the Committee t hat demonstrate arbitrary and c apricious treatment, or that are fundamentally inappropriate in the eyes of the plaintiff(s) may be appealed to the Dean of NDSU College of Health Professions. In such cases, the student (s) file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed directly to the Dean. The written complaint would also identify and pro vide evidence indicating that the Associate Dean and/or the Comm ittee acted in an arbitrary, capricious or otherwise inappropriate manner. 7. If unsatisfactory resolution occurs after the appeal to the Dean, a final appeal may be made to the Provost. Once again, the student(s) must file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed directly to the Provost, rather than the Dean, and would provide evidence substantiating the claim of unfair treatment at prior procedural levels. STUDENT TECHNICAL STANDA RDS (PHARM.D) POLICY 3.29 The North Dakota State Univers ity College of Health Professions ' mission is to educate students and advance research and professional service in pharmacy, nursing, allied sciences, and public health. As a corollary to this mission, t he Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D .) program seeks to train students who have the ability, interest and work ethic necessary to be eligi ble for licensure, and embark upon a successful career as a health care professional. Thus, the Phar m.D. professional program requires students to undertake the full set of activities that are necessary to complete their program of study. The goal of every licensed pha rmacist is to provide safe and effective care to patients. In order to provide that care, individuals mu st have the physical, cognitiv e and social skills necessary to learn, practice and master each of the competencies of one's professio n. Failure to demonstrate these competencies not only endangers the patients under the pharmaci st's care, but also impacts the ability of other providers to provide sa fe and effective patient care. Therefore, the following techni cal standards represent competen cies necessary to complete the Pharm.D. professional program and provides additional guidance to the College Student Technical Standards Policy 3.11 for students. Students must be able, with or without reasonable accommodations, to consistently demonstrate these competencies. Students who fail to demonstrate these competencies are ineligib le for admission or progression in the NDSU Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) professional program. The technical standard compete ncies are organized into five general categories: 1. Perception/observation 2. Communication 3. Motor/tactile function 4. Intellectual, conceptual, int egrative, and quantitative abil ities 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes 1. Perception/Observation Competencies Students must be able to utilize their senses and mental abilit ies to perceive and observe information presented through: Written material Audiovisual material Demonstration Large-group lectures Small group discussi ons and presentations One-on-one interactions 27 Laboratory experiences Patient encounters (at a d istance or close at hand) Procedures 2. Communication Competencies Students must be able to communi cate effectively and efficientl y (in English) using nonverbal, verbal, and writing st rategies with faculty members, other members of the healthcare team, patients, familie s, and other students, in ord er to: Produce written and or al communication Elicit information Convey information Clarify information Create rapport Work collaboratively Develop therapeut ic relationships Demonstrate com puter literacy 3. Motor/Tactile Function Competencies Students must have sufficient mot or function, skills, and tacti le ability to execute basic tasks in the training and provisi on of patient care. This inclu des coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equ ilibrium, and functional use of the senses o f touch and vision in order to: Attend and pa rticipate in classes, groups , and activities which are part of the curriculum. Conduct basic laboratory procedures and tests. Perform basic, non-sterile compounding. Demonstrate as eptic technique. Examine patients (including in spection, auscultation, palpati on, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers). Administer immunizations, perfo rm cardiopulmonary resuscitati on, perform palpitation, auscultation, and percussion. Provide patient care appropr iate to the circumstances. Perform in a reasonably indepen dent way in potentially high s peed/high demand/emergency en vironments. 4. Intellectual, Conceptual, Inte grative & Quantitative Compete ncies: Student must be able to demonstrat e higher-level cognitive abil ities, which include: Memory Rational thought Visual-spatial comprehension Conceptualization Application Measurement Calculation Analysis Representation (oral, written , diagrammatic, three dimensiona l) Organization Synthesis Clinical reasoning Ethical reasoning 5. Behavioral and Social Competencies Students must consistent ly demonstrate attributes of profession alism, including: Empathy, compassion, integrit y, and respect for others. Preparation, initiative, and a ccountability cons istent with a commitment to excellence. Commitment to legal and ethical principles pertaining to the provision of patient centered care. Mindfulness of the environment, recognizing that one's profes sionalism is constantly evaluated by others. 28 Reasonable Accommodations under th e Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) The College strongly encourages a ny student who suspects that h e or she may have a disability to contact the NDSU Office of Dis ability Services for guidance con cerning the steps that are necessary to document and verify the nature and extent of the disability. Consistent with NDSU and Federal policies, students with document ed evidence of disabilities may request reasonable accommodations. However, such requests are not r easonable if they disrupt, are detrimental to and/or endanger patients, students, co-workers and/ or instructors, or otherwise cause a fundamental a lteration to the program. Failing to Meet, Reporting and Ad judicating Technical Competenc ies Applicants and students of the P harmacy Doctorate professional program who consistently fail to demonstrate the competencies ident ified above are ineligible fo r admission or progression in the program. Students who are admitted to the Pharmacy Doctorate pr ofessional program and who realize (either through their own effort s or as demonstrated by a licen sing board, a preceptor or a faculty member in the program) that they do not (or no longer) consistently demonstrate the requisite technical competencies to be e ligible for licensure have an eth ical obligation to self-report that information to the College's administration (i.e., the appropri ate department chair, t he Senior Associate Dean and/or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs). Once realized (through own awareness or as reported to them by a licensing boar d, faculty, or preceptor), failure to self-report a consistent lack of technical competencies represent s a violation of the Student Co nduct Policy (College Policy Manual, Policy 3.01). SUBSTANCE MISUSE TESTING POLICY 3.14 The NDSU College of Health Professions is committed to ensuring safe, healthy learning environments, including both dida ctic and experiential learning environments, for all of its students. The use of illicit drugs, as well as the overt misuse of alcoho l and/or legally prescribed medications (including, but not l imited to, mood altering medications) comp romise learning environments and are prohibited under College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy an d University Policy 155. It is beneficial for all College of Health Profe ssions stakeholders (including i ts students, faculty, staf f, clinical partners, and the patients and families we se rve) to establish a testing policy process to ensure the safety and health of these learning enviro nments, as well as to ensure an equitable due process for students who are alleged to partake i n substance misuse. Basis for Testing The College of Health Professions reserves the right to require any student enrolled in one of its pre- professional or professional programs and/or enrolled in any co urse housed within the College to undergo testing for substance mi suse. All testing is coordinate d and monitored through the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development (ADSAFD). All testing must be direct observation, 10 panel (or higher) tests, and must be conducted at a WADA-accredited or SAMHSA- certified laboratory. Per Co llege Policy 3.12: Student File Con tents, all test results shall be maintained in a secure location in the Offi ce of the ADSAFD, and may be in cluded in the Student's Personal File. The default method of analysis w ill be urinalysis, although the ADSAFD reserves the right to require alternative methods of analysis ( for example, blood analysis or hair analysis) where appropriate. Alternative methods (if requi red) will be disclosed in writing when notifying the st udent about the need to be tested. Nonrandom Testing Nonrandom testing for substance misuse may occur as a requireme nt for entry into clinical sites (per site policies or program-specif ic experiential education polici es), or to fulfill the requirements of sanctions imposed und er College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Po licy. Reasonable Suspicion Testing Incidents or events involving sus pected substance misuse by stu dents shall be reported to the ADSAFD using the Reasonable Susp icion Reporting Form. Reasonabl e suspicion shall be determined using objective evidence (photos , legal documents, or other doc umentation), reports made by credible sources (law enforcement, clin ical site staff, NDSU faculty and staff, etc.), or a combination of these sources. Because it is a violat ion of University Policy 155 and College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct 29 Policy to misuse alcohol or pre scription medications, or to use illicit drugs, and te sting may exonerate the student of an alleged policy violation should the allegatio n be made falsely, the ADSAFD may exercise discretion in determining what evidence is of sufficie nt credibility to require testing. A descriptive summary of the evidence will be provided to the stu dent at the time the student is informed of the need to submit to testing. Random Testing The College of Health Professions may implement a random substa nce misuse testing program. Should a random subst ance misuse testing pr ogram be implemented , the parameters of the program must be made freely available on the College of Health Professi on's website, and students must be provided notice of the policy at l east 6 months prior to its im plementation. No more than 5 percent of the active College of Health Pr ofessions student body may be ra ndomly selected for testing in any academic semester. No student will be randomly identified for t esting more than once in a single academic year. The random selecti on of students will be impleme nted using a computer generated random number generating process, with interval (or other non-w eighted) sampling. A summary of that selection process shall be provided to the Dean of the Col lege of Health Professions on an annual basis. Testing Process Students who are required to und ergo testing will be notified i n writing via NDSU email. Upon receiving a request for testing, students ar e responsible for providing a 10 (or larger) panel, direct observation, drug screen from a reputable, appr opriated licensed vendor with in 12 business hours of the date and time of the request. The student i dentified for testing is sole ly responsible for obtaining his/her own appointment for testing, his/her transportation to the appointm ent, and paying the costs of these tests. An original copy of the test results must be delivered to the O ffice of the ADSAFD at the end of the 12 business hour window. Test result s that show evidence of a dilu ted sample will not be accepted, and will not result in additional time in which to submit test resu lts. Ramifications for Positive Test Results or Failure to Test in a Timely Manner Students whose test results are positive are subject to sanctio ns outlined in College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Once sanc tions are assigned, a student' s rights of due process are also outlined in College Policy 3. 01: Student Conduct Policy. Students who fail to submit an original copy of their test resu lts within the 12 business hour window face additional sanctions under C ollege Policy 3.01: Student Co nduct Policy. More specifically, students who fail to provide the r equired test results within t he 12 business hour window will be sanctioned under the pres umption that the test results for the substance misuse in question are positive. Testing Alternatives Students whose religious, cultural or other practices prohibit them from undergoing a specific type of drug test may request that the ADSAFD require an alternative te st, so long as the alternative test is of equal or greater accuracy and prec ision than the original test required by the ADSAFD. All parameters identified previously apply to t he alternative test. In the eve nt that no such test exists, or in the event that students are unable to jus tify the need for an alternative test, students may be found in violation of College Policy 3.11: S tudent Technical Standards. TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENT S FOR PHARMACY STUDENTS Students are required to purchase an iPad for use in the classr oom, Thrifty White Concept Lab, and experiential rotation sites. The Pharmacy program endorses a full size iPad that has 32 GB o r higher based upon the amount of memory, sharpness of display, a nd speed. However, students may choose any current iPad version and size, including previous iP ads (5, 6, Air or Pro) since Apple has a consistent operating system between devices so that older devices are still compatible when upgrades are made. When making your choice, keep in mind that t he iPad will be utilized for a variety of applications incl uding note taking and for testing; the iPad mini may not be an optimal choice for all formats. 30 Other devices, such as smartphon es, android tablets, and/or lap tops cannot be substituted for the iPad requirement. It is import ant to keep the technology consis tent in the learning environment so that all students have the same learning experience. Even though oth er devices can do some of the same things an iPad can do, all of t hese devices operate off differe nt platforms. Not all educational apps will work on all platforms and some devices (e.g. smart phone) are n ot appropriate for some apps (exams). Lastly, apps are designed to work on tablets, not laptops. If y ou have already purchased a device other than an Apple iPad it may be possible to sell it on Craig slist, eBay, or Amazon so that you may recoup some of your investment. We highly recommend that iPads be purchased through the NDSU Bo okstore. Exclusive arrangements have been made with the NDSU Bookstore to allow st udents the ability to charge the iPad to their student account. For students with financial aid, the charge will be subtracted from your aid. The NDSU Bookstore has know ledgeable staff including: Brad Sonmor, Dept. Manager, and Justin Hills, Certified Apple Technici an. Finally, Bookstore personnel will assist students with any service issues for all iPads purchased fr om them. Options to purchasing a less expensive iPad include buying a \"refurbished\" iPad through the online Apple store or purchasi ng one through Craigslist, eBay, or Amazon. It is recommended that students also purchase the AppleCare+ Wa rranty. The cost of the warranty is $69 - $129 for two (2) years and provides technical support and repairs, including coverage for up to two (2) incidents of accidental damage (such as dropping it) . See http://store.apple.com/us/pro duct/S4689LL/A/applecare-for-ipad for more information. (Note: If your parents purchase this device fo r you, their homeowners insuranc e may cover the iPad, minus the cost of the deductible, in the event i t is stolen. You will need to keep track of the device ID in order to report it.) The AppleCare+ Warranty c an be purchased fr om the Bookstor e. Again, the NDSU Bookstore will assist students with service i ssues if the iPad was bought from them. Students have also found that pur chasing an external keyboard i s advantageous for taking notes in class. There are several to choos e from, some of which are desc ribed in this article: https://www.digitaltrends.com /mobile/best-ipad-keyboards/ . Lastly, a word about iPad Apps. In itially, you will \"need\" only a few Apps, many which are free. At the minimum, you will need: An App to take notes in class on your iPad. The iPad comes loa ded with \"Notes\", which is basically a blank legal pad you c an take notes on. Newer versio ns of the iPad come with \"Pages\", Apple's version of Word . NDSU students can also downlo ad Microsoft Office on their iPads for FREE! Check the following for details: https://www.ndsu.edu/its/software/ software_licensing_program/mi crosoft/office_proplus/ If you want to take notes on a course handout that you've down loaded, \"iAnnotate\" is a fantastic App and wort h the $9.99. Another note taking App that is cheaper is Notability for $9.99 that is a white board applic ation for drawing, writing, a nd note-taking. \"Adobe Reader\" view PDF doc uments and also p rovides annotat ion options-FREE Some textbooks are available as downloads on t he iPad as a Kin dle, iBook, &/or Nook and you will find electronic books are cheaper than the hardcover n ew edition. Typically, the Kindle version is the most ec onomical of the three listed. You will need to install the \"Kindle\" App-FREE Blackboard - FREE - and Yuga App which is a lso FREE to be able to access these sites directly without having to go through Safari. High Point Mobile Campus Connection - FREE - https://m.cnd.ndus.edu .

Student Bl ackBoard organization in the 'iPad Apps. See the short \"How- to' Videos\" folder under Student Resources. TERMINATION - RIGHT TO TERMI NATE ENROLLMENT POLICY 3.03 The College of Health Professions reserves the right to termina te the enrollment of any student at any time, if the student demonstrates that he or she is unsuited fo r a professional career and its inherent responsibilities and obligations. Circumstances that may lead t o student termination will include, but not be limited to, violation of sta te or federal statutes or re gulations. TUITION In 2012 the North Dakota Board of Higher Education approved a d ifferential tuition for the pharmacy professional program which is higher than the standard universi ty tuition rate. Differential tuition is needed to cover the higher costs associated with a professional degree program. This differential tuition does not include other s tudent fees, room and boards, a nd miscellaneous expenses. As noted earlier, students are expected to complete certain degree requi rements including Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience (I PPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Pract ice Experience (APPE) during summer months in addition to the regular academic year. Startin g with the fall 2013 semester, students should expect to be charged (and t o pay) differential tuition o n course credits for all professional program degree requirements regardless of the term in which cre dits are earned. The amount of differential tuition in an ac ademic term can be found on the ND SU Financial Aid and Scholarships website: www.ndsu.edu/onest op/accounts/ .There is a non-refundable admission deposit fee of $500 for students who have been accepted to the pharmacy program. T his fee is to assure their place in the class and will be applied to the differential tuition for t he first semester of the professional program. 32 NDSU ENTRY-LEVEL PHARM.

To enter the pre- pharmacy program the student must qualify for and obtain admiss ion to the University. Applications to NDSU may be obtained from t he NDSU Office of Admission. Admission to the professional phar macy program is competitive a nd limited to 85 students each year. Students are selected based upon successful prior academic performance at the time of admission. There are two paths to gain admission into the pharmacy program . New Early Admission Pathway (EAP) to the Professional Entry-Lev el Pharm.D. Program The first is our \"early admissi on\" path. This path is designed for high achieving high school students who seek an expedited path to the professional program. Student s are selected for this path based on their academic credentials (incl uding high school grade point a verages and ACT or SAT scores) at the time they apply to NDSU. Prefer ence is given to North Dakota re sidents. Supplemental applications are submitted online directly to the Pharmacy Admissions Commit tee. A nonrefundable $125.00 application fee must accompany the supplemental application. St udents are evaluated during the summer before they enroll at NDS U as first year students, and w ill be offered admission to this path on or before May 15 of that year . Once accepted on this admissi on path, students must attend NDSU for the entire six-year program . The first year entails standard pre-professional studies. At the conclusion of the first year, st udents who maintain academic an d professional requirements transition into a five-year professional program. During the first year i n the professional program, students complete all remaining pre-prof essional requirements, including an expedited set of courses that prepare them for the final four years of the professional progr am. Students also complete the Pharmacy College Admissions Test (PCAT) and an on-site interview. Transition into the final four years of the professional program is guaranteed as long as stud ents meet all academic and professional requirements. Students accepted into the \"early ad missions\" path, but who fail to meet all academic and professional requi rements, are encouraged to a pply to the professional program through the second path described below. Traditional Admission Pathway to the Professional Entry-Level P harm.D. Program The second path is our \"traditi onal\" path. Pre-pharmacy student s (including transfer students) typically apply for admission to the four-year professional program durin g the second (or in some cases the third) pre-pharmacy year. Admission to the professional pharma cy program is competitive and limited to the difference between the numbe r of available seats (85) an d the number of \"early admission\" students entering the final four years of the professional program each year. Students are selected based upon successful pre-pharmacy academic performance. Prefer ence is given to North Dakota residents and students who attend NDS U. A cumulative grade poin t average of 3.0 (4.0 = A) or above is required before an applicant will be evaluated for admission to the professional program. The actual admission cutoff is much higher. The Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) is an admission requirement. Students must take t he PCAT during the July or Sep tember testing dates. An on-site interview is part of the admission process for the professional program. Supplemental applications are due on or before December 31 for subsequent fall semester admis sion. Supplemental applications are submitted online directly to the Pharmacy Admissions Commit tee. A nonrefundable $125.00 application fee must accompany the supplemental application. Applicants should note that admission to the University does not grant admission to the Entry Level Pharm.D. Program. All students mu st apply and be formally acce pted by the Pharmacy Admission Committee of the School of Pharmacy before they may begin the professional courses in the four years of the pharmacy program. 35 Students may apply to the School of Pharmacy for admission into the Professional Pharmacy program upon satisfactory completion of t he pre-pharmacy program or evi dence that this program will be successfully completed at either NDSU or another accredited col lege prior to admission. Students not previously enrolled at NDSU must apply both to NDSU (with a NDSU Application for Admission) and to the School of Pharmacy (wi th the Supplemental Pharmacy A pplication form). Applications will be reviewed by the Pharmacy Admission Committ ee, which is composed of administrators, pharmacy practit ioners, and pharmacy faculty in the basic, administrative and clinical sciences. The size of each entering professional class is limit ed by the availability of the resources of the School of Pharmacy and the c apacity of the c linical facilit ies. NDSU is a state supported institution, thus, residents of North Dakota will be given primary considera tion. Residents from other states who attend NDSU full time will also be given partial residency pref erence. A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (4.0=A) or above is required before an applicant will be evaluated for admission to the Professional Entry Level Pharm.D. Program.

Applications submitted after De cember 31 will be used to fill r emaining spots in the professional program if any are available after evaluating thos e applications submitted prior to the December 31 deadline. 2. APPLICATION FEE - All PharmCAS fees must be paid before your application will be processed. A $125.00 non-refund able application fee is required for admission. 3. If the applicant is not a current or former NDSU student, se parate application must be made for admission to NDSU through the NDSU Office of Admission. 4. Official transcripts from all universities and colleges atte nded must be sent to the NDSU Office of Admission AND to the College of Health Professions. The tra nscripts must contain the winter quarter or fall semester grades. Students must show transcr ipt evidence that all coursework required by the en d of the spring term (courses listed by name and number) will be completed by the end of spring term. The applicant must also supply official transcripts of spring term. It is the respons ibility of the applicant to dete rmine that all transcripts and other application materials (supplement al applications and completed PCAT scores) are submitted and updated if incomplete transcrip ts are initially submitted. a. Note: NDSU students not enrolled in the pre-pharmacy major must contact the Office of Registration & Records to request their transcripts be forwarded to the School of Pharmacy. 5. The Pharmacy College Admissi on Test (PCAT) is required. Com pleted scores must be sent to the Chair of the Pharmacy Adm ission Committee. For informat ion on the PCAT, contact us at 701-231-7601. The School of Pharmacy requires that students take the PCAT in July, September, October or November 2018 as their most recent exam. We will accept PCAT scores back three years (July 2015 to November 2018). The web address for the PCAT is www.pcatweb.info . 6. All courses must be completed with at least a grade of \"C.\" Selected core courses, indicated by an asterisk (*) must be completed by the end of fall semeste r prior to the December 31 deadline date to apply to the pharmacy program. Remaining cour ses, which are required and listed in the pre-pharmacy curricu lum, MUST be completed by the end of spring term. The only exceptions are the elective s which may be completed during the summer (up to six credits). 7. An interview on campus is par t of the evaluation process for students who receive final consideration for admission. 36 Notification of Acceptance 1. Applicants are notif ied of their acceptanc e as rapidly as ad mission decisions are made. 2. Acceptance Deposit: Applicants who are offered a position i nto the entry-level Professional Pharm.D. program are required to submit a non-refundable deposi t fee of $500.00 to the School of Pharmacy to assure a p lace in the class. This deposi t is typically due within 30 days of receipt of an admission lette r. This fee will be applied to the differential tuition for the first semester of the professional program. 3. Differential Tuition. In 2012 the North Dakota Board of High er Education approved a differential tuition for the pharmacy professional program which is higher t han the standard university tuition rate. Differential tuition is needed to cover the highe r costs associated with a professional degree program. This differential tuition does not include other student fees, room and boards, and miscellaneous expens es. As noted earlier, stude nts are expected to complete certain degree requirements including Introductory Pharmacy Pra ctice Experience (IPPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) during summer mont hs in addition to the regular academic year. Starting with the fall 2013 semester, st udents should expect to be charged (and to pay) differential tuition on course credits for all professional program degree requirements regardless of the term in which credits are earned . The amount of differential tuition in an academic term c an be found on the NDSU Financial Aid and Scholarships website: www.ndsu.edu/ones top/accounts/ . 4. An additional $100 fee is required. It will be applied to t he first year annual fee for registration as a Pharmacy Student Intern in N orth Dakota, with the North Da kota Board of Pharmacy. Note: this $100 annual fee for licensure as a student intern is required by the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy for four years of enrollment in the professio nal program. Once a student is accepted into the professional pharmacy program, he or she i s expected to continuously hold a valid North Dakota Pharmacy Intern license for the entir ety of their professional program. Reapplication A student who has made application to the professional program but is not accepted, who fails to enroll after being accepted or who was uns uccessful in the Early Admis sions Pathway program (EAP), may reapply for admission to the professional program. Students are allowed to apply to the program twice (including the EAP). Regardless of whether or not a student mee ts the eligibility r equirements, once a student pays the pharmacy applicat ion fee, that application off icially counts toward the limit of two attempts. All academic and admission requirements in force at t he time of his/her reapplication must be met. PLEASE NOTE The faculty reserve the right to change rules and regulations i ncluding those relating to admission, instruction and graduation. Su ch changes may apply to prospect ive students, as well as students already enrolled. Changes will be shared with students in a ti mely manner. However, it is the responsibility of the student to periodically contact their adv iser or the Dean's Office to obtain current policies.

An essentia l first step is the est ablishment of a patient- pharmacist relationship that s upports engagement and effective communication with pat ients, families, and caregivers throughout the proce ss. In addition, at the core of the process, pharmacists continually collaborate, document, and communi cate with physicians, other p harmacists, and other health care professionals in the provision o f safe, effective, and coordina ted care. This process is enhanced through the use of interoperable informati on technology sys tems that facili tate efficient and effective communication among all individuals involved in patient care. (Figure 1). Using principles of evidence- based practice, pharmacists: A. Collect The pharmacist assures the collect ion of necessary subjective a nd objective informati on about the patient in order to understand the relevan t medical/medication history and clinical status of the patient. Information may be gathered and verified from multiple sources including ex isting patient records , the patient, and other health care professionals. This process includes collecting: A current medication list and m edication use history for pres cription and nonprescription medications, herbal products, and other dietary supplements Relevant health data that may include medical history, health and wellness information, biometric testresults, and physica l assessment findings Patient lifestyle habits, pre ferences and beliefs, health and functional goals, and socioeconomic factors that affect access to medications and other aspects of care 58 B. Assess The pharmacist assesses the info rmation collect ed and analyzes the clinical effects of the patient's therapy in the context of the patient's overall health goals in order t o identify and prioritize problems and achieve optimal care. This proc ess includes assessing: Each medication for appropriat eness, effectiv eness, safety, a nd patient adherence Health and functional status, r isk factors, health data, cult ural factors, health lit eracy, and access to medications or other aspects of care Immunization status and the need for preventive care and othe r health care services, where appropriate C. Plan The pharmacist develops an indi vidualized pati ent-centered care plan, in collaboration with other health care professionals and the patient or ca regiver that is evidence-bas ed and cost-effective. Thi s process includes establishing a care plan that: Addresses medication-related problems and optimizes medicatio n therapy Sets goals of therapy for achiev ing clinical outcomes in the context of the patient's o verall health care goals and access to care Engages the patient th rough education, em powerment, and self- management Supports care continuity, inc luding follow-up and transitions of care as appropriate D. Implement The pharmacist implements the ca re plan in collaboration with o ther health care professionals and the patient or caregiver. During the process of implementing the ca re plan, the pharmacist: Addresses medication- and he alth-related problems and engages in preventive care strategies, including vaccine administration Initiates, modifies, discont inues, or administers medication therapy as authorized Provides education and self-management tr aining to the patien t or caregiver Contributes to coordination of c are, including the referral o r transition of the patient to another health care professional Schedules follow-up care as needed to achieve goals of therap y E. Follow-up: Monitor and Evaluate The pharmacist monitors and eval uates the effectiveness of the care plan and modifies the plan in collaboration with other health c are professionals and the pati ent or caregiver as needed. This process includes the continuous monito ring and evaluation of: Medication appropriateness, e ffectiveness, and safety and pat ient adherence through available health data, biometric test results, and patient feedback Clinical endpoints that contri bute to the patient's overall h ealth Outcomes of care, including pr ogress toward or the achievemen t of goals of therapy Information from PHARMACISTS' PATIENT CARE PROCESS MAY 29, 2014 59 NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY PROFESSIONAL PHARM ACY CURRICULUM (PRE-REQS) 2019/2020 Note: An additional 6 credits of Professional Electives MUST be completed PRIOR to P4 Year P1 (39 credits) FALL 2019 C r SPRING 2020 C r Micr 470, Basic Immunology 3 PSci 369, Pharmaceutics tical Biotechnology PSci 412, Chemotherapeutic Agents (Oncology/ID) (PSCI 411) 3 PSci 411, Principles of Dynamics 3 PSci 470, Pharmacokinetics (PSCI 3 Phrm Phrm Pathophysiology II 350, Introduction to Pharmacy Prax 2 Phrm 351L, Pharmacy Practice Lab I 2 Phrm 352, Introduction to Healthcar e Systems 2 Phrm 480, Drug Literature Evaluation 3 TOTAL 18 TOTAL 18 SUMMER 2019 - Phrm 355, Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experien ce (IPPE) I , 120 hours = 3 cr. * (All P1 classes) P2 (38 credits) FALL 2019 C r SPRING 2020 C r PSci 413, Endocrine/Resp/GI Dynamics (PHRM 340, 341, Interprofessional Health Care Practice (PHRM 355) 3 PSci 414, Cardiovascular Dynamics (PHRM 340, 3 (PHRM 340, Phrm Top Hematology and Oncology (PSCI 410, PSCI 412) 3 TOTAL 17 TOTAL 17 SUMMER 2019 - Phrm 455, IPPE II, 160 hours = 4 cr. * (P1 course work + PHRM 400, 450, 452L, & 565) P3 (30 credits) FALL 2019 C r SPRING 2020 C r Phrm 475, Pharmacy Man agement (PHRM 350, 352, 452L) (PHRM 532, 537, 538) 3 500, Top II (PHRM 400) 1 Phrm 552L, Pharmacy Pra ctice (PSCI PSCI 536, Mgmt (PHRM 475, PHRM 480) 2 Phrm 537, Renal, Fluid & Ele ctrolytes (PSCI 414) 2 Phrm 572, Pharmacy Law and Ethics (PHRM 350, 352, 452L) 3 Phrm 540, Public Health (PHRM 352) 3 Phrm Pharmacotherapy ractice Lab III (PHRM 452L) 2 TOTAL 18 TOTAL 15 P-4 (40 credits) 40 W eek Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE), Phrm 581 through 589, Rotations 1 through 9.

Cody Wiberg, Pharm.D ., Executive Director Minnesota State Board of Pharmacy 2829 SE University Ave., Suite 530 Minneapolis GRADUATE RESIDENCY FAQS What is a Pharmacy Residency? A pharmacy residency is an organi zed, mentored, post-graduate t raining program. Typically, a residency is completed directly after graduating from a Doctor of Pharmacy p rogram. However, some may choose to complete residency after prac ticing as a licensed pharmacist fo r a few years. What will I learn in a residency program? You will learn the k nowledge and gain the experience required o f pharmacists in various areas of practice, allowing you to further refine your clinical skills and bring y our pharmacy-based problem solving abilities to a higher level. You will have the opportunity to learn from pharm acists who are experts in their area of pharmacy, many of which have achieved addi tional board certifications. Why should I do a residency? This is an opportunity to bridge the gap between being a pharma cy student one day, and the next day being a licensed pharmacist. You will hav e the opportunity to fortify your strengths, strengthen your weaknesses, and develop confidence in your abilities as an individual pharm acist. Other benefits include a competitive advantage in the job market, networking opportunities, career p lanning, and attendance/part icipation at local and national meetings. M any clinical positions are now requirin g a residency. What is the duration of residency program? Each residency is typically one year. They start July 1 and con clude June 30 each year. Some residencies are offered in combination with a postgraduate degree (M.S., MB A). There are also some combination programs allowing you to complete both a PGY-1 and PGY-2 progra m over the course of 2 years. Additionally, there are non-traditional program s, where a pharmacist may comp lete their PGY-1 residency over two years. Are all residency programs the same? No. The type of residency you select will depend on your career objectives. Select a program that will prepare you for the type of job you event ually want to have. Some PGY-1 programs allow you to focus your residency based on your interest. In some ca ses, an individual may procee d with a second year of training to obtain this specialized experience. Examples of current residency types inc lude: PGY-1 (\"Pharmacy Practice\" or \"General\") Pediatrics Psychiatry Ambulatory Care Infectious Diseases Oncology Pharmacy Management Managed Care Critical Care Are residencies only for hospital-based programs? No. There are many ambulatory bas ed programs. In fact, these pr ograms are among the fastest growing type. Additionally, there are community pharmacy based programs. Do I get paid during this program? Yes. Most residencies pay roughl y $40,000-$45,000 for the year. Some programs allow the opportunity to pick-up extra pharmacist shifts to earn extra pay. Most program s offer fringe benefits (e.g. health care, investment opportunities, etc.). Also, you may be eligible for deferring payment on your student loans during the program. 63 I'm not sure what type of progr am is right for me. What do you suggest? The most common type of residenc y is a PGY-1 (\"Pharmacy Practic e\" or \"General\") residency. It covers a broad spectrum of practice ar eas and patient types. Required ex periences include acute care, ambulatory care, drug information, and practice management. In addition to these \"core\" elements, each program has various specialty areas to comp lete the training experience. Al so, a research project (in collaboration with one of your preceptors) is completed during the residency year. Som e programs include teaching/precepting opportunities in cooperation with an affiliated college of phar macy. Finally, programs have various service (\"staffing\") requirements. Typica lly, staffing requires functio ning as a pharmacist during evening and/or weekend hours. How do I apply for a residency program? PGY-1 and PGY-2 residencies (ASHP-accredited) require participa tion in the residency-matching program. This is a formal process that a ttempts to match applicants to t heir choice of programs and vice versa. Programs that are in the process of rec eiving accreditation may also par ticipate in the residency-matching program. Check with the individual program s to verify their accreditatio n, and match parti cipation status. To participate in the Match for a position designated as a PGY- 2 residency, an applicant must have already completed a PGY-1 residency, or currently be in training in a P GY-1 residency program that will be completed before the start of t he PGY-2 residency. Current PGY-1 residents who are interested in continuing their training in a PGY-2 residency offered by the same sponsor as the applicant's P GY-1 residency (e.g., the same or an affiliated organization) may be able to obtain the position through an Early Commitment Process. App licants who are committed to a position in this manner do not need to register for or participate in the M atch. After I complete this residenc y experience, what is next? You will have an advantage over man y of your peers regarding em ployment opportunities. More \"doors\" will be open to you, and you will have more freedom in your career c hoice. Many employers value residency- trained pharmacists, and some jobs require residency experience . Graduates of residency programs go on to the following: pharmacist posit ions (staff, specialist, manager , etc.) in their area of tra ining, faculty positions, specialty residency programs , or fellowship programs. How do I find out more about residency programs and where they are located? Here are a few good resources: https://www.ashp.org/Pr ofessional-Development/Residency-Informa tion, college's direc tors, and ASHP's Midyear Clinical Meeting, which showcases virtually all of the ASHP-accredited programs.

Public health is defined as the pr actice of helping members of society live healthier, longer lives. More specifically, public health focuses on improving the general he alth of communities through efforts to monitor the spread of diseases, initiati ves (both clinical and policy-o riented) to prevent diseas e and disability, and by promoting healthy lifestyles th rough education and community en gagement. Public health is both an art and a science. It is practiced by int er-professional teams whose me mbers' training spans a wide array of academic and vocational fields. Of particular importance to public health in our state is deter mining how to meet the challenges of change and diversity within rural areas. R ural health solutions are essen tial to the well-being of North Dakota and to other areas of the nation and the world. North Dakota is an ideal loc ation for rural public health research in addition to the application of practical s olutions to health improvement for rural communities. Public health is an interdisciplinary field; it is common for many people to gain c ompetencies and/or training in a related field (medicine, nursing, pharmacy, bus iness, engineering, etc.) and subsequently move into public health as a matter of vocation or occupati on. The MPH degree is uniquely de signed to accommodate the needs to these individuals. It blends theory and pr actical knowledge across a wide array of disciplines, and is the \"degree of choice\" among practiti oners in the field. There are three specializations t o choose from within the MPH d egree at NDSU. The specializations of Community Health Sciences or the Management of Infe ctious Diseases are the most suitable for most pharmacists, as they prepare health professionals to integrate public health initiatives and policies within traditional medical models. It is designed to provide pharmacis ts and other health professionals with a better understanding of their diverse roles in public health. For more information on the NDSU MPH program you can visit www.ndsu.edu/publichealth or contact the Academic Coordinator/Lecturer, Ste fanie Meyer, at Stefanie.meye r@ndsu.edu. PHARM.D./MPH DUAL DEGREE OPTION The Master of Public Health (MPH) offers diverse tracks in public health that build upon the stre ngths of campus to meet the practical needs of the public and health car e practitioners who serve it. Specializations at NDSU include community health sci ences, management of infectiou s diseases, and American Indian public health. The MPH degree consists of 42 cr edits and can be completed in t wo years as a full time graduate student. Pharm.D. students are abl e to complete a Pharm.D./MPH dual degree in as little as one extra year of study. Pharm.D. students who are in good academic standing a re eligible to apply for the Pharm.D./MPH program through the graduate school during their P2 year. Why Public Health? Practitioners in our region hav e limited opportunities for adva nced, practical public heal th training that focuses on the unique challenges facing this largely rural area that en compasses North Dakota and other Northern Plains states. There are many u nderserved populations living in the region that would benefit from expanded public health interventions. Fo r example, the American Indian c ommunities have typically been underserved and significant health disparities between this population and others have resulted. Overall, there is much to be gained from greater collaboration within the Northern Great Plains, and the education of public health professionals is a natural start ing point to facilitate that co llaboration. 68 Is the MPH accredited? Yes. T he Council on Education for Publ ic Health (CEPH) at its October 6-7, 2016, meeting acted to accredit the Master of Public Health Program at North Dakota State Universit y for a five-year term, extending to December 31, 2021. What are the admission requireme nts for the Pharm.D./MPH dual d egree? You must be enrolled in the Phar m.D. program and in good academ ic standing. In additi on to graduate school requirements (with the exception of the GRE; the PCAT score can be used inst ead for Pharm.D. students), the MPH Admissions Committee may invite selected applicants for an interview. How do I apply to the Pharm.D./MPH dual degree? You apply online during the spring semester of your P2 year thr ough the Graduate School at http://ndusndsugrad.askadmissions.n et/emtinterestpage.aspx?ip=a pplication and choose \"Public Health.\" If you are a P1 student and wish to get started early, apply onlin e at the above website but choose \"Non-Degree\" in the drop down box during the spring semester of your P1 year . This will allow you to take PHRM 632 for Graduate credit. Up to nine grad uate credits can be taken as a non-degree student. When can I start the MPH program? Applications are reviewed each year beginning March through May for a fall semester start. You may also take up to nine graduate credits as a non-degree seeking student wit h permission of the instructor. How much does it cost for MPH courses? Tuition and fees for MPH coursework can be found here: www.ndsu.edu/onestop/a ccounts/tuition/gra duate_tuition_fall_201 scholarships available? Yes. Scripts Sc holars Program offers scholarships for P harm.D. dual degree students. The program provides four (4) $10,000 scholar ships nationally each year to enrolled dual degree students. The awarded students are given $2,500 per semes ter for four consecutive sem esters, totaling $10,000 over two years. For application instructi ons, please contact: ExpressScriptsScholars@aacp.org . The College of Health Professions has a limited number of schol arships and awards available for assistance to students. Applications for scholarships and awards are avai lable February 1 of each calendar year on the college web page, www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions . Deadlines vary. NOTE: Specific information related to criteria for selection of scho larship recipients is available in the Office of Development in Sudro Hall 120. When are MPH courses offered? MPH core courses are generally offered in the evening to accomm odate students who work. These courses are only offered in the Fall and Spring semesters. There are no summer core courses, although the MPH practicum may be completed during summer. Current students are encouraged to talk with their faculty advisors for the most up -to-date information on course offerings. Does the MPH program accommodate distance learners? MPH students can take their courses on campus at NDSU or off -campus through live video broadcasts of classes (IVN). Since I will not enroll in Phrm 555 IPPE III or Phrm 552L in th e P3/Public Health year, do I still need to complete the required online tr ainings (e.g. HIPAA, HIPAA Secur ity, NDSU P reventing Methamphetamine Abuse , etc.)? Yes. You will still need to compl ete the required trainings in the fall of your P3/Public Health year. In addition, you will need to be registered as a Pharmacy Intern in the stat e of North Dakota. 69 Can I take courses in more than one area of specialization? Yes, there is a list of electiv es in each specialization that a re available to all MPH students. You are welcome to take additional credits if you are interested. Can I change to a different specialization track after starting the MPH program? Yes. You must be in good academic standing within the MPH progr am and the admissions committee for the specialization you wish to enter must agree that your backgroun d is sufficient for the transition. Contact the Academic Coordinator/Lect urer if interested. Where can I do my Practicum? Can the Practicum be done in anoth er country? NDMPH has secured Practicum affi liation agreements with local, national, and global sites in public health. Students can also request a Practicum site without an existing affiliation agreement, but this must be done a minimum of 6 months in advance of the Practicum start date to e nsure that a working agreement can be established. Practicums can be d one in other countries as long as an acceptable agreement can be established beforehand. What are the hardware and software requirements for off -campus students? The ability of a student to succ eed in a distanc e education cla ss depends on his or her ability to understand both the course structure and the associated technology. Inform ing students of what skills and technology are needed for distanc e education allows t hem the opportunity t o self-evaluate their capability to succeed in the course. At the time of admission to the program, students are required to ensure that their computers meet the minimum hardware and software re quirements described below. Reg istration for the c ourse constitutes the student's understanding and acceptance of the requirements nece ssary to participate in the course.

DUAL DEGREE OPTION Purpose The entry level curriculum leading to the Pharm.D. degree requi res a minimum of six years of study. Up to 76 semester hours are required in the pre-professional curriculum. Admission to the professional program is competitive, based upon successful pre-pharmacy academic perfor mance and available positions in each class. After successful completion of 76 semester hours, interviews, a nd the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT), students are admitted to a fou r-year professional program. The Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, one of six academic departments of the College of Health Professions, subscribes to the missions of the College and of N orth Dakota State University in the provision of Teaching, Research, and Service. T he Department provides instru ction in disciplines applicable to science. The faculty design and conduct research in the natural and biologic al sciences, as well as mentor graduate and Professional students in advanc ed concepts of pharmaceutical sc ience and in the process of scientific inquiry. NDSU offers both the MS and Ph.D. degrees in Pharmaceutical Sci ences. The graduate program emphasizes both research and teaching excellence. The doctor of philosophy degr ee is awarded in recognition of high scholarly achievement as evidenced by a per iod of successful study, the s atisfactory completion of examinations and the development of an acceptable dissertation project covering some significant aspect of a major field of learning and research. After successful completion of a Ph.D. degree program , students have had a high level of success gaining highly desirable employment i n academia, industry and governmen tal agencies. The dual program (Pharm.D./Ph.D.) is designed to provide an opp ortunity for outstanding pr ofessional students in the Pharmacy Program at North Dakota State University obtain re search experience and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. It is proposed that this can be accomplished with an additional three years of study and research placed between the second and the third years of the four-year professional pr ogram. It is believed that the combinat ion of the Pharm.D. and Ph.D. d egrees will greatly enhance the student's research background, critical thinking skills, and marketability for lea dership positions within t he profession of Pharmacy in academic, government, and industrial environments. Summer Research Experience During the summer between the P1 and P2 years, up to six studen ts per year will be allowed into an introductory research experience phase of the Pharm.D./Ph.D. program and wil l spend twelve weeks rotating throughout these three research laboratories. A summer stipend will be provided for each participating student in return for a 20 hour/week commitment (These funds are to be obtained from the C ollege's differential tuition funds). Admission Students in the Doctor of Pharmacy program will make an applica tion to the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences by December 20h at the end of the fall term of their second year (P2) in the p rogram for acceptance into the Pharm.D./Ph.D. program. T hey should have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above. At the same time, an application to the graduate school should also be made. The GRE should als o be taken by the end of this semester. Pharm.D./Ph.D. applications will be considered by the Departmen t as for all graduate students. Course requirements during the professional program The Pharm.D. curriculum is unchanged. In the fall semester of the P1 year, a faculty member(s) will make the students aware of the Pharm.D./P h.D. option, and briefly outlin e the program. 76 The Ph.D. Graduate Dissertat ion Years (i.e. G1, G2, G3) Students will receive a monthly stipend, and tuition waiver dur ing Ph.D. graduate year 1 (G1), year 2 (G2) and year 3 (G3). For this time period the students are full-time gradua te students in the Department, subject to the same expectations (e.g. seminar participation, 6 credits of PSCI 790 , year-round study, etc.). D uring the three graduate years, the students will be required to complete STAT 725 (3 c r), BIOC 701 (4 cr) and BIOC 702 (4 cr). In addition, if interested, students may take other 700-level courses availa ble in the department and university. Thus by the end of G3, the students will have a mi nimum of (12 cr) 600-level an d (up to 21 cr) 700-level didactic credits. At the end of three graduate years, students would be able to write disser tation and pass the final thesis examination. In addition to didactic credits, students will take 1 credit Semin ar (PSCI 790) in the fall and the Spring semesters of each of the three graduate years. Students will also be require d to take 60 thesis research credits (PSCI 799) during three graduate years. NOTE: Professional pharmacy students who are enrolled as a full or part time student at NDSU, and who are pursuing a joint degree with the Doctor of Pharmacy program , must complete all required pharmacy training as required by the Doctor of Pharmacy program (includi ng, but not limited to, training on HIPAA & Privacy, HIPAA & Security, Blood-borne Pathogens, Preventing Me dicare Fraud, Waste and Abuse, and Combating Methamphetamine Abuse) regardless of whether they are completing pharmacy academic or experiential credits in a given semester. These trainings are r equired until such time as the student graduates with a Doctor of Pharm acy degree or officially dis-en rolls in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. The Clinical Years (P3 & P4) For the final two years of the professional program, dual degre e students will receive a waiver of NDSU base tuition and pharmacy differential tuiti on. No changes in the didactic coursework of the P3 y ear are proposed. Program requirements for the participants Once accepted into the dual degree program (i.e. the G1 year an d beyond), the student is considered to be a full- time graduate student in the Department of Pharmaceutical Scien ces. They must maintain a GPA of 3.0 or above. Ph.D. Summary: 12 credits of 600 and at least 18 out of 21 suggested credits o f 700=30 didactic credits, with 6 credits seminar and 60 credits dissertation gives a total of 96 graduate credits. Up to 12 credits of 600 level courses can be used for the Pharm.D. P3 and P4 years will remain as it is in the traditional Pharm.D . program. Suggested Course Schedule for Pharm. D. /Ph.D. Students P-1 Year: It would remain the same. In summer, students are required to do a research rotation in three laboratories. Please contact the Department of Pharmaceutical S ciences (231-7661) for details. P-2 Year: It would remain G-1 Year: BIOC 701 (4 cr), BIOC 702 (4 cr), 725 (3 cr), PSCI 790 ( 2 cr), PSCI 799 (15 cr), PSCI cr), PSCI 670 (3 cr) G-2 Year: PSCI 790 (2 cr), PSCI 799 (25 cr), and at least any two of th e following 3 credit courses: PSCI 612/613/614/615 G-3 Year: PSCI cr) P-3 and P-4 Years: Unchanged Students interested in pursuing this option need to see Dr. Sin gh, the Chairman of Pharmaceutical Sciences, to begin the process. His office i s located in Sudro Hall 136. 77 PHARMACY STUDENT ACTIVITIES & ORGANIZATIONS The American Pharmaceutical Association-Academy of Students of Pharmacy (APhA-ASP) The mission of the American Pharmacist Association Academy of S tudent Pharmacist (APhA-ASP) is to be the collective voice of student phar macists, to provide opportuniti es for professional growth, to improve patient care, and to envision and advance the future of pharmacy.

We try to achieve this by being actively involved in community affairs, university affairs, and the College of Health Professions. Throughout our history, the Beta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Psi has maintained a stout brotherhood founded on industry, sobriety, fellowship, and high ideals. Our chapter ha s been involved in many community service events including volunteering for Bet hany Homes, the New Life Center, the American Diabetes Association, t he Ronald McDonald house, the A rthritis Foundation, Dor othy Day Food Pantry. We also provide a monthly meal a long with a blood pressure scre ening at low income hous ing in West Fargo. We consistently earn the highest cum ulative all-Greek GPA. We spo nsor an annual Homecoming pig roast, a faculty appreciation dinner, a Spring Formal, and other social activiti es. We are also active on the local, regional, and national levels of Kappa Psi. Kappa Psi was founded in May 1879 at the Russell Military Acade my in New Haven, Connec ticut. Initially, it was a medical pharmaceutical fraternity and continued as such until 1 924. At that time, by mutual agreement, the members of both professions decided to separate into two distin ct groups. The medical group became Theta Kappa Psi and the Pharmacy group became Kappa Psi. Our chapter was f ounded April 25, 1924 and was one of the 27 founding chapters of Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity. Our chapter became co-ed in 1998. We continue to thrive on the North Dakota State campus as a source of brotherh ood for pharmacy students.

Native American Professional Program (NAPP) To address the critical shortage of Native American pharmacists in the United States, the College initiated NAPP (then known as the Native American Pharmacy Program) in Septemb er 1987. The program was designed to recruit and facilitate the entry of Native American students into the C ollege and provide them with counseling and retention services to increase their c hances for academic success. In 2009, NAPP members transformed t he program into a student or ganization and made it inclusive of all the majors within the College, thus changing the name from Native American Pharmacy Program to Native American Professional Programs. NAPP meets monthly to discuss a variety of topics related to th e knowledge and skills needed to pursue degrees offered by the College of Health Professions at NDSU. Counselin g and tutorial services for students, financial aid and scholarship information, and internship and future career o pportunities also are presented. The NDSU National Community Phar macists Association Student Cha pter (NCPA) NCPA is a national organization representing independent commun ity pharmacy practice. In 1987, the national office began a student outreach program that has founded studen t chapters in 41 colleges of pharmacy across the nation. The mission of the NCPA st udent outreach program is to foster entrepreneurial sp irit in pharmacy students and introduce them to opportunities in independent pharmacy pra ctice and ownership. 79 Established at NDSU in April 2000, the NCPA Student Chapter pro vides a forum for students to learn about the many career options available in independent community practice . The objectives of the chapter are to promote the profession of pharmacy and the role of independent pharmacy in the health care system, and to maintain and expand educational programs and st rengthen student members' pro fessional, business, and leadership abilities. Goals of the chapter are to sponsor pharmacists involved in an innovative practice to speak at meetings, start a management/ownership workshop for students interested in owning their own pharmacy, participate in service activities to the community, and to send students to the NCPA A nnual Convention in October of each year. Benefits of membership in the student chapter include a variety of scholarships, low interest student loans, and a student publication called The New Independent in addition to the national journal America's Pharmacist.

As a corollary to this mission, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program seeks to train students who have the ability, interest and work ethic necessary to be eligible for licensure, and embark upon a successful career as a health care professional. Thus, the Pharm.D. professional program requires students to undertake the full set of activities that are necessary to complete their program of study. The goal of every licensed pharmacist is to provide safeand effectivecare to patients. In order to provide that care, individuals must have the physical, cognitive and social skills necessary to learn, practice and master each of the competencies of one's profession. Failure to demonstrate these competencies not only endangers the patients under the pharmacist's care, but also impacts the ability of other providers to provide safe and effective patient care. Therefore, the following technical standards represent competencies necessary to complete the Pharm.D. professional program and provides additional guidance to the College Student Technical Standards Policy 3.11 for students. Students must be able, with or without reasonable accommodations, to consistently demonstrate these competencies. Students who fail to demonstrate these competencies are ineligible for admission or progression in the NDSU Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) professional program. The technical standard competencies are organized into five general categories: 1. Perception/observation 2. Communication 3. Motor/tactile function 4. Intellectual, conceptual,integrative, and quantitative abilities 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes 1. Perception/Observation Competencies Students must be able to utilize their senses and mental abilities to perceive and observe information presented through: Written material Audiovisual material Demonstration Large-group lectures Small group discussions and presentations One-on-one interactions Laboratory experiences Patient encounters (at a distance or close at hand) ProceduresAPPENDIX 16B2. Communication Competencies Students must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently (in English) using nonverbal, verbal, and writing strategies with faculty members, other members of the healthcare team, patients, families, and other students, in order to: Produce written and oral communication Elicit information Convey information Clarify information Create rapport Work collaboratively Develop therapeutic relationships Demonstrate computer literacy 3. Motor/Tactile Function Competencies Students must have sufficient motor function, skills, andtactile ability to execute basic tasks in the training and provision of patient care. This includes coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision in order to: Attend and participate in classes, groups, and activities which are part of the curriculum. Conduct basic laboratory procedures and tests. Perform basic, non-sterile compounding. Demonstrate aseptic technique. Examine patients (including inspection, auscultation, palpation, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers). Administer immunizations, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, perform palpitation, auscultation, and percussion. Provide patient care appropriate to the circumstances. Perform in a reasonably independent way in potentially high speed/high demand/emergency environments. 4. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative & Quantitative Competencies: Student must be able to demonstrate higher-level cognitive abilities, which include: Memory Rational thought Visual-spatial comprehension Conceptualization Application Measurement Calculation Analysis Representation (oral, written, diagrammatic, three dimensional) Organization Synthesis Clinical reasoning Ethical reasoning5. Behavioral and Social Competencies Students must consistently demonstrate attributes of professionalism, including: Empathy, compassion, integrity, and respect for others. Preparation, initiative, and accountability consistent with a commitment to excellence Commitment to legal and ethical principles pertaining to the provision of patient centered care. Mindfulness of the environment, recognizing that one's professionalism is constantly evaluated by others. Reasonable Accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) The College strongly encourages any student who suspects that he or she may have a disability to contact the NDSU Office of Disability Services for guidance concerning the steps that are necessary to document and verify the nature and extent of the disability. Consistent with NDSU and Federal policies, students with documented evidence of disabilities may request reasonable accommodations. However, such requests are not reasonable if they disrupt, are detrimental to and/or endanger patients, students, co-workers and/or instructors, or otherwise cause a fundamental alteration to the program. Failing to Meet, Reporting and Adjudicating Technical Competencies Applicants and students of the Pharmacy Doctorate professional program who consistently fail to demonstrate the competencies identified above are ineligible for admission or progression in the program. Students who are admitted to the Pharmacy Doctorate professional program and who realize(either through their own efforts or as demonstrated by a licensing board, a preceptor or a faculty member in the program) that they do not (or no longer) consistently demonstrate the requisite technical competencies to be eligible for licensure have an ethical obligation to self-report that information to the College's administration (i.e., the appropriate department chair, the Senior Associate Dean and/or the Associate Dean for Student Affairsand Faculty Development). Once realized (through own awareness or as reported to them by a licensing board, faculty, or preceptor), failure to self-report a consistent lack of technical competencies represents a violation of the Student Conduct Policy (College Policy Manual, Policy 3.01).

Any individual seeking to transfer into NDSU's Pharm. D. Program must follow t he procedures outlined below. 1. Students must currently be enroll ed in an ACPE-accredited Pharm. D. Program. Student s enrolled in non-pharmacy degree programs, or those enrolled in bachelor or masters-level pharmacy programs (ACPE-accredited or otherwise) are not eligible to transfer into NDSU's Pharm.D. Program. Those students must apply directly to the entry leve l Pharm.D. Program us ing the NDSU Pharm.D. Supplemental Application. 2. The student must submit a formal application to both North Dakota State University, and be accepted to study at the University. Applicat ions to the University as a whol e must be completed according to the guidelines established by the Un iversity (www.ndsu.edu/admission). 3. Students accepted to study at NDSU may subsequently submit a formal transfer request to the NDSU College of Health Professions, Pharmacy Admissions Committee. A formal request will contain (at a minimum) the following information: i) A formal letter or equivalent written stat ement outlining the reasons for requesting the transfer; ii) Documented evidence from the st udent's current institution (typically a formal letter on university letterhead written by the Dean of t he current institution) demonstrating that the student is currently in good ac ademic and professional standing; iii) Documented evidence (including, but not limited to include official transcripts of all college work including pharmacy transcrip ts, PCAT scores and three lette rs of evaluation/reference from faculty members of a professional pharmacy program) that the student meets all admission requirements for NDSU's Pharm.D. Program. 4. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee will review transfer applications twice per year.

St udents intending to transfer and begin classes in the spring semester must submit the entirety of their application materi als by October 15 of the preceding semester/calendar year. 5. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee will conven e to evaluate completed transfer applications within 30 days of the application deadline in question. If, upon review of the application materials, the Pharmacy Admissions Committee believes t hat the student's application merits further consideration, the Admissions Committee will schedule an interview with the applicant. The interview will be conducted within 45 days of the applicat ion deadline in question. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee may exercise discretion in choosin g the medium (in-person, telephone, video- conferencing, etc.) for, and t he content of, the interview. 6. All decisions on transfer applications are made excl usively by the Pharmacy Admissions Committee. Decisions will be based on factor s which include, but are not lim ited to: the student's academic record, an evaluation of the circ umstances leading to the transfe r request, the student's performance during the interview (if granted by the Pharmacy Admissions Committee), available space in the Pharm.D. Program, and the admi ssion standards currently used to evaluate traditional Pharm.D. applicants. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee will generally not accept transfer applicants whose credentials fall substantially below those of the 85 students admitted to th e entry-level Pharm.D. Program in the previous year. The Pharmacy Ad missions Committee will generally not admit any transfer students if such admissions increase cl ass sizes beyond the maximum capacity identified under College Policy 2.24. 7. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Facult y Development (who serves as Chair of the Pharmacy Admissions Committee) will notify the student in writing within 60 days of the application deadline regarding the outcome of the application. 8. In the event that the students request for a transfer is grant ed, the Pharmacy Admissions Committee will forward the student's academic transcript and contact information to the Senior Associate Dean. The Senior Associate Dean will review the student's transcript and co llect other relevant information in order to assess whether (and if so, how mu ch) credit may be granted for courses which are applicable to the courses outlined in the curri culum of the NDSU Pharmacy Program. This assessment will be completed at leas t one week prior to the start of the semester in which the student is set authorized to attend classes. Students should be aware that not al l ACPE-accredited Pharm.D. Progr ams have the same curricula. As a result, student should antici pate that some courses may not transfer and/or that remedial coursework may be necessary. Students are responsible for ensuring that all information necessary to complete the assessment is provided to the Senior Associate Dean in a timely fashion. Failure to do so will result in fewer credits accepted for transfer and additional coursework to be completed by the student at NDSU. 9. The student must complete and submit a copy of the NDSU Student Condu ct Policy prior to registering for any coursework at NDSU. The st udent must also provide documented evidence of health insurance, apply to the North Dakota Boar d of Pharmacy for a Pharmacy Intern License, successfully pass a multi-state background check and complete all other relevant paperwork/tasks expected of incoming Pharm.D. st udents (transfer or otherwise) prior to registering for any coursework at NDSU. Failure to do so will autom atically lead to a revocation of the student's admittance. The student also is made aware the academic, profe ssional and time-limit standards outlined in the College Policy Manual (www.nds u.edu/healthprofessions/college_information/ policy_manual/) which govern the st udent's continued 3.20 ACADEMIC REMEDIATION and REPETITION OF PROFESSIONAL COURSES Professional pharmacy student s failing to achieve a mi nimum grade of \"C\" in a graded course or \"P\" in a pass/fail course may be offered remediation at the discre tion of the course instruct or(s) to. Remediation is a privilege and should only be offered to students with regular course a ttendance and participation. Remediation is defined as any change in grade based on the es tablished grading crit eria and process t hat applies to all students. Remediation will be tailored to the individual student and may in clude, but is not limited to, one or more of the following in conjunction with ac ademic advising: re-examination, additional course work, independent study, and campus tutoring. If remediation is offered, it is the responsibility of the instructor to ensure the student demonstrates competence in the c ourse material. Prior to offering re mediation, the course instructor must notify the Senior Asso ciate Dean with the student's name and pr oposed plan of remediation. The Senior Associate Dean will be responsible fo r tracking remediation o pportunities offered to all professional students. Students will only be allowed to re mediate one course per semester. If students do not successfully complete a profession al pharmacy course (i.e. grade less than a C), and remediation is not offered, they may repeat the c ourse. Withdrawal (for r easons other than extenuating conditions*) from a profe ssional pharmacy course with a grade less than a C is considered the same as a failure. Failure to complete all Co-Curriculum semester requi rements is considered a pr ofessional pharmacy course failure . Students are limited to a total number of three (3) course failures and/ or course remediation. A fourth occurrence of receiving a grade less than a C (or withdrawal due to a grade less than a C) or course remediation in a professional pharmacy course, didactic or experiential, wi ll result in term ination from the pharmacy program. For example the established standard wo uld result in dismissal from the professional pharmacy program if a student had the following results Rem ediation of 2 courses, failure of 1 course, and fail ure of 1 APPE. Compliance with the University Class Attendance Policy 333 is still required by ins tructors. Appeals to this policy may be submitted to the Pharmacy Academic Affa irs and Student Progre ss Committee which may grant exceptions due to exte nuating circumstances. *All extenuating circumstances mu st be approved by the Pharmacy Ac ademic Affairs and Student Progress Committee before the withdrawal takes place.

Approved: 8/11/04 Housekeeping: 3.26 PHARM.D. PROFESSIONAL ELECTIVES A minimum of 6 professional elective course credits, that permit explorat ion of and/or advance study in areas of professional interest, are required for graduation with the entry-level Pharm.D. degree. Professional elective courses are subjec t to the following rules: 1. Professional elective courses must be taken while enrolled in the entry-level P harm.D. program (e.g. beginning Fall Semester P1 year). These courses must be completed prio r to the beginning of the P4 year. 2. Professional elective courses must be taken for a letter grade, and a grade of C or better (pass for a pass/fail course) is required to meet the requirements. 3. The Pharm.D. handbook contains a list of pr e-approved professional elective courses. 4. A student may take a professional elective course that is not included in the pre-approved list only after (1) consultation with his/her academic advisor, AND (2) approval of the c ourse by the Pharm.D. Curriculum Committee. The necessary steps to take a course that is not included in the pre-approved prof essional elective course list is as follows: 1. The student must meet with his/her advisor and demonstrate that the c ourse \"permits exploration of and/or advance study in areas of professional interest\". This reques t must be made to the advisor by December 1 for upcoming spring semester courses, and April 1 for upcoming summer and fall semester courses. 2. If the advisor supports the student's elective course choice, then th e advisor shall petition to the chair of the Curriculum Committee to approve the course. 3. Curriculum Committee will obtain a syllabus for revi ew and contact the instructor to address other criteria as needed. 4. Upon receipt of all required information, the Cu rriculum Committee shall review the information, determine the status of the request, and inform the student, and advisor, of the outcome of the petition. 5. If the Curriculum Committee approves the course, the course shall be included in future revisions of the pre-approved professional elective course list.

This policy shall apply to students who have obtained a previous graduate degree or are in process of obtaining a graduate degree and then choose to pursue the Pharm.D. degree. It shall not apply to st udents enrolled in the joint Pharm.D./Ph.D. Program. Any credits beyond this limit must be fulfilled with addi tional elective courses in compliance with the Policy on Electives. A plan of study must be filed with t he Curriculum Committee and the Office of Registration & Records for any student who deviates from the standard curriculum. The plan must fulfill all curricular and credit requirements. A copy of the plan of student for t he graduate degree will also be filed with the Curriculum Committee. Approved: 3/10/04 Housekeeping: 12/3/14 Source: Faculty Meeting Minutes PHARM.D. Policy 3.28 STUDENT COMPLAINT PROCEDURES The Accreditation Council for Phar macy Education (ACPE), at the behes t of the U.S. Secretary of Education, requires all accredited pharmacy programs to establish, impl ement and assess a formal complaint policy for students. More specifica lly, all accredited colleges or school s of pharmacy must establish a comprehensive policy with a simple set of procedures whereby all students enroll ed in the College (and the pharmacy program in particular) can submit and resolv e a complaint about the educational process. While such procedures do not always produce an outcome that meets the student's pref erences, they do ensure that students have access to an equitabl e and efficient means to remediate their complaints. The complete set of ACPE standards regarding student complaint po licies can be found on pages 32-33 (Standard 20) of the following website http://www.acpe-accredit.org/pdf/ACPE_Revised_PharmD_Standards_Adopted_Jan152006.pdf. The NDSU School of Pharmacy takes student complaints very seriousl y. Our goal is to ensure that students have access to transparent, due process in a m anner that leads to an appropriate resolution of the complaint. To that end, a copy of t he NDSU School of Pharma cy policy relating to this issue is available on its website at www.ndsu.ed u/pharmacy. Students who have difficulty a ccessing this webpage may also obtain a copy of the complaint policy in the Dean's Office (Sudro Hall, Room 123). A discussion of this policy shall take place annually during the orientation pr ocess for first professional year students. Each student complaint will be appropriately docum ented and investigated. A chronological record of each complaint, including the natur e of the complaint, written records of the complaint procedure and the final outcomes of the resolution proc ess shall be maintained in the Office of the Dean, and shall be available for review by ACPE or its represent atives upon written request or in the process of an on-site evaluation visit. Student complaints generally fall within two major categories: complaints about unfair grading and all other, non-grade-related complaints. Student complain ts about grades are generally handled at the level of the University, since grades are usually adminis tered through the NDSU Office of Registration and Records. Other student complaints remain under the purview of the individual colleges within NDSU. Student Complaints Regarding Grades University Grade Appeal Policy NDSU has an established policy regarding complain ts about grading, otherwi se known as \"grade appeals\". The full grade appeal pol icy (section 337), which includes hearing procedures, is available at www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/337.pdf. While students acti vely considering a grade appeal are referred to the aforementioned website for the specific details of the policy, a summary of the policy is outlined below. With the exception of incomplete grades, a cour se grade is considered final unless an appropriate appeal is filed by the student. Grade changes are also considered only for those students who have not yet earned a degree for which the course in question was applied. For a student who has reason to believe that t hey have been issued an inco rrect or inappropriate grade, he/she must initiate a request fo r a change of a grade with the instructor within fifteen (15) instructional days of the first day of the semest er immediately following the semest er in which the grade was awarded. For Spring Semester courses, the request may be made with in fifteen (15) instructi onal days of the start of Fall Semester, if the student is not enrolled for a Summer term in the same academic year. A grade appeal is formally in itiated when the stude nt presents the Grade Appeal Form to the instructor. If there is an unsatisfactory decision, t he student must consult the Department Head, and the Dean or a designated college commi ttee, proceeding from one le vel to the next only after an unsatisfactory decision of the conflict at that level. In t he event that the instructor is also the Department Head or Dean, he or she need only be consulted in the capacity of instructor. In the event of an unsatisfactory decision within the college, the student may submit a formal written appeal to the Grade Appeals Board Chair. Such an appeal shall be made within fifteen (15) instructional days a fter conclusion of the coll ege proceedings as stated above. Non-Grade Student Complaints Pre-professional and professiona l pharmacy students who have a non-grade-related complaint can seek resolution of that complaint through the followi ng procedures. It is impo rtant to note that these procedures represent the sole avenu e for student complaints regarding non-grade-related issues, including (but not limited to) ACPE standards, policies and proc edures. Additionally, becau se the pharmacy program spans multiple departments, the non-grade complaints are handled thr ough the Dean's Office , rather than by the departments themselves. 1. The student(s) or, in cases where student anonymity is required, their advocate (also known as the \"plaintiff(s)\") will file a formal written complaint (delivered through the postal service or NDSU email) to the Dean's Office in t he NDSU School of Pharmacy. 2. The written complaint must include a description of the issue, policy, pr ocedure or ACPE standard in question. It must also summarize the argument of the plainti ff (including the grounds for the appeal or complaint) and provide a reasonable am ount of evidence supporting the claim. 3. Upon receipt of the written complaint, the complain t will be assigned to either the Senior Associate Dean (as the Chair of the College Academic Affairs Committee) if the complain t is primarily academic in nature, or the Associate Dean for Student Affa irs and Faculty Development (as the Chair of the College Student Affairs Committee) if the complain t is primarily non-academic . The plaintiff(s) will receive email notification (via NDSU email) within forty-eight hours of the receipt of the complaint concerning the identity of the A ssociate Dean handling the complaint. 4. The Senior Associate Dean or Associate Dean fo r Student Affairs and Facult y Development or, if a non-academic issue, Student Affair s, shall convene a meet ing of College Academic Affairs or, if a non-academic, Student Affairs Committe e to review the complaint. Be cause the procedures for both Associate Deans and Committees are similar in pr ocedure, they will henceforth be referred to generically as \"Associate Dean\" and \"Committee\", re spectively. The Committee meeting shall occur within thirty days from the time that the A ssociate Dean receives the written complaint. 5. Once the Committee has met, the Associate Dean sh all prepare and submit a formal, written reply to the student(s) based on the recommendation of Comm ittee. The reply sha ll include an evaluation of the complaint, a description of any violations, and a proposal for any necessary corrective action. The reply will be sent through official NDSU deliv ery methods (i.e., the postal service, campus mail and/or the NDSU email system) with in fifteen business days from the time that the Committee makes a decision. 6. Decisions of the Committee that demonstrate arbitrary and capric ious treatment, or that are fundamentally inappropriate in the eyes of the plaintiff(s) may be appealed to the Dean of NDSU School of Pharmacy. In such cases, the st udent(s) file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed directly to the Dean. The written complaint would also identify and provide evidenc e indicating that the A ssociate Dean and/or the Committee acted in an arbitrary, capric ious or otherwise inappropriate manner. 7. If unsatisfactory resolution occurs after the appeal to the Dean, a final appeal may be made to the Provost. Once again, the student(s) must file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complain t would be addressed directly to t he Provost, rather than the Dean, and would provide evidence substant iating the claim of unfair treatm ent levels. Approved: 4/21/2011 Source: 3.29 DOCTOR OF PHARMACY (PHARM.D.) STUDENT TECHNICAL STANDARDS The North Dakota State Universi ty College of Health Professions ' (NDSU CHP) mission is to educate students and advance research and professional service in pharmacy, nursing, allied sciences, and public health. As a corollary to this mission, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program seeks to train students who have the ability, interest and work ethic necessary to be eligible for licensure, and embark upon a successful career as a health care professional. Thus, the Pharm.D. professional program requires students to undertake the full set of activities that are necessary to comple te their program of study. The goal of every licensed pharmacist is to provide safe and effective care to patients. In order to provide that care, individuals must have the physical, cognitiv e and social skills necessary to learn, practice and master each of the competencies of one's profession. Failure to dem onstrate these competencies not only endangers the patients under the pharmacist's care, but also impacts the ability of other prov iders to provide safe and effective patient care. Therefore, the following technical st andards represent competencies neces sary to complete the Pharm.D. professional program and provides additional guidance to the College Student Technical Standards Policy 3.11 for students. Students must be able, with or without reasonable accommodations, to consistently demonstrate these competencies. Stude nts who fail to demonstrate these competencies are ineligible for admission or progression in the NDSU Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) pr ofessional program. The technical standard competencies are organized into five general categories: 1. Perception/observation 2. Communication 3. Motor/tactile function 4. Intellectual, conceptual, integr ative, and quantitative abilities 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes 1. Perception/Observation Competencies Students must be able to utilize their senses and ment al abilities to perceive and observe information presented through: Written material Audiovisual material Demonstration Large-group lectures Small group discussions and presentations One-on-one interactions Laboratory experiences Patient encounters (at a di stance or close at hand) Procedures 2. Communication Competencies Students must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently (in English) using nonverbal, verbal, and writing strategies with faculty members, other members of the healthcare team , patients, families, and other students, in order to: Produce written and or al communication Elicit information Convey information Clarify information Create rapport Work collaboratively Develop therapeutic relationships Demonstrate computer literacy 3. Motor/Tactile Function Competencies Students must have sufficient motor func tion, skills, and tactile ability to ex ecute basic tasks in the training and provision of patient care. This includes coor dination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the sens es of touch and vision in order to: Attend and participate in classes, groups, and acti vities which are part of the curriculum. Conduct basic laboratory procedures and tests. Perform basic, non-sterile compounding. Demonstrate aseptic technique. Examine patients (including in spection, auscultation, palpatio n, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers). Administer immunizations, per form cardiopulmonary resuscita tion, perform palpitation, auscultation, and percussion. Provide patient care appropri ate to the circumstances. Perform in a reasonably in dependent way in potentially hi gh speed/high demand/emergency environments. 4. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrat ive & Quantitative Competencies: Student must be able to demonstr ate higher-level cognitive abilities, which include: Memory Rational thought Visual-spatial comprehension Conceptualization Application Measurement Calculation Analysis Representation (oral, written, di agrammatic, three dimensional) Organization Synthesis Clinical reasoning Ethical reasoning 5. Behavioral and Social Competencies Students must consistently demonstrate attributes of pr ofessionalism, including: Empathy, compassion, integrity, and respect for others. Preparation, initiative, and a ccountability consistent with a commitment to excellence Commitment to legal and ethical principles pertain ing to the provision of patient centered care. Mindfulness of the environment, re cognizing that one's professionalis m is constantly evaluated by others. Reasonable Accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) The College strongly encourages any st udent who suspects that he or s he may have a disability to contact the NDSU Office of Disability Services for guidance concerning the steps that are necessary to document and verify the nature and extent of the disability. C onsistent with NDSU and Federal policies, students with documented evidence of disabilities may request r easonable accommodations. However, such requests are not reasonable if they disrupt, are detrimental to and/or endanger pati ents, students, co-workers and/or instructors, or otherwise cause a f undamental alteration to the program. Failing to Meet, Reporting and Adj udicating Technical Competencies Applicants and students of the Phar macy Doctorate professional progr am who consistently fail to demonstrate the competencies identifie d above are ineligible for admissi on or progression in the program. Students who are admitted to the Pharmacy Doctorate professi onal program and who realize (either through their own efforts or as demonstrated by a licensing board, a pr eceptor or a faculty me mber in the program) that they do not (or no longer) consistently demonstrate the requisite technica l competencies to be eligible for licensure have an ethical obl igation to self-report that information to the College' s administration (i.e., the appropriate department chair, the Senior Associate D ean and/or the Associate De an for Student Affairs and Faculty Development). Once realized (through own awareness or as report ed to them by a licensing board, faculty, or preceptor), failure to self-report a consistent lack of technical competenc ies represents a violation of the Student Conduct Policy (Co llege Policy Manual, 3.30 EXAMINATION ADMINISTRATION The purpose of this policy is to provide expectation s for student conduct related to examinations and ensure examinations given at t he School of Pharmacy are adequately and consistently administered. Aside from maintaining academic integrity, exam ination procedures prepar e the student for the stringent expectations of the professional licensure process. I. Technology Requirements 1. Students must possess an iPad and accessor ies that meet the School of Pharmacy requirements. 2. Students must install and mainta in a current version of iOS and the electronic testing software utilized for ExamSoft exam delivery. 3. Students should be familiar with their iPad, testing software, and instructions prior to downloading an ex amination. 4. Students are expected to: a. Have an A/C power cord av ailable AND a fully charged battery (at least 2 hours) for cases in which there is a power di sruption during the ex amination OR an electrical outlet is not near the student's assigned seat. b. Ensure that the internal clock is set to the correct date a nd time (CST/CDT). II. Timing and Attendanc e at Examinations 1. Students requiring accommodations are to coordinate with the office of Disability Services prior to the delivery of the examin ation (NDSU Policy Manual Section 606). 2. Students are expected to be present for all ex aminations unless otherwise stated by the course instructor. All absences require appropriate document ation and instru ctor approval (NDSU Policy Man ual Section 333). a. Students missing an examinat ion due to an EXCUSED abs ence will be permitted to take a make-up examination timed at the discretion of the instructor. b. Students missing an exam ination due to an UNE XCUSED absence may be granted the privilege of taking a make-up examination; however, the student will be subject to a penalty on their exam score. c. In any case where a delayed or makeup examination is necessary, a comparable but different examination may be given. Faculty may assess in a different format from the original exam (e.g. multiple choice may be replaced with essay questions). d. All delayed or makeup examinations must be taken under direct observation of a proctor. The proctor may be a teaching assistant, graduate assistant. The proctor may also directly observe with use of a surveillance camera. 3. Students must be on time for examinations. St udents arriving more than 15 minutes late, without proper justification, will be subject to penalty. Student's arrivi ng late must take the examination in a location deter mined by the individual administering the exam. Unless extenuating circumstances are ca use for the delay and were un avoidable, they will receive no additional time. 4. Examination start times will not be delayed d ue to a hardware or software problem with a student's iPad. Students enc ountering a tech nical issue during an exam should notify the individual administering the exam. See Technology Issues. 5. Students are responsible for brin ging their iPad to the examination room with the exam file already downloaded. Additional time will not be granted for do wnloading exam files when it was available prior to the exam session. 6. If a student has examination acco mmodations approved by the Office for Disability Services, the exam must be taken in the facilities of the Office for Dis ability Services and at the same time as the regular class exam ination (if time permits). III. Examination Procedures 1. Faculty are responsibl e for being attentive to students during an exam. 2. Students may be asked for id entification or si gn an attendance log at any time. 3. Students are expected to maintain a decor um and demeanor consistent with accepted academic and professional standards at all times during examinatio ns (NDSU CHP Policy Manual Section 3.9). Lack of pr ofessional decorum may result in dismissal from the exam, which will be considered an unexcused absence. 4. Students may be randomly s eated during an examination. 5. An examination may take place dur ing a time that is not part of their regular course schedule. This will be determined by the faculty and will be conv eyed in the course syllabus. 6. Students are allowed ONLY the following items at their seat: a. iPad devoid of taped-on note s or markings that coul d be construed as \"cheat sheets\" b. Power adapter c. Standard (non-mechanical/ non-refillable) #2 pencils d. The following items may be al lowed if deemed necessary by the course instructor: 1. Scratch paper if allowed would be provid ed by the faculty member as colored paper and must be turned in and signed at the end of the exam 2. Non-programmable calculator 3. iPad stylus 7. Students must leave ALL personal items in studen t lockers or place at the front of the testing room if a locker is unavailable. Restrict ed items includes, but is not limited to: a. Food and drinks b. Books, notes, study aids, etc. (unless s pecifically permitted by the instructor) c. Mechanical/refillable pencils/pens/pencil cases d. Coats/ jackets) e.

Electronic devices 1. Activity tracking devices 2. Cell phones 3. Programmable/graphing calculators 4. Any other devices capable of stori ng/transmitting/receiving information 8. Students may be asked to turn out pockets, change position, or pr ovide other means of assurance to demonstrate compliance with this pol icy. One's body should be void of writing in reference to exam content. All it ems are subject to inspection. 9. Proctors may confiscate restricted items until t he exam is completed. Possession of restricted items will be considered a lack of proper decoru m and be subject to penalty. Serious breaches (e.g. cheat sheet) will result in dismissal from the examination. 10. If the instructor decides to addr ess a student inquiry related to interpretation or context of exam they shall address the answer to the entire class. Questions may only be addressed before the first student co mpletes the examination. 11. Students witnessing suspected chea ting should notify the proctor discreetly and immediately. 12. Students will not be excused from the exam room withou t good reason. Those granted permission, should turn over all papers or enable t he \"Hide Exam\" function so it cannot be viewed by a classmate. No more than one student will be allo wed to leave the examination room at one time. During absence, students must not use any co mmunication device or consult any reference. 13. Students must turn in all requested materials (e.g. exam , answer sheet, scratch paper, equation sheets) prior to ex iting the examination room. 14. When completing the exam, students must subm it and have receipt of their uploaded exam confirmed by the individual delivering the exam before leaving the exam room. Students who experience difficulty submit ting their exam will be refe rred for technical assistance. 15. After submitting the exam, a student must leav e the examination room and any adjacent area to prevent disturbing those student s still taking the examination. IV. Technology Issues 1. If a student is unable to download the examinati on file or there is an iPad failure after downloading examination file but prior to t he examination start time, the student should contact the course instructor PRIO R to the examination start time. 2. If an iPad freezes or fails during an examination: a. Bring device to the proctor at the front of the room b. Restart the device (instructor will note amount of time needed for restart). c. If unable to restart and resume the examinat ion, leave the device at the front of the room and obtain a paper c opy of the examination. V. Academic Dishonesty 1. Students are expected to adher e to the Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy (NDSU CHP Policy Manu al Section 3.01). 2. Students should avoid behaviors that give t he appearance of cheating (e.g. talking during exams, wandering eyes) and should take measures to protect their own work. 3. Violations of the Conduct Standards will be reported to the Senior Associate Dean and reported via the Professional Misconduct tracking form. 4. Instructors may move students during the exam ination to avoid or suspend possible instances of cheating. If a widespread breach of the Conduct Standards is suspected, particularly in the case of emergency matters/evacuation, the instructor may cancel the remainder of the examination and reschedule a new exam at a later date (NDS U Policy Manual Section 335). VI. Interruptions During an Examination 1. If a fire alarm or other emergency condition occu rs during an examination, either paper or electronic-based, students will immediately c ease taking the examination and evacuate the building. All materials should be turned over and left on the desk. 2. Students may be asked to evacuate to a specific location. Students are to remain in full view of the individual administeri ng the exam where they can hear the all clear announcement. 3. Students may not discuss the examination with any other person or access any materials including electronic devices. 4. After the fire alarm or othe r cause of interruption has ended, students will return to their assigned seat immediately and if possible, resume the exam ination when announced by the proctor to do so. Students returning later than 10 minutes following the \"all clear\" signal may be excluded from continui ng the examination. 5. The examination will add additional time equal to that lost during the interruption, if time permits. Students returning late will not rece ive additional time above that given to all students. 6. In the event of a prolonged interruption of 15 min without a foreseeable resolution, the examination should be cancelled and rescheduled for a different date. VII. Penalties 1. Instructors are encouraged to outline penalties for examination infractions within their course syllabus. An example of infractions and associated penalties are listed in Table 1. 2. All infractions, regardless of penalties should be reported by the in structor through the Professional Misconduct Tracking From within seven days of occurrence. Table 1.

Any individual seeking to transfer into NDSU's Pharm.D. Program must follow the procedures outlined below. 1. Students must currently be enrolled in an ACPE-accredited Pharm.D. Program. Students enrolled in non-pharmacy degree programs, or those enrolled in bachelor or masters-level pharmacy programs (ACPE-accredited or otherwise) are not eligible to transfer into NDSU's Pharm.D. Program. Those students must apply directly to the entry level Pharm.D. Program using the NDSU Pharm.D. Supplemental Application. 2. The student must submit a formal application to both North Dakota State University, and be accepted to study at the University. Applications to the University as a whole must be completed according to the guidelines established by the University (www.ndsu.edu/admission). 3. Students accepted to study at NDSU may subsequently submit a formal transfer request to the NDSU College of Health Professions, Pharmacy Admissions Committee. A formal request will contain (at a minimum) the following information: i) A formal letter or equivalent written statement outlining the reasons for requesting the transfer; ii) Documented evidence from the student's current institution (typically a formal letter on university letterhead written by the Dean of the current institution) demonstrating that the student is currently in good academic and professional standing; iii) Documented evidence (including, but not limited to include official transcripts of all college work including pharmacy transcripts, PCAT scores and three lettersof evaluation/reference from faculty members of a professional pharmacy program) that the student meets all admission requirements for NDSU's Pharm.D. Program. 4. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee will review transfer applications twice per year. Individuals wishing to transfer and begin classes in the fall semester must submit the entirety of their application materials by June 1 of that academic year. Students intending to transfer and begin classes in the spring semester must submit the entirety of their application materials by October 15 of the preceding semester/calendar year. 5. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee will convene to evaluate completed transfer applications within 30 days of the application deadline in question. If, upon review of the application materials, the Pharmacy Admissions Committee believes that the student's application merits further consideration, the Admissions Committee will schedule an interview with the applicant. The interview will be conducted within 45 days of the application deadline in question. The Pharmacy AdmissionsAPPENDIX 16 ECommittee may exercise discretion in choosing the medium (in-person, telephone, video- conferencing, etc.) for, and the content of, the interview. 6. All decisions on transfer applications are made exclusively by the Pharmacy AdmissionsCommittee. Decisions will be based on factors which include, but are not limited to: the student's academic record, an evaluation of the circumstances leading to the transfer request, the student's performance during the interview (if granted by the Pharmacy Admissions Committee), available space in the Pharm.D. Program, and the admission standards currently used to evaluate traditional Pharm.D. applicants. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee will generally not accept transfer applicants whose credentials fall substantially below those of the 85 students admitted to the entry-level Pharm.D. Program in the previous year. The Pharmacy Admissions Committee will generally not admit any transfer students if such admissions increase class sizes beyond the maximum capacity identified under College Policy 2.24. 7. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development (who serves as Chair of the Pharmacy Admissions Committee) will notify the student in writing within 60 days of the application deadline regarding the outcome of the application. 8. In the event that the students request for a transfer is granted, the Pharmacy AdmissionsCommittee will forward the student's academic transcript and contact information to the Senior Associate Dean. The Senior Associate Deanwill review the student's transcript and collect other relevant information in order to assess whether (and if so, how much) credit may be granted for courses which are applicable to the courses outlined in the curriculum of the NDSU Pharmacy Program. This assessment will be completed at least one week prior to the start of the semester in which the student is set authorized to attend classes. Students should be aware that not all ACPE-accredited Pharm.D. Programs have the same curricula. As a result, student should anticipate that some courses may not transfer and/or that remedial coursework may be necessary. Students are responsible for ensuring that all information necessary to complete the assessment is provided to the Senior Associate Deanin a timely fashion. Failure to do so will result in fewer credits accepted for transfer and additional coursework to be completed by the student at NDSU. 9. The student must complete and submit a copy of the NDSU Student Conduct Policy prior to registering for any coursework at NDSU. The student must also provide documented evidence of health insurance, apply to the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy for a Pharmacy Intern License, successfully pass a multi-state background check and complete all other relevant paperwork/tasks expected of incoming Pharm.D. students (transfer or otherwise) prior to registering for any coursework at NDSU. Failure to do so will automatically lead to a revocation of the student's admittance. The student also is made aware the academic, professional and time-limit standards outlined in the College Policy Manual (www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions/college_information/ policy_manual/) which govern the student's continued Model to Identify At-Risk Professional StudentsThe Challenge In 2016, new Accreditation Council on Pharmacy Education (ACPE) developed new accreditation standards and guidelines. Two changes are noteworthy The requirement that each college/school of pharmacy develop and implement a \"co- curriculum\" The requirement that each college/school of pharmacy develop a statistical model to gauge students' risk of not successfully graduating from the professional program with their intended cohort and correlate that risk with admissions criteria.Study Objective The purpose of this study is to develop an initial, descriptive, comprehensive, statistical profiling model that identifies at-risk students, and the factors that signal risk, from the pre-professional through the first professional year of study in the North Dakota State University Doctor of Pharmacy Program. Study Objective The study is: Initial - only examine the first half of study Descriptive - examine the factors that correlate with students becoming at- risk. Comprehensive - students fail to progress in any number of academic courses/experiences and many factors go into admitting students. The study will: Broadly guide future, more directed profiling initiatives in specific areas/courses. Allow for out of sample forecasting and cohort-specific characteristics. Methodology We seek a method of data analysis that: Allows multiple input (admissions) and output (professional student success) variables Is flexible Is intuitive Can be applied to data with and without well-defined statistical properties. Can be applied to small (perhaps too small for regression and SEM) and large sample sizes Can be implemented without the use of specialized statistical software (i.e., it can be implemented in Microsoft Excel)Methodology Based on these considerations, we adopted: Simple Pearson and Spearman Correlations Understand basic trends in the data Maximum Correlation Analysis (MCA) as the technique of choice. Used in Tofalis, JORS, 2001 Murphy, Rosenman, McPherson, and Friesner, MCRR, Let variable X be \"success in admissions process\" X is a linear combination of all major pre-professional criteria used to assess admission, including grades and soft skills. X = a Where w1 ,..., wJare parameters for each of the J admissions characteristics. The model can include or exclude an intercept. Data may be unstandardized or standardized using z-scores.MCA Methodology Let variable Y be \"success in the first year of the professional program\" Y is a linear combination of all major professional program criteria (courses) used to assess admission, including grades and soft skills. Y = b Where 1 ,...,are parameters for each of the L professional progression criteria. The model can include or exclude an intercept. Data may be unstandardized or standardized using z-scores.MCA Methodology MCA uses the following nonlinear programming model, which can be implemented using Excel's Solver's nonlinear programming routine: ,,,...,,,..., Subject to: Y = b X = a MCA Methodology We look for three major things: Large weights (more important criterion) In sample model fit (magnitude the overall correlation) Consistency/uniqueness across cohorts.Methodology Retrospective, descriptive empirical analysis Use current \"P2\" professional pharmacy cohort (admitted two years ago; 4-5thyear college students) Use current \"P3\" professional pharmacy cohort (admitted three years ago 5-6thyear college students).
