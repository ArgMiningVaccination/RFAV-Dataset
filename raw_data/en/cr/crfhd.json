Can our facility obtain COVID -19 vaccine through our usual pharmacy and administer it ourselves like we do for influenza vaccine? Yes, however, most of the COVID -19 vaccines currently in late -stage testing have stricter cold chain requirements than seasonal influenza vaccine, including requirements for some vaccines to be frozen. Additionally, each vaccine has different mixing requir ements for administration and minimal interval requirements for a second dose, if indicated. Reporting requirements for COVID -19 vaccines will also be stricter than those for seasonal influenza vaccine. Anyone who administers COVID -19 vaccine is required t o enroll as a vaccination provider and report individual -level administration data to the appropriate state, territorial, local, or federal jurisdiction once the vaccine has been administered . For facilities opting into the pharmacy partnership program, th e pharmacy partner would be responsible for procuring vaccine, cold chain management, administration to residents (and staff who have not yet been vaccinated), and fulfillment of all reporting requirements to public health authorities on behalf of the facility. 2. How do I sign up for the Pharmacy Partnership for Long -Term Care Program for COVID -19 Vaccination? Nursing homes can sign up via the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN; https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/index.html ) and assisted living facilities can sign up via an online survey ( https://redcap.link/LTCF ) starting October 1 9 and remaining open for two weeks. 3. Why are facilities beingasked to consider the LTC pharmacy partnership program for vaccination of LTCF residents? CDC is partnering with pharmacies to offer on -site COVID -19 vaccination services for nursing homes and assisted l iving facilities. The Pharmacy Partnership for Long -term Care (LTC) Program provides end-to-endmanagementof the COVID -19 vaccination process, including cold chain management, on-site vaccinations, and fulfillment of reporting requirements, to facilitate safe vaccination of this patient population, while reducing burden on facilities and jurisdictional health departments. 4. Can staff at my facility get vaccinated via this program? It is possible that staff will be eligible to receive COVID -19 vaccine earlier than LTCF residents as part of a recommendation for vaccination for healthcare personnel, including those in LTCFs. Any staff member who was not already vaccinated could be vaccinated through these on -site clinics; however, we stro ngly encourage staff to be vaccinated as soon as they are eligible, which may occur through mobile clinics and clinics run by health departments for healthcare personnel. 5. Our facility has their own pharmacy, are we required toparticipate in the LTC pharmacy partnership programforvaccine distribution? No, you are not required to participate in this program. A facility can opt to have vaccine supply and management services coordinated by a pharmacy provider of their choice or opt in at a later time b y emailing eocevent494@cdc.gov to sign up if a fter the online form has closed. If an LTCF opts out of the pharmacy partnership program, the LTCF and the pharmacy provider of their choice are responsibl e for coordination of and adherence to all vaccine supply chain, storage, handling, administration, and reporting requirements, including strict cold chain and public health reporting requirements.
