It is important to not only understand what you should do to protect your body but also how you can a consciously make the effort to implement them into daily rituals. In this post I will share with you some of my own favourite immune boosting rituals that I have learned over the years working in the health and wellness field. Please keep in mind that I am not a medical professional. There are so many amazing immune boosting products and rituals that protect the body from infection. I am specifically highlighting these particular ones as they are powerful yet simple enough for daily use. 1. Hand Soap + water I know this sounds simple but if you decide to incorporate only one of these rituals, please let this be the one. [Proper hand washing is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of infection.](5. Hand Soap on the Go Hand washing is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of infections. Yes, hand sanitizers are commendable, but in most cases you should be able to access some water and always choose to wash your hands if possible. I like to keep a mini liquid hand soap in my bag for when I am on the go. I mix liquid castille soap such as Dr.Bronners, water, and a few drops on an immune boosting, antibacterial essential oil.) Hand washing is not only a physical cleansing practice but also an energetic one. Not only do we pick up physical germs on our hands but we also accumulate energetic debris. For the protection of both my immunity and others, I constantly wash my hands throughout the day. Rituals: In order to create a habit around hand washing, find a soap that you will look forward to using. If you are a scent person, use a soap that has an intoxicating scent. If you are a texture person, make sure to use a soap that feels incredible on your skin. I personally like to make my own soap because I know exactly what is in it, I can create exactly what I want, it is more environmentally friendly, and very economical. I like diluting liquid castille soap in water and/or flower water inside of a foam pump bottle and then add a few drops of an essential oil that I enjoy the scent of. You can also add in essential oils that have immune boosting, antibacterial properties. I use this soap both at home and on the go with a mini hand soap pump (featured picture). Aside from [common hand washing practices](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html)(after using the washroom, before eating, caring for someone who is sick, after sneezing or coughing, etc.) I also have hand washing rituals that I always use before I come in contact with a my face, someone else's face, and before and after working with energy. Some good practices are to wash your hands before brushing your teeth, applying skincare, working with a client, washing your face, and so on. Find many ways to incorporate hand washing in your day. If you find great benefit in the power of mantras, try saying out loud or in your mind while you wash your hands: \"I am healthy, I am healing, I am clean\", etc. for at least 30 seconds. 2. Throat Spray Using a throat spray throughout the day can prevent or diminish the intensity of a cold, flu, or throat infection. This [Stop it Cold throat spray by St. Francis](https://www.stfrancisherbfarm.com/products/stop-it-cold-throat-spray) contains organic, wildcrafted, healing ingredients such as echinacea, marshmallow, liquorice, propolis, and sage. Rituals: I like to spray this into my throat with healing intention three times. I will use it after having brushed my teeth, after sipping some water, and simply throughout the day every few hours. 3. Essential Oils Not only do essential oils smell beautiful but they also can treat and prevent harmful bacteria, fungus, and viruses. This particular essential oil blend, [Immune by Saje Wellness](https://www.saje.com/ca/product/immune-IMMUCA04.html), contains healing ingredients such as eucalyptus, tea tree, lemon, myrtle, pine needle, myrrh, and thyme. Rituals: I use essential oils a lot. Below are just some of the ways I like to incorporate them into my immune boosting rituals. First thing in the morning and right before bed I like to fill up a diffuser with fresh water and add some immune booting essential oil drops with a healing intention. I like to blend a few drops of an immune boosting essential oil with a carrier oil, such as jojoba, so that I can apply it directly to the skin. While rubbing this mixture onto my nose and hands it will provide antibacterial benefits. To relieve any congestion I will rub this same mixture onto my chest, throat, nose, cheeks, and eyebrows with a mantra of \"I breathe with ease\". You can also pour this mixture into a roller ball container to make application easier. I love to bath, so before I get in I will close the bathroom door and add a few drops of essential oil to the water. 4. Hot Herbal Tea Whether you are a tea drinker or not, hot herbal teas provide incredible healing benefits. If you don't enjoy drinking tea, you can instead use it to [create a healing facial steam ](https://www.speyeralbeauty.com/blog/2018/herbalfacialsteam?rq=steam). There are so many incredible herbal teas on the market to choose from. If you are an herbal tea enthusiast you might have already discovered [Traditional Medicinals](https://www.traditionalmedicinals.com/search/herbal+tea). This is a very accessible brand found in most grocery, health, and wellness shops in North America. My go to organic blends for boosting immunity are Breathe Easy, Echinacea Plus, and Cold Formula. Rituals: I love tea so I drink it morning, noon, and night. If you don't enjoy it, I invite you to try having at least one a day for a week and see what differences you notice. If you still don't like it, try having just hot water with some lemon, fresh ginger, and/or honey. To make a beautiful healing tea I will grab my favourite mug, boil some hot water, follow steeping instructions (it is best to cover the tea while it steeps to keep in the healing properties), and sip away. For sinus congestion I like to use the Breathe Easy tea in [herbal facial steams.](https://www.speyeralbeauty.com/blog/2018/herbalfacialsteam?rq=steam) 5. Healing Mist Misting with essential oils, whether by a room diffuser or travel spray, will help to boost your immunity. This practice is not only incredibly nourishing for your skin but is also beneficial for your health as it can treat and prevent harmful bacteria, fungus, and viruses. When selecting an oil, be sure to use one that is not only safe for you but also anyone else in your environment (including pets). Featured in this image is my fancy travel diffuser. If you are familiar with traditional room diffusers (you know, that misty thing in the corner of everyone's living room that smells incredible?), it is just like that but for on the go. It is a handy piece of technology that can also be referred to as a nano mister or travel nebulizer. It creates a luxurious experience by producing an ultra fine mist. I also love using traditional misting bottles. Rituals: In the morning while I wait for my tea kettle to boil I will prepare my mister by filling it up with water and a few drops of an immune boosting essential oil. For on the go, I will pack my travel mister in a spot in my purse that I will typically reach for so I remember to use it. When misting myself, I use this as a time to practice deep, conscious breathing. I cover the entire face, neck, and aura while inhaling deep down into the base of the belly. These are just a few important rituals that I use daily to boost my immunity. Please comment below and share which you are going to try or that which "}
