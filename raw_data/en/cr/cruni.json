This version 2.2 (referenced herein as the Guide) incorporates changes to the 2002 Guide. The revised, added, or deleted material is indicated by vertical lines in the margin, and is summarized in the table below the contact information following this section. Additionally, Appendix 5 provides additional narrative and shows the new material and previous version's material Any needed additions or revisions to the G uide have been coordinated with the American Immunization Registry Association (AIRA). Previous changes were coordinated with the Committee on Immunization Registry Standards for Electronic Transactions (CIRSET), whose functions have now been merged with AIRA. Members have indicated their intention to implement the Guide as written and to resist adding Z segments or otherwise changing the implementation to one that is not consistent with this document. To claim conformance with this Guide, registries must support the four immunization data transaction messages described on page 3: the VXQ (Query for Vaccination Record), the VXR (Response to Vaccination Query Returning the Vaccination Record), the VXX (Response to Vaccination Query Returning Multiple PID Matches), and the VXU (Unsolicited Vaccination Record Update). As necessary, registries should support the use of ACK and QCK messages described in the Guide. For registries that are developing HL7-based electronic VAERS reporting, the ORU message definition supplied in the Guide is the standard for compliance. Supporting all four VX* message types is also a recommended requirement for registry certification. Registries are encouraged to implement HL7 communication with providers and data sources other than registries. In these cases, the four VX* messages mentioned above may alone prove insufficient. ADT messages are discussed in this document and are available for communication with providers and other non-registry data sources. However, even with non-registry data sources, the VX* messages are preferred when possible and appropriate. A conformant registry must also follow the HL7 protocol as described in the standard and further defined in this Guide. Registries should include segments and fields required by HL7 exactly as defined by the standard and described in this Guide. For example, the third field in the Patient Identification Segment (PID-3) is required by HL7 to contain the list of patient identifiers, identified by type code. It can retain an unlimited number of identifiers. Registries should not restrict the utility of this field in their implementation by arbitrarily limiting the supported identifiers to their own registry identifier. Other functions described herein, such as reporting vaccine adverse events using HL7, are provided as information to registries. If these functions are implemented, however, registries should follow the guidelines as written. The HL7 2.3.1 standard version is the standard for registries and for registry certification. XML versions of the HL7 versions 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 exist and are used by registries. These cannot, however, be considered a substitute for the standard version embodied in this document. Any registry using an XML approach has the responsibility to be able to communicate with other registries or providers using the HL7 standard version. In order to be certified, any registry using an XML approach must be able to receive, process, and respond using the standard HL7 2.3.1 message test sets. This Guide is intended for use by immunization registries that want to participate in a strictly-defined record exchange agreement that limits the amount of optionality normally expected when using the HL7 standard. The Guide describes the most frequently used segments in their entirety, while giving a minimum description of segments containing only a few useful fields for registries. The Guide fully describes the fields within the segments used frequently by immunization registries, while the others are omitted in this document. With this limited scope, this Guide can in no way serve as a substitute for a thorough study of the entire set of HL7 specifications for electronic data interchange in health care environments.

It is a series of segments in a defined sequence, with a message type and a trigger event. Segment: A segment is a logical grouping of data fields. Segments within a defined message may be required or optional, may occur only once, or may be allowed to repeat. Each segment is named and is identified by a segment ID, a unique 3-character code. Field: A field is a string of characters. Each field is identified by the segment it is in and its position within the segment; e.g., PID-5 is the fifth field of the PID segment. Optional data fields may be omitted. Whether a field is required, optional, or conditional in a segment is specified in the segment attribute tables. The designations are: R=Required, O=Optional, C=Conditional on the trigger event or on some other field(s). The field definition should define any conditionality for the field: X=Not used with this trigger event, B=Left in for backward compatibility with previous versions of HL7. A maximum length of the field is stated as normative information. Exceeding the listed length should not be considered an error. Component: A component is one of a logical grouping of items that comprise the contents of a coded or composite field. Within a field having several components, not all components are required to be valued. Item number: Each field is assigned a unique item number. Fields that are used in more than one segment will retain their unique item number across segments. Null and empty fields: The null value is transmitted as two double quote marks (\"\"). A null-valued field differs from an empty field. An empty field should not overwrite previously entered data in the field, while the null value means that any previous value in this field should be overwritten. Data type: A data type restricts the contents and format of the data field. Data types are given a 2- or 3- letter code. Some data types are coded or composite types with several components. The applicable data type is listed and defined in each field definition. Appendix 2 provides a complete listing of data types used in this document and their definitions. Delimiters: The delimiter values are given in MSH-2 and used throughout the message. Applications must use agreed upon delimiters to parse the message. The recommended delimiters for immunization messages are <CR> = Segment Terminator; | = Field Separator; ^ = Component Separator; & = Sub-Component Separator; ~ = Repetition Separator; and \\ = Escape Character. Message syntax: Each message is defined in special notation that lists the segment 3-letter identifiers in the order they will appear in the message. Braces, {}, indicate that one or more of the enclosed group of segments may repeat, and brackets, [ ], indicate that the enclosed group of segments is optional. Z segments: All message types, trigger event codes, and segment ID codes beginning with Z are reserved for locally defined messages. No such codes will be defined within the HL7 Standard. The users of this guide have agreed to eliminate Z segments from their implementations in order to produce a standard method that will be used nationally to transmit immunization data. 1 Basic Message Construction Rules Encoding Rules for Sending - Encode each segment in the order specified in the abstract message format. - P lace the Segment ID first in the segment. - Precede each data field with the field separator. - Encode the data fields in the order and data type specified in the segment definition table. - End each segment with the segment terminator. - Components, subcomponents, or repetitions that are not valued at the end of a field need not be represented by component separators. The data fields below, for example, are equivalent: ^XX X&YYY&&^ is equal to ^XXX&YYY^ |ABC^DEF^^| is equal to |ABC^DEF| Encoding Rules for Receiving - If a data segment that is expected is not included, treat it as if all data fields within were not present. - If a data segment is included that is not expected, ignore it; this is not an error. - If data fields are found at the end of a data segment that are not expected, ignore them; this is not an error. 2 IMMUNIZATION DATA TRANSACTION MESSAGES Information systems that maintain immunization records need to be able to transmit patient-specific immunization histories electronically to other systems to allow healthcare providers to have access to these records at the time health care is given. Electronic tracking of immunization records also allows providers to track their own progress in reaching age-appropriate immunization coverage levels easily and efficiently. The data transmissions between registries will occur as the result of four activities: (1) a query from one system for a patient's vaccination record that is held in another system (VXQ); (2) a response to a query containing multiple patient \"matches\" to the query, but not returning vaccination records (VXX); (3) a response to a query containing the vaccination record (VXR); and (4) an unsolicited update to a vaccination record (VXU). Trigger event V01 will initiate the Query for Vaccination Record (VXQ) message. Two responses are possible: (1) event type V02--Response to Vaccination Query Returning Multiple PID Matches (VXX), or (2) event type V03 --Response to Query Returning Vaccination Record (VXR). Trigger event type V04 will initiate the Unsolicited Update to Vaccination Record (VXU) message. Addition of new patients can be accomplished by using either VXU (V04) or ADT. The interaction model at the end of this section graphically depicts this process. Version 2.3.1 of the HL7 Standard gives the following explanation in Section 2.2.4, Queries. \"In all cases, the HL7 Standard consists of a simple exchange of messages between a pair of applications: the unsolicited update and its acknowledgment, or the query and its response. The underlying operational model is that of a client and a server. An application interfaces with another application using an event code that identifies the transaction. The other application responds with a message that includes data or an error indication. The initiating application may receive a reject status from the other application or from lower level software indicating that its message was not received correctly.\" For standard immunization exchanges, the VXQ message (event V01) querying for a patient's immunization record and its two standard responses, VXX (event V02) reporting multiple matches to the query parameters, or VXR (event V03) reporting the specifically requested patient immunization history, are defined in Sections 4.12 through 4.14 of the HL7 Standard. In the event that a query was not received correctly, the response would be an ACK (see Sections 2.13, 2.13.1, and 2.18.1 of the Guide ). In the event that a query was received and processed correctly, but no matching records were found, the response would be a QCK (see Sections 2.13, 2.13.1, and 2.18.1 of the Guide ). In the case of an unsolicited update to a record, a VXU (event V04) message would be sent. The response to the VXU is an ACK, or Acknowledgment Message (see Sections 2.13, 2.13.1, and 2.18.1 of the Guide ). Each message is defined in special notation called the message syntax that lists the allowed segments by their three-letter identifiers in the order they will appear in the message. Braces, {}, indicate that the enclosed segment(s) may repeat one or more times, and brackets, [ ], indicate that the enclosed segment(s) is optional. The syntax and an example of each of the defined messages follow. In HL7 transmissions, messages are transmitted as a single string of ASCII characters. The segment is terminated with the carriage return symbol, the ASCII Hex0D. In the examples in this document, the three-letter segment identifiers are bolded, each segment begins on a new line, and carriage return segment endings are shown as <CR> to allow human reading. In a message transmission, an HL7 parser \"reads\" the characters that are transmitted, using the delimiters to divide fields and components. The notation of message and event type in MSH-9 informs the parser which segments will follow, which segments are required, and which can repeat. Similarly, each segment begins with its three-letter identifier, alerting the parser to which fields will follow, which fields are required, and which can repeat. Each segment is defined in the standard, with each field defined. Required fields and allowed field or component repetitions are so noted. For the purposes of this document, the optional segments (PD1, PV1, PV2, IN1, IN2, IN3, RXR, OBX, and NTE) and optional fields within the messages are defined only if needed for immunization registries or if required by HL7. 3 VXQ (Query for Vaccination) )Record) Private Provider- Application \"A\" Possible responses: Private Provider- Application \"A\" Private Provider - Application \"A\" Possible Response: Private Provider - Application \"A\" Private Provider - Application \"A\" Possible Response: Private Provider - Application \"A\" VXQ (Query for Vaccination Record) [Uses components in QRF-5 to match record] 1.

The query will follow this format: VXQ Vaccination Query HL7 Chapter MSH Message Header Segment 2 QRD Query Definition Segment 2 [QRF] Query Filter Segment 2 VXQ Example the Georgia state registry (GA0000) is sending a request to the Massachusetts state registry (MA0000) for the immunization record of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Jr., who was born on June 7, 1990. The request is being sent on May 22, 1997, at 4:05 p.m. All known patient identifiers are included in the sample query for use in matching records. These identifiers are defined by their position in the QRF segment. The responding system is expected to return all query items in its response. If the requestor knew only the patient's Social Security number and birth date, this is how the QRF-5 would appear: |256946789~19900607| If in addition to the Social Security number and birth date, the patient's birth state and mother's current and maiden name were known, this is how the QRF-5 would appear: |256946789~19900607~MA~~~KENNEDY^JACQUELINE^LEE~BOUVIER| Note: Responses when some information has been found in the receiving system are outlined below. If there are processing errors or no data are found to match the query, the response message would be a general acknowledgment message with errors noted or explanatory information provided. A full discussion of error responses follows below. VXQ Example #2 (Query with only a name identifier) MSH |^~\\&||GA0000||MA0000|199705221605||VXQ^V01|19970522GA40|T|2.3.1|||NE|AL|<CR> QRD |199705221605|R|I|19970522GA05|||25^RD|^KENNEDY^JOHN|VXI^VACCINE INFORMATION^HL70048|^SIIS|<CR> This query shows a request for the immunization record using only the patient's name. A limited number of identifiers may result in the receiving registry's matching multiple records. 5 4.14.2 Response to Vaccination Query Returning Multiple PID Matches (VXX) Definition: In response to a query for the definitive patient vaccination record, the system holding the record will return it to the system originating the query. If the query results in multiple \"matches;\" i.e., more than one patient record matches the identifiers in the query so that there is no unique identification, the response to the query (a V02 trigger event) will follow this format: VXX Vaccination Response HL7 Chapter MSH Message Header Segment 2 MSA Message Acknowledgment Segment 2 QRD Query Definition Segment 2 [QRF] Query Filter Segment 2 { PID Patient Identification Segment 3 [ {NK1} ] Next of Kin Segment 3 } VXX Example (Response with many example, each Patient Identification Segment (PID) returns, along with its associated Next of Kin/Associated Parties Segment(s) (NK1). In this message, the query contained only the patient name of John Kennedy. The responding system, Massachusetts state registry, found four patient matches to the query, as reflected in the PID segments. Their associated NK1 segments provide information about the patient's associated parties that will allow the querying system, Georgia state registry, to send a more precise query. Note: To protect confidentiality some registries will not allow this function to return values in any field that was not valued in the query. Each registry will implement its own policies in this regard. We recommend that registries consult the guidelines for privacy, confidentiality, and security of data on the NIP website at <www.cdc.gov/nip/registry>. 6 4.14.3 Response to Vaccination Query Returning the Vaccination Record (VXR) Definition: When the patient has been uniquely identified (there is only one \"match\" to the query), the response to the query (a V03 trigger event) will follow this format: VXR Vaccination Response HL7 Chapter MSH Message Header Segment 2 MSA Message Acknowledgment Segment 2 QRD Query Definition Segment 2 [QRF] Query Filter Segment 2 PID Patient Identification Segment 3 [PD1] Additional Demographics 3 [ {NK1} ] Next of Kin/Associated Parties 3 [PV1 Patient Visit 3 [PV2] ] Patient Visit Additional Information 3 [ {IN1 Insurance 6 [IN2] Insurance Additional Information 6 [IN3] Insurance Additional Information-Cert. 6 } ] [ { [ORC] Common Order Segment 4 RXA Pharmacy Administration 4 [ RXR] Pharmacy Route 4 [ { OBX Observation/Result 7 [ {NTE} ] Notes (Regarding Immunization) 2 } ] } ] VXR Example #1 (Response to VXQ Example #1) The example below reflects a vaccination record response from an immunization registry to a query from an immunization registry in one state to another state registry, but is typical of a response from an immunization registry to one of its participating private health care providers. The example demonstrates the use of optional segments in the message to provide more detail about the patient. Having made an exact match, this response provides the immunization history and other information. For example, the OBX segments document the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) date, specify dose number for each component in a combination vaccine, record an adverse event, and document the reaction to a PPD test.

The child's birth information came from Vital Statistics, but the registry has no record of any vaccines having been given. This response gives no vaccine administration data in the required RXA segment, but is able to return a forecast of next vaccines due in the associated OBX segments. The example shows the use of a \"placeholder\" RXA, but in a typical exchange, the immunization registry will be returning a history of vaccines in repeating RXA segments, then adding the next vaccines due after the last RXA. The list of vaccines due next is not dependant on any one vaccine, but rather the history as a whole, so there should be no misinterpretation of the message in the case where the OBX list showing next vaccines due follows an RXA reporting a real vaccine. The LOINC \u00ae descriptions for the OBX-3 fields are so specific that they offer further insurance against misinterpretation. If a user chooses to insert a \"place-holder\" RXA after the vaccine history and before the next vaccines due list, it should be acceptable to the receiver . 9 [This page was intentionally left blank.] 10 4.14.4 Unsolicited Vaccination Record Update (VXU) Definition: When a provider using one system wishes to update the patient's vaccination record being held in another system, he will transmit an unsolicited update of the record (a V04 trigger event). An unsolicited update will follow this format: VXU Unsolicited Vaccination Update HL7 Chapter MSH Message Header Segment 2 PID Patient Identification Segment 3 [PD1] Additional Demographics 3 [{NK1} ] Next of Kin/Associated Parties 3 [PV1 Patient Visit 3 [PV2] ] Patient Visit Additional Information 3 [ {IN1 Insurance 6 [IN2] Insurance Additional Information6 [IN3] Insurance Additional Information-Cert. 6 } ] [ { [ORC] Common Order Segment 4 RXA Pharmacy Administration 4 [RXR] Pharmacy Route 4 [ { OBX Observation/Result 7 [ {NTE} ] Notes (Regarding Immunization) 2 } ] } ] VXU Example #1 (Message with only required fields valued) The example below of an unsolicited update of a vaccination record demonstrates a message with only the minimum number of fields valued. This message provides all the NIP-required core data elements (see Appendix 3 for the complete core data set) as well as the fields required by HL7 to form a correct message. In the body of this Implementation Guide these required items are represented in boldface type. Some software vendors have expressed an interest in attaching a \"patch\" to an existing system, possibly a billing system that does not otherwise use HL7, that would automatically generate this message from data in an existing update showing use of optional segments) The example below of an unsolicited update of a vaccination record demonstrates the use of this message to update an entire immunization record and to use some of the optional segments in the message to provide additional information. For example, the PD1 segment records the medical home and states whether reminder/recall notices should be sent for this patient. The PV1 segment reports that the patient is a recurring patient who is VFC eligible and is a Medicaid patient. The effective date of his VFC and Medicaid status is June 12 7.2.1 Unsolicited Transmission of an Observation (ORU) The ORU is a very versatile HL7 message. Using this message, one can construct almost any clinical report as a three-level hierarchy, with the patient information (PID segment) at the upper level, an order record (OBR segment) at the next level, and one or more observation records (OBX segment) at the third level . ORU^R01 Observational Results (Unsolicited ) Chapter MSH Message Header 2 { [ PID Patient Identification 3 [PD1] Additional Demographics 3 [ {NK1} ] Next of Kin/Associated Parties 3 [ {NTE} ] Notes and Comments 2 [PV1 Patient Visit 3 [PV2]] Patient Visit -Additional Info 3 ] { [ORC] Order common 4 OBR Observations Report ID 7 { [NTE] } Notes and comments 2 { [OBX] Observation/Result 7 { [NTE] } Notes and comments 2 } { [CTI] } Clinical Trial Identification 7 } } [DSC] Continuation Pointer 2 The HL7 ORU message can transmit a report of an adverse event possibly caused by a vaccine. The message is tightly coded and defined to provide unambiguous reporting that can be processed electronically. Each item on the VAERS-1 (FDA) form can be reported in one of the fields in this message. The standard ORU message allows for the optional use of PD1, PV1, PV2, CTI, and DSC segments, but these segments will not be used in the VAERS ORU message. For this reason, the limited discussion of some of these segments in this implementation guide in connection with other messages does not reference the VAERS message. The segments that are highlighted in the syntax above are those needed by the VAERS message. Background on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) VAERS is a passive surveillance system, a repository for voluntarily submitted reports. An active surveillance system, in contrast, would follow all individuals in a defined population to determine their responses to vaccination. To encourage reporting of any possibly vaccine-induced adverse event, the criteria for reporting to VAERS are unrestrictive; the system accepts and includes any report submitted, no matter how tenuous the possible connection with vaccination might seem. The virtually universal exposure of the population to vaccines makes it vitally important to understand even the very rare complications of vaccination. Therefore, it is essential to continue to collect information on vaccine- related adverse events, even after the vaccines have been approved for general use. For this reason, the Federal Government has established a surveillance system to monitor adverse events that occur following vaccination. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 mandated that all health care providers report certain adverse events that occur following vaccination. Adverse events are defined for VAERS reporting as health effects that occur after immunization that may be related to the vaccine. Adverse event data are continually monitored in order to detect previously unknown adverse events or increases in known adverse events. Several investigations of VAERS data have uncovered previously unrecognized problems that may occur rarely in vaccine recipients. 13 Immunization registries have the potential to provide a mechanism for the more efficient and comprehensive reporting of adverse events associated with vaccines. Physicians increasingly are establishing electronic connections with local and state registries using the standard HL7 protocol. HL7 messages to report immunizations and to access the repository of immunization histories in the registry have been specified in other parts of this Guide. Immunization registries and vendors of physicians' electronic information systems should be able to extend the common immunization record exchange functions of registries to allow physicians to submit VAERS reports about their patients with a minimum of staff time and duplication of data entry. This Guide contains the specifications for electronic transmissi on of VAERS reports to immunization registries and to the VAERS processing contractor using a standard HL7 message, the ORU . The VAERS ORU specifications are incorporated throughout the document. For example, the PID segment is used in both VAERS and immunization messages, but its definition is provided in only one place . The optionality of items in the VAERS ORU message is governed by requirements of the HL7 syntax for an ORU message and by the VAERS reporting rules. The directions on the back of the VAERS form are for the submitter to complete the form to the best of their abilities. It states further that \"Items 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 13 are considered essential and should be completed whenever possible.\" A separate implementation guide for only the VAERS message is available at <www.cdc.gov/nip/registry/hl7vaers.pdf >. This guide describes the ORU message, defines each data field in the message, and provides an example of a complete message using the VAERS-1 (FDA) form. The guide includes tables of codes that are especially relevant to this message. Future versions of VAERS reports may change from the VAERS- 1 (FDA) form. Developers are advised to confirm the current reporting version and format before implementation, but the VAERS-1 (FDA) form will continue to be supported for the near future. The following VAERS ORU message example places the message in a grid that allows users to easily see the item number of the VAERS-1 (FDA) form being addressed, the example segment with the item question expressed as a LOINC \u00ae code, and the identification of the table needed to provide the answer to the question (if coded). The code tables needed to provide data in the OBX-5 and descriptions of required data types are provided in appendices 1 and 2 . A copy of the VAERS-1 (FDA) form is provided as Appendix 4. 14 Example VAERS ORU Message VAERS Item Number EXAMPLE SEGMENTS THA T ANSWER THE VAERS QUESTIONS Code Tables To Be Used Unnumbered Questions in Top Third of Page and Questions events and treatment, if any^LN|1|fever of 106F, with vomiting, seizures, persistent crying lasting over 3 hours, loss of appetite||||||F|<CR> Table NIP003 8 days hospitalized vaccination adverse event^LN|1|02|d^day^ANSI|||||F|<CR> Table NIP003 Table NIP005 Note: Patient death and date information is derived from PID - 29-30. 9 is repeated in each subcomponent of this item and joined with a second LOINC\u00ae code by an \"&.\" HL7 Table 3|||30961 -7^Any other vaccinations within 4 weeks pr ior is repeated in each subcomponent of this item and joined with a second LOINC\u00ae code by an \"&.\" HL7 19 OBX |12|FT|30966 -6^Pre -existing defects, convulsions||||||F|<CR> Table NIP003 NA -2 is repeated in each subcomponent of this item and joined with a second LOINC\u00ae code by an \"&.\" NA Table NIP003 NA NA HL7 table 0292 NA Table NIP003 NA NA 22 children and birth^LN||82|oz^ounces^ANSI|||||F|<CR> Table ANSI unit codes OBX of brothers and sisters^LN||2||||||F|<CR> Table This example shows an HL7 message being sent on March 31, 2001, from the Georgia Immunization Registry to the VAERS processor. The message contains a VAERS report for patient John Fitzgerald Doe, Jr., white male, who resides at 123 Peachtree St., Atlanta, GA 30210. His date of birth was October 7, 2000. Additional identifying information given in the message is: telephone number, 678- 555-1212; State medical record number 00725. Jane Lee Jones administered the vaccine and also completed the VAERS form. Her mailing address and work telephone number are provided. Dr. Marcus J. Welby, Jr., MD, of the Peachtree Clinic, 101 Main Street, Atlanta, GA 38765, ordered the vaccine, and his telephone number is provided. The VAERS form was completed on March 16, 2001, and reported fever of 106 , with seizures, persistent crying lasting over 3 hours, and loss of appetite. This event required an emergency room visit and a 2- day hospitalization. The patient recovered. The patient was vaccinated on February 16, 2001, at the reported age of 5 months, with Hep B and DTaP-Hib. The onset of the adverse event was February 18, 2001, at 9:00 am. 17 2.13 Acknowledgment Messages (With errors or finding no match to query parameters) Definition: The general default acknowledgment message returning error conditions has the following syntax. 2.13.1 ACK General Acknowledgment HL7 Chapter MSH Message Hea der 2 MSA Message Acknowledgment 2 [ ERR ] Error 2 Definition: The query general default acknowledgment message returning error conditions or explaining why the requested data are not being returned has the following syntax. 2.18.1 QCK Query General Acknowledgment HL7 Chapter MSH Message Header 2 MSA Message Acknowledgment 2 [ ERR ] Error 2 [ QAK ] Query Acknowledgment Segment 2 General Acknowledgment Example #1 (ACK with error) Acknowledgment Example #1 shows an unsolicited update being rejected by Massachusetts Vaccine Records because a required field was empty.

Each segment is identified by its unique three-letter code. The segments used in the immunization messages are defined below. The segments are listed in the most logical order for immunization messages and do not strictly adhere to the order in which they are presented in the HL7 Standard. However, for ease of reference, the number preceding each segment and field name indicates its reference place in the HL7 Standard, Version 2.3.1. Because the segments here are re-ordered, these reference numbers are not always in sequential order. The following format is used in this document for listing and defining message segments and fields. First, the message segment's use is defined, and a segment attribute table listing all fields defined in the segment is shown. In the segment attribute table, the following attributes are given for each field: sequence number within the segment, length of field, data type, whether required (R), optional (O), conditional (C), or for backwards compatibility (B), whether repeating (Y), the applicable table number for values, the field item number, and the field name. Following the table, an example of the segment is provided, and select ed fields are listed and defined. For each defined field, the HL7 segment code and reference number are listed, followed by the field name. Items in parentheses after the field name show respectively data type and length of field, whether the field is required or optional, and lists \"repeating\" if the field is allowed to repeat. The HL7 item number follows the parenthesis and is given for reference convenience. As part of the definitions, usage notes for immunization registries are provided, a description of the data type is given in small font, and a statement about how the field is valued in the example is given. Fields that we do not anticipate immunization registries using are not defined. Users interested in learning more about fields not discussed in this document should refer to the full text of the HL7 Standard. 19 SEGMENT DEFINITIONS 2.24 MESSAGE CONTROL SEGMENTS These segments are necessary to support the functionality described in the Control/Query chapter of the HL7 Standard. 2.24.1 Message Header (MSH) Segment Used to define the intent, source, destination, and some specifics of the syntax of a messag e.

The message control ID indicates that this is the third HL7 message of the day from this registry. 2.24.1.0 MSH definitions MSH 2.24.1.1 Field separator (ST-1, Required) 00001 Definition: The character to be used as the field separator for the rest of the message. The r eco mmended value is |, as shown in our examples. MSH 2.24.1.2 Encoding characters (ST-4, Required) 00002 Definition: Four the following order: component separator, repetition separator, escape character, and subcomponent separator. The recommended values are ^~\\&, as shown in our examples. 20 MSH 2.24.1.3 Sending application (HD-180, Optional) 00003 Definition: Uniquely identifies the sending application among all other applications within the network enterprise. The network enterprise consists of all the applications that participate in the exchange of HL7 messages within the enterprise. Immunization programs may use this field to identify the software name and version. We do not define it further in this document. Data type HD: Components: <namespace ID (IS)>^ <universal ID (ST)>^<universal ID type (ID)> Components are defined as follows: (1) Namespace ID (IS). Refer to User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID for suggested values. (2) Universal ID (ST). The UID is a string formatted according to the scheme defined by the third component, UID type. The UID is intended to be unique over time within the UID type. It is rigorously defined by the scheme constructing it. The UID must follow the syntactic rules of the particular scheme defined in the third component. (3) Universal ID type (ID). Governs the interpretation of the second component of the HD. If it is a known UID, refer to HL7 Table 0301 - Universal ID type for valid values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. MSH 2.24.1.4 Sending facility (HD-180, Optional) 00004 Definition: This field contains the address of the sending facility. Site-defined. Immunization programs may use this field to identify which state immunization registry is sending the query. The address consists of the two-letter postal code plus digits. The digits of the state central registry will be all 0's; e.g., GA0000. Facilities and registries within the state will be assigned numeric codes by the state; e.g., GA0322. Data type HD: ID type (ID)> Components are defined as follows: (1) Namespace ID (IS). Refer to User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID for suggested values. (2) Universal ID (ST). The UID is a string formatted according to the scheme defined by the third component, UID type. The UID is intended to be unique over time within the UID type. It is rigorously defined by the scheme constructing it. The UID must follow the syntactic rules of the particular scheme defined in the third component. (3) Universal ID type (ID). Governs the interpretation of the second component of the HD. If it is a known UID, refer to HL7 Table 0301 - Universal ID type for valid values. In our query examples, we show the Georgia state registry as the sending facility. MSH 2.24.1.5 Receiving application (HD-180, Optional) 00005 Definition: Uniquely identifies the receiving application among all other applications within the network enterprise. The network enterprise consists of all the applications that participate in the exchange of HL7 messages within the enterprise. Immunization programs may use this field to identify the software name and version. We do not define it further in this document. Data type HD: Components: <namespace ID (IS)>^ <universal ID (ST)>^<universal ID type (ID)> Components are defined as follows: (1) Namespace ID (IS). Refer to User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID for suggested values. (2) Universal ID (ST). The UID is a string formatted according to the scheme defined by the third component, UID type. The UID is intended to be unique over time within the UID type. It is rigorously defined by the scheme constructing it. The UID must follow the syntactic rules of the particular scheme defined in the third component. (3) Universal ID type (ID). Governs the interpretation of the second component of the HD. If it is a known UID, refer to HL7 Table 0301 - Universal ID type for valid values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. MSH 2.24.1.6 Receiving facility (HD-180, Optional) 00006 Definition: This field identifies the receiving application among multiple identical applications running on behalf of different organizations. Site-defined. Immunization programs may use this field to identify which state immunization registry is to receive the query. The address consists of the two-letter postal code plus digits. The digits of the state central registry will be all 0's; e.g., MA0000. Facilities and registries within the state will be assigned numeric codes by the state; e.g., MA0322. Data type HD: Components: ID ID type (I D)> Components are defined as follows: 21 (1) Namespace ID (IS). Refer to User-defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID for suggested values. (2) Universal ID (ST). The UID is a string formatted according to the scheme defined by the third component, UID type. The UID is intended to be unique over time within the UID type. It is rigorously defined by the scheme constructing it. The UID must follow the syntactic rules of the particular scheme defined in the third component. (3) Universal ID type (ID). Governs the interpretation of the second component of the HD. If it is a known UID, refer to HL7 Table 0301 - Universal ID type for valid values. In our query examples, we show Massachusetts state registry as the receiving system. MSH 2.24.1 .7 Date/time of message (TS-26, Optional) 00007 Definition: Date/time the sending system created the message. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. The user values the field only as far as needed. When a system has only a partial date, e.g., month and year, but not day, the missing values may be interpreted as zeros. The time zone is assumed to be that of the sender. In the query examples, a message is being sent on May 22, 1995, at 4:05 p.m. MSH 2.24.1.8 Security (ST-40, Optional) 00008 Definition: This field may be used to implement security features, but its use is not further specified by HL7. In our examples, we have not valued this field. MSH 2.24.1.9 Message type (CM-7, Required) 00009 Definition: The receiving system uses this field to know the data segments to recognize and, possibly, the application to which to route this message. The second component is not required on acknowledgment messages. The third component is not required for immunization registries, since in the VXQ, VXR, VXX, and VXU messages, the message structure is the same designation as the trigger event type shown in component two. The specific components of fields using the CM data type are defined within the field descriptions. The components for this field are: <message type (ID)>^<trigger event (ID)>^<message structure (ID)> 0076 - Message type , HL7 Table 0003 - Event type , and HL7 Table 0354 - Message structure for values. In the VXR example, the third component is valued for illustration although we do not anticipate immunization registries using this component. The unsolicited transmission of a vaccination record update message would appears as: |VXU^V04|. The unsolicited transmission of an observation message, such as a VAERS report, would appear as: |ORU^R01|. MSH 2.24.1.10 Message Number or other identifier that uniquely identifies the message. The receiving system echoes this ID back to the sending system in the message acknowledgment segment (MSA). Each immunization registry will design its own method for assigning control IDs. VXQ Example #1 shows a potential identification method consisting of date (YYYYMMDD)+state 2-letter code+sequential number indicating the number of queries from the Georgia registry for this date. In the example, this is the 40th HL7 message to be sent from the Georgia registry on May 22, 19 97. MSH 2.24.1.11 Processing ID (PT-3, Required) 00011 Definition: Used to indicate how to process the message as defined in HL7 processing rules. PT data type components: <processing ID (ID)>^<processing mode (ID)> 22 (1) Processing ID (ID). A value that defines whether the message is part of a production, training, or debugging system. Refer to HL7 Table 0103-Processing ID for valid values. (2) Processing mode (ID). A value that defines whether the message is part of an archival process or an initial load. Refer to HL7 Table 0207-Processing mode for valid values. The default (blank) means current processing. In our VXU #1 example, the use is production. In the other examples, the use is training. The second component is not specified, indicating current processing as the default. MSH 2.24.1.12 Version ID (VID-60, Required) 00012 Definition: Matched by the receiving system to its own HL7 version to be sure the message will be interpreted correctly. VID data type components: <version ID (ID)>^<internationalization code (CE)>^<international version ID (CE)> (1) Version ID (ID). Used to identify the HL7 version. Refer to HL7 Table 0104 - Version ID for valid values (2) Internationalization code (CE). Used to identify the international affiliate country code. ISO 3166 provides a list of country codes that may be used (see User-defined Table 0212 - Nationality ). (3) International version ID (CE). Used when the international affiliate has more than a single local version associated with a single U.S. version. In our examples, the version is 2.3.1. MSH 2.24.1.13 Sequence number (NM-15, Optional) 00013 Definition: in this field implies that the sequence number protocol is in use. This numeric field is incremented by one for each subsequent value. In our examples, we have not valued this field. MSH 2.24.1.14 Continuation pointer (ST-180, Optional) 00014 Definition: Used to define continuations in application-specific ways. In our examples, we have not valued this field. MSH 2.24.1.15 Accept acknowledgment type (ID-2, Optional) 00015 Definition: Identifies the conditions under which accept acknowledgments are required to be returned in response to this message. HL7 Table 0155 - Accept/Application acknowledgment conditions gives valid values. Required for enhanced acknowledgment mode. (Note: If MSH-15 and MSH-16 are omitted or null, the original acknowledgment mode rules are used.) The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. This field is required if the enhanced acknowledgement mode is used, when the sending system wants a guarantee that the underlying communications system has delivered the message. The enhanced acknowledgement mode distinguishes both accept and application acknowledgments, as well the conditions under which each is required. With a positive accept acknowledgment, the receiving system commits the message to safe storage in a manner that releases the sending system from the need to resend the message. After the message has been processed by the receiving system, an application acknowledgment may be used to return the resultant status to the sending system. Immunization registries will usually use the original acknowledgement mode and will value this field as NE. MSH 2.24.1.16 Application acknowledgment type (ID-2, Optional) 00016 Definition: Identifies the conditions under which application acknowledgments are required to be returned in response to this message. Required for enhanced acknowledgment mode. See HL7 Table 0155 - Accept/Application acknowledgment conditions for values. 23 The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our examples, we have specified that the application acknowledgement is always required. This mode specifies that the message be acknowledged at the application level. The reasoning is that it is not sufficient to know that the underlying communications system guaranteed delivery of the message. It is also necessary to know that the receiving application processed the data successfully at a logical application level. In our examples, we have specified that the accept acknowledgment (MSH-15) is never required, but the application acknowledgment (MSH-16) is always required. MSH 2.24.1.17 Country code (ID-2, Optional) 00017 Definition: Defines the country of origin for the message. It is used primarily to specify default elements, such as currency denominations. ISO 3166 provides a list of country codes that may be used (see User-defined Table 0212 - Nationality ). The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our examples, we have not specified a country. When left blank, we assume this field to be the USA. MSH 2.24.1.18 Character set (ID-10, Optional, Repeating) 00692 Definition: Contains the character set for the entire message. Refer to HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate character sets for valid values of alternate character sets. The default set (if the field is left blank) is the printable 7-bit ASCII character set. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. MSH 2.24.1.19 Principal language of message (CE-60, Optional) 00693 Definition: Contains the principal language of the message. HL7 recommends ISO 639 codes. See User-defined Table 0296 - Language . The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding sy stem components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our examples, we have not valued this field. MSH 2.24.1.20 Alternate character set handling (ID-20, Optional) 01317 Definition: When alternative character sets are used as specified in the second or later components of MSH-18 - Character S ets, any special handling scheme needed can be specified in this component according to HL7 Table 0356 - Alternative character set handling scheme . The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. 24 2.24.2 Message Acknowledgment (MSA) Segment Used to send information while acknowledging another message. MSA Attributes SEQ LEN DT R/O RP/# TBL# ITEM# ELEMENT NAME 1 2 ID R 0008 00018 Acknowledgment code 2 20 ST R 00010 Message con trol ID 3 80 ST O 00020 Text message 4 15 NM O 00021 Expected sequence number 5 1 ID B 0102 00022 Delayed acknowledgment type 6 100 CE O 00023 Error condition Example: MSA |AA|19970522GA40|<CR> In this example MSA segment, the receiving system is replying to the sending system with an application accept acknowledgement indicating that the message was processed successfully and echoing the sender's message control ID --19970522GA40. 2.24.2.0 MSA field definitions MSA 2.24.2.1 Acknowledgment code (ID-2, Required) 00018 Definition: Valid codes are given in HL7 Table 0008 - Acknowledgment code to indicate accept, reject, error, etc. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our VXX and VXR examples, the code is AA = Application Accept. Our Acknowledgment Message #1 example shows AE = Application Error. MSA 2.24.2.2 Mes sage control ID (ST-20, Required) 00010 Defini tion: Message control ID of the message sent by the sending system. It allows the sending system to associate this response with the message for which it is intended. In our VXX example, the message control ID of 19970522GA40 sent from the Georgia state registry in the query is echoed. This should be the same ID that was sent by the sending system in MSH-10. MSA 2.24.2.3 Text message (ST-80, Optional) 00020 Definition: Optional text field that further describes an error condition. This text may be printed in error logs or presented to an end user. In our Acknowledgment message with error example, we have valued this field to show that the sending system failed to value a required field. The text reads, \"No patient identifier list.\" MSA 2.24.2.4 Expected sequence number (NM-15, Optional) 00021 Definition: Optional numeric field used in the sequence number protocol. In our examples, we have not valued this field. MSA 2.24.2.5 Delayed acknowledgment type (ID- 1, Backwards Compatibility) 00022 25 Definition: Valid codes given in HL7 Table 0102 - Delayed acknowledgment type . Used only as described in the HL7 Standard Section 2.5.2. Otherwise this field is not used. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. MSA 2.24.2.6 Error condition (CE-100, Optional) 00023 Definition: CE data type field allows the acknowledging system to use HL7 Table 0357- Message error status codes to further specify AR (application reject) or AE (application error) type acknowledgments. This field allows a coded replacement for MSA-3-text message. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4- 6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our examples, we have not valued this field. Immunization registries may wish to develop codes to represent various types of errors from their participants. 26 2.24.3 Error (ERR) Segment Used to add error comments to acknowledgment messages. If the message was rejected for f unctional reasons, this segment will locate the error and describe it using locally established codes. ERR A ttributes SEQ LEN DT R/O RP/# TBL# ITEM# ELEMENT NAME 1 80 CM R Y 0357 00024 Error code and location Example: ERR |PID^^3^ID|<CR> This error segment shows that an error was located in the third field of the PID segment, where the patient identifier list (PID-3) was missing. 2.24.3.0 ERR field definitions ERR 2.24.3.1 Error code and location (CM-80, Required, Repeating) (00024) Definition: Identifies an erroneous segment in the message received. The second component is an index if more than one segment of a specific type repeats. For systems that do not use the HL7 Encoding Rules, the data item number may be used for the third component. The fourth component (which references HL7 Table 0357 - Message error status codes ) is restricted from having any subcomponents, since it is a CE data type and the subcomponent separator is now the CE's comp onent separator. The specific components of fields using the CM data type are defined within the field descriptions. The components for this field are: <segment ID (ST)>^<sequence (NM)>^<field position (NM)>^<code identifying error (CE)> In our Acknowledgment Message example with error, we show an error in the PID segment, field 3. 27 2.24.22 Query Acknowledgment (QAK) Segment Used to send information with responses to a query. QAK Attributes SEQ LEN DT R/O RP/# TBL# ITEM# ELEMENT NAME 1 32 ST C 00696 Query tag 2 2 ID O 0208 00708 Query response status Example: QAK |19970522GA05|NF|<CR> This example query acknowledgement segment shows that the query with the query tag 19970522GA05 was processed, but no matches to the query parameters were found. 2.24.22.0 QAK field definitions QAK 2.24.22.1 Query tag (ST-32, Conditional) 00696 Definition: This field may be valued by the initiating system to identify the query and may be used to match response messages to the originating query. If it is valued, the responding system is required to echo it back as the first field in the QAK. This field differs from MSA-2-message control ID in that its value remains constant for each message associated with the query (i.e., all continuation messages), whereas MSA-2-message control ID may vary with each continuation message, since it is associated with each individual message, not the query as a whole. In our Acknowledgment Example #2 (with no records found), we show the Massachusetts registry reflecting the Query ID (QRD-4) sent in the query from the Georgia registry. QAK 2.24.22.2 Query response status (ID-2, Optional) 00708 Definition: This field allows the responding system to return a precise response status. It is especially useful in the case where no data is found that matches the query parameters, but where there is also no error. It is defined with HL7 Table 0208 - Query response status. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values . In our Acknowledgment Example #2 (with no records found), we show the Massachusetts registry advising the Georgia registry that it processed the query, but found no matches to the query parameters. Note that some registries plan to use this acknowledgment when they do not have consent to exchange the record. (See discussion at PD1-12.) 28 2.24.4 Query Definition (QRD) Segment Used to define a query.

The sending system expects a record-oriented response to be sent immediately from the State Immunization Information System (SIIS). 2.24.4.0 QRD 00025 Definition: Date the query was generated by the application program. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. In both query examples, the query was generated on May 22, 1997, at 4:05 p.m. QRD 2.24.4.2 Query format code (ID-1, Required) 00026 Definition: Valid format codes are given in HL7 Table 0106 - Query/response format code . The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In both query examples, we use the record-oriented format (R). QRD 2.24.4.3 Query priority (ID-1, Required) 00027 Definition: Time frame in which the response is expected. Table values and subsequent fields specify time frames for response. HL7 Table 0091 - Query priority gives valid codes. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In both query examples, we expect an immediate response (I). 29 VXQ Example #1 follows the same formula as in MSH-10. While MSH-10 demonstrates the 40th message of the day, the QRD-4 field reveals that this is the 5th query of the day from the Georgia system. QRD 2.24.4.4 Query ID (ST-10, Required) 00028 Definition: Unique identifier for the query. Assigned by the querying application. Returned intact by the responding application. Q RD 2.24.4.5 Deferred response type (ID-1, Optional) 00029 Definition: Valid entries are from HL7 Table 0107 - Deferred response type , to indicate before or later than the date/time specified. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our examples, we have not specified a date/time of response, because we expect an immediate response (see 2.24.4.3 above). QRD 2.24.4.6 Deferred response date/time (TS-26, Optional) 00030 Definition: Date/time before or after which to send a deferred response. If not present, the response can be sent when it is available. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. In our examples, we have not specified a response date/time. QRD 2.24.4.7 Quantity limited request (CQ-10, Required) 00031 Definition: Maximum length of the response that can be accepted by the requesting system. Valid responses are numerical values given in units specified in the second component. HL7 Table 0126 - Quantity limited request gives valid entries, with codes for characters, lines, pages, records, or locally defined. The default value is lines. CQ data type components: <quantity (NM)>^<units (CE)> Our query examples specify a maximum length of 25 records. QRD 2.24.4.8 Who subject filter (XCN-60, Required, Repeating) 00032 Definition: Identifies the subject of the query or who the inquiry is about. The field is allowed to repeat. XCN data type components: or name (ST)>^<suffix (e.g., Jr. or III) (ST)>^<prefix (e.g., Dr.) (ST)>^<degree (e.g., MD) (IS)>^<source table (IS)>^<assigning authority (HD)>^<name type code (ID)>^<identifier check digit (ST)>^<code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)>^<identifier type code (IS)>^<assigning facility ID (HD)>^<name representation code (ID)> Subcomponents of assigning authority: <namespace ID (IS)>&<universal ID (ST)> <universal facility: ID (IS)>&<universal ID (ST)> <universal ID type (ID)> In our VXQ example #1, we are sending a query for the record of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Jr. Our VXQ example #2 demonstrates giving only the name of John Kennedy as the subject of the query. 30 QRD 2.24.4.9 What subject filter (CE-60, Required, Repeating) 00033 Definition: Describes the kind of information required to satisfy the request. Valid codes are given in HL7 Table 0048 - What subject filter and may be extended locally during implementation. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our query examples, we specify Vaccine Information (VXI). QRD 2.24.4.10 What department data code (CE-60, Required, Repeating) 00034 Definition: Can include drug code, item number, etc., consistent with the subject in 2. 24.4.9. Can contain multiple occurrences separated by repetition delimiters. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our VXQ #1, VXQ #2, VXX, and VXR examples, we have specified State Immunization Information Systems (SIIS) in this field. QRD 2.24.4.11 What data code value qualifier (CM-20, Optional, Repeating) 00035 Definition: Further refines the inquiry by data code qualifiers by providing a window or range to further refine the inquiry. This field contains components giving start and stop code values. The specific components of fields using the CM data type are defined within the field descriptions. The components for this field are: <first data code value (ST)>^<last data code value (ST)> In our examples, we have not valued this field. QRD 2.24.4.12 Query results level (ID-1, Optional) 00036 Definition: Used to control level of detail in results. HL7 Table 0108 - Query results level gives valid values. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. 31 2.24.5 Query Filter (QRF) Segment Used with the QRD segment to further refine the content of a query.

QRF 2.24.5.1 Where subject filter (ST-20, Required, Repeating) 00037 Definition: Identifies the department, system, or subsystem to which the query pertains. This field may repeat. In our VXQ example #1, the query pertains to the Massachusetts immunization registry. QRF 2.24.5.2 When data start date/time (TS-26, Optional) 00038 Definition: Data representing dates and times the same as or after this value should be included. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. In our VXQ example #1, we have not specified a date for record inclusion, because we want the entire vaccine record. QRF 2.24.5.3 When data end date/time (TS-26, Optional) 00039 Definition: Data representing dates and times the same as or before this value should be included. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> 32 Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. In our VXQ example #1, we have not specified an end date for record inclusion, because we want the entire vaccine record. QRF 2.24.5.4 What user qualifier (ST-60, Optional, Repeating) 00040 Definition: An identifier to further define characteristics of the data of interest. The field is allowed to repeat. In our query examples, we have not valued this field. QRF 2.24.5.5 Other query subject filter (ST-60, Optional, Repeating) 00041 Definition: A filter defined locally for use between two systems. This filter uses codes and field definitions which have specific meaning only to the applications and/or sites involved. The field is allowed to repeat. If one of the fields has no value, it is left empty in the repeating field. The requestor may send values for all the components that are known or may limit the items according to a search formula. For vaccination data, QRF-5 should be structured as shown in the table below to transmit up to ten separate search \"keys.\" These search keys are used to identify one patient's immunization record and include a wide variety of possible identifiers. The format of each possible search key is given below. These keys are transmitted as strings separated by repeat delimiters. The position of the components within QRF-5 is significant, as the position of an occurrence in this field defines the characteristic. Data items will be given in this order: <patient Social Security number>~<patient birth date>~<patient Social Security number>~<father's name>~<father's Social Security number>. If one of the fields has no value, it is left empty in the repeating field, with a repeat delimiter holding its place. Posi -tion Component Data Type Description/Examples 1 Patient Social Security Number~ ST In U.S., use SSN without hyphens between 3rd and 4th digits and 5th and 6th digits, e.g., 123456789. In other countries , universal patient ID such as National Health Service number may be used. 2 Patient Birth Date~ DT July 4, 1976 = 19760704 3 Patient Birth State~ ID In U.S., use 2 -letter postal code, e.g., IN, NY, CA. In other countries, locally applicable p ostal table may be used. 4 Patient Birth Registration Number~ ST State birth certificate number 5 Patient Medicaid Number~ ST When relevant 6 Mother's Maiden Name~ ST Family name of mother before marriage. E.g., Jones 8 Mother's Social Security Number~ ST In U.S., use SSN without hyphens between 3rd and 4th digits and 5th and 6th digits, e.g ., 33 123456789. In other countries, universal patient ID such as National Health Service number may be used. 9 Father's Number ST In U.S., use SSN without hyphens between 3rd and 4th digits and 5th and 6th digits, e.g., 123456789. In other countries, universal patient ID such as National Health Service number may be used. 34 2.23.3 HL7 BATCH PROTOCOL Use of the File/Batch Header (BHS) and Trailer (BTS) Segments A batch of HL7 messages may be sent online using a common file transfer protocol or offline via tape or diskette. If needed, a group of batches may be sent using the file header and trailer segments. The FHS and FTS are optional and need not be sent if the transaction is one batch of records. Both the batch header segment (BHS) and the file header segment (FHS) have fields that provide unique ID's for these segments. The file/batch syntax follows. [FHS] (file header segment) { [BHS] (batch header segment) {[MSH or more HL7 messages) .... .... ]} [BTS] (batch trailer segment) HL7 VXU messages being sent from the Indian Health Service Clinic 0032 to the Massachusetts Immunization Registry on May 22, 1995, at 4:05 p.m. If a group of batches were sent, an FHS would be added at the beginning of the message and an FTS at the end. 2.24.11 File Header (FHS) Segment Used to head a file (group of batches).

Each component is an NM data type. This field may be defined as a CM data type for backwards compatibility with HL7 2.2 and 2.1. Users of the field in later HL7 2.x versions should use the NM data type and define it as \"repeating\" as illustrated below. Components: <total 1 (NM)>~<total 2 (NM)>~.... 38 3.3 PATIENT ADMINISTRATION MESSAGE SEGMENTS 3.3.2 Patient Identification (PID) Segment Used by all applications as the primary means of communicating patient identification information. This segment contains permanent patient identifying and demographic information that, for the most part, is not likely to change frequently.

His date of birth was October 7, 2000. Additional identifying information given in the message is: telephone number, 678-555-1212; State registry number 00725. 3.3.2.0 PID field definitions Usage notes: There are several PID fields that we do not anticipate that immunization registries will need to use, so we do not provide definitions for them here. These are PID-2,4,12,16-20,26-28. Several of these fields refer to types of patient identifiers. 39 With Version 2.3.1, HL7 recommends using PID-3-patient identifier list for all patient identifiers. NIP encourages immunization registries to conform to the HL7 Version 2.3.1 recommendation by repeating PID-3 to report these identifiers along with the appropriate identifier type code ( User-defined Table 0203 - Identifier type ). Previous versions of these guidelines based on HL7 Version 2.3 recommended that immunization registries use PID-4 - Alternate patient ID to record the patient's birth certificate or birth registration number assigned by the state at birth. In addition, it was formerly recommended that the patient's Social Security number be recorded in PID-19 - SSN - patient. The HL7 recommendation as stated above supercedes those recommendations. PID 3.3.2.1 Set ID - PID (SI-4, Optional) 00104 Definition: The Set ID field numbers the repetitions of the segment. For the first occurrence of the segment, the sequence number shall be one, for the second occurrence, the sequence number shall be two, etc. SI data type is a non-negative integer in the form of an NM field. The uses of this data type are defined in the chapters defining the segments and messages in which it is used. The VXX example shows the use of this field to number the four PID segments. For vaccine adverse event reporting, it is strongly recommended that information for only one patient be sent per message, in other words one PID per MSH. Thus PID-1 may be left blank or appear as: |1| PID 3.3.2.3 Patient identifier list (CX-20, Required, Repeating) 00106 Definition: This field contains the list of identifiers (one or more) used by immunization registries and their participants to uniquely identify a patient ( e.g., medical record number, billing number, birth registry, national unique individual identifier, etc.) CX data type components: <ID (ST)>^<check digit (ST)>^<code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)>^<assigning authority (HD)>^<identifier type code (IS)>^<assigning facility (HD)> Components are defined as follows: (1) ID number (ST). (2) Check digit (ST). Defined as in the CK data type except as a ST. The check digit used in this data type is not an add- on produced by the message processor. It is the check digit that is part of the identifying number used in the sending application. If the sending application does not include a self-generated check digit in the identifying number, this component should be valued null. (3) Code identifying check digit scheme employed (ID). Refer to HL7 Table 0061 - Check digit scheme for valid values . (4) Assigning authority (HD). Subcomponents of (4): <application 6 (ID)> (5) Identifier type code (IS). A code corresponding to the type of identifier. This code may be used as a qualifier to the \"Assigning authority\" component. Refer to User-defined Table 0203 - Identifier type for suggested values. (6) Assigning facility (HD). The place or location identifier where the identifier was first assigned to the patient-part of the history of the identifier. Subcomponents of (6): <namespace ID (IS)>&<universal ID (ST)>&<universal ID type (ID)> HL7 recommends that this field be used to record all patient identifiers. For that reason, the type code should always be used to identify what type of identifier is being listed. Values for the type code are found in User-defined Table 0203 - Identifier type . Immunization registries should retain all identifiers and type codes they receive for a patient to aid in matching records of patients seen by multiple providers. In our VXR example, we have listed a state registry ID, a local registry ID, the provider's medical record number, the patient's Social Security number, and the patient's Medicaid number. Other identifiers, such as WIC client number, birth certificate number, etc. may also be listed in this field. PID 3.3.2.5 Patient name (XPN-48, Required, Repeating) 00108 Definition: The current, assumed legal name of the patient should be sent in this field. The name type code in this field should always be \"L\" for \"Legal.\" All other names for the patient should be sent in PID-9-patient alias . Repetition of this field is allowed only for representing the same name in different 40 character sets, a situation that will rarely arise. Therefore, for practical purposes this field should be considered not repeating. XPN data type components: <family name (ST)>&<last name prefix (ST)>^<given name (ST)>^<middle initial or name (ST)>^<suffix (e.g., JR or III) (ST)>^<prefix (e.g., DR) (ST)>^<degree (e.g., MD) (IS)>^<name type code (ID)>^<name representation code (ID)> For valid values, refer to User-defined Table 0360 - Degree for the degree component, to HL7 Table 0200 - Name type for the name type code, and to HL7 Table 4000 - Name/address representation for the name representation code. In our VXU #1, VXU #2, and VXR examples, the patient is John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Jr., and the name type code is \"L\" for \"Legal.\" In all of our example fields that use the XPN data type, we do not value the last component because all of our messages use an alphabetic name representation. PID 3.3.2.6 Mother's maiden name (XPN-48, Optional) 00109 Definition: This field contains the family name under which the mother was born (i.e., before marriage). It is used to distinguish between patients with the same last name. The name type code should be valued \"M\" for \"Maiden Name.\" If a system needs additional information about the mother, the NK1 segment should be used. XPN data type components: <family name (ST)>&<last name prefix (ST)>^<given name (ST)>^<middle initial or name (ST)>^<suffix (e.g., JR or III) (ST)>^<prefix (e.g., DR) (ST)>^<degree (e.g., MD) (IS)>^<name type code (ID)>^<name representation code (ID)> For valid values, refer to User-defined Table 0360 - Degree for the degree component, to HL7 Table 0200 - Name type for the name type code, and to HL7 Table 4000 - Name/address representation for the name representation code. In our VXU #1, VXU #2, and VXR examples, the mother's maiden name is Bouvier, and the name type code is \"M.\" PID 3.3.2.7 Date of birth (TS-26, Optional) 00110 Definition: This field contains the patient's date and (if applicable) time of birth. If not present, the HHMM portion will default to 0000. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. In our examples that value this field, the patient's date of birth is June 7, 1990. PID 3.3.2.8 Sex (IS-1, Optional) 00111 Definition: This field contains the patient's sex. Refer to User-defined Table 0001 - Sex for valid values. The IS data type follows the formatting rules for an ST field except that it is drawn from a site-defined (or user-defined) table of legal values. In our examples that value this field, the patient's sex is male. PID 3.3.2.9 Patient alias (XPN-48, Optional, Repeating) 00112 Definition: This field contains names by which the patient has been known at some time. XPN data type components: <family name (ST)>&<last name prefix (ST)>^<given name (ST)>^<middle initial or name (ST)>^<suffix (e.g., JR or III) (ST)>^<prefix (e.g., DR) (ST)>^<degree (e.g., MD) (IS)>^<name type code (ID)>^<name representation code (ID)> 41 For valid values, refer to User-defined Table 0360 - Degree for the degree component, to HL7 Table 0200 - Name type for the name type code, and to HL7 Table 4000 - Name/address representation for the name representation code. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, we have used this field to indicate a different birth name, Baby Boy Kennedy. The name type code is valued \"B.\" PID 3.3.2.10 Race (CE-80, Optional, Repeating) 00113 Definition: This field identifies the patient's race. Refer to User-defined Table 0005 - Race for suggested values. This field is allowed to repeat, so several races may be reported for one patient. HL7's Version 2.3.1 did not suggest values for this table, so Version 2.0 of our Implementation Guide provided a table based on commonly used categories for data on race at that time, stating that \"values compliant with the OMB directive will be added when available.\" The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published a notice of revised standards for the classification of Federal data on race and ethnicity in the Federal Register on October 30, 1997 (hereinafter referenced as the OMB Notice). It directed the Bureau of the Census and other Federal programs to adopt the standards as soon as possible for data collections. The OMB Notice did not assign codes, but did establish categories of race and ethnicity with some differences from the previous standard. It established five minimum categories for data on race and two categories for data on ethnicity, but encouraged collection of greater detail. It also established two acceptable methods of reporting\u2014one maintaining race and ethnicity as separate categories and one that combined both of these (called the combined format). It stated that more detailed collections should be organized in a way that allowed aggregation into these minimum categories for data on race and ethnicity. In response to OMB's revised standard, representatives from several Federal agencies, including CDC, developed a code set that met the terms of the OMB Notice. HL7 also responded to this new need by recommending values for its User-defined Table 0005 - Race that were consistent with the OMB Notice and that adopted the codes for the minimum categories that were developed by the Federal agencies. The entire hierarchical list of numeric race and ethnicity categories is available at http://www.cdc.gov/od/hissb/docs/Race-EthnicityCodeSet.pdf . CIRSET members voted to change the recommendation in th is Guide for race coding to these newer codes to be consistent with Federal data collections, such as Census data, as well as Version 2.4 and later HL7 implementations. The first triplet of this data type should use codes found in User-defined Table 0005 - Race. The HL7 standard states that the second triplet of the CE data type for race (alternate identifier, alternate text, and name of alternate coding system) is reserved for governmentally- assigned codes. If codes from the more detailed hierarchy described above are needed, for example to denote specific American Indian tribal affiliations, they may be drawn from the code set at the URL given above and represented in the second triplet of the CE data type in this field, with the code set name CDCRE1 in the 6 th position of the second triplet. For example, if an immunization registry needed to represent the race of an American Indian patient who was a member of the Cherokee tribe, this field could be valued as: |1002-5^American Indian or Alaska Native^HL70005^1088-4^Cherokee^CDCRE1| The differences between the NIP-assigned race codes in the original Guide and the numeric race codes from HL7 Version 2.4's User-defined Table 0005 - Race are in the categories of Asian and Pacific Islander. Immunization registries that collect race data will transition to the newer HL7 codes in the first triplet of the race field's CE data type as quickly as possible. Immunization registries that have implemented messaging based on the original User-defined Table 0005 - Race may continue to provide this information in its original form during the transition by repeating the field and valuing the first triplet of the CE data in the repeated field with the original codes. Because the two affected categories will not map directly to the old categories, registries may map historical data collected before the availability of the revised OMB categories in these two categories to a code value of \"U,\" representing \"Unknown.\" The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: 42 (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, the patient's race is \"white PID 3.3.2.11 Patient address (XAD-106, Optional, Repeating) 00114 Definition: This field lists the mailing address of the patient. Multiple addresses for the same person may be sent in the following sequence: the primary mailing address must be sent first in the sequence; if the mailing address is not sent, then a repeat delimiter must be sent in the first sequence. If there is only one repetition of this field and an address type is not given, it is assumed to be the primary mailing address. XAD data type components: <street address (ST)>^ <other designation (ID)>^<other geographic designation (ST)>^<county/parish code (IS)>^<census tract (IS)>^<address representation code (ID)> For valid values in these components, refer to User-defined Table 0212 - Nationality for country codes, HL7 Table 0190 - Address type for address type codes, User-defined Table 0289 - County/parish for county/parish codes, User-defined Table 0288 - Census Tract for census tract codes, and HL7 Table 4000 - Name/address representation for address representation codes. We recommend the USPS format for recording street address, other designation, city, state, and zip or postal code (available at <www.usps.gov>). When sending multiple addresses, the appropriate type code must be indicated. The address order is by local convention, however, we recommend that immunization registries send in the following order: 1) primary (current) mailing address (required to be first); 2) place of birth (indicate facility address and county ; name of birth facility is recorded in PID-23-Birth place); and 3) residence at birth (registries may choose to indicate county and state alone). Note that county is a specific component of this data type and should not be duplicated in the \"other geographic designation\" component. Items to include here might be metropolitan statistical area (MSA) codes (available at <www.census.gov>) or school district number, for example. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, we have listed the current mailing address, birth facility address, and residence county at birth. The birth facility address is recorded here, but the birth facility name is recorded in PID-23. PID 3.3.2.13 Phone number - home (XTN-40, Optional, Repeating) 00116 Definition: The patient's personal phone numbers. All personal phone numbers for the patient are sent in this sequence. The first sequence is considered the primary number. If the primary number is not sent, then a repeat delimiter is sent in the first sequence. XTN data type format and components: [NNN] [(999)]999-9999[X99999][B99999][C any text]^<telecommunication code - Telecommunication use code and HL7 Table 0202 - Telecommunication equipment type for valid values. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, we have listed the primary home phone number for the patient. PID 3.3.2.14 Phone number - business Optional, Repeating) 00117 Definition: Patient's business phone number. Repetitions are permitted, with the first one being the primary number. If the primary number is not sent, then a repeat delimiter is sent in the first sequence. XTN data type format and components: [NNN] [(999)]999-9999[X99999][B99999][C any text]^<telecommunication code Refer HL7 0201 - Telecommunication use code and HL7 Table 0202 - Telecommunication equipment type for valid values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. PID 3.3.2.15 Primary language (CE-60, Optional) 00118 Definition: Patient's primary language. Refer to User-defined Table 0296 - Language (ISO 639) for suggested values. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, the patient's primary language 3.3.2.21 Mother's identifier (CX-20, Optional, Repeating) 00124 Definition: This field is used as a link field for newborns, for example. Typically a patient ID or account number may be used. This field can contain multiple identifiers for the same mother. Immunization registries will typically carry the majority of information about the mother in the NK1 segment. CX data type components: <ID (ST)>^<check digit (ST)>^<code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)>^<assigning authority (HD)>^<identifier type code (IS)>^<assigning facility (HD)> Components are defined as follows: (1) ID number (ST) (2) Check digit (ST) (The check digit used in this data type is not an add-on produced by the message processor. It is the check digit that is part of the identifying number used in the sending application. If the sending application does not include a self-generated check digit in the identifying number, this component should be valued null .) (3) Code identifying check digit scheme employed (ID) Refer to HL7 Table 0061 - Check digit scheme for valid values . (4) Assigning authority (HD) Subcomponents of (4): <application 6 (ID)> (5) Identifier type code (IS) A code corresponding to the type of identifier. This code may be used as a qualifier to the \"Assigning authority\" component. Refer to User-defined Table 0203 - Identifier type for suggested values. (6) Assigning facility (HD) Definition: The place or location identifier where the identifier was first assigned to the patient-part of the history of the identifier. Subcomponents of (6): <namespace ID (IS)>&<universal ID (ST)>&<universal ID type (ID)> In our examples, we have not valued this field. However, immunization registries may value this field with any number of identifiers for the patient's mother using type codes as described in PID-3 above and shown in User-defined Table 0203 - Identifier type . PID 3.3.2.22 Ethnic group (CE-80, Optional, Repeating) 00125 Definition: This field further defines patient ancestry. Suggested values are listed in User-defined Table 0189 - Ethnic group. This field is allowed to repeat, so several ethnic groups may be reported for one patient. HL7's Version 2.3.1 did not suggest values for this table, so Version 2.0 of our Guide provided temporary codes, stating that these were to be used in the second triplet (of the CE data type) until OMB-compliant codes were available. According to HL7's Version 2.4, \"the second triplet of the CE data type for Ethnic group (alternate identifier, alternate text, and name of alternate coding system) is 44 reserved for governmentally assigned codes.\" In the US, a current use is to report ethnicity following US federal standards for Hispanic origin. In the User-defined Table 0189 - Ethnic group , this Guide provides the ethnicity codes that were added to HL7's Version 2.4, along with the relevant numeric ethnicity codes to be used in the second triplet from the hierarchical list of numeric race and ethnicity categories that is available at http://www.cdc.gov/od/hissb/docs/Race-EthnicityCodeSet.pdf . The code set from which these codes are drawn may be referenced as CDCRE1. (See discussion of these codes at PID-10.) Immunization registries that have already implemented the older codes for collections of ethnic data should transition to the HL7 codes provided in User-defined Table 0189 - Ethnic group in the first triplet of the CE data type and should include the numeric ethnic group codes in the second triplet. Because the affected categories will map directly to the old categories, registries should be able to map historical data collected before HL7's Version 2.4 to the newer method with a minimum of effort. All new registry implementers of the HL7 messages that collect ethnic group data should use the HL7 codes provided in User-defined Table 0189 - Ethnic group in the first triplet of the CE data type and the numeric ethnic group codes in the second triplet. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, the patient's ethnic ancestry is \"not Hispanic or Latino,\" and we have s hown the use of both the HL7 ethnic code and the governmentally-assigned code to which it maps. PID 3.3.2.23 Birth place (ST-60, Optional) 00126 Definition: This field gives the location of the patient's birth. Immunization registries may use this field for the name of the facility where the patient was born. This information may be used in conjunction with PID-11-Patient address with address type as \"location of birthing facility.\" In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, we have specified \"Children's Hospital\" as the birth facility. The birth facility address is given in one repetition of PID- 11 with the code BDL. PID 3.3.2.24 Multiple birth indicator (ID-1, Optional) 00127 Definition: This field indicates whether the patient was part of a multiple birth. Refer to HL7 Table 0136 - Yes/No indicator for valid values. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. PID 3.3.2.25 Birth order (NM-2, Optional) 00128 Definition: If the patient was part of a multiple birth, a number indicating the patient's birth order is entered in this field. This field should only be used if PID-24-Multiple birth indicator is valued as \"yes.\" In our examples, we have not valued this field. PID 3.3.2.29 Patient death date and time (TS-26, Optional) 00740 45 Definition: This field contains the date and time at which the patient death occurred. This field should only be valued if PID-30 is valued \"yes.\" Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. In our examples, we have not valued this field. PID 3.3.2.30 Patient death indicator (ID-1, Optional) 00741 Definition: This field indicates whether or not the patient is deceased. Refer to HL7 Table 0136 - Yes/No indicator for valid values. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. 46 3.3.9 Patient Additional Demographic (PD1) Segment The patient additional demographic segment contains demographic information that is likely to change about the patient.

The authority that assigned this facility ID number is Lexington Hospital, which has 5678 as its organization identifier. Dr. Marcus Welby (his legal name), with doctor number 12345, is the patient's primary care physician. The patient may be sent both reminder and recall notices by mail, but no calls are acceptable. The patient has consented to share records and is active in the registry as of June 7, 1990. 3.3.9.0 PD1 field definitions Usage notes: We do not anticipate that immunization registries will use several PD1 fields (PD1- 1, 2, 5-10, 14-15; therefore, we do not provide definitions for them here. PD1-13, 16, 17 and 18 were requested for immunization registries and added to HL7's Version 2.4. Immunization registries may use the fields as described in this document in their Version 2.3.1 implementations, and the fields will be consistent with future versions of the standard. PD1 3.3.9.3 Patient primary facility (XON-90, Optional, Repeating) 00756 Definition: This field contains the name and identifier that specifies the primary care facility for the patient. Multiple names and identifiers are allowed for the same facility. The legal name of the facility must be sent in the first sequence. If the legal name of the facility is not sent, then the repeat delimiter must be sent in the first sequence. Immunization registries may use this field to indicate a patient's medical home. Hierarchical organizational structures may be reflected here.

In our VXU #2 and VXR #1 examples, we have listed a medical home facility and its assigning authority organization. PD1 3.3.9.4 Patient primary care provider name & ID no. (XCN-90, Optional, Repeating) 00757 Definition: This field contains the provider name and ID of the identified primary care provider. This information is usually selected by the patient at the time of enrollment in an HMO. This field is allowed to repeat and can provide multiple names for the same person. The legal name must be sent in the first sequence. If the legal name is not sent, then the repeat delimiter must be sent in the first sequence. Immunization registries may use this field to indicate a patient's primary care provider or medical home provider.

PD1 3.3.9.10 Duplicate patient (CX-20, Optional, Repeating) 00762 Definition: This field indicates that a patient is the same as, or a duplicate of, another patient found on the sending system. The intent is to be informational only-no action is required by the receiver. Include the patient identifier if the sender knows an identifier for the patient. The assigning authority and identifier type code are strongly recommended for all CX data types. Refer to User-defined Table 0203 - Identifier type for suggested values for the identifier type code. CX data type components: <ID (ST)>^<check digit (ST)>^<code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)>^<assigning authority (HD)>^<identifier type code (IS)>^<assigning facility (HD)> Components are defined as follows: (1) ID number (ST) (2) Check digit (ST) (The check digit used in this data type is not an add-on produced by the message processor. It is the check digit that is part of the identifying number used in the sending application. If the sending application does not include a self-generated check digit in the identifying number, this component should be valued null .) (3) Code identifying check digit scheme employed (ID) Refer to HL7 Table 0061 - Check digit scheme for valid values . (4) Assigning authority (HD) Subcomponents of (4): <application 6 (ID)> (5) Identifier type code (IS) A code corresponding to the type of identifier. This code may be used as a qualifier to the \"Assigning authority\" component. Refer to User-defined Table 0203 - Identifier type for suggested values. (6) Assigning facility (HD) Definition: The place or location identifier where the identifier was first assigned to the patient-part of the history of the identifier. Subcomponents of (6): <namespace ID (IS)>&<universal ID (ST)>&<universal ID type (ID)> In our examples, we have not valued this field. PD1 3.3.9.11 Publicity code (CE-80, Optional) 00743 48 Definition: This field contains a user-defined code indicating what level of publicity is allowed (e.g., no publicity, family only) for the patient. This field will be used by immunization registries to indicate whether reminder/recall notices may be sent to a patient. Refer to User-defined Table 0215 - Publicity code for valid values. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, the patient may be sent both reminder and recall notices by mail. PD1 3.3.9.12 Protection indicator (ID-1, Optional) 00744 Definition: This field identifies whether access to information about this person should be kept from users who do not have adequate authority for the patient. Refer to HL7 Table 0136 - Yes/No indicator for valid values. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. This field will be used by immunization registries to indicate whether or not consent has been given (or assumed) for record sharing. It can have 3 values with the following meanings: 1) null, designated by \"\" (see section 2.6 of HL7 Version 2.3.1 for discussion of null value). Null will indicate that patient/guardian has not yet been asked to give consent to share or has not responded; 2) Y - sharing is allowed (patient has given consent or consent is implied); 3) N - sharing is not allowed (patient has refused consent ). For registries with required consent (e.g., California), the suggested default value for this field is null (\"\") to indicate that consent has not yet been requested or received. For registries with implied consent (e.g., Georgia), the suggested default value is \"Y\" to allow sharing unless the patient specifically refuses consent. When a registry receives a request for a record for which record sharing is not permitted (value is N), that application should return a QAK query acknowledgment with the query response status field valued as \"NF,\" meaning \"no data found, no errors.\" No other information should be provided. When PD1-12 is valued as \"N,\" that record should never be shared outside the scope outlined by the consent agreement. In the mistaken case that a sending application sends or updates a record for which PD1-12 is \"N,\" the receiving application should not process the message. A QAK segment should be returned to the sending application indicating \"AE\" for \"application error\" in the query response status field. MSA-3, Text message, should be valued to indicate that PD1-12 was \"N\" so the record was not processed and should not be re-sent. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, the patient has consented to sharing, so the value indicated is \"Y.\" PD1 3.3.9.13 Protection indicator effective date (DT-8, Optional) 01566 Note: This field was added to HL7's Version 2.4 at NIP's request, but may be used by registries in Version 2.3.1 messages. Definition: Effective date for protection indicator reported in PD1-12. DT data type format: YYYY[MM[DD]] PD1 3.3.9.16 Immunization registry status (IS-1, Optional) 01569 Note: This field was added to HL7's Version 2.4 at NIP's request, but may be used by registries in Version 2.3.1 messages. 49 Definition: This field identifies the registry status of the patient. Examples include active, inactive, lost to follow-up, moved or gone elsewhere (MOGE). Refer to User-defined Table 0441-Immunization registry status for suggested values. Note that Table 0441, now a part of HL7's Version 2.4, is consistent with the former Table NIP006 - Patient registry status except that the code for Inactive has been changed by HL7 to \"I\" for consistency with other HL7 codes. A deceased patient should be recorded in PID-30, with date and time of death recorded in PID-29. The IS data type follows the formatting rules for an ST field except that it is drawn from a site-defined (or user- defined) table of legal values. In our VXR example, the registry status of the patient is active.

The effective date of his VFC and Medicaid status is June 7, 1990. Since a single VFC effective date is being submitted, this status should only be applied to the immunizations given on June 7, 1990. The eligibility status for the other immunization dates is unknown. Every effort should be made to associate an effective date with a corresponding immunization date. For instance, since the only status submitted in the sample PV1 segment has a date of June 7, 1990, no information about the eligibility status of the other incoming immunizations should be inferred from this message. It is also possible that a VFC status and date may be sent that was not related to an immunization event: the status may not be applicable to any immunizations in the message. 3.3.3.0 PV1 field definitions Usage notes: We do not anticipate that immunization registries will need to use several PV1 fields (PV1 3-19,21-52); therefore, we do not provide definitions for them here. PV1 3.3.3.1 Set ID - PV1 (SI-4, Optional) 00131 Definition: This field contains the number that identifies this transaction. For the first occurrence of the segment, the sequence number shall be one, for the second occurrence, the sequence number shall be two, etc. SI data type is a non-negative integer in the form of an NM field. The uses of this data type are defined in the chapters defining the segments and messages in which it is used. In our examples, we have not valued this field. PV1 3.3.3.2 Patient class (IS-1, Required) 00132 Definition: This field is used by systems to categorize patients by site. It does not have a consistent industry-wide definition. We recommend that immunization registries record all patients as recurring. Refer to User-defined Table 0004 - Patient class for suggested values. The IS data type follows the formatting rules for an ST field except that it is drawn from a site-defined (or user-defined) table of legal values. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, this is a recurring patient. PV1 3.3.3.20 Financial class (FC-50, Optional, Repeating) 00150 Definition: This field contains the financial class(es) assigned to the patient for the purpose of identifying sources of reimbursement. Immunization registries may use this field to indicate several items: 1) eligibility for the Vaccines For Children (VFC) program; 2) eligibility for state or local reimbursement programs; and 3) type of insurance plan (e.g., Medicaid, HMO, selfpay, etc.) . Refer to User-defined Table 0064 - Financial class for suggested values. FC data type components: <financial class (IS)>^<effective date (TS)> (1) Financial class (IS). The financial class assigned to a person. Refer to User defined Table 0064 - Financial class for suggested values. (2) Effective date (TS). The effective date/time of the person's assignment to the financial class specified in the first component. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, the patient is VFC-eligible because he is a Medicaid patient. 52 3.3.4 Patient Visit - Additional Information (PV2) Segment The PV2 segment is a continuation of the PV1 segment visit-specific PV2 Attributes SEQ LEN DT R/O TBL# ITEM# ELEMENT NAME 1 80 PL C 00181 Prior pending location 2 60 CE O 0129 00182 Accommodation code 3 60 CE O 00183 Admit reason 4 60 CE O 00184 Transfer reason 5 25 ST O Y 00185 Patient valuables 6 25 ST O 00186 Patient valuables location 7 2 IS O 0130 00187 Visit user code 8 26 TS O 00188 Expected admit date/time 9 26 TS O 00189 Expected discharge date/time 10 3 NM O 00711 Estimated length of inpatient stay 11 3 NM O 00712 Actual length of inpatient stay 12 50 ST O 00713 Visit description 13 90 XCN O Y 00714 Referral source code 14 8 DT O 00715 Previous service date 15 1 ID O 0136 00716 Employment illness related indicator 16 1 IS O 0213 00717 Purge status code 17 8 DT O 00718 Purge status date 18 2 IS O 0214 00719 Special program code 19 1 ID O 0136 00720 Retention indicator 20 1 NM O 00721 Expected number of insurance plans 21 1 IS O Y 0215 00722 Visit publicity code 22 1 ID O 0136 00723 Visit protection indicator 23 90 XON O Y 00724 Clinic organization name 24 2 IS O 0216 00725 Patient status code 25 1 IS O 0217 00726 Visit priority code 26 8 DT O 00727 Previous treatment date 27 2 IS O 0112 00728 Expected discharge disposition 28 8 DT O 00729 Signature on file date 29 8 DT O 00730 First similar illness date 30 80 CE O 0218 00731 Patient charge adjustment code 31 2 IS O 0219 00732 Recurring service code 32 1 ID O 0136 00733 Billing media code 33 26 TS O 00734 Expected surgery date & time 34 1 ID O 0136 00735 Military partnership code 35 1 ID O 0136 00736 Military non -availability code 36 1 ID O 0136 00737 Newborn baby indicator 37 1 ID O 0136 00738 Baby detained indicator 3.3.4.0 PV2 field definitions Usage notes: We do not anticipate that immunization registries will need to use any of the fields in the PV2 message segment; therefore, we do not define any of these fields further. 53 3.3.5 Next of Kin (NK1)/Associated Parties Segment Contains information about the patient's next of kin and other associated or related parties.

The NK1 segment should be used to send the mother's full name (a core data element). NK1- 2 - Name may be repeated to also send the mother's maiden name. If the mother's maiden name is sent in the NK1, it should also be mapped to PID-6 - Mother's maiden name . NK1 (SI-4, Required) 00190 Definition: The Set ID field numbers the repetitions of the segment within its association with the PID. For the first occurrence of the segment, the sequence number shall be one, for the second occurrence, the sequence number shall be two, etc. SI data type is a non-negative integer in the form of an NM field. The uses of this data type are defined in the chapters defining the segments and messages in which it is used. In our VXX, VXU #2 and VXR examples, 1 indicates that this segment is the first set of next of kin data, in this case the mother's information, and 2 indicates that this is the second next of kin data, the father's. NK1 3.3.5.2 Name (XPN-48, Optional, Repeating) 00191 Definition: This field gives the name of the next of kin or associated party. Multiple names for the same person are allowed, but the legal name must be sent in the first sequence. If the legal name is not sent, then the repeat delimiter must be sent in the first sequence. XPN data type components: <family name (ST)>&<last name prefix (ST)>^<given name (ST)>^<middle initial or name (ST)>^<suffix (e.g., JR or III) (ST)>^<prefix (e.g., DR) (ST)>^<degree (e.g., MD) (IS)>^<name type code (ID)>^<name representation code (ID)> For valid values, refer to User-defined Table 0360 - Degree for the degree component, to HL7 Table 0200 - Name type for the name type code, and to HL7 Table 4000 - Name/address representation for the name representation code. In our VXU #1, VXU #2, and VXR examples, we have shown the mother as Jacqueline Lee Kennedy. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, we have also shown the father as John Fitzgerald Kennedy. In our VAERS ORU example, the vaccine administrator is Jane Lee Jones, who also completed the VAERS-1 for m. NK1 3.3.5.3 Relationship (CE-60, Optional) 00192 Definition: This field defines the personal relationship of the next of kin. User-defined Table 0063 -Relationship gives suggested values as defined in HL7 Standard Version 2.4. It is recommended that the original table in Version 2.0 of the Guide, which was based on X12N standard relationship codes, be replaced with the new HL7 table from Version 2.4 in order to keep the codes consistent with the newer HL7 implementations. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our vaccine record examples, we have used this field to code the relationships of the mother and father to the patient. This segment can be used to record information about any person with a relation to the patient. It is not limited to relatives, but the relationship to the patient should be coded. 55 NK1 3.3.5.4 Address (XAD-106, Optional, Repeating) 00193 Definition: This field lists the mailing address of the next of kin/associated party. Multiple addresses for the same person may be sent in the following sequence: the primary mailing address must be sent first in the sequence; if the mailing address is not sent, then a repeat delimiter must be sent in the first sequence. If there is only one repetition of this field and an address type is not given, it is assumed to be the primary mailing address. XAD data type components: <street address (ST)>^ <other designation (ID)>^<other geographic designation (ST)>^<county/parish code (IS)>^<census tract (IS)>^<address representation code (ID)> For valid values in these components, refer to User-defined Table 0212 - Nationality for country codes, HL7 Table 0190 - Address type for address type codes, User-defined Table 0289 - County/parish for county/parish codes, User-defined Table 0288 - Census Tract for census tract codes, and HL7 Table 4000 - Name/address representation for address representation codes. We recommend using the USPS format for recording street address, other designation, city, state, and zip or postal code (available at <www.usps.gov>). When sending multiple addresses, the appropriate type code must be indicated. In our examples, we have not valued this field. NK1 3.3.5.5 Phone number (XTN-40, Optional, Repeating) 00194 Definition: The next of kin/associated party's personal phone numbers. All personal phone numbers for the next of kin/associated party are sent in this sequence. The first sequence is considered the primary number. If the primary number is not sent, then a repeat delimiter is sent in the first sequence.

The first sequence is the primary number. If the primary number is not sent, then a repeat delimiter is sent in the first sequence. XTN data type format and components: [NNN] [(999)]999-9999[X99999][B99999][C any text]^<telecommunication code - Telecommunication use code and HL7 Table 0202 - Telecommunication equipment type for valid values. In our NK1 example on the preceding page, we have listed (404)554-9097 as the value for this field . NK1 3.3.5.16 Date/time of birth (TS-26, Optional) field contains the next of kin/associated party's date of birth. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. In our examples, we have not valued this field. 56 NK1 3.3.5.21 Living arrangement (IS-2, Optional) 00742 Definition: This field identifies the situation that the associated party lives in at his or her residential address. Refer to User-defined Table 0220 - Living arrangement for suggested values. Immunization registries may use this field to record whether this associated party lives with the patient. The IS data type follows the formatting rules for an ST field except that it is drawn from a site-defined (or user-defined) table of legal values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. NK1 3.3.5.29 Contact reason (CE-80, Optional, Repeating) 00747 Definition: This field identifies the role the next of kin/associated party plays with respect to the patient. Immunization registries may use this field to indicate the next of kin/associated party who is designated to receive reminder/recall notices, if applicable. This field may also be used to indicate the next of kin/associated party who is responsible for the patient's care. Refer to User-defined Table 0222 - Contact reason for suggested values. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our examples, we have not valued this field. NK1 3.3.5.33 Next of kin/associated party's This field contains identifiers for the next of kin/associated party. Examples include Social Security number, driver's license number, Medicaid number, WIC client number, etc. This field, not NK1-37 - Contact Person Social Security # , should be used to record all identifiers, including SSN. CX data type components: <ID (ST)>^<check digit identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)>^<assigning authority (HD)>^<identifier type code (IS)>^<assigning facility (HD)> Components are defined as follows: (1) ID number (ST) (2) Check digit (ST) (The check digit used in this data type is not an add-on produced by the message processor. It is the check digit that is part of the identifying number used in the sending application. If the sending application does not include a self-generated check digit in the identifying number, this component should be valued null .) (3) Code identifying check digit scheme employed (ID) Refer to HL7 Table 0061 - Check digit scheme for valid values . (4) Assigning authority (HD) Subcomponents of (4): <application 6 (ID)> (5) Identifier type code (IS) A code corresponding to the type of identifier. This code may be used as a qualifier to the \"Assigning authority\" component. Refer to User-defined Table 0203 - Identifier type for suggested values. (6) Assigning facility (HD) Definition: The place or location identifier where the identifier was first assigned to the patient-part of the history of the identifier. Subcomponents of (6): <namespace ID (IS)>&<universal ID (ID)> #2 VXR examples, we mother's SSN and 822- 54-6618 as the father's. 57 6.4 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT MESSAGE SEGMENTS Note: The Financial Management Message Segments listed below are optional segments in the message syntax for VXR and VXU. We do not anticipate immunization registries using these segments and do not provide field definitions or examples here. 6.4.6 Insurance (IN1) Segment The IN1 segment contains insurance policy coverage information necessary to produce properly pro-rated patient and insurance bills. 6.4.7 Insurance Additional Information (IN2) Segment The IN2 segment contains additional insurance policy coverage and benefit information necessary for proper billing and reimbursement. Fields used by this segment are defined by CMS (formerly HCFA) or other regulatory agencies. 6.4.8 Insurance Additional Information, Certification (IN3) Segment The IN3 segment contains additional insurance information for certifying the need for patient care. Fields used by this segment are defined by CMS (formerly HCFA ) or other regulatory agencies. 58 4.8 PHARMACY/TREATMENT ORDERS 4.3.1 Common Order (ORC) Segment Used to transmit fields that are common to all orders (all types of services that are requested).

ORC 4.3.1.24 Ordering provider address (XAD-106, Optional, Repeating) 01314 60 Definition: This field contains the address of the care provider requesting the order. XAD data type components: <street address (ST)> ^ <other or code(ST)> ^ <country (ID)> ^ < address type (ID)> ^ geographic (ST)> ^ <county/parish code <census tract (IS)> ^ <address representation code (ID)> For valid values in these components, refer to User-defined Table 0212 - Nationality for country codes, HL7 Table 0190 - Address type for address type codes, User-defined Table 0289 - County/parish for county/parish codes, User-defined Table 0288 - Census Tract for census tract codes, and HL7 Table 4000 - Name/address representation for address representation codes. In our VAERS ORU example, we have shown the address for the provider to be the same as that of the facility. 61 4.8.3 Pharmacy/Treatment Route (RXR) Segment The Pharmacy/Treatment Route Segment contains the alternative combination of route, site, administration device, and administration method that are prescribed. For immunization registries, the actual route and site used should be recorded. RXR Attributes SEQ LEN DT R/O RP/# Route 2 60 CE Site 3 60 CE O Administration Device 4 60 CE O 0165 00312 Administration Method 5 Example: RXR |IM^INTRAMUSCULAR^HL70162|LA^LEFT ARM^HL70163|<CR> This RXR segment shows that a vaccine was administered intramuscularly in the left arm. 4.8.3.0 RXR field definitions Usage notes: We do not anticipate immunization registries using several RXR fields (RXR-3-5); therefore, we do not provide definitions for them here. RXR 4.8.3.1 Route (CE-60, Required) 00309 Definition: This field is the route of administration (e.g., intramuscular, oral, etc.). Refer to HL7 Table 0162 - Route of administration for valid values. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, DTaP-Hib and DTaP 4.8.3.2 Site (CE-60, Optional) 00310 Definition: This field contains the site of the administration route (e.g., left arm, right leg). Refer to HL7 Table 0163 - Administrative site for valid values. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our examples, all of the vaccines for which route is indicated were given in the left arm. 62 4.8.14 Pharmacy/Treatment Administration (RXA) Segment The RXA segment carries pharmacy administration data. It is a repeating se gment in the VXR and VXU messages and can record unlimited numbers of ttributes SEQ LEN 4 NM R Give sub -ID counter 2 4 NM R 00344 Administration sub -ID counter 3 26 TS R 00345 Date/time start of administration 4 26 TS R 00346 Date/time end of administration 5 100 CE R 0292 00347 Administered code 6 20 NM R 00348 Administered amount 7 60 CE C 00349 Administered units 8 60 CE O 00350 Administered dosage form 9 200 CE O Y 00351 Administration notes 10 200 XCN O Y 00352 Administering provider 11 200 CM C 00353 Administered -at location 12 20 ST C 00354 Administered per (time unit) 13 20 NM O 01134 Administered strength 14 60 CE O 01135 Administered strength units 15 20 ST O Y 01129 Substance lot number 16 26 TS O Y 01130 Substance expiration date 17 60 CE O Y 0227 01131 Substance manufacturer name 18 200 CE O Y 01136 Substance refusal reason 19 200 CE O Y 01123 Indication 20 2 ID O 0322 01223 Completion status 21 2 ID O 0323 01224 Actio n code -RXA |0|1|19900607|19900607|08^HEPB-PEDIATRIC/ADOLESCENT^CVX|.5|ML^^ISO+|||||||| MRK12345||MSD^MERCK^MVX|<CR> This RXA segment shows that the first dose of a Hepatitis B vaccine, manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., was administered on June 7, 1990. The dosage of the vaccine was .5mL, and the lot number was MRK12345. 00342 Definition: Use this field if matching this RXA segment to a corresponding RXG segment. If not matching, this field's value is zero. For immunization registries, this field's value should always be zero. In our examples, the value is 0. RXA 4.8.14.2 Administration sub-ID counter (NM-4, Required) 00344 Definition: Starts with one the first time this medication is administered for this order and increases by increments of one with each additional administration of medication. This field can be used to record dose number for a particular vaccine series and product, if applicable. When the vaccine product administered is part of only one vaccine series (e.g., DTaP, MMR, etc.), a single digit number representing the series dose number should be entered. When a combination vaccine covering more than one series is administered, use the OBX segment to record dose numbers of various components as demonstrated at Section 7.3 of this document. If a vaccine is offered to the patient and refused, the number 0 should be recorded for the dose number in RXA-2 (see RXA-18 for recording refusal reason). 63 Since RXA-2 is a required field in HL7, registries who choose not to record dose number should enter \"999\" in this field. In our VXU #1, VXU #2, and VXR #1 examples, we show the first dose of Hepatitis B vaccine. In our VXU #2 and VXR #1 examples, we also show the fourth dose of DTaP and Hib vaccines (given in the first dose of a combination DTaP-Hib vaccine), the fifth dose of DTaP, and the first and second doses of MMR. Our VXR example also illustrates the administration of a tuberculosis test and the report of its result. RXA 4.8.14 .3 Date/time start of administration (TS-26, Required) 00345 Definition: This field records when the administration is started. We use this field to show the vaccination date. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. In our VXR #1 example, we show Hepatitis B given on June 7, 1990; DTaP's on December 7, 1990, and May 20, 1995; DTaP-Hib on September 7, 1991; and MMR's given on September 7, 1991, and May 20, 1995 . RXA 4.8.14.4 Date/time end of administration (if applies) (TS-26, Required) 00346 Definition: Where administration continues over some time, the end date/time may be recorded. For typical vaccines, the end of administration is the same as the start of administration given in RXA- 3 date/time start of administration , so the RXA-3 date is repeated in RXA-4. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. In our examples, the values for end of administration are the same as for start of administration. RXA 4.8.14.5 Administered code (CE-100, Required) 00347 Definition: This field identifies the medical substance administered. If the substance administered is a vaccine, CVX codes should be used in the first triplet to code this field (see HL7 Table 0292 - Codes for vaccines administered ). The second set of three components could be used to represent the same vaccine using a different coding system, such as Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) . The most up- to- date version of the CVX code set and a mapping between the CVX and CPT codes are available on the CDC/NIP website at <http://www.cdc.gov/nip/registry/cpt.htm>. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our VXU #1, VXU #2, and VXR #1 examples, we show administration of Hepatitis B vaccine. In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, we also show administration of MMR, DTaP-Hib, and DTaP vaccines. The first triplet of the CE data type gives the CVX vaccine codes as defined in HL7 Table 0292 - Codes for 64 vaccines administered . The second triplet gives the CPT codes for the same vaccine. The VXR #1 example also shows administration of a tuberculosis test. RXA 4.8.14.6 Administered amount (NM-20, Required) 00348 Definition: This field records the amount of pharmaceutical administered. The units are expressed in the next field, RXA-7. Registries that do not collect the administered amount should record the value \"999\" in this field. In our examples, the amount of each vaccine administered was .5 mL. RXA 4.8.14.7 Administered units (CE-60, Conditional) 00349 Definition: This field is conditional because it is required if the administered amount code does not imply units. Must be in simple units that reflect the actual quantity of the substance administered. It does not include compound units. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our examples, we show ML to designate milliliter and ISO+ as the coding system. If no coding system is listed, ISO+ is the default system. RXA 4.8.14.8 Administered dosage form (CE-60, Optional) 00350 Definition: The dosage form indicates the manner in which the medication is aggregated for dispensing, e.g., tablets, capsules, suppositories. In some cases, this information is implied by the dispense/give code in RXA-5. Use this field when the administered code does not specify the dosage form. Generally, immunization registries will not need to use this field. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined in Appendix 2, 2.8.3. In our examples, we have not valued this field. RXA 4.8.14 .9 Administration notes (CE-200, Optional, Repeating) 00351 Definition: Free text notes from the provider administering the medication. If coded, requires a user-defined table. If free text, place a null in the first component and the text in the second, e.g., |^this is a free text administration note|. Immunization registries may use this field to record information that is not found elsewhere in the message; e.g., indicate the source of information for this immunization record or, more generically, whether the immunization being reported has just been administered (new) or came from other records (historical). Refer to NIP-defined Table 0001 - Immunization Information Source for these codes. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding system (ST)> 65 CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our VXU #2 and VXR #1 examples, the Hepatitis B vaccine came from a parent's immunization history; the DTaP-Hib was new; and the information sources for the remaining immunizations (MMR and DTaP) are not stated. RXA 4.8.14.10 Administering provider (XCN-200, Optional, Repeating) 00352 Definition: This field is intended to contain the name and provider ID of the person physically administering the pharmaceutical. This person (the \"vaccinator\") should be listed first. In addition, immunization registries may desire to record the provider who ordered the immunization (the \"orderer\") and/or the person who recorded the immunization into the registry (the \"recorder\"). These persons may also be listed. In order to distinguish between these persons, the following identifier type codes should be used: VEI - for number; OEI - for orderer employee number (Note: The person identified by this code should be the same person listed in ORC-12, Orderer, for those systems that use the ORC segment); and REI - for recorder employee number. Components of the XCN or name (ST)>^<suffix (e.g., Jr. or III) (ST)>^<prefix (e.g., Dr.) (ST)>^<degree (e.g., MD) (IS)>^<source table (IS)>^<assigning authority (HD)>^<name type code (ID)>^<identifier check digit (ST)>^<code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)>^<identifier type code (IS)>^<assigning facility ID (HD)>^<name representation code (ID)> Subcomponents of assigning authority: <namespace ID (IS)>&<universal ID (ST)> <universal facility: ID (IS)>&<universal ID In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, the new vaccines were administered by Nurse Sally S. Smith, with ID number 1234567890 and ID type VEI. Dr. Robert A. O'Brian, ID number 1234567891, ordered the vaccinations and was listed with an OEI ID type. The historical vaccination was administered by Lisa Jones, with no ID number listed. RXA 4.8.14.11 Administered at location (CM-200, Conditional) 00353 Definition: Name and address of facility where medical substance was administered. The specific components of fields using the CM data type are defined within the field descriptions. The components for this field are: <point of care (IS)>^< room postal code (ST)>^<country (ID)>^<address (ID)>^<other geographic designation Subcomponents of facility <namespace ID (IS)>&<universal ID (ST)>&< ID type (ID)> In our VXU #2 and VXR examples, we used Child Healthcare Clinic at 101 Main Street, Boston, MA as the facility location for the new vaccinations. The historical vaccination was administered at Children's Hospital, with no further address. RXA 4.8.14.12 Administer per (time unit) (ST-20, Conditional) 00354 Definition: This field records the rate at which this medication was administered. Except for intravenous administrations, this field is not likely to be used by immunization registries. In our examples, we have not valued this field. RXA 4.8.14.13 Administered strength (NM-20, Optional) 01134 66 Definition: Use when RXA-5-administered code does not imply the strength. This is the numeric part of the strength, used in combination with RXA-14 Administered Strength Unit. In our VXU #2 and VXR #1 examples, we used this field only for Hepatitis B vaccine, where we indicated .5 mcg for the pediatric/adolescent formulation. RXA 4.8.14.14 Administered strength unit (CE-60, Optional) 01135 Definition: Use when RXA-5-administered code does not specify the strength. This is the unit of the strength, used in combination with RXA- 13-administered strength. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. Note: These units can be a compound quantity; i.e., the units may express a quantity per unit of time. For example, micrograms per hour (ug/hr) is an acceptable value. In our VXU #2 and VXR #1 examples, we used MCG for micrograms and ISO+ for the coding system for the Hepatitis B vaccine only. RXA 4.8.14.15 Substance lot number (ST-20, Optional, Repeating) 01129 Definition: This field records the lot number of the medical substance administered. Note: The lot number is defined as the number printed on the label attached to the container holding the substance and on the packaging that houses the container. If the substance is a vaccine and a diluent is required, a lot number may appear on the vial containing the diluent; however, any such identifier associated with a diluent is not the identifier of interest. The substance lot number should be reported, not that of the diluent. In our examples, the lot numbers (e.g., W2341234567 for second dose MMR) are listed for each of the newly administered vaccines. RXA 4.8.14.16 Substance expiration date (TS-26, Optional, Repeating) 01130 Definition: This field identifies the expiration date of the medical substance administered. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. Note: Vaccine expiration date does not always have a \"day\" component. Such a date may be transmitted as YYYYMM. In our VXU #2 and VXR #1 examples, the expiration date (e.g., June 30, 1995 for the second dose MMR) is listed for each of the newly administered vaccines. 67 RXA 4.8.14.17 Substance manufacturer (CE-60, Optional, Repeating) 01131 Definition: This field records the manufacturer of the medical substance administered. For purposes of transmission of immunization data in immunization registries, the MVX codes from the HL7 Table 0227 - Manufacturers of vaccines should be used. The manufacturer names and codes have changed over the years, and users are referred to the current codes that are located at www.cdc.gov/nip/registry/mvx.pdf . However, please note that the manufacturer names given in the second component of the CE data type in our examples continue to reflect the correct name and code at the time the vaccines in the example messages were administered. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. RXA 4.8.14.18 Substance refusal reason (CE-200, Optional, Repeating) 01136 Definition: When applicable, this field records the reason the patient refused the medical substance. Any entry in the field indicates that the patient did not take the substance. The vaccine that was offered should be recorded in RXA-5, with the number 0 recorded for the dose number in RXA- 2. See discussion at RXA 4.8.14.20 below. Do not record contraindications and immunities in this field. They should be recorded in OBX segments. See discussion at 7.3 --Observation Reporting Segments. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in tw o groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. If the vaccination is refused by the patient or guardian, this field will record the vaccine refusal reason. See NIP-defined Table 002 - Substance refusal reason for valid values. In our VXR #1 example, we show the DTaP vaccine being refused by parental decision. RXA 4.8.14.19 Indication (CE- 200, Optional) 01123 Definition: This field contains the identifier of the condition or problem for which the drug/treatment was prescribed. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in tw o groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. 68 (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our examples, we have not valued this field. RXA 4.8.14.20 Completion status (ID-2, Optional) 01223 Definition: This field indicates the status of the treatment administration event. Refer to HL7 Table 0322 - Completion status for valid values. If the substance is refused, RXA- 18 - Substance refusal reason should be valued as well. The vaccine that was offered should be recorded in RXA-5, with the number 0 recorded for the dose number in RXA-2. If the substance is not administered because it was contraindicated, an OBX segment may be provided to record the specific contraindication. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our VXR #1 example, we show \"RE\" to indicate that the DTaP was offered and was refused. The DTaP-Hib vaccine administration is shown as \"CP\" for complete. RXA 4.8.14.21 Action code (ID-2, Optional) 01224 Definition: Status of record. This field provides a method of correcting vaccination information previously transmitted with incorrect patient identifying information. Refer to HL7 Table 0323 - Action code for valid values. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our VXU #2 and VXR #1 examples, we showed the use of this field in the DTaP-Hib vaccine administration as \"A\" for add. RXA 4.8.14.22 System entry date/time (TS-26, Optional) 01225 Definition: This field records the date/time the administration information was entered into the source system. This field is used to detect instances where treatment administration information is inadvertently entered multiple times by providing a unique identification field. Under usual circumstances, this field would be provided automatically by the computer system rather than being entered by a person. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. In our VXR #1 and VXU #2 examples, we showed the use of this field in the DTaP-Hib vaccine administration as the computer-generated time of September 7, 1991 at 12:00:30. 69 7.3 OBSERVATION REPORTING SEGMENTS Use of OBX Segments OBX segments have great flexibility to report information. When properly coded, OBX segments report a large amount of information in a small amount of space. OBX segments within the ORU message are widely used to report laboratory and other clinical information. For immunization registries, these segments can be configured within the VXR and VXU messages to code adverse events, allergies related to vaccines, and many other kinds of data. For information that is commonly reported among registries, nationally standardized code sets such as Logical Observation Identifier, Names and Codes (LOINC\u00ae ) are preferred over local user-defined code sets to facilitate a common vocabulary among registries. Code sets in this document that HL7 allows to be user-defined will be agreed upon by participants in the development of this document so that registries can efficiently exchange information. Registries are discouraged from establishing their own code sets, and instead are asked to coordinate their data needs through NIP so that all users will have a common vocabulary. NIP will maintain the latest version of these tables on its web site at <www.cdc.gov/nip/registry>. The optional, repeating OBX segment in the VXR and VXU messages provides information about a single vaccine event. It includes a field that identifies what kind of observation will be recorded in this segment (e.g., contraindication-can be used to indicate what condition the patient had that contraindicated receipt of the vaccine when RXA-18 indicates that the vaccine was not given and the RXA dose number is valued as zero). The optional Notes and Comments (NTE) segment is allowed to repeat and may be inserted after any of the OBX segments. The note segment applies to the information in the segment that immediately precedes it, i.e., the observation reported in the preceding OBX segment. The NTE segment can carry any text relevant to the vaccine event or the observation and can give its source. The NTE segment is not further defined by HL7. HL7 does not require the use of a particular coding system to identify either the observation or the result. In the past, users tended to invent their own unique code systems for identifying tests and other clinical observations because standard codes were not available. Such local code systems suffice for transmitting information within single institutions, but present high barriers to aggregating data from many sources for research or for public health record systems. Standard code systems such as LOINC\u00ae and others included in User-defined Table 0396 now exist for many of these purposes, and we strongly encourage their use in immunization registry reporting. Standard codes can be sent as the only code, or they can be sent along with the local historic code as the second code system represented in the field (a CE data type allows for two coded representations of the same concept within a single field). When two different codes for the same information are sent this way in OBX segments, immunization registries should send the nationally standardized code in the first triplet of the CE data type. For immunization registries, several categories of information have been identified that may be reported using the OBX segment in immunization messages. LOINC\u00ae codes for values in OBX-3 are provided in NIP-defined Table NIP003 - Observation identifiers . NIP has defined other tables in this document NIP-defined Tables NIP001 , NIP002 , NIP004, and NIP005) that reflect concepts particularly relevant to immunization registry reporting where no standardized code set has been identified. The data type for the results shown in OBX-5 will be designated in OBX-2. Suggested data types for these results are provided in NIP-defined Table NIP003 - Observation Identifiers . Code tables for use in OBX-5 are also provided in NIP-defined Table NIP003 - Observation Identifiers . Examples of the following uses of OBX are given in the VXR examples: 1. Dose number for component antigens in combination vaccines when individual component dose numbers are different from the dose number of the combination vaccine 2. Contraindications, Precautions, and Immunities 3. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting (VAERS) 4. Date Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) Published 5. Date Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) Presented 6. Vaccines Due Next 70 7.3.1 Observation Request (OBR) Segment The Observation Request (OBR) segment is used within an Unsolicited Transmission of an Observation (ORU) message to define the attributes of a particular request for diagnostic services or clinical observations, and the attributes themselves follow the OBR in repeating OBX segments. The OBX segment is described in Section 7.3.2 below. In the VAERS ORU message, the first OBR identifies the message as a report using the VAERS-1 form. The subsequent OBR's describe particular parts of the report for which detailed information is provided in the associated OBX segments. As defined by the ORU syntax, there can be many OBX's per OBR, and there can be many OBR's per PID.

OBR 7.3.1.1 Set ID (SI-4, Optional ) 00237 Definition: This field identifies the sequence number of one of multiple OBR's under one PID. For the first order transmitted, the sequence number shall be 1; for the second order, it shall be 2; and so on. For example, the second OBR under a single PID would appear as |2|. For VAERS reporting, OBR segments serve to name sections of the report. The set ID number for each OBR increases by one from the previous OBR-1. The example above indicates that this is the sixth OBR of the message. OBR 7.3.1.4 Universal service ID (CE-200, Required) 00238 Definition: This field is the identifier code for the requested observation/test/battery. For vaccine adverse event reporting purposes, this field is used to identify the item on the VAERS- 1 (FDA) form for which information will follow in the OBX segments. Most OBR-4's have an assigned LOINC\u00ae code to specify the question on the VAERS form being addresse d. Refer to NIP Table 003 - Observation identifiers for VAERS reporting for valid entries. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our ORU example, we use the first OBR to identify this message as a VAERS-1 (FDA) report. Subsequent OBR's name specific items to be reported in the associated OBX's. OBR 7.3.1.7 Observation date/time (TS-26, Conditional) 00241 Definition: This field is the clinically relevant date/time of the observation. When the OBR is transmitted as part of a report message, the field must be valued . For VAERS ORU reporting, this field should be valued in the first OBR of the message with the date the VAERS form was completed. 72 * For vaccine adverse event reporting, LOINC codes are strongly recommended for OBX- 3. 7.3.2 Observation/Result (OBX) Segment Used to transmit an observation or observation fragment. It represents the smallest indivisible unit of a report . Its principal mission is to carry information about observations in report messages. The OBR, ORC, and OBX segments work together to provide a flexible structure for including detailed coded information. OBR gives general information about the details that will follow, ORC gives information on all services that are requested, while the OBX segment gives the specific, individual tests performed or report items (OBX-3) and the specific results for each test or answer for each report item (OBX-5). Vaccine adverse event reporting uses OBX-3 to state the subject of the information and OBX-5 to provide the specific related data.

These are OBX- 12-13. OBX 7.3.2.1 Set ID - observation simple (SI-4, Optional) 005 69 Definition: This field contains the sequence number. Since OBX is a repeating segment in immunization messages, the number in this field will increase by one for each OBX used for a single RXA. SI data type is a non-negative integer in the form of an NM field. The uses of this data type are defined in the chapters defining the segments and messages in which it is used. In our VXR #1 example, for the DTaP-Hib vaccine, we show the first and second sequence number for the two OBX segments. 73 In the VAERS example, the first OBX-1 after an OBR has the value of |1|. Each subsequent OBX- 1 increases its number by one. OBX 7.3.2.2 Value type (ID-3, Conditional) 00570 Definition: This field contains the data type which defines the format of the observation value in OBX-5. A full explanation of possible data types is given below so that users will have complete information. However, for immunization registries, this field will usually be CE, NM, ST, DT, or TS. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. Data types in OBX-2 . This field must be a standard HL7-defined data type. It must be valued if OBX- 11- Observ result status is not valued with an X, meaning no results can be obtained for this observation. If the value is CE then the result must be a coded entry. When the value type is TX or FT then the results are bulk text. Although NM is a valid type, observations which are usually reported as numbers will sometimes have the string (ST) data type because non-numeric characters are often reported as part of the result, e.g., >300 to indicate the result was off-scale for the instrument. In the example, \">300\", \">\" is a symbol and the digits are considered a numeric value. However, this usage of the ST type should be discouraged since the SN (structured numeric) data type now accommodates such reporting and, in addition, permits the receiving system to interpret the magnitude. All HL7 data types are valid, except CM, CQ, SI, and ID. This is because, for a CM definition to have meaning, the specifics about the CM must be included in the field definition. OBX-5-observation value is a general field definition that is influenced by the data type OBX-3 , so CMs are undefined in this context. CQ is invalid because units for OBX-5-observation value are always specified explicitly in an OBX segment with OBX-6 units . SI is invalid because it only applies to HL7 message segments, and ID because it requires a constant field definition. We allow the FT data type in the OBX segment but its use is discouraged. Formatted text usually implies a meaningful structure e.g., a list of three independent diagnoses reported on different lines. But ideally, the structure in three independent diagnostic statements would be reported as three separate OBX segments. TX should not be used except to send large amounts of text. In the TX data type, the repeat delimiter can only be used to identify paragraph breaks. Use ST to send short, and possibly encodable, text strings. In our VXR and VAERS examples, each OBX occurrence of this field is valued appropriately to represent the data type of the expected value in OBX- 5. OBX 7.3.2.3 Observation identifier (CE-80, Required) 00571 Definition: This field contains a unique identifier for the observation, or the thing being reported. The format is that of the Coded Element (CE). Example: OBX |9|CE|30963-3^Vaccine purchased with^LN||PBF^Public funds^NIP008||||||F|<CR>... ...in which 30963-3 is a LOINC code (with the name of this system coded in the third component as LN) for the subject of the observation, in this case \"vaccine purchased with.\" The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our VXR #1 example, we have valued this field to show what observation will be reported in OBX- 5. For example, following the RXA segment showing the administration of a DTaP vaccine, OBX-3 and 5 show the VIS publication date and the date the VIS was presented to the patient. Following the RXA segment showing the administration of a DTaP-Hib combination vaccine, OBX-3 and 5 indicate the individual dose numbers of each vaccine component. Following the RXA segment showing the 74 administration of the second MMR, the OBX-3 and 5 show the report of an adverse event. For the results of the tuberculosis test, we use an OBX segment to show a measurement of the reaction. For reporting of adverse events, OBX-3 is valued with the LOINC\u00ae code that represents the subject of the information being given in OBX- 5. Refer to NIP Table 003 - Observation identifiers for VAERS reporting for valid coded entries for VAERS reports. In both VAERS reports and vaccine due next reporting, we use the combining rule described in Section 7.1.2 of HL7's Version 2.3.1 to combine a general code with a more specific one to arrange information in a hierarchy. An example is shown below at OBX 7.3.2.4. OBX 7.3.2.4 Observation sub- ID (ST-20, Conditional) 00572 This field is used to distinguish between multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID. For example, a chest X-ray report might include three separate diagnostic impressions. The standard requires three OBX segments, one for each impression. By putting a 1 in the Sub-ID of the first of these OBX segments, 2 in the second, and 3 in the third, we can uniquely identify each OBX segment for editing or replacement. The sub-identifier can be further extended by adding decimals (e.g., 2.1, 2.2). The use of the sub ID to distinguish repeating OBXs for the same observation ID uses the sub ID to group related subdivisions of information within the overall observation category. Its use must be carefully structured to avoid introducing ambiguities. In our VXR #2 example, we have valued this field as \"1\" in the first set of 5 OBX segments and as \"2\" in the second give^LN|1|19900803I|||||F|<CR> OBX |5|CE|30979-9&30982-3^Reason to project this 6|CE|30979-9^Vaccines give^LN|2|19900722||||||F|<CR> OBX |10|CE|30979-9&30982-3^Reason applied by forecast logic to project this vaccine^LN|2|^ACIP schedule||||||F|<CR> (continues on next page) 75 75.1 Some i nformation about combination vaccines (vaccines that contain multiple component antigens) can be specific to an individual vaccine component. For example, there can be separate VIS statements for each vaccine component. In the example below the combination vaccine has two component vaccines. The RXA segment describes the entire combination vaccine and does not have a value in the Observation sub-ID. Following the RXA, the first set of 5 OBX segments describes one vaccine component so all have the value \"1\" in the Observation sub-ID. The next set of 5 OBX segments describes another vaccine component so all have the value \"2\" in the Observation OBX |10|ST|38890-0&30959-1^LOT^LN|2|WP95441||||||F|<CR> The following a simplified example that illustrates specifically how \"Dose number in series\" should be portrayed for a combination vaccine using the Observation sub-ID to group the OBX segments for each component vaccine type. Note the use of LOINC\u00ae codes 38890-0&30973-2 for every component vaccine dose number in series. This is preferred over the previous method for portraying \"dose count in combination vaccine\" which used a different LOINC\u00ae code for each component vaccine and which lacked a code for the dose count for the Polio vaccine component of a combination vaccine. RXA |0|1|19901207|19901207|110^DTAP/Polio/Hep 7.3.2.5 Observation value (User-assigned, Conditional, Repeating) 00573 Definition: This field contains the value observed. OBX-2-value type contains the data type for this field according to how the observation value is formatted. It is not a required field because some systems will report only normalcy/abnormalcy ( OBX-8 ), especially in product experience reporting. This field contains the value of, or amount reported, or response to OBX-3-observation identifier of the same segment. Depending upon the observation, the data type may be a number (e.g., a respiratory rate), a coded answer (e.g., a pathology impression recorded as a SNOMED code), or a date/time (the date/time that a unit of blood is sent to the ward). An observation value is always represented as the data type specified in OBX-2-value type of the same segment. This example is from the list of OBX's in section 7.3.2.4 above, where OBX-2 indicates that a numeric data type (NM) will be used in OBX-5 to provide the value of the subject named in OBX- 3. In this example, the vaccine due next dose number is \"1.\" OBX|8|NM|30979-9&30973-2^Vaccine due next dose number^LN|2|1||||||F|<CR> In our VXR #1 example, we give several demonstrations of use of this field: 1) to show that the VIS publication date for DTaP was June 5, 1990; 2) that the VIS was presented to the patient on December 7, 1990; and 3) that this is the fourth dose of DTaP and the fourth dose of Hib in the combination vaccine. For the second MMR, this field shows anaphylaxis as the adverse event. For the results of the tuberculosis test, we show a measurement of 1 mm. (continues on next page) For VAERS reporting, the same rules apply--the OBX-5 provides the specific data in response to the topic specified in the OBX-3. The data must be formatted according to the data type named in OBX- 2. OBX 7.3.2.6 Units (CE-60, Optional) 00574 Definition: This field contains the units for the observation value in OBX-5. The default value is ISO+abbreviation, as defined. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our VXR #1 example, we show the units to be millimeter s. OBX 7.3.2.7 References range (ST-60, Optional) 00575 Definition: When the observation quantifies the amount of a toxic substance, then the upper limit of the range identifies the toxic limit. If the observation quantifies a drug, the lower limits identify the lower therapeutic bounds and the upper limits represent the upper therapeutic bounds above which toxic side effects are common. If numeric, the values of this field may report several values in one of the following three formats: a) lower limit-upper limit (when both lower and upper limits are defined, e.g., for potassium 3.5 - 4.5) b) > lower limit (if no upper limit, e.g., >10) c) < upper limit (if no lower limit, e.g., <15) If alphabetical, the normal value may be reported in this location. In our examples, we have not valued this field. OBX 7.3.2.8 Abnormal flags (ID-5, Optional, Repeating) 00576 Definition: This field contains a table lookup indicating the normalcy status of the result. Refer to HL7 Table 0078 - Abnormal flags for valid entries. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our VXR #1 example, we show the reaction to the tuberculosis test to be normal. OBX 7.3.2.9 Probability (NM-5, Optional) 00577 Definition: This field contains the probability of a result being true for results with categorical values. It mainly applies to discrete coded results. It is a decimal number represented as an ASCII string that must be between 0 and 1, inclusive. In our examples, we have not valued this field. OBX 7.3.2.10 Nature of abnormal test (ID-2, Optional, Repeating) 00578 Definition: This field contains the nature of the abnormal test. 76 The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. OBX 7.3.2.11 Observation result status (ID-1, Required) 00579 Definition: This field contains the observation result status. Refer to HL7 Table 0085 - Observation result status codes interpretation for valid values. This field reflects the current completion status of the results for data contained in the OBX-5-observation value field. It is a required field. Previous versions of HL7 stated this implicitly by defining a default value of \"F.\" The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our VXR #1 example, we have valued all OBX-11 fields as F for final. OBX 7.3.2.14 Date-time of the observation (TS-26, Optional) 00582 Definition: Records the time of the observation. It is the physiologically relevant date-time or the closest approximation to that date-time of the observation. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. In our VXR #1 example of results of the tuberculosis test, we show the date of observation as April 18, 1990. OBX 7.3.2.15 Producer's ID (CE-60, Optional) 00583 Definition: Contains a unique identifier of the responsible producing service. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our examples, we have not valued this field. OBX 7.3.2.16 Responsible observer (XCN-80, Optional, Repeating) 00584 Definition: This field contains the identifier of the individual directly responsible for the observation (the person who either performed or verified it). Components of the XCN data type: or name (ST)>^<suffix (e.g., Jr. or III) (ST)>^<prefix (e.g., Dr.) (ST)>^<degree (e.g., MD) (IS)>^<source table (IS)>^<assigning authority (HD)>^<name type code (ID)>^<identifier check digit (ST)>^<code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)>^<identifier type code (IS)>^<assigning facility ID (HD)>^<name representation code (ID)> Subcomponents of assigning authority: <namespace ID (IS)>&<universal ID (ST)> <universal facility: ID (IS)>&<universal ID (ST)> & <universal ID type (ID)> In our examples, we have not valued this field. 77 OBX 7.3.2.17 Observation method (CE-60, Optional, Repeating) 00936 Definition: Used to transmit the method or procedure by which an observation was obtained. The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the <text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1-3 for the alternate or local coding system. In our examples, we have not valued this field. 78 2.24.15 Notes and Comments (NTE) Segment The NTE segment is defined as a common format for sending notes and comments. NTE Attributes SEQ LEN DT OPT RP/# TBL# ITEM# ELEMENT NAME 1 4 SI O 00096 Set ID -NTE 2 8 ID O 0105 00097 Source of comment 3 64k FT O Y 00098 Comment 4 60 CE O 01318 Comment type Example: NTE|||PATIENT DEVELOPED HIGH FEVER APPROX 3 HRS AFTER VACCINE INJECTION|<CR> In this NTE segment, we show a comment about the patient's reaction to the vaccination. 2.24.15.0 NTE field definitions NTE 2.24.15.1 Set ID - NTE (SI-4, Optional) 00096 Definition: This field may be used when multiple NTE segments are included in a message. SI data type is a non-negative integer in the form of an NM field. The uses of this data type are defined in the chapters defining the segments and messages in which it is used. In our examples, we have not valued this field. NTE 2.24.15.2 Source of comment (ID-8, Optional) 00097 Definition: This field is used to identify source of comment. HL7 Table 0105 - Source of Comment is used, but may be extended locally during implementation. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. In our examples, we have not valued this field. NTE 2.24.15.3 Comment (FT-64k, Optional, Repeating) 00098 Definition: This field contains the comment contained in the segment. Note: The FT data type without embedded formatting commands is compatible with the previous TX data type. In our VXR example, this comment field shows that the VAERS form was submitted by the provider. NTE 2.24.15.4 Comment type (CE-60, Optional) 01318 Definition: This field identifies the type of comment text. Allowable values are user-defined, but may include the following: PI - Patient Instruction, HS - Historical Record Comment. A separate NTE segment can be used for each type of comment (e.g., instructions on one NTE and remarks on another NTE). The CE data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. This type has six components arranged in two groups as follows: <identifier (ST)>^<text of alternate coding (ST)> CE data type components are defined in Appendix 2, 2.8.3. In our examples, we have not valued this field. 79 3.2 PATIENT ADMINISTRATION MESSAGE DEFINITIONS Use of the Optional Admission/Discharge, Transfer (ADT) Segments The HL7 standard defines many specialized ADT messages for administrative events dealing with patients; e.g., admit, discharge, transfer, merge record. The VXU message can be used for adding a person or additional information about the person, so ADT messages are not necessary for registries to communicate with each other. However, intercommunicating private providers and immunization registries may decide to use the ADT message when there is no immunization information, especially when the communicating partner already has implemented the ADT but not the VXU. The challenge for registries becomes to identify which ADT messages to use. There are 51 different ADT messages distinguished from each other by 51 different trigger event codes. At this writing, the set of ADT messages most likely to be needed by registries is not yet fully bounded. Registries are accepting the messages sent by their communicating partners. Registries may receive extra messages that they are not interested in, in which case it will need to handle them appropriately. 2.3.1 ADT messages currently identified and accepted by registries include (by event code): A01 (admit/visit notification) A04 (register a patient) A05 (pre-admit a patient) A08 (update patient information) A18 (merge patient information) A28 (add person information) A31 (update person information) A47 (change patient identifier list) As registry experience with ADT grows, this section of this document will be further refined. 80 ADT^A29 ADT Message HL7 Chapter MSH Message Header 2 EVN Event Type 3 PID Patient Identification 3 [PD1] Additional Demographics 3 PV1 Patient Visit 3 [ PV2 ] Patient Visit - Additional Info. 3 [ { DB1 } ] Disability Information 3 [ { OBX } ] Observation/Result 7 ADT^A28 ADT Message HL7 Chapter MSH Message Header 2 EVN Event Type 3 PID Patient Identification 3 [ PD1] Additional Demographics 3 [ { NK1 } ] Next of Kin /Associated Parties 3 PV1 Patient Visit 3 [ PV2 ] Patient Visit - Additional Info. 3 [ { DB1 } ] Disability Information 3 [ { OBX } ] Observation/Result 7 [ { AL1 } ] Allergy Information 3 [ { DG1 } ] Diagnosis Information 6 [ DRG ] Diagnosis Related Group 6 [ { PR1 Procedures 6 [{ ROL}] Role 12 } ] [ { GT1 } ] Guarantor 6 [ { IN1 Insurance 6 [ IN2 ] Insurance Additional Info. 6 [ {IN3} ] Insurance Add'l Info - Cert. 6 } ] [ ACC ] Accident Information 6 [ UB1 ] Universal Bill Information 6 [ UB2 ] Universal Bill 92 Information 6 ACK General Acknowledgment HL7 Chapter MSH Message Header 2 MSA Message Acknowledgment 2 [ERR ] Error 2 3.2.28 Admission/Discharge/Transfer and Ac knowledgment (ADT/ACK) - add person information (event A28) Definition: The A 28 event can be used to send everything that is known about a person. An A28 (add person information) or A31 (update person information) can also be used for back loading MPI information for the person, or for back loading all person and historical information from one system to another. 3.2.29 Admission/Discharge/Transfer and Ackno Definition: An A29 event can be used to delete all demographic information related to a given person. This event \"undoes\" an A28 (add person information) event. The information from the A28 event is deleted. This event is used, for example, when information was added in error, or when another record already exists for the person, or when one wants to purge the person from the database. When this event occurs, all visit and account level data for this person is also purged. 81 3.2.30 Admission/Discharge/Transfer and Acknowledgment (ADT/ACK) -merge person information (event A30) Definition: An A30 event can be used to merge person information in an MPI. An A30 (merge person information) is intended for merging person records without merging patient identifiers.

EVN 3.3.1.1 Event type code (ID-3, Backwards Compatibility) 0 0099 Definition: This field has been retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will use the second component (trigger event) of MSH-9 to transmit event type code. The value of an ID data type follows the formatting rules for an ST data type except that it is drawn from a table of HL7 legal values. EVN 3.3.1.2 Recorded date/time (TS-26, Required) 00100 Definition: Most systems will default to the system date/time when the transaction is entered, but they may permit an override. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. EVN 3.3.1.3 Date/time planned event (TS-26, Optional) 00101 82 Definition: The date/time the event is planned. Time stamp (TS) data type must be in the format: YYYY[MM[DD[HHMM[SS[.S[S[S[S]]]]]]]][+/-ZZZZ]^<degree of precision> Note: The optional degree of precision component is retained for backward compatibility only. Immunization registries will not value this component. EVN 3.3.1.4 Event reason code (IS-3, Optional) 00102 Definition: The reason for this event . Refer to User-defined Table 0062 - Event reason for suggested values. The IS data type follows the formatting rules for an ST field except that it is drawn from a site-defined (or user-defined) table of legal values. EVN 3.3.1.5 Operator ID (XCN-60, Optional, Repeating) 00103 Definition: The individual responsible for triggering the event. Refer to User-defined Table 0188 - Operator ID for suggested values.

A group of intercommunicating institutions, such as immunization registries, may establish a list of assigning authorities to serve as a master dictionary list. The assigning authority must be unique across applications at a given site. This field is required in HL7 implementations that have more than a single Patient Administration application assigning such numbers. We did not use the MRG segment in our examples, but do provide field definitions here for reference. MRG 3.3.8.1 Prior patient identifier list (CX-20, Required, Repeating) 00211 Definition: This field contains the internal prior patient identifier. This field contains a list of potential \"old\" numbers to match. Only one old number can be merged with one new number in a transaction. CX data type components: <ID (ST)>^<check digit (ST)>^<code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)>^<assigning authority (HD)>^<identifier type code (IS)>^<assigning facility (HD)> Components are defined as follows: (1) ID number (ST) (2) Check digit (ST) (The check digit used in this data type is not an add-on produced by the message processor. It is the check digit that is part of the identifying number used in the sending application. If the sending application does not include a self-generated check digit in the identifying number, this component should be valued null .) (3) Code identifying check digit scheme employed (ID) Refer to HL7 Table 0061 - Check digit scheme for valid values . (4) Assigning authority (HD) Subcomponents of (4): <application 6 (ID)> (5) Identifier type code (IS) A code corresponding to the type of identifier.

do not use3 RESERVED - do not use Usage Notes: 1. NOS=not otherwise specified; avoid using NOS codes except to record historical records that lack the indicated specificity. 2. As of August 27, 1998, Merck ceased distribution of their adolescent/high risk infant hepatitis B vaccine dosage. Code 42 should only be used to record historical records. For curr ent administration of hepatitis B vaccine, pediatric/adolescent dosage, use code 08. 3. Code 99 will not be used in this table to avoid confusion with code 999. 4. As of September 1999, a 2-dose hepatitis B schedule for adolescents (11-15 year olds) was FDA approved for Merck's Recombivax HB\u00ae adult formulation. Use code 43 for both the 2-dose and the 3 -dose schedules. 5. Code 998 was added for use in VXR and VXU HL7 messages where the OBX segment is nested with the RXA segment, but the message does not contain information about a vaccine administration. An example of this use is to report the vaccines due next for a patient when no vaccine administration is being reported. 6. As of May 2002, the FDA approved Aventis Pasteur's DTaP Daptacel for use in the also manufactures the DTaP vaccine Tripedia. Daptacel contains 5 pertussis antigens, while Tripedia contains 2 pertussis antigens. To distinguish between the two Aventis Pasteur DTaP vaccines, dose 106 was added to represent Daptacel. Use code 106 for Daptacel and code 20 for Tripedia and other DTaP vaccines User-defined Table 0296 - Language [ISO 639 suggested by HL7; selected 2-letter values listed from ISO 639:1988; The full set of ISO 639 Language Codes is available for purchase from <www.ansi.org>.

APPENDIX 2: Data Types used in this Implementation Guide HL7 Ref# Data Type Description Notes 2.8.3 CE -coded element with formatted values This data type transmits codes and the text associated with the code. To allow all six components of a CE data type to be valued, the suggested length of a field of this data type is at least 60. Components: <identifier ^<name of alternate (ST)> Components are defined as follows: (1) Identifier (ST). The code that uniquely identifies the item being referenced by the < text>. Different coding schemes will have different elements here. (2) Text (ST). Name or description of the item in question. (3) Name of coding system (ST). Identifies the coding system used. The combination of the identifier and the name of the coding system components will be a unique code for a data item. (4-6) Three components analogous to 1 -3 for the alternate or local coding system. For HL7-defined tables, the third component, name of coding system, is constructed by appending t he table number to the string \"HL7.\" For example, the HL7 table number 0163 would be designated in the \"name of coding system\" component as \"HL70163.\" The second set of codes must carry the same meaning as the first set. For example, for immunizatio n data, a first set using CVX codes followed by a second set using CPT codes may be used to record the administration of a single vaccine. The presence of two sets of equivalent codes in this data type is semantically different from a repetition of a CE -type field. With repetition, several distinct codes (with distinct meanings) may be transmitted. 2.8.5 CK -composite ID with check digit Components: <ID n umber (NM)>^<check digit (NM)>^<code identifying the check digit scheme employed (ID)>^<assigning authority (HD)> Components are defined as follows: (1) ID number (NM). (2) Check digit (NM). This is the check digit that is part of the identifying number used in the sending application. If the sending application does not include a self -generated check digit in the identifying number, this component should be valued null . (3) Code identifying the check digit scheme e mployed (ID). Check digit scheme codes are defined in HL7 Table 0061 -Check digit scheme . Note: Mod 10 and Mod 11 check digit algorithms are defined in the HL7 Standard Section 2.8.5.3. This data type is used for certain fields that commonly contain check digits, e.g., PID-3-Patient identifier list . If a user is not using check digits for a CK field, the second and third components are not valued. 2.8.6 CM - composite A field that is a combination of other meaningf ul data fields. Each portion is called a component. The specific components of CM fields are defined within the field descriptions. The CM data type is maintained strictly for backward compatibility and may not be used for the definition of new fields. 2.8.9 CP -composite Standard with units Components: <quantity (NM)>^<units (CE)> Future use of this data type will be avoided because the same information can be sent as a CE data type. 2.8.12 CX -extended composite ID with check digit Components: <ID (ST)>^<check digit (ST)>^<code identifying the check digit scheme (ID)>^<assigning authority (HD)>^<identifier type code (IS)>^ <assigning facility (HD)> Components are defined as follows: (1) ID (ST).

This component is usually defined to be unique within the series of identif iers created by the assigning authority, defined by a hierarchic designator, represented by components (2) through (4). (These are as defined here at 2.8.20, \"HD -hierarchic designator.\") The entity identifier defines a given within a specified series of identifiers. 2.8.18 FC -financial class Components: Components are defined as follows: (1) Financial class (IS). The financial class assigned to a person. Refer to User -defined Table 0064 -Financial class for suggested values. (2) Effective date (TS). The effective date/time of the person's assignment to the financial class specified in the first component. Used in immunization regis tries to classify VFC eligibility. 2.8.19 FT -formatted text data This data type is derived from the string data type by allowing the addition of embedded formatting instructions. These instructions are limited to those that are intrinsic and independent of the circumstances under which the field is being used. The FT field is of arbitrary length (up to 64K) and may contain formatting commands enclosed in escape characters. 2.8.20 HD -hierarchic designator A unique name that identifies the system which was the source of the data. The HD is designed to be used either as a local version of a site - defined application identifier or a publicly -assigned UID. Syntactically, the HD is a group of two application identifiers: one defined by the first component, and one defined by the second and third components. Components: <namespace ID (IS)>^ <universal ID (ST)>^<universal ID type (ID)> Components are defin ed as follows: (1) Namespace ID (IS). Refer to User -defined Table 0300 - Namespace ID for suggested values. (2) Universal ID (ST). The UID is a string formatted according to the scheme defined by the third component, UID type. The UID is intended to be unique over time within the UID type. It is rigorously defined by the scheme constructing it. The UID must follow the syntactic rules of the particular scheme defined in the third component. (3) Universal ID type (ID). Governs the interpretation of the second Used in fields that formerly used the IS data type. When only the first HD component is valued, it looks like a simple IS data type. Designed to be an application identifier, either as a local version of a site-defined application identifier or a publicly -assigned universal ID (UID).

Examples of ID fields include MSH -12-Version ID and PD1-12-Protection indicator . This data type should be used only for HL7 tables. The reverse is not true, since in some circumstances, it is more appropriate to use the CE data type for HL7 tab les. 2.8.22 IS -coded value for user - defined tables The value of such a field follows the formatting rules for an ST field except that it is drawn from a site -defined (or user -defined) ta ble of legal values. An example of an IS field is PID-8-Sex. This data type should be used only for user -defined tables. The reverse is not true, since in some circumstances, it is more appropriate to use the CE data type for user Standard for component definitions and -money Components: <quantity (NM)> ^<denomination (ID)> See tables to use. 2.8.26 NM -numeric A number represented as a series of ASCII numeric characters consisting of an optional leading sign (+ or -), the digits and an optional decimal point.

Surname/last name. Last name prefix is for use w ith Germanic languages (e.g., van in Ludwig van Beethoven). (2) Given name (ST). (3) Middle initial or name (ST). (4) Suffix (ST). Used to specify a name suffix (e.g., Jr. or III). (5) Prefix (ST). Used to specify a name prefix (e.g., Dr.). (6) Degree (I S). Used to specify an educational degree (e.g., MD). See User -defined Table 0360 -Degree for values. Note: To \"translate\" the last name prefix and the family name, prepend the last name prefix to the family name component. If the last name prefix is not null, the last name prefix should not also be present as part of the family name component. 2.8.31 PT -processing type Components: <processing ID (ID)>^<processing mode (ID)> Components are de fined as follows: Processing ID (ID). A value that defines whether the message is part of a production, training, or debugging system. Refer to HL7 Table 0103 - Processing ID for valid values. Processing mode (ID). A value that defines whether t he message is part of an archival process or an initial load. Refer to HL7 Table 0207 - Processing mode for valid values. The default (blank) means current processing. 2.8.38 SI -sequence ID A non-negative in teger in the form of an NM field.

A2 -6 APPENDIX 3: Recommended Core Data Set for Immunization Registries This core data set was prepared in 1995 by the National Immunization Program (NIP) in consultation with the Immunization Grantee Working Group. It was reviewed by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC), and recommendations of NVAC were incorporated. Contributions were also made by public health representatives and private providers. The core data elements fall into two categories: required and optional. In addition, two functions for future consideration are presented here. Required core data elements are listed in bold print. These elements represent fundamental attributes necessary for identifying individuals and for describing immunization events. Required elements are critical to the record exchange process. Optional core data elements are less important for record exchange. Some optional items (e.g., address) may be useful only at the local level. The purpose of the core data set is to facilitate record exchange between immunization registries. It is imperative that, at a minimum, each registry include in its database schema a method to receive and store all of the required core data elements, even if the registry does not routinely collect the information. Thus, if a registry receives a record from one system and subsequently transfers it to another, no required core data elements will be lost in the process. It is strongly recommended that immunization registries also collect data on all of the required core data elements for their own patients. Listing of Core Data Set (Required data elements are listed in bold print.) Patient/System/State Identifiers (Until a unique personal identifier can be established on a national basis, multiple means of identification must be used.) Patient name: first, middle, last Patient alias name: first, middle, last (former names for management of adoptions and name changes) Patient address, phone number, birthing facility (these variables should be locally defined) Patient Social Security number (SSN) Patient birth date Patient sex Patient race Patient primary language Patient birth order Patient birth registration number Patient birth State/country Patient Medicaid number Identifiers Vaccine type (Use Table 0292 - Vaccines Administered (code=CVX) found in Appendix 1.

Vaccine Manufacturer (Use HL7-defined Table 0227 - Manufacturers of vaccines (code=MVX) found in Appendix 1. Note that up- to-date versions of this table will be maintained on the NIP website at <www.cdc.gov/nip/registry>.) Vaccine dose number NOTE: With a fully operating system, this variable is not needed. However, in the real world, and particularly during the initial startup phase, many systems will be gathering partial histories; therefore, to evaluate histories properly, dose number becomes very important. The ultimate goal would be to remove this variable from the core data set, within the first 2 to 3 years of system operation.

IMMUNIZATION DATA TRANSACTION MESSAGES Information systems that maintain immunization records need to be able to transmit patient-specific immunization histories electronically to other systems to allow healthcare providers to have access to these records at the time health care is given. Electronic tracking of immunization records also allows providers to track their own progress in reaching age-appropriate immunization coverage levels easily and efficiently. The data transmissions between registries will occur as the result of four activities: (1) a query from one system for a patient's vaccination record that is held in another system (VXQ) ; (2) a response to a query containing multiple patient \"matches\" to the query, but not returning vaccination records (VXX) ; (3) a response to a query containing the vaccination record (VXR) ; and (4) an unsolicited update to a vaccination record (VXU). Trigger event V01 will initiate the Query for Vaccination Record (VXQ) message. Two responses are possible: (1) event type V02 --Response to Vaccination Query Returning Multiple PID Matches (VXX), or (2) event type V03 --Response to Query Returning Vaccination Record (VXR). Trigger event type V04 will initiate the Unsolicited Update to Vaccination Record (VXU) message. Addition of new patients can be accomplished by using either VXU (V04) or ADT. The interaction model at the end of this section graphically depicts this process. === ============================================================================ Prev ious Text (version 2.1, September 2002) Page 3 (Strike-through indicates material deleted from newer version above) IMMUNIZATION DATA TRANSACTION MESSAGES Information systems that maintain immunization records need to be able to transmit patient-specific immunization histories electronically to other systems to allow healthcare providers to have access to these records at the time health care is given.

Some registries will use Admission/Discharge/Transfer (ADT) transactions to add or update patient information. Registries will need to determine how they will add new patients or update patient information when no immunization activity is involved. ADT messages can provide these functions and are described in this document. Trigger event V01 will initiate the Query for Vaccination Record (VXQ) message.

Summary Emphasizes effective date matching an immunization date. Example: PV1||R||||||||||||||||||V02^19900607~H02^19900607|<CR> This PV1 segment shows that the patient is a recurring patient who is VFC eligible and is a Medicaid patient. The effective date of his VFC and Medicaid status is June 7, 1990. Since a single VFC effective date is being submitted, this status should only be applied to the immunizations given on June 7, 1990. The eligibility status for the other immunization dates is unknown. Every effort should be made to associate an effective date with a corresponding immunization date. For instance, since the only status submitted in the sample PV1 segment has a date of June 7, 1990, no information about the eligibility status of the other incoming immunizations should be inferred from this message. It is also possible that a VFC status and date may be sent that was not related to an immunization event: the status may not be applicable to any immunizations in the message . === ==================================================================== Previous Text (version 2.1, September 2002) Page 52 Example: PV1||R||||||||||||||||||V02^19900607~H02^19900607|<CR> This PV1 segment shows that the patient is a recurring patient who is VFC eligible and is a Medicaid patient.

Summary (For combination vaccine Vaccine Information Statements (VIS), the first example demonstrates use of the Observation sub-ID to indicate separate VIS for each component antigen. The second example demonstrates use of the Observation sub-ID with the 'Dose Number in Series' for a combination vaccine, and contrasts this with previous use of separate LOINC codes for dose count.) ) === ===================================================================== Some information about combination vaccines (vaccines that contain multiple component antigens) can be specific to an individual vaccine component. For example, there can be separate VIS statements for each vaccine component. In the example below the combination vaccine has two component vaccines. The RXA segment describes the entire combination vaccine and does not have a value in the Observation sub-ID. Following the RXA, the first set of 5 OBX segments describes one vaccine component so all have the value \"1\" in the Observation sub-ID. The next set of 5 OBX segments describes another vaccine component so all have the value \"2\" in the Observation OBX |10|ST|38890-0&30959-1^LOT^LN|2|WP95441||||||F|<CR> The following a simplified example that illustrates specifically how \"Dose number in series\" should be portrayed for a combination vaccine using the Observation sub-ID to group the OBX segments for each component vaccine type. Note the use of LOINC\u00ae codes 38890-0&30973-2 for every component vaccine dose number in series. This is preferred over the previous method for portraying \"dose count in combination vaccine\" which used a different LOINC\u00ae code for each component vaccine and which lacked a code for the dose count for the Polio vaccine component of a combination vaccine.

The VXU message can be used for adding a person or additional information about the person, so ADT messages are not necessary for registries to communicate with each other. However, intercommunicating private providers and immunization registries may decide to use the ADT message when there is no immunization information, especially when the communicating partner already has implemented the ADT but not the VXU. The challenge for registries becomes to identify which ADT messages to use. There are 51 different ADT messages distinguished from each other by 51 different trigger event codes. At this writing, the set of ADT messages most likely to be needed by registries is not yet fully bounded. Registries are accepting the messages sent by their communicating partners. Registries may receive extra messages that they are not interested in, in which case it will need to handle them appropriately. 2.3.1 ADT messages currently identified and accepted by registries include (by event code): A01 (admit/visit notification) A04 (register a patient) A05 (pre-admit a patient) A08 (update patient information) A18 (merge patient information) A28 (add person information) A31 (update person information) A47 (change patient identifier list) As registry experience with ADT grows, this section of this document will be further refined. === ============================================================================ A5-3 Previous Text (version 2.1, September 2002) Page 80 (Strike-through indicates material deleted from newer vers ion above) 3.2 PATIENT ADMINISTRATION MESSAGE DEFINITIONS Use of the Optional Admission/Discharge, Transfer (ADT) Segments Note: The HL7 standard defines many specialized ADT messages for administrative events dealing with patients; e.g., admit, discharge, transfer, merge record. The ADT messages are distinguished from each other by the trigger event code. Some ADT messages are for use with admitted patients only. These include event code A01 (admit/visit notification), A08 (update patient information), A18 (merge patient information), and A23 (delete a patient record). We will not define those in this document, because their utility to immunization registries is limited. Even though the segments and fields are identical, the A28, A29, and A31 events are not duplicate messages, because they are not intended to be used for notification of admitted patient events. The VXU message can be used for adding a person or additional information about the person, so ADT messages are not necessary for registries to communicate with each other. However, intercommunicating private providers and immunization registries may decide to use the ADT/A28 message to add or update person data from a different data system to a registry or vice versa. The data would be kept in both places. The purpose of the ADT A28, A29, A30, and A31 messages is to allow sites with multiple systems and respective master patient databases to communicate activity related to a person regardless of whether that person is currently a patient on each system. Each system has an interest in the database activity of the others in order to maintain data integrity across an institution. Though they are defined within the ADT message set, these messages differ in that they are not patient-specific. To a certain registry, the person may be a person of interest, a potential future patient, a parent or guardian, or a potential guarantor. For example, these events can be used to maintain an MPI (master patient index), a cancer or immunization registry, members of a managed care plan, an HIV database, etc. Visit information may be included but is not required. These events are primarily for demographic data, but optional historical non-demographic data may be sent as well. The A28 event can be used to send all known demographics about a person. An A28 (add person information) or A31 (update person information) can also be used for back loading MPI information for the person, or for back loading all personal and historical information from one system to another. In addition to adding (A28) a person to a database, the delete (A29), update (A31), and merge (A30) messages work in a similar manner to maintain concurrent person information. It is left up to site-specific negotiations to decide how much data must be transmitted or re-transmitted when a person becomes a patient. For immunization registries, only items listed in the CDC core data set should be required for entry to a registry. These items can be found at <www.cdc.gov/nip/registry>. Note that all segments are optional except the MSH, EVN, and PID. The segments that are useful for immunization registries have been defined above, except for the EVN and MRG segments, which are described below. The syntax for the ADT^A28 and ADT^A31 are identical. These messages are distinguished by the second component of MSH-9- Message type , a CM data type formatted as <message type (ID)>^<trigger event (ID)>^<message structure (ID)>. =============================================================================== =============================================================================== Revised , Added or Deleted Text (version 2.2, June 2006 ) Other material revised, added, or deleted in this version is detailed in the corresponding Appendix and appropriate Table.
