They are searchable by individual airport in PDF format. They contain data on public and joint use airports, seaplane bases, heliports, VFR airport sketches, NAVAIDs, communications data, weather data, airspace, special notices, and operational procedures. The seven A/FD volumes cover the conterminous United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The Supplements cover Alaska and the Pacific Island Territories. The Chart Supplements includes data that cannot be readily depicted in graphic form: e.g., airport hours of operation, types of fuel available, runway data, lighting codes, etc. General Information, Directory Legend and Supplemental information pages printed in each of the volumes are provided as multi-page PDF files. The Digital Chart Supplement pages are available for viewing, searching, downloading and printing. Information changes to the chart supplement series come from a variety of sources. Information published in the Airport Facility Directory (excluding airport sketch blocks) is generated from Aeronautical Information Services data. All changes to this portion of the publication must be submitted as an [Aeronautical Data Change](../../aero_data/Airport_Data_Changes_Public/). Any content not covered in the Airport Facility Directory section of the supplements must be submitted as an [ Aeronautical Chart Change](../../aero_data/Aero_Chart_Changes/). There are 2 different components of information related to an Aeronautical Chart Change for the Chart Supplements; these are Airport Diagrams and sketches, and Supplemental Charts and publications. It is incumbent on the proponent to ensure they understand the [ Criteria and Requirements](../../aero_data/CS_Notice_Submissions/) for submitting changes to the Supplemental Charts and publications portion of the Aeronautical Chart Change. If any user of the Chart Supplement product finds an error, or has any questions, please submit an [Aeronautical Inquiry](../../aero_data/Aeronautical_Inquiries/). The tables below contain digital Chart Supplement files for a given cycle. The Application Data zip file contains single page PDFs and an xml database for searching. No application is included. The Cover-to-Cover files contain each of the nine supplements from cover to cover in Portable Document Format (PDF).
