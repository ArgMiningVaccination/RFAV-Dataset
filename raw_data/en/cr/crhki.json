This article shares the best vitamins for women over 50, plus reasons why most women likely need to consider supplementation as part of their self-care and anti-aging routine. [hide](#) Why Older Women Need Vitamins Women over fifty years old are presented with different challenges than women in our earlier years. The most notable change is that 51 is the [average age](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397) that women enter menopause, the ceasing of the menstrual cycle. Menopause is associated with lower levels of reproductive hormones, especially estrogen and progesterone. Because of this, menopausal women are more susceptible to hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, depression, brain fog, insomnia, urinary incontinence, lowered sex drive, thinning skin, and osteoporosis. Even if women over 50 have not yet entered menopause, they are likely to be in perimenopause which is the transition period between having normal menstrual cycles and menopause.

Other potentially big stressors and changes that women over fifty have to deal with include: - taking on more leadership roles at work or in the community - raising teenagers - caring for aging parents - adjusting to empty-nesting after children move away - getting divorced or remarried - down-sizing or moving to a new home/location Taking Supplements is Self Care With all of these life stressors, it's so important for women at every age to take care of ourselves! Self-care can include everything from getting enough sleep, eating more fruits and vegetables, learning to manage stress better, and taking vitamin supplements to help support mood, stress, energy, and vitality. I hope you enjoy this post today. While I'm not yet fifty, I'm not that far off. I can already feel my body changing as I get older. They're not necessarily bad changes and I'm not fearful of aging, but I also know how important it is to stay strong, balanced, and healthy at every age.

Best Vitamin Supplements for Women Over 50 I've rounded up the best vitamins for women over 50 to take. I've also include some of the best multivitamin supplements for women over 50 at the end of this list. You might also like my articles on the [Best Vitamins for a Teenage Girl](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/best-vitamins-for-teenage-girl/) and the [Best Supplements for a 30 Year Old Woman](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/vitamins-30-year-old-woman-take/). While not every woman needs every vitamin on this list, these are the most common supplements that can help with symptoms of aging and hormone changes. As always, please ask your doctor about which of these are right for you. If you're looking to switch to a functional medicine practitioner who can offer a much more customized approach to supplements, then check out my article on [how to find functional medicine doctors near me](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/functional-medicine-doctors-near-me/). You may also want to check out my article on the [best vitamins for gums and teeth](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/best-vitamins-for-teeth/). 1. CoQ10 Coenzyme Q10, often shortened to CoQ10, is a compound that helps generate cellular energy. Our bodies produce CoQ10, but [production slows](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coenzyme-q10) down as we age. Thus, women in their 50s tend to be more deficient in this compound. CoQ10 comes in two forms: ubiquinol and ubiquinone. It's best to supplement with the ubiquinol form of CoQ10 since it is [more absorbable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30302465). CoQ10 is a fat-soluble compound so it is best taken with a meal that contains a healthy fat source. There are other things besides aging that can reduce CoQ10 production in a woman's body. The most common one is the use of prescription medications especially statins for lowered cholesterol support. If you take a statin medication, you'll [definitely want to consider](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096178/) CoQ10. CoQ10 is also on my list of the [best supplements for dry eyes](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/best-supplements-for-dry-eyes/). Brand recommendation for CoQ10: 2. Black Cohosh or Chinese Ginseng Black cohosh is currently being studied for the [treatment of symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3767045/) associated with menopause. It is also being studied as a supplement with the ability to help menopausal women stave off osteoporosis. Chinese ginseng, also known as panax ginseng, might be [another option for controlling hot flashes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659624/) for some women. This herb has also shown to be beneficial for mood swings associated with menopause as well as sleep disturbances associated with reduced estrogen production. Brand recommendations for Black Cohosh Root and Ginseng: 3. Magnesium [Magnesium deficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5786912/) is quite common among women in their fifties in the United States. Deficiencies in this crucial mineral could lead to muscle cramping and weakness, bone pain, increased anxiety, depression, fatigue, high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, headaches, sleep disorders, and more. It is recommended that women in their fifties and beyond supplement with at least 400 mg of magnesium daily. If you are taking an antacid, blood pressure medication, antibiotics, or any type of hormonal replacement therapy medication, you will need to supplement with even more magnesium. Learn more about the [different types of magnesium](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/magnesium-pms-anxiety-migraines/). Brand recommendation of magnesium: 4. DIM Diindolylmethane, or DIM, has been shown to promote a [healthy menopausal transition](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dim-supplement). DIM is derived from cruciferous vegetables and is used to support estrogen metabolism in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. DIM is such an amazing supplement - it has research showing that it can [prevent breast cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27261275) because of how it helps metabolize estrogen (read more about [how to reverse estrogen dominance naturally](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/manage-estrogen-dominance-naturally/)). I highly recommend asking your healthcare practitioner about starting this one. Brand recommendation of DIM: 5. Passion Flower or Valerian Root Perimenopause and [sleep disruptions seem to go hand-in-hand](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/how-does-menopause-affect-my-sleep). This is most likely caused by fluctuations in estrogen. But, there are some supplements and herbs that can help! Passion flower has been used for centuries as a calming herb and sleep aide. Research has shown that compounds found in passion flower bind to GABA receptors in the brain and nerves, which are responsible for promoting [calmness and relaxation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ptr.3400). Valerian root is another medicinal compound that has been used for sleep disorders, namely insomnia, or centuries. Studies have shown that use of [valerian root](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4394901/) can help people fall asleep faster and get into a deeper REM state of sleep. However, valerian root should not be used if you have a known liver disorder or are currently taking a benzodiazepine. It should not be combined with alcohol or any other nervous system depressants. It has also been shown to negatively react with St. John's Wort. So, please consult your healthcare provider to make sure valerian root is safe for you. Brand recommendation of Passion Flower and Valerian Root: 6. Turmeric for Inflammation Turmeric is often a much better and less potentially harmful [anti-inflammatory option](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4394901/) over non-steroidal anti-inflammatories medications (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin. Curcumin is the key component in turmeric that has been shown to be beneficial for inflammation. Turmeric has been used for centuries to help alleviate inflammatory conditions caused by wounds, infections, and diseases. Chronic inflammation is something quite a few people tend to deal with as they age. That's why it's recommended to take a turmeric supplement that contains a good dose of curcumin. Brand recommendation of Turmeric: 7. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids have [many benefits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22332096). The essential oils found in fish oil have been shown to help fight mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. EPA and DHA, the essential omega-3 fats found in fish oil, are essential to optimal health. You can find these fats in cold water fish like salmon and sardines. See my [clean eating shopping list](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/clean-eating-food-list/) for more foods you should be eating. Omega-3 fatty acids in particular have research showing they can help with [depressive symptoms during menopause](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090128104702.htm) and may also help [reduce hot flashes and other troublesome symptoms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030121151830335X). Brand recommendation for Fish Oil: 8. St. John's Wort St. John's wort is a wild plant that has been used for centuries to [treat mood disorders](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/stjohnswort/sjw-and-depression.htm) such as depression. Several recent studies have shown St. John's wort to be as effective as prescription antidepressants for improving mood disorders. Short-term usage of St. John's wort is worth a try if you're feeling a little blue. There is also research showing that St. John's Wort [may help with hot flashes](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-st-johns-wort/art-20362212), especially when taken with black cohosh. But please consult your healthcare practitioner about any possible interactions or if you experience side effects. St. John's Wort can reduce the effectiveness of hormonal birth control. Brand recommendation for St. John's Wort: 9. Calcium + K2 + D3 As we age, we leach more calcium from our bones. We need adequate amounts of calcium to help [prevent post-menopausal bone loss](https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Abstract/2001/03000/The_role_of_calcium_in_peri_and_postmenopausal.3.aspx). However, the most recent research recommends against taking a [stand-alone calcium supplement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4566462/). It's safer to combine calcium with vitamins K2 and D3. Taking calcium with K2 and D3 helps to get it to its intended place, the bones, as opposed to the arteries or kidneys. Vitamin D3 controls the absorption of calcium into the blood while vitamin K2 controls where the calcium ends up. Deficiencies in calcium, K2 and D3 can have negative effects on our immunity as well. Supplementing with them is beneficial if you want to experience healthier aging. Brand recommendation for Calcium + K2 + D: 10. B Vitamins The B-vitamins are a family of water-soluble vitamins that our bodies use for many functions. Our bodies need adequate amounts of B-vitamins to produce energy from the foods we eat- given that we're eating nutrient-dense foods that our bodies can turn into useful energy. B12 is the star B vitamin when it comes to energy production. However, all of the B vitamins are necessary for optimal health. There is research showing that [B vitamin intake during menopause](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317864) can help with [cognitive issues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6372850/) and hot flashes. Brand recommendation for B Vitamin Complex: Bonus: Multivitamin Recommendation for Women 50+ A good quality multivitamin is also essential for women of all ages. If you're over 50, however, you want to choose a multivitamin that is formulated to meet your needs. You may need to review the list of vitamins, minerals, and herbs that are included in whatever multivitamin you select to ensure that you aren't already taking it separately. You also want to make sure you aren't taking a multivitamin that includes things that you don't need. For example, a woman in menopause who is not menstruating likely will not need to take iron in a vitamin. A qualified healthcare practitioner can help sort out your vitamins if you need extra help. Otherwise, here are some of the best multivitamins for women over 50: [Pure Encapsulations Women's Nutrients](https://amzn.to/326pum0)| Multivitamin for Women Over 40 to Support Urinary Tract Health, Breast Cell Health, Eye Integrity, and Emotional Health [Seeking Health | Optimal Start](https://amzn.to/3mFA1O9)| Daily Multivitamin Without B12, Iron, Calcium or Folate FAQs About Women Over 50 Prenatal vitamins are a good multivitamin source for women of childbearing age. But because the majority of women over the age of 50 are post-menopausal, it's probably better that they choose a multivitamin specifically formulated for women who are in that stage of life. See my post with the [best vitamins for young women](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/vitamins-30-year-old-woman-take/). Prenatal vitamins contain added iron and folate. While this is great for mamas-to-be, it can pose health risks for older women who no longer menstruate. Iron deficiency is rare in postmenopausal women. Excess iron in supplementation form can harm organs such as the liver, pancreas, and heart. Excess iron has also been linked to an [increased risk for diabetes](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/198182). Iron overload can also leave some women prone to a condition called hemochromatosis, a common genetic disorder in the United States. Some of the best advice for optimal health post-menopause is to eat a nutritious, whole-foods diet low in sugar and other refined carbohydrates (see the [best foods to eat every day](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/what-foods-to-eat-everyday/)). Women who wish to remain healthy after 50 should also exercise regularly, focusing on both cardiovascular fitness and resistance training. Don't smoke or drink excessive amounts of alcohol. See your doctor regularly and monitor yourself for any signs or symptoms that are out of the norm for you. Try to get good sleep, stay well hydrated, maintain a healthy weight, reduce and/or manage stressors, and practice self-care. Find a solid support group of women who understand what you are going through and meet regularly to socialize with them. And, please, remember that while the aging process is normal, what is NOT normal is to feel tired, cranky, and hopeless all the time. See [why you're tired all the time](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/ten-reasons-why-always-tired/). If you do feel this way, then that's a signal that it's time to make some changes. There is no better time than now to get started feeling stronger and more vibrant. I consider collagen as more of a food than a supplement. But, yes, collagen may help improve skin smoothness and reduce joint pain (learn more about [collagen side effects](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/secrets-about-collagen-protein/)). I include collagen on my list of the [best clean protein powders](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/best-paleo-protein-powders/). Probiotics in a supplement or probiotics from food are generally recognized as healthy for people of all ages. Learn which foods have [natural probiotics](https://www.cleaneatingkitchen.com/10-foods-with-natural-probiotics/). Absolutely not! It is an individual decision based on symptoms as to whether or not a woman needs bioidentical hormones after menopause. Please work with a qualified practitioner to help figure out what would work best for you.
