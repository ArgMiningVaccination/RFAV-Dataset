CMS and RI EOHHS will each make monthly payments for each Enrollee to the Contractor for their portion of the capitated rate, in accordance with the rates of paym ent and payment provisions set forth herein and subject to all applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, rules, billing instructions, and bulletins, as amended. 4.1.1.2. The Contractor will receive three monthly payments for each Enrollee: one amount from C MS reflecting coverage of Medicare Parts A/B services (Medicare Parts A/B Component); one amount from CMS reflecting coverage Medicare Part D services (Medicare Part D Component); and, a third amount from RI EOHHS reflecting coverage of Medicaid services ( Medicaid Component). 4.1.1.3. The Medicare Parts A/B payment will be risk adjusted using the Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC Model. The Medicare Part D payment will be risk adjusted using the Part D RxHCC Model. The Medicaid Component will utilize the rate cell method ology described in Section 4.2. 4.1.1.4. CMS and RI EOHHS will provide the Contractor with a rate report for their Medicare Parts A/B, Part D and Medicaid payments on an annual basis for the upcoming calendar year. 4.1.1.5. On a regular basis, CMS will provide RI EOHHS wit h the Contractor -level payment information included in the Medicare Plan Payment Report. The use of such information by RI EOHHS will be limited to financial monitoring, performing financial audits, and related activities, unless otherwise agreed to by CMS and the Contractor. On a regular basis, RI EOHHS will also provide to CMS Contractor -level plan payment informaiton including the Medicaid Capitation Payments. 4.1.2. Demonstration Year Dates 4.1.2.1. Capitation Rate updates will take place as on January 1 st of each calendar year, or more frequently, as described in this section; however, savings percentages (see Section 4.2.3) and quality 220 withhold percentages (see Section 4.4.7) will be applied based on final Demonstration Years, as follows: 4.1.2.1.1. Demonstration Y ear 1: No sooner than May 1, 2016 - December 31, 2017 4.1.2.1.2. Demonstration Year 2: January 1, 2018 - December 31, 2018 4.1.2.1.3. Demonstration Year 3: January 1, 2019 - December 31, 2019 4.1.2.1.4. Demonstration Year 4: January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2020 4.2. Capitated Rate Structure 4.2.1. Medicaid Component of the Capitation Payment 4.2.1.1. RI EOHHS shall pay the Contractor a monthly capitation amount (the Medicaid Component) based on the rate cell of the Enrollee, a sum equal to the product of the approved Capitation Rate and the number of Enrollees enrolled in that category: 4.2.1.1.1. Except as provided in Sections 4.6.1.1 through 4.6.3.1, an Enrollee's rate cell will be determined by his or her status as of the first Day of the month. 4.2.1.1.2. RI EOHHS will use its eligibility system to determine an Enrollee's Medicaid Component rate cell. When there are delays in changes to an Enrollee's Medicaid Component rate in RI EOHHS' eligibility system, RI EOHHS will adjust past Medicaid Component payments as needed. 4.2.1.2. The baseline spending data used for calculating the Medicai d Component consists of the Medicaid capitation rates for RHO. These rates are based on the three most recently available State fiscal years of Medicaid FFS Claims data and Medicaid managed care encounter data for Medicare- Medicaid beneficiaries who met RHO eligibility criteria during the historical baseline period. Completion factors are calculated and applied to the baseline data, in order to include expenditures for services that were incurred but not reported (IBNR) in the available data. The data are then adjusted for known policy and program changes that will be in effect during the C ontract period, as well as any differences in 221 services covered under the Demonstration, as compared to the historical baseline period . The completed and adjusted data ar e trended forward to the midpoint of the C ontract period and used to develop Capitation Rates. All steps in this process are subject to CMS review. 4.2.1.3. The Capitation Payments are based on the rate cell structure and are automatically generated by the RI EOHHS information system at the rates established in this Contract. Any and all costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the Capitation Payment will be borne in full by the Contractor, subject to the risk mitigation strategies in accordance with Section 4. 4. Exhibit 1 Medicaid Rate Cell Categories Capitation Cell Rating Category Description Community Non-LTSS Community Non- LTSS Individuals who are living in the community and not receiving LTSS LTSS Community LTSS Individuals who are living in the community and receiving LTSS LTSS Facility LTSS Individuals receiving LTSS in a nursing facility and have been in a nursing facility for more than 90 Consecutive Days I/DD I/DD Individuals identified as having intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) SPMI SPMI Individuals identified as having severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) Note: The community LTSS and facility LTSS rating categories will be blended and reimbursed as a single Capitation Rate cell based on the Contractor's original assignment mix of Enrollees in the community LTSS and facility LTSS population cohorts, adjusted for the targeted Enrollment mix. 222 4.2.2. Medicare Component of the Capitation Rate 4.2.2.1. Medicare will pay the Contractor a monthly capitation amount for the Medicare Parts A/B services (the Medicare A/B Component), risk adjusted using the Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC Model and the CMS -HCC ESRD Model, except as specified in Section 4.2.4. Medicare will also pay the Contractor a monthly capitation amount for Medicare Part D services, risk adjusted using the Part D RxHCC Model (the Medicare Part D Component). 4.2.2.2. Medicare A/B Component 4.2.2.2.1. The Medicare baseline spending for Parts A/B services are a blend of the Medicare Advantage projected payment rates and the Medicare FFS standardized county rates for each year, weighted by the proportion of the target population that will be transitioning from each program into the Demonstration. The Medicare Advantage baseline spending will include costs that would have occurred absent the Demonstration, such as quality bonus payments for applicable Medicare Advantage plans. The FFS county rates will generally reflect amounts published with the April Medicare Advantage Final Rate Announcement. CMS may adjust the Medicare FFS standardized county rates as necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. To the extent that the published FFS county rates do not conform with current law in effect for Medi care during an applicable payment month, and to the extent that such nonconformance would have a significant fiscal impact on the Demonstration, CMS will update the baseline (and therefore the corresponding payment rate) to calculate and apply an accurate payment rate for such month. Such update may take place retroactively, as needed. 4.2.2.2.2. Separate baselines will exist for Enrollees meeting the Medicare ESRD criteria. For Enrollees with ESRD in the dialysis or transplant status phases, the Medicare Parts A/B b aseline will be the ESRD dialysis state rate. For Enrollees in the functioning graft status phase, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the Medicare Advantage 3.5% bonus county rate (benchmark) for the applicable county. 223 4.2.2.2.3. Both baseline spending and payme nt rates under the Demonstration for Medicare Parts A/B services will be calculated as per member per month (PMPM) standardized amounts for each county participating in the Demonstration for each year. Enrollee risk scores will be applied to the standardiz ed rates at the time of payment. 4.2.2.2.4. The Medicare A/B Component will be updated annually consistent with annual FFS estimates and Medicare Advantage rates released each year with the annual rate announcement. 4.2.2.3. Medicare Part D 4.2.2.3.1. The Medicare Part D baseline for t he Part D Direct Subsidy will be set at the Part D national average monthly bid amount (NAMBA) for the calendar year. CMS will estimate an average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and federal reinsurance amounts; t hese payments will be reconciled after the end of each payment year in the same manner as for all Part D sponsors. The CY 2016 Part D NAMBA is $64.66. 4.2.2.3.2. The monthly Medicare Part D Component for an Enrollee can be calculated by multiplying the Part D NAMBA by the RxHCC risk score assigned to the individual, and then adding to this estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and federal reinsurance amounts. 4.2.3. Aggregate Savings Percentages 4.2.3.1. Aggregate savings percen tages will be applied equally, as follows, to the baseline spending amounts for the Medicare Parts A/B Component and the Medicaid Component of the capitated rate, provided that such savings percentages may be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.4.4.7. 4.2.3.1.1. Demonstration Year 1: 1% 4.2.3.1.2. Demonstration Year 2: 1.25% 4.2.3.1.3. Demonstration Year 224 4.2.3.1.4. Demonstration Year 4: 3% 4.2.3.2. Capitation Rate updates will take place on January 1st of each calendar year; however, savings percentages will be calculated and applied based on Demonstration Years. 4.2.3.3. Savings percentages will not be applied to the Part D component of the rate. CMS will monitor Part D costs closely on an ongoing basis. Any material change in Part D costs relative to the baseline may be factored into future year savings percentages. 4.2.4. Risk Adjustment Methodology 4.2.4.1. Medicare Parts A/B: The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be risk adjusted based on the risk profile of each Enrollee. Except as specified below, the existing Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC and CMS -HCC ESRD risk adjust ment methodology will be used for the Demonstration. 4.2.4.1.1. In calendar year 2016, CMS will calculate and apply a coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demonstration Enrollees. This will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Enrollees in 2016 with Medicare Advantage experience in 2015, prior to the Demonstration. 4.2.4.1.2. In calendar year 2017, CMS will apply an appropriate coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demons tration Enrollees. This will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Enrollees in CY 2017 with prior Medicare Advantage experience and/or Demonstration experience based on the Demonstration's Enrollment phase -in as of September 30, 2016. 4.2.4.1.3. After calendar year 2017, CMS will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment to all Demonstration Enrollees. 225 4.2.4.1.4. The coding intensity adjustment factor will not b e applied during the Demonstration to risk scores for Enrollees with an ESRD status of dialysis or transplant, consistent with Medicare Advantage policy. 4.2.4.2. Medicare Part D: The Medicare Part D national average bid amount will be risk adjusted in accordance w ith existing Part D RxHCC methodology. The estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts will not be risk adjusted. 4.2.4.3. Medicaid: The Medicaid component will employ rating categorie s described in Exhibit 1. 4.3. Risk Mitigation Approaches 4.3.1. Risk Corridors 4.3.1.1. Risk corridors will be established for Demonstration Years 1, 2, and 3. 4.3.1.2. The Demonstration will use a tiered Contractor -level symmetrical risk corridor to include the combined Medicare Parts A/B and Medicaid components. 4.3.1.3. Total Adjusted Expenditures and Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue will be calculated as in Sections 4. 3.1.7 and 4.3.1.8 to establish payment or recoupment under the risk corridor. 4.3.1.4. The risk corridors will be reconcile d after application of any risk adjustment methodologies (e.g. CMS -HCC) and as if the Contractor had received the full quality withhold payment. 4.3.1.5. Process for collecting cost information for interim and final risk corridor settlement. 4.3.1.5.1. CMS and RI EOHHS will e valuate encounter data, cost data, and Contractor financial reports, as set forth in Sections 4.3.1.11.1.1 and 4.3.1.11.2.1, to determine the Contractor's incurred costs. 4.3.1.6. Risk Corridor Shares. The Medicare and Medicaid contributions to risk corridor paymen ts or recoupments will be in proportion to their contributions to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue, except as described below: 226 4.3.1.6.1. Medicare Contribution to Risk Corridor 4.3.1.6.1.1. Prior to risk corridor calculations, CMS will analyze FFS Medicare expenditures relative to the risk adjusted county FFS rates for the population enrolled in the Demonstration to calculate a ratio of the risk -adjusted Medicare FFS county rates to Medicare FFS costs (\"Rate- to-FFS Ratio\"). One ratio will be calculated for the entire Demonstration area. 4.3.1.6.1.2. If that analysis shows a Rate- to-FFS Ratio for the risk adjustment model for the entire Demonstration area between 0.98 and 1.02, the maximum Medicare payment/recoupment will equal 2% of the risk- adjusted Medicare contribution to the To tal Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue in DY1, 1.5% of the risk-adjusted Medicare contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue in DY2, and 1% of the risk -adjusted Medicare contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue in DY3. 4.3.1.6.1.3. If the analysis shows a Rate- to-FFS Ratio for the risk adjustment model greater than 1.02 and there are plan losses, Medicare participation in the risk corridor will be limited to 1% of the risk-adjusted Medicare contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Ra te Revenue in each year. 227 4.3.1.6.1.4. If the analysis shows a Rate- to-FFS Ratio for the risk adjustment model less than 0.98 and there are plan losses, Medicare participation in the risk corridor settlement will be adjusted. First, Medicare will make payment to the Contractor of the lesser of the Medicare amount necessary to bring the predictive value to 0.98 or the total plan losses. For Medicare, participation in the risk corridor bands will be capped at 2% of the risk- adjusted Medicare contribution to the Total Adju sted Capitation Rate Revenue in DY1, 1.5% of the risk- adjusted Medicare contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue in DY2, and 1% of the risk -adjusted Medicare contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue in DY3; in such scena rios, the risk- adjusted Medicare contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue will be adjusted to incorporate the payment associated with the Rate- to-FFS Ratio analysis. 4.3.1.6.1.5. If the analysis shows a Rate- to-FFS Ratio for the risk adjustment model less than 0.98 and there are plan gains, Medicare recoupment in the risk corridor will be limited to 1% of the risk-adjusted Medicare contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue in each year. 228 4.3.1.6.1.6. If the analysis shows a Rate- to-FFS Ratio predict ive value for the risk adjustment model greater than 1.02 and there are plan gains, Medicare participation in the risk corridor will be adjusted. First, Medicare will recoup from the Contractor the lesser of the Medicare amount necessary to bring the predi ctive value to 1.02 or the total plan gains. For any remaining gains after that recoupment, the risk corridor bands in Section 4.3.1.5.4 will apply. Medicare recoupment under the risk corridor bands will be capped at 2% of the risk- adjusted Medicare contri bution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue in DY1, 1.5% of the risk-adjusted Medicare contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue in DY2, and 1% of the risk- adjusted Medicare contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Reven ue in DY3; in such scenarios, the Medicare baseline will be adjusted to incorporate the recoupment associated with the Rate- to-FFS Ratio analysis. 4.3.1.6.2. Medicaid Component. 4.3.1.6.2.1. The maximum Medicaid payment/recoupment equals 2% of the Medicaid contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue in Demonstration Year 1, 1.5% of the Medicaid contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue in Demonstration Year 2, and 1% of the Medicaid contribution to the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue in Demo nstration Year 3. 4.3.1.7. Total Adjusted Expenditures are the Contractor's actual amount incurred for expenditures for Covered Services and non- service expenditures, including both administrative and care management costs. Expenditures included in risk corridor ca lculations shall be in compliance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.2400 except that the following expenses incurred by the Contractor will be excluded for purposes of the gain/loss calculation: 229 4.3.1.7.1. The amount of incentive and bonus payments made to Health Care Professionals and provider pay -for- performance incentive arrangements t hat were not approved by CMS and RI EOHHS; 4.3.1.7.2. General operating expenditures , as defined by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.2400, that exceed 15% of the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue, inclusive of any quality withholds whether or not they were paid to the Contractor; and 4.3.1.7.3. Start -up costs, defined as costs incurred by the Contractor prior to the start of the Demonstration. 4.3.1.8. Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue is the sum of the monthly capitation payments f or the applicable Demonstration Year (reflecting coverage of Medicare Parts A/B services and Medicaid services, pursuant to Appendix A of this contract). This includes the application of risk adjustment methodologies, as described in Section 4.2.4 and will be calculated as if the Contractor had received the full quality withhold payment. 4.3.1.9. In the event the Contractor qualifies to both make a risk corridor payment to CMS and RI EOHHS, as well as an MLR remittance as described in Section 4.3.2, the risk corridor calculation will be net of any MLR remittances. 4.3.1.10. Risk Corridors Tiers 4.3.1.10.1. Gains and losses are calculated as the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue minus Total Adjusted Expenditures. CMS and RI EOHHS will use the following risk corridor bands for e ach Demonstration Year to address the Contractor's potential aggregate gains/losses across all capitation cells. 4.3.1.10.1.1. Demonstration Year 1: 4.3.1.10.1.1.1. Greater than 5% gain/loss, the Contractor would bear 10% of the risk/reward; RI EOHHS and CMS would share in the other 90 % as described in Section 4.3.1.6, above. 230 4.3.1.10.1.1.2. Between 1.5% and 5% gain/loss, would bear 30% of the risk/reward; RI EOHHS and CMS would share in the other 70% as described in Section 4.3.1.6, above. 4.3.1.10.1.1.3. Between 0 and 1.5% gain/loss, the Contractor would bear 100% of the risk/reward. 4.3.1.10.1.2. Demonstration Year 2: 4.3.1.10.1.2.1. Greater than 6% gain/loss, Contractor would bear 10% of the risk/reward; RI EOHHS and CMS would share in the other 90% as described in Section 4.3.1.6, above. 4.3.1.10.1.2.2. Between 2% and 6% gain/loss, bear 30% of the risk/reward; RI EOHHS and CMS would share in the other 70% as described in Section 4.3.1.6, above. 4.3.1.10.1.2.3. Between 0 and 2% gain/loss, Contractor the Contractor would bear 100% of the risk/reward. 4.3.1.10.1.3. Demonstration Year 3: 4.3.1.10.1.3.1. Greater than 7 % gain/loss, the Contractor would bear 100% of the risk/reward. 231 4.3.1.10.1.3.2. Between 2.5% and 7% gain/loss, Contractor would bear 30% of the risk/reward; RI EOHHS and CMS would share in the other 70% as described in Section 4.3.1.6, above. 4.3.1.10.1.3.3. Between 0 and 2.5% gain/loss, Contractor the Contractor would bear 100% of the risk/reward. 4.3.1.11.

CMS and RI EOHHS shall provide the Contractor with a final reconciliation under the risk corridor arrangement by within five hundred and ten ( 510) calendar Day s following the end of the applicable Demonstration Year. Any balance due between the Contractor and CMS and RI EOHHS, net of any payments made for the Interim Settlement, shall be paid within sixty ( 60) Days of the Contractor receiving the final reconciliation from CMS and RI EOHHS; and 4.3.1.11.2.3. The Contractor shall provide any additional information upon request from CMS and RI EOHHS necessary to calculate Total Adjusted Expenditures. 4.3.1.11.3. Interim and final settlement amounts shall be calculated for each Demonstration Year; however, any Demonstration Year 1 payment will be contingent upon the Contractor's participation in Demonstration Year 2, and any Demonstration Year 2 payment will be contingent upon the Contractor's participation in Demonstration Year 3, unless otherwise permitted by RI EOHHS and CMS. 4.3.2. Medical loss ratio (MLR) 4.3.2.1. The Contractor has a minimum target medical loss ratio (MLR) of eighty -five percent (85%). 4.3.2.2. If the MLR calculated as set forth below is less than the minimum target MLR, the Contractor shall refund to RI EOHHS and CMS an amount equal to the difference between the calculated MLR and the minimum target MLR (expressed as a percentage) multiplied by the coverage year revenue. RI EOHHS and CMS shall calculate an aggregate MLR for Enrollees under t his Contract, and shall provide to the Contractor the amount to be refunded, if any, to RI EOHHS and CMS respectively. Any refunded amounts will be distributed back to the Medicaid and Medicare programs, with the amount to each payor based on the proportion between the Medicare and Medicaid Components. At the option of CMS and RI EOHHS, separately, any amount to be refunded may be recovered either by requiring the Contractor to make a payment or by an offset to future Capitation Payment. The MLR calculatio n shall be determined as set forth below; however, RI EOHHS and CMS may adopt NAIC 236 reporting standards and protocols after giving written notice to the Contractor. 4.3.2.3. MLR will be based on the 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 422.2400 et seq and 423.2400 et seq except the numerator in the MLR calculation will include: 4.3.2.3.1. All Covered Services required in the Demonstration under Section 2.4 and Appendix A; 4.3.2.3.2. Any services purchased in lieu of more costly Covered Services and consistent with the objectives of the Demonstration; and 4.3.2.3.3. Activities that improve health care quality, as defined by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 422.2430. 4.3.2.4. The revenue used in the MLR calculation will consist of the Capitation payments, as adjusted pursuant to Section 4.2.4, due from RI EOHHS and CMS for services provided dur ing the coverage year. Revenue will include amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.4.6 and Section 4.4.7, regardless of whether the Contractor actually receives the amount in Section 4.4.6 and Section 4.4.7. 4.3.2.5. Data Submission. The Contractor shall submit to RI EOHHS and CMS, in the form and manner prescribed by RI EOHHS and CMS, the necessary data to calculate and verify the MLR after the end of the coverage year. 4.3.2.6. Medical Loss Ratio Calculation. Within ninety (90) Days following the six (6) month Claims ru n-out period following the coverage year, RI EOHHS and CMS shall calculate the MLR by dividing the benefit expense by the revenue. The MLR shall be expressed as a percentage rounded to the second decimal point. The Contractor shall have sixty (60) Days to review the MLR calculation. Each Party shall have the right to review all data and methodologies used to calculate the MLR. 4.3.2.7. Coverage Year. The coverage year shall be the Demonstration Year. The MLR calculation shall be prepared using all data available from the coverage year, including IBNR and six (6) months of run- out for benefit expense (excluding sub- capitation paid during the run- out months). 237 4.4. Payment Terms 4.4.1. Medicare Components 4.4.1.1. The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be the product of the Enrollee's CMS -HCC risk score multiplied by the relevant standard county payment rate (or the ESRD dialysis state rate by the HCC ESRD risk score, as applicable). The Medicare Part D Component will be the product of the Enrollee's RxHCC risk score multiplied by the Part D National Average Monthly Bid Amount, with the addition of the estimated average monthly prospective payment. 4.4.2. Medicaid Component 4.4.2.1. The Medicaid component for each rate cell will be product of the number of Enrollees in each category multiplied by the p ayment rate for that rate cell. 4.4.3. Timing of Capitation Payments 4.4.3.1. On or before the fifth calendar Day of every month, CMS and RI EOHHS will each make monthly Capitation Payments to the Contractor. If an individual is enrolled with the Contractor on the first Day of a month, the Contractor has the responsibility of providing Covered Services to that Enrollee for that month, even if the Enrollee moves to another locality. If the Enrollee moves to a locality outside of the Contractor's Service Area, the Enrollee will be disenrolled from the Contractor at the end of the month of change. Any and all costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the Capitation Payment will be borne in full by the Contractor except as otherwise provided for in Section 4.3.1 and 4.3.2. The Contractor shall accept RI EOHHS's electronic transfer of funds to receive Capitation Payments. 4.4.3.2. Enrollments 4.4.3.2.1. On or before the fifth calendar Day of every month CMS will make monthly prospective per Enrollee per month Capitation Payment to the Contract or. The PMPM Capitation Payment for a particular month will reflect payment for the beneficiaries with effective Enrollment into the Contractor's Demonstration plan as of the first Day of that month. 238 4.4.3.2.2. On or before the fifth calendar Day of every month RI EOHHS will make monthly prospective per Enrollee per month Capitation Payments to the Contractor for the next month's expected Enrollment with a subsequent payment or recoupment to reconcile any variation between expected and actual Enrollment. 4.4.3.3. Disenrollmen ts 4.4.3.3.1. The final per Enrollee per month Capitation Payment made by CMS and RI EOHHS to the Contractor for each Enrollee will be for the month: a) in which the disenrollment was submitted, b) the Enrollee loses eligibility, or c) the Enrollee dies (see Section 2.3. 6). 4.4.4. Enrollee Contribution to Care Amounts 4.4.4.1. When an Enrollee's income exceeds an allowable amount, he or she must contribute toward the cost of their LTSS. This contribution, known as the Patient Pay amount, is required for individuals residing in a nu rsing facility and for those receiving home & community -based LTSS. Patient Pay is required to be calculated for every individual receiving nursing facility or community -based LTSS, although not every eligible individual will end up having to pay each month. 4.4.4.2. RI EOHHS will provide information to the Contractor that identifies Enrollees who are required to pay a Patient Pay amount and the amount of the obligation as part of the monthly transition report. RI EOHHS Capitation Payments to the Contractor for Enrollees who are required to pay a Patient Pay Amount will be net of the monthly Patient Pay amount. It is the responsibility of the LTSS provider(s) to collect the Patient Pay amount from Enrollees and the Contractor shall reduce reimbursements to LTSS p roviders equal to the Patient Pay amount each month. 4.4.5. Modifications to Capitation Rates 4.4.5.1. CMS and RI EOHHS will jointly notify the Contractor in advance and in writing as soon as pr acticable, but in no event less than thirty (30) Days prior to processing the change to the Capitation Rate, of any proposed changes to the Capitation Rates, and the Contractor shall accept such changes as payment in full as described in Section 4.7. Any mid- year rate changes would be articulated in a rate report. 239 4.4.5.2. Rates will be upd ated using a similar process for each calendar year. Subject to Section 4.4.5.3 below, changes to the Medicare and Medicaid baselines (and therefore to the corresponding payment rate) outside of the annual Medicare Advantage and Part D rate announcement and annual Medicaid rate update will be made only if and when CMS and RI EOHHS jointly determine the change is necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. Such changes may be based on the following factors: shifts in Enrollment assu mptions; major changes or discrepancies in Federal law and/or State policy used in the development of baseline estimates; and changes to coding intensity. 4.4.5.3. For changes solely affecting the Medicare program baseline, CMS will consult with RI EOHHS prior to making any adjustment, but RI EOHHS concurrence will not be required. CMS will update baselines by amounts necessary to best effectuate accurate payment rates for each month, as identified by the independent CMS Office of the Actuary. 4.4.5.4. Subject to Section 4.4.5.3 above, if other statutory changes enacted after the annual baseline determination and rate development process are jointly determined by CMS and RI EOHHS to have a material change in baseline estimates for any given payment year, baseline estimates and corresponding standardized payment rates shall be updated outside of the annual rate development process. 4.4.5.5. CMS and/or RI EOHHS will make changes to baseline estimates within thirty (30) Days of identification of the need for such changes, and changes w ill be applied, if necessary on a retrospective basis, to effectuate accurate payment rates for each month. 4.4.5.6. Changes to the savings percentages will be made if and when CMS and RI EOHHS jointly determine that changes in Part D spending have resulted in materially higher or lower savings that need to be recouped through higher or lower savings percentages applied to the Medicare A/B baselines. 4.4.5.7. In the event that the Contractor experiences annual losses in Demonstration Year 1 exceeding 3% of the Total Adjusted Capitation Rate Revenue, in the aggregate over all regions in which the Contractor participates, the savings percentage for Demonstration Year 3 will be reduced to 1.5%. Revenue will include Medicare A/B revenue and Medicaid revenue, including any reconciliation and risk adjustment. Annual losses will be 240 calculated as if the Contractor had received the full quality withhold payment and any other offsets defined in this contract. 4.4.5.8. Any material changes in the Medicaid State plan, including pertaining to Covered Services, payment schedules and related methodologies, shall be reflected in corresponding Capitation Payment adjustments. The Contracto r will not be required to implement such changes without advance notice and corresponding adjustment in the Capitation Payment. In addition, to the extent other Medicaid costs are incurred absent the Demonstration, such costs shall be reflected in correspo nding Capitation Payment adjustments. 4.4.6. Implementation of Alternative Payment Arrangements 4.4.6.1. RI EOHHS and CMS are committed to expanding new health care payment models aimed at improving health care quality and reducing cost by progressively moving away from volume based payments to value based payment arrangements that incorporate quality thresholds and shared savings and/or risk arrangements. Under the Demonstration, RI EOHHS for Demonstration Years 2, 3, and 4 will withhold a percentage of the Medicaid Component of the Capitation Rate, subject to the degree that the Contractor has implemented Alternative Payment Arrangements with providers that are in accord with RI EOHHS standards , as set forth in RI EOHHS Alternative Payment Methodology Guidelines for Medi caid Managed Care Organizations . 4.4.6.2. Offsets to Capitation related to Value Based Purchasing contracts 4.4.6.2.1. During Demonstration Year 1 Contractor is expected to develop Alternative Payment Arrangements with providers that include the components outlined in Section 4.4.6.1 and that are deemed compliant with RI EOHHS requirements. 4.4.6.2.2. For the period January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, Contractor shall have in effect Alternative Payment Arrangements with a value of not less than 20% of total payments to Health Care Professionals for Medicaid, Medicare Part A, and Medicare Part B services covered under this Contract. 241 4.4.6.2.2.1. If compliance with this standard is not satisfactorily demonstrated to RI EOHHS by December 1, 2016, Medicaid Capitation Payments to C ontractor wi ll be reduced by 0.5% for the period January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. 4.4.6.2.3. For the period January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, Contractor shall have in effect Alternative Payment Arrangements with a value of not less than 50% of total payments to Health Care Professionals for Medicaid, Medicare Part A, and Medicare Part B services covered under this Contract. 4.4.6.2.3.1. If compliance with this standard is not satisfactorily demonstrated to RI EOHHS by December 1, 2017, M edicaid Capitation Payments to the C ontractor will be reduced by 1% for the period January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. 4.4.6.2.4. For the periods January 1, 2019 through Dece mber 31, 2019 and January 1, 2020 through Dece mber 31, 2020, Contractor shall have in effect Alternative Payment Ar rangements that meet RI EOHHS standards . 4.4.6.2.4.1. If compliance with RI EOHHS standard s is not satisfactorily demonstrated to RI EOHHS, Medicaid Capitation Payments to the Contractor will be reduced for the applicable period. 4.4.6.3. For the period January 1, 2018 throug h December 31, 2018, the Contractor will have in effect contracts with Health Care Professionals that link at least some aspect of payment to quality or value, in accord with RI EOHHS standards, for at least 80% of total payments to providers for Medicaid, Medicare Part A, and Medicare Part B services covered under this Contract . The Contractor will demonstrate compliance with this standard to RI EOHHS by December 1, 2017. 4.4.6.4. For the periods January 1, 2019 through Dece mber 31, 2019 and January 1, 2020 throug h December 31, 2020, Contractor shall have in effect contracts with Health Care Professionals that link at least some aspect of payment to quality or value, in accord with RI EOHHS 242 standards . The Contractor will be responsible for demonstrating compliance with RI EOHHS standards . 4.4.7. Quality Withhold Policy 4.4.7.1. Under the Demonstration, both CMS and RI EOHHS will withhold a percentage of their respective components of the Capitation Rate, with the exception of Part D Component amounts. The withheld amounts will be repaid subject to the Contractor's performance consistent with established quality thresholds. 4.4.7.2. CMS and RI EOHHS will evaluate the Contractor's performance according to the specified metrics required in order to earn back the quality withhold for a given year. 4.4.7.3. Whether or not the Contractor has met the quality requirements in a given year will be made public. 4.4.7.4. Additional details regarding the quality withholds, including more detailed specifications, required thresholds and other information regarding the methodology will be made available in future technical guidance. 4.4.7.5. Determination of whether the Contractor has met required quality withhold requirements will be based solely on those measures that can appropriately be calculated based on actual en rollment volume during the Demonstration Year. 4.4.7.6. Quality Withhold Percentages. 4.4.7.6.1. Aggregate quality withhold percentages will be applied equally, as follows, to the baseline spending amounts for the Medicare Parts A/B Component and the Medicaid Component of the capitated rate: 4.4.7.6.1.1. Demonstration Year 1: 1.0% 4.4.7.6.1.2. 2.0% 4.4.7.6.1.3. Demonstration Year 3: 3.0% 4.4.7.6.1.4. Demonstration Year 4: 3.0% 4.4.7.7. Withhold Measures in Demonstration Year 1 243 4.4.7.7.1. Exhibit 2 below identifies the withhold measures for Demonstration Year 1. Together, these will be utilized as the basis for the withhold amount defined in Section 4.4.7.6.1.1. Additional details, including technical specifications, withhold methodology and required benchmarks, is provided in the Medicare - Medicaid Capitated Financial Alignment Model Quality Withhold Technical Notes and in subsequent guidance. 4.4.7.7.2. For Demonstration Year 1, which crosses calendar years, the Contractor will be evaluated to determine whether it has met quality withhold requirements at the end of both Calendar Year 2016 and Calendar Year 2017. The determination in CY 2016 will be based solely on those measures that can appropriately be calculated based on the actual Enrollment volume during CY 2016. Consistent with such evaluations, the withheld amounts will be repa id separately for each calendar year.
