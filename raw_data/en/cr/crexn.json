They have a refined or delicate appearance, and often have weakness in the spine. Their injuries are slow to heal, and they tend to have a low resistance to infection. Moderate exercise often warms the person up and improves energy. Symphytum When osteoporosis is a problem, fractures often occur from mild trauma. This remedy can be useful for strengthening and healing bones when new fractures occur, and also helpful when pain persists in old, healed fractures. Other Remedies Calcarea carbonica This remedy is often helpful to individuals who are easily tired by exertion and tend to feel anxious and overwhelmed from work or stress. The person may be chilly, flabby or overweight, and feel worse from cold and dampness. Back pain, swollen joints, and a sweaty head at night are often seen. People who need this remedy often have strong cravings for both eggs and sweets. Calcarea phosphorica Stiffness, soreness, and weakness of the bones and joints often are experienced by those who need this remedy. Aching in the bones of the neck, upper back, and hips can be distressing. Deep tiredness frequently is felt, especially after exercise. Calcium deposits and bone-spurs may develop, even while general bone-loss is taking place, and fractures may be slow to heal. A feeling of dissatisfaction and a strong desire for travel or a change of circumstances are often seen in people who need Calcarea phosphorica. Phosphorus This remedy is often helpful to people who are sensitive, suggestible, imaginative, but easily tired or weakened physically. Bones may be less strong than normal, or be slow to heal after fractures. Weakness is often felt in the spine, with burning pain between the shoulder blades. People who need this remedy are often tall and thin with an easily-flushing face. A desire for refreshing foods (especially ice cream) and strong thirst for cold or carbonated drinks are other indications for Phosphorus. [] Dosage Homeopathy Dosage Directions Select the medicine that most closely matches the symptoms. In conditions where self-treatment is appropriate, unless otherwise directed by a physician, a lower potency (6X, 6C, 12X, 12C, 30X, or 30C) should be used. In addition, instructions for use are usually printed on the label. Many homeopathic physicians suggest that medicines be used as follows: Take one dose and wait for a response. If improvement is seen, continue to wait and let the medicine work. If improvement lags significantly or has clearly stopped, another dose may be taken. The frequency of dosage varies with the condition and the individual. Sometimes a dose may be required several times an hour; other times a dose may be indicated several times a day; and in some situations, one dose per day (or less) can be sufficient. If no response is seen within a reasonable amount of time, select a different medicine.

Osteoporosis must b diagnosed and treated by a medical doctor. Many factors can contribute to osteoporosis, including the aging process (especially in women after menopause), inadequate exercise, dietary errors or deficiencies, and effects of certain drugs. Homeopathic remedies will not reverse existing bone loss, but can bring the body into better balance and help its minerals and nutrients be used efficiently. Remedies are also helpful for aching bones and prevention or healing of fractures. - - [Top of the page](#top) - Next Section: [Dosage](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2247004#hn-2247004-dosage) - Section: Previous - [Top - Previous Section: [Related Information](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2247004#hn-2247004-related-information) - [Top of page](#top) Last Review: 10-31-2012 Copyright \u00a9 2020 TraceGains, Inc.
