True meditation in the yoga tradition - not mindfulness or relaxation or imaginative journeys, but deep, spiritually inclined techniques that take years to master. Never before have these techniques and tools been published and laid out in such a clear and structured way. French yogi, Bernard Bouanchaud, in his eighties now, reveals his extensive training over several years in Chennai, India with T.K.V. Desikachar, and then in France with his brother T.K.Sribhashyam. Both were sons of the legendary yogi T. Krishnamacharya, who was at the centre of the modern revival of yoga and played a pivotal role in its recent growth in modern times. The yoga meditation in this book is: - authentic, for it is a tradition that has been passed down for more than ten centuries; and - based on the philosophy of Pata\u00f1jali in his Yoga-Stra and other key yoga texts. With the help of an experienced teacher to implement these rational and progressive methods presented here, you too will enrich your yoga meditation, promising you more mental clarity and compassion.
