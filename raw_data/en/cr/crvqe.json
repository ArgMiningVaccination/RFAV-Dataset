BHF dietitian Victoria Taylor says: Lots of people are asking me how to keep their immune system functioning well this winter. But it's important to remember that there are no single foods or specific diets that will 'boost' your immunity, despite what you might read online. In the UK there are no foods or drinks that are allowed to make claims that they protect against infection. The nutrients that keep our immune system working well include vitamins A, B6, B12, C and D as well as copper, folate, iron, selenium and zinc. This doesn't mean that you need to be taking supplements - and some vitamin supplements can be harmful if taken in large doses. Instead, focus on getting these nutrients from a healthy, varied diet including fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, wholegrains, dairy products or fortified alternatives, and meat, fish or plant proteins like pulses. The exception to this is vitamin D, which is mostly produced from exposure to sunlight. To make sure that we're getting enough year-round it's recommended that we all consider taking a daily 10-microgram supplement in autumn and winter. This is even more important if you don't go outside very much or cover most of your skin. Although research is still in its early stages, a healthy gut microbiome (the range of bacteria and other organisms in your intestine) has also been linked to a role in our immune system. The best way to achieve this is to have a wide variety of high-fibre plant-based foods like fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, nuts, seeds, beans and lentils. Fermented foods like live yoghurt or kefir might also be helpful. Try adding an extra portion of vegetables to your main meal, and take a look at our [tips on eating more pulses](/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/nutrition/pulses). As well as helping to support your immune system, eating this way can help you feel better, and is great for your heart health too.
