Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity. (2) Dual-use items (including software and technology) should be subject to effective control when they are exported from the European Community. (3) An effective common system of export controls on dual-use items is necessary to ensure that the international com\u00admitments and responsibilities of the Member States, especially regarding non-proliferation, and of the European Union (EU), are complied with. (4) The existence of a common control system and harmon\u00adised policies for enforcement and monitoring in all Mem\u00adber States is a prerequisite for establishing the free movement of dual-use items inside the Community.(5) The responsibility for deciding on individual, global or national general export authorisations, on authorisations for brokering services, on transits of non-Community dual-use items or on authorisations for the transfer within the Community of the dual-use items listed in Annex IV lies with national authorities. National provisions and deci\u00ad sions affecting exports of dual-use items must be taken in the framework of the common commercial policy, and in particular Council Regulation (EEC) No 2603/69 of20 December 1969 establishing common rules for exports (2) OJ L 324, 27.12.1969, p. 25.. (6) Decisions to update the common list of dual-use items sub\u00ad ject to export controls must be in conformity with the obli\u00adgations and commitments that Member States have accepted as members of the relevant international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties. (7) Common lists of dual-use items, destinations and guide\u00adlines are essential elements for an effective export control regime. (8) Transmission of software and technology by means of electronic media, fax or telephone to destinations outside the Community should also be controlled. (9) Particular attention needs to be paid to issues of re-export and end-use.1) ( (2)L 134/2 EN Official Journal of the European Union 29.5.2009 (10) On 22 September 1998 representatives of the Member States and the European Commission signed Protocols additional to the respective safeguards agreements between the Member States, the European Atomic Energy Commu\u00adnity and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which, among other measures, oblige the Member States to pro\u00advide information on transfers of specified equipment and non-nuclear material. (11) The Community has adopted a body of customs rules, con\u00ad tained in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (1) OJ L 302, 19.10.1992, p. 1. (hereinafter the Community Customs Code) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (2) OJ L 253, 11.10.1993, p. 1. implement\u00ad ing Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 which lay down, among other things, provisions relating to the export and re-export of goods. Nothing in this Regulation constrains any powers under and pursuant to the Community Cus\u00ad toms Code and its implementing provisions. (12) Pursuant to and within the limits of Article 30 of the Treaty and pending a greater degree of harmonisation, Member States retain the right to carry out controls on transfers of certain dual-use items within the Community in order to safeguard public policy or public security. Where these controls are linked to the effectiveness of controls on exports from the Community, they should be periodically reviewed by the Council. (13) In order to ensure that this Regulation is properly applied, each Member State should take measures giving the com\u00adpetent authorities appropriate powers. (14) The Heads of State or Government of the EU adopted in June 2003 an Action Plan on Non-Proliferation of Weap\u00adons of Mass Destruction (Thessaloniki Action Plan). This Action Plan was complemented by the EU Strategy against proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction adopted by the European Council on 12 December 2003 (EU WMD Strategy). According to Chapter III of this Strategy, the European Union must make use of all its instruments to prevent, deter, halt, and if possible eliminate proliferation programmes that cause concern at global level. Subpara\u00adgraph 30.A(4) of that Chapter specifically refers to strengthening export control policies and practices. (15) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, adopted on 28 April 2004, decides that all States shall take and enforce effective measures to establish domestic controls to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical or biologi\u00adcal weapons and their means of delivery, including by establishing appropriate controls over related materials and to this end shall, among others, establish transit and brokering controls. Related materials are materials, equip\u00adment and technology covered by relevant multilateral trea\u00adties and arrangements, or included on national control lists, which could be used for the design, development, production or use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery. (16) This Regulation includes items which only pass through the territory of the Community, that is, those items which are not assigned a customs-approved treatment or use other than the external transit procedure or which are merely placed in a free zone or free warehouse and where no record of them has to be kept in an approved stock record. Accordingly, a possibility for Member States' authorities to prohibit on a case-by-case basis the transit of non-Community dual-use items should be established, where they have reasonable grounds for suspecting from intelligence or other sources that the items are or may be intended in their entirety or in part for proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or of their means of delivery. (17) Controls should also be introduced on the provision of brokering services when the broker has been informed by competent national authorities or is aware that such pro\u00advision might lead to production or delivery of weapons of mass destruction in a third country. (18) It is desirable to achieve a uniform and consistent applica\u00ad tion of controls throughout the EU in order to promote EU and international security and to provide a level playing field for EU exporters. It is therefore appropriate, in accor\u00addance with the recommendations of the Thessaloniki Action Plan and the calls of the EU WMD Strategy, to broaden the scope of consultation between Member States prior to granting an export authorisation. Among the ben\u00ad efits of this approach would be, for example, an assurance that a Member State's essential security interests would not be threatened by an export from another Member State. Greater convergence of conditions implementing national controls on dual-use items not listed in this Regulation, and harmonisation of the conditions of use of the differ\u00adent types of authorisations that may be granted under this Regulation would bring about more uniform and consis\u00adtent application of controls. Improving the definition of intangible transfers of technology, to include making avail\u00ad able controlled technology to persons located outside the EU, would assist the effort to promote security as would further alignment of the modalities for exchanging sensi\u00adtive information among Member States with those of the international export control regimes, in particular by pro\u00adviding for the possibility of establishing a secure electronic system for sharing information among Member States.29.5.2009 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 134/3 (19) Each Member State should determine effective, proportion\u00ad ate and dissuasive penalties applicable in the event of breach of the provisions of this Regulation, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER I SUBJECT AND DEFINITIONS Article 1 This Regulation sets up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items.

In exceptional cases, any Member State consulted may request the extension of the 10-day period. However, the extension may not exceed 30 working days. 2. If an export might prejudice its essential security interests, a Member State may request another Member State not to grant an export authorisation or, if such authorisation has been granted,request its annulment, suspension, modification or revocation.The Member State receiving such a request shall immediatelyengage in consultations of a non-binding nature with the request\u00ading Member State, to be terminated within 10 working days. Incase the requested Member State decides to grant the authorisa\u00adtion, this should be notified to the Commission and other Mem\u00adber States using the electronic system mentioned in Article 13(6).(1)29.5.2009 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 134/7 Article 12 1. In deciding whether or not to grant an individual or global export authorisation or to grant an authorisation for brokering services under this Regulation, the Member States shall take intoaccount all relevant considerations including: (a) the obligations and commitments they have each accepted as members of the relevant international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratificationof relevant international treaties; (b) their obligations under sanctions imposed by a commonposition or a joint action adopted by the Council or by adecision of the OSCE or by a binding resolution of the Secu\u00adrity Council of the United Nations; (c) considerations of national foreign and security policy, includ\u00ad ing those covered by Council Common Position2008/944/CFSP of 8 December 2008 defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology andequipment (1) OJ L 335, 13.12.2008, p. 99.; (d) considerations about intended end use and the risk of diversion. 2.

Where theyrefuse, annul, suspend, substantially limit or revoke an exportauthorisation or when they have determined that the intendedexport is not to be authorised, they shall notify the competentauthorities of the other Member States and the Commissionthereof and share the relevant information with them. In case thecompetent authorities of a Member State have suspended anexport authorisation, the final assessment shall be communicated to the Member States and the Commission at the end of the period of suspension. 2. The competent authorities of Member States shall review denials of authorisations notified under paragraph 1 within three years of their notification and revoke them, amend them or renewthem. The competent authorities of the Member States will notifythe results of the review to the competent authorities of the otherMember States and the Commission as soon as possible. Denialswhich are not revoked shall remain valid. 3. The competent authorities of the Member States shall notify the Member States and the Commission of their decisions to pro\u00ad hibit a transit of dual-use items listed in Annex I taken under Article 6 without delay. These notifications will contain all rel\u00ad evant information including the classification of the item, its tech\u00adnical parameters, the country of destination and the end user. 4. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to authorisations for brokering services.5. Before the competent authorities of a Member State, acting under this Regulation, grant an authorisation for export or bro\u00ad kering services or decide on a transit they shall examine all validdenials or decisions to prohibit a transit of dual-use items listedin Annex I taken under this Regulation to ascertain whether anauthorisation or a transit has been denied by the competentauthorities of another Member State or States for an essentiallyidentical transaction (meaning an item with essentially identicalparameters or technical characteristics to the same enduser or consignee). They shall first consult the competent authori\u00adties of the Member State or States which issued such denial(s) ordecisions to prohibit the transit as provided for in paragraphs 1 and 3. If following such consultation the competent authorities of the Member State decide to grant an authorisation or allow thetransit, they shall notify the competent authorities of the otherMember States and the Commission, providing all relevant infor\u00admation to explain the decision. 6. All notifications required under this Article will be made via secure electronic means including via a secure system that may be set up in accordance with Article 19(4). 7.

At the request of exporters, global export authorisations that contain quantitative limitations shall be split.L 134/8 EN Official Journal of the European Union 29.5.2009 CHAPTER IV UPDATING OF LIST OF DUAL-USE ITEMS Article 15 1. The list of dual-use items set out in Annex I shall be updated in conformity with the relevant obligations and commitments, and any modification thereof, that Member States have acceptedas members of the international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant inter\u00ad national treaties. 2. Annex IV, which is a subset of Annex I, shall be updated with regard to Article 30 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, namely the public policy and public security inter\u00adests of the Member States. CHAPTER V CUSTOMS PROCEDURES Article 16 1. When completing the formalities for the export of dual-use items at the customs office responsible for handling the exportdeclaration, the exporter shall furnish proof that any necessary export authorisation has been obtained. 2. A translation of any documents furnished as proof into an official language of the Member State where the export declara\u00ad tion is presented may be required of the exporter. 3. Without prejudice to any powers conferred on it under, and pursuant to, the Community Customs Code, a Member State may also, for a period not exceeding the periods referred to in para\u00adgraph 4, suspend the process of export from its territory, or, if necessary, otherwise prevent the dual-use items listed in Annex I which are covered by a valid export authorisation from leavingthe Community via its territory, where it has grounds for suspi\u00adcion that: (a) relevant information was not taken into account when the authorisation was granted, or (b) circumstances have materially changed since the grant of the authorisation. 4. In the case referred to in paragraph 3, the competent authorities of the Member State which granted the export autho\u00adrisation shall be consulted forthwith in order that they may takeaction pursuant to Article 13(1). If such competent authoritiesdecide to maintain the authorisation, they shall reply within 10working days, which, at their request, may be extended to 30working days in exceptional circumstances. In such case, or if noreply is received within 10 or 30 days, as the case may be, thedual-use items shall be released immediately. The Member Statewhich granted the authorisation shall inform the other MemberStates and the Commission. Article 17 1. Member States may provide that customs formalities for the export of dual-use items may be completed only at customs offices empowered to that end. 2. Member States availing themselves of the option set out in paragraph 1 shall inform the Commission of the duly empowered customs offices. The Commission shall publish the information inthe C series of the Official Journal of the European Union. Article 18 The provisions of Articles 843 and 912a to 912g of Regulation(EEC) No 2454/93 shall apply to the restrictions relating to theexport, re-export and exit from the customs territory of dual-useitems for the export of which an authorisation is required underthis Regulation. CHAPTER VI ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION Article 19 1.

Table \u2014 Deposition techniques \u2014 Technical note Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows: a. Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, composite, dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or com\u00adbined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material onthe substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the sub\u00adstrate, a glow discharge plasma, or laser irradiation. N.B.1 CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal deposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes. N.B.2 Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture. N.B.3 The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture. b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapour Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0,1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This processresults in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordi\u00ad nary modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modifica\u00ad tion in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknessof coatings can be a feature of these processes.29.5.2009 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 134/119 Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows: 1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating; 2. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species; 3. Laser Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave laser beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating; 4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periph\u00adery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition. N.B.This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates. 5. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extrac\u00ad tion of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses ofcoatings are ordinary modifications of the process. c. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in apowder mixture (a pack), that consists of: 1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminium, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof); 2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and 3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina. The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1 030 K (757 \u00b0C) and 1 375 K (1 102 \u00b0C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating. d. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasmaspraying. N.B.1 Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure. N.B.2 High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 \u00b0C) at 0,1 MPa. e. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting,subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating. f. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ionsare accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impactingions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate. N.B.1 The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporisation of non- metallic coating materials. N.B.2 Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition. g. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionized, acceleratedthrough a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in whichion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapour deposition or sputter deposition.29.5.2009 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 134/121 CATEGORY 3 ELECTRONICS29.5.2009 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 134/123 3A Systems, Equipment and Components Note 1:The control status of equipment and components described in 3A001 or 3A002, other than those described in 3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.10. or 3A001.a.12., which are specially designed for or which have the same func\u00ad tional characteristics as other equipment is determined by the control status of the other equipment.

APP is expressed in Weighted TeraFLOPS (WT), in units of 1012 adjusted floating point operations per second Abbreviations used in this Technical Note n:number of processors in the digital computer i:processor number (i,...n) ti:processor cycle time (ti = 1/Fi) Fi:processor frequency Ri:peak floating point calculating rate Wi:architecture adjustment factor Outline of APP calculation method 1. For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the digital computer. Note In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions and/or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressedin fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating point operands of64-bit or more, the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor R i = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate APP as APP = W1 \u00d7 Note 1For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as addition and multiplication, each operation is counted. Note 2For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate. Note 3The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the APP of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for thecomputer. Note 4Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communica\u00ad tion and video display) when calculating APP.
