A fourth-dose 18 months after the primary vaccination was shown to restore the waning ef cacy. However, only total IgG against the immunodominant malaria vaccine epitope has been analyzed following the booster. To better characterize the magnitude, nature, and longevity of the immune response to the booster, we measured levels of total IgM, IgG, and IgG 1-4subclasses against three constructs of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg, also present in RTS,S) by quantitative suspension array technology in 50 subjects in the phase 3 trial in Manhi\u00e7a, Mozambique. To explore the impact of vaccination on naturally acquired immune responses, we measured antibodies to P. falciparum antigens not included in RTS,S. We found increased IgG, IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4, but not IgG2 nor IgM, levels against vaccine antigens 1 month afterthe fourth dose. Overall, antibody responses to the booster dose were lower than the initial peak response to primary immunization and children had higher IgG and IgG1 levels than infants. Higher anti-Rh5 IgG and IgG 1-4levels were detected after the booster dose, suggesting that RTS,S partial protection could increase some blood stage antibody responses. Our work shows that theresponse to the RTS,S/AS01 Ebooster dose is different from the primary vaccine immune response and highlights the dynamic changes in subclass antibody patterns upon the vaccine booster and with acquisition of adaptive immunity to malaria. npj Vaccines (2020) 5:46 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-020-0192-7 INTRODUCTION Despite the great reduction in malaria cases in the last 15 years, thanks to the combination of multiple control measures, it is estimated that 219 million malaria cases and 435,000 deathsoccurred in 2017, mostly associated with Plasmodium falciparum1. Importantly, 90% of these deaths concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and a large proportion occurred in children under 5 years. Owing to the concerning rise of parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs and vector resistance to insecticides1,2and stalling progress in reducing malaria since 20161,2, integration of a malaria vaccine with other preventive measures will be a useful addition to controldisease burden in the future. Currently, the pre-erythrocytic RTS,S/AS01 Evaccine is the most advanced, having shown consistent but partial vaccine ef cacy (VE) that wanes over time and is less effective in infants compared to children3. RTS,S/AS01E contains a fusion protein including the central tandem repeat (NANP) and the C-terminal (C-term) regions of the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP), and the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). It is expressed togetherwith HBsAg, and injected in combination with the AS01 adjuvant system4. The vaccine was tested in a phase 3 clinical trial of a 3- dose immunization schedule (month [M] 0, M1 and M2) with a fourth dose 18 months after primary vaccination (M20)3, with thebooster dose partly restoring the waning VE. Speci cally, VE for the 3-dose immunization schedule was 35.2% in children and20.3% in infants up to M32 of the study, but VE waned over timewith a VE of 16.1 and 7.6%, respectively, when considering only the period from M20 to M32. In children and infants who received the booster dose, waning VE was restored to overall levels of 43.9and 27.8%, respectively 3. In order to understand why protection offered by RTS,S is suboptimal and continue efforts to improve it,there is a need to decipher the mechanisms of protection elicitedby the vaccine. It has been shown that antibody levels areinvolved in the vaccine-induced immunity, but they do not fullyexplain the protective effect of the vaccine 5,6. Thus far, the study of antibody response in trials performed in endemic areas hasbeen largely focused on IgG levels against the NANP repeat regionof CSP, with the exception of our previous work assessing moregenerally subclass responses to NANP and to other antigens afterprimary vaccination in the phase 3 trial 7-9. Characterizing responses by other antibody isotypes, sub- classes, and responses to different epitopes may provide in depth understanding of the immune response to the vaccine and themode of action. Antibody levels are not the sole means todetermine vaccine mechanisms of action. Characteristics like thebalance between isotypes or subclasses of the antibodies are Cl\u00ednic de of Immunology & Infection Research and Centre for Immunity, Infection & Evolution, Ashworth Laboratories, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, King 's Buildings, Edinburgh, UK.5U.S. Military Malaria Vaccine Program, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, MD, USA.6Infection and Immunity Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Microbiology, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.7Malaria Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi, India.8Laboratory of Malaria and Vaccine Research, School of Biotechnology, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.9Burnet Institute, the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development1234567890():,;important because of their varying effector functions10. For instance, some IgG subclasses act as cytophilic others have non-cytophilic functions10,i nfluencing the roles of Fc-mediated functions such as complement xation and phagocytosis11. Determining which type of response is detrimental or bene cial could further inform which responses could be modi ed to enhance the ef cacy of the vaccine. The epitope speci city of the antibody response is also relevant. There is clear evidence that NANP is related to VE6but other regions could also mediate protection. Avidity of IgG to the CSP C-term has been associated with protection in African children12, and C-term and not the NANP-repeat-speci c antibodies have been reported to be the main mediators of phagocytic activity in naive adults13. Furthermore, antibodies to both C-term and NANP- repeat can mediate complement xation in children, suggesting both regions are important for functional activity14,15. Additionally, studying the response to P. falciparum blood stage antigens not present in the vaccine is relevant to determine theeffect of the vaccine on naturally acquired immunity (NAI), developed from continuous parasite exposure. It has been hypothesized that vaccination could (1) decrease NAI by reducing the exposure to the parasite, which could mean individuals are left vulnerable in the long term due to the waning ef cacy of the vaccine3, as predicted for other malaria prevention tools16, or (2) increase NAI by allowing subclinical exposure to the parasite due to the partial ef cacy of the vaccine9,17. Here, we used samples from the phase 3 trial at the time of the booster dose (M20) and onwards from a subgroup of subjects in Manhi\u00e7a, Mozambique, to characterize the effect of the RTS,S/ AS01 Ebooster dose on different antibody responses. We evaluated total IgM, IgG and IgG 1-4subclasses to vaccine and vaccine-unrelated P. falciparum blood stage antigens. Data werecombined with those from the primary vaccine response previously assessed7-9to display the kinetics from baseline (M0) until M32. RESULTS Short- and dose increased IgG, IgG1, IgG3, vaccine antigens 1 month (M21) after itsadministration (M20), but it did not increase IgG2 nor IgM levels(Figs. 1and 2; and Supplementary Table 1). The increase in antibody levels was signi cant both when comparing the levels pre-boost at M20 and M21 of the same individual, and when comparing the levels at post-boost M21 of the RTS,S booster group (R3R) to those of the individuals who did not receive abooster (R3C), except for IgG3 CSP NANP and IgG3 CSP full length(FL) for the latter comparison. At M21, the highest levels wereagainst FL CSP, followed by the CSP NANP region, the CSP C-termand HBsAg. The predominant subclass was IgG1 followed by IgG3,then levels of IgG2 and least for IgG4. Longer-term immunogenicity was measured 1 year after the administration of the booster (M32). IgG and IgG1 (but not IgG3)levels against vaccine antigens in the R3R group remained group, except for IgG1 NANP (Figs. 1and 2; and Supplementary Table 1). Similar to the pattern at M21, IgG2 andIgM levels were not higher in R3R For IgG4, levels weresigni cantly higher in compared to R3C only for CSP C-term and HBsAg. In comparison to the group that did not receive anyRTS,S dose (C3C), the R3R and R3C groups levels at M32 remained for antigens total IgG, IgG1-2 subclasses for CSP constructs and HBsAg at month (M) 20, 21, and 32 for RTS,S/AS01 vaccinees with (R3R) and without (R3C) with medians, interquartile ranges (IQR), upper whisker between maximum \u00d7 value and Q3 +1.5*IQR, lower whisker as the largest between minimum \u00d7 and Q1 -1.5*IQR, and log 10(geometric mean(MFI)) (diamond). Non-parametric tests were used to compare the booster response (M20 vs. M21) and the long-term immunogenicity (M21 vs. M32), as well as to compare the R3C and R3R groups at eachtimepoint.

Sanchez et al. 2 npj Vaccines (2020) 46 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development1234567890():,;Antibody kinetics through the entire study follow-up When comparing the booster response (M21) to the primary vaccination response (M3), the group that received the booster hada lower peak in IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 levels after the booster than after primary vaccination (Figs. 3and 4; and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). In contrast, IgG4 levels against CSP constructs showedhigher levels after the booster dose than after primary vaccination,and overall levels increased in time. The opposite happened with HBsAg where IgG4 levels decreased with time and were higher at M3 than at M21. Although primary vaccination increased IgG2 andIgM levels, the booster dose did not increase them. The decrease in anti-CSP levels from primary vaccination to M20 was larger for IgG3 than for IgG and IgG1; the mean decreases for anti-NANP IgG and IgG1 was around 1.5 log 10median fluorescent intensity (MFI) while for IgG3 it was around 2.5 log 10MFI. IgG2 levels remained more stable after the primary vaccination and did not increase or decrease vastly after M3. Remarkably, IgG4 levels against CSP FL and C-term at M20 were slightly higher than levelsat M3 although this effect was not observed in the C3C group. The levels of IgG and IgG 1-4to CSP in RTS,S/AS01 Evaccination groups (R3), with or without booster, were higher for most post-vaccination time points than the levels in the comparator group.IgM levels were higher only at M3 in the R3 groups compared to the C3C group. Factors affecting immunogenicity Age. Children who received RTS,S/AS01 Eeither with or without a booster had higher IgG and IgG1 levels against CSP antigens thaninfants throughout the study period (Supplementary Figs. 1 -6 and Supplementary Table 2). Without booster, IgG3 levels to NANP and FL CSP, but not C-term, were higher in children than infants. Incontrast, we did not detect differences in IgG3 levels between age groups after booster immunization. Most of the differencesobserved were not statistically signi cant but there were consistent patterns, e.g., for the same isotype/subclass and antigen, levels were lower in infants than children and all comparisons were p< 0.05 before adjustment for multiple testing. We did not detect a signi cant in fluence of age on IgG2, IgG4, or IgM levels in any group after the booster, except for NANP IgG4 levels in the R3R group that were higher in children. Likewise, we did not detect signi cant differences in antibody levels against HBsAg between age groups. Malaria episodes . We compared the antibody levels at M20, M21 and M32 in individuals who had either presented or not withclinical malaria before M20 (Figs. 5-7and Supplementary Table 3). None of the comparisons were statistically signi cant after adjusting for multiple testing. At M20 we did not detect anysigni cant difference between individuals who presented or not with prior clinical malaria in the RTS,S vaccinees. In the R3R group at M21 there was FL and anti-NANP IgG4 levels(p< 0.05 before adjustment) in individuals who had clinical malaria. For the R3C group at M21, individuals who presented with clinical malaria before M20 had lower anti-CSP IgG and IgG1mean levels levels againstCSP FL ( p< 0.05 before adjustment). In contrast, IgM levels were higher in plasma from previous malaria cases but this was not statistically signi cant. In the C3C group, IgG and IgG 1-3to FL CSP and NANP were higher in the subjects with previous malaria casesbut this difference was not statistically signi cant after adjusting for multiple testing. Lower levels of IgG, IgG1, and IgG3 to HBsAg were also observed and in the immunogenicity against vaccine antigens: IgG3-4 subclasses and IgM for CSP constructs and HBsAg at month (M) 20, 21, and 32 for RTS,S/AS01 vaccinees with (R3R) and without (R3C) with medians, interquartile ranges (IQR), upper whisker between maximum \u00d7 value and Q3 +1.5*IQR, lower whisker as the largest between minimum \u00d7 and Q1 -1.5*IQR, and log 10(geometric mean(MFI)) (diamond). Non-parametric tests were used to compare the booster response (M20 vs. M21) and the long-term immunogenicity (M21 vs. M32), as well as to compare the R3C and R3R groups at each timepoint. Only p-values < 0.05 after adjustment for multiple testing are shown. The y-axis is in logarithm 10 scale. R3R (green): RTS,S/AS01 and a comparator booster.

Sanchez et al. 3 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2020) 46 malaria cases (Supplementary Fig. 7), but these differences were not statistically signi cant. The study was not designed to assess associations with future malaria risk but we had some provisional ndings. IgG2 and IgG3 to vaccine antigens in the R3R group at M21 were higher in those subjects with subsequent clinical malaria, but this difference wasnot statistically signi cant. Only for anti-NANP IgG2 and anti-HBsAg IgG2 and IgG3 levels, differences had p< 0.05 before adjusting for multiple testing (Figs. 8-11and Supplementary Table 3). In contrast, IgG1 and IgG4 levels to NANP and CSP FL in the R3R group at M21were lower in malaria cases, but not signi cantly. An opposite pattern consisting of higher levels in malaria cases was observed in the R3C group. Fold-change in IgM levels against CSP constructs from M20 to M21 in the R3R group was lower in malaria cases ( p< 0.05 before adjustment) (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). Thiscontrasted to what was observed in the R3C group who had higher fold-change in IgM levels in malaria cases. Additionally, the fold- change in anti-HBsAg IgG3 levels was higher in malaria cases ( p< 0.05 before adjustment). In most cases, there was no statistically signicant difference between subjects presenting with clinical malaria after M21 and those who did not. Effect of RTS,S booster vaccination on antibodies to blood stage antigens For most of the blood stage antigens we studied, we could not detect differences in antibody levels before and after the booster dose, nor when comparing the R3R, R3C, and C3C groups. There were some differences ( p< 0.05 before adjustment) in antibody levels at M3 M21 for MSP5, MSP1 42, MSP1-BL2, (Supplementary 10 -15 and Supplemen- tary Table 4). Interestingly, Rh5 antibodies showed a consistent change in levels after the RTS,S booster for IgG and all IgG subclasses, with higher levels in the R3R group (Figs. 12and 13; Supplementary Fig. 16 and Supplementary Table 4). In the case ofIgG, IgG1 and IgG2 the differences were signi cant both in the short (M21) and long (M32) term, while for IgG3 and IgG4 differences were only at M21 with p< 0.05 before adjustment. Curiously, overall levels diminished over follow-up with the exception of IgG4. Age did not have a signi cant effect on the antibody levels against the studied blood stage antigens (Supplementary Figs. 16 - 23 and Supplementary Table 5). Individuals who were classi ed as having had a case of clinical malaria before M20 tended to have higher levels of antibody to blood stage antigens at M20-32 but this difference was not statistically signi cant (Supplementary Figs. 24 -30 and Supplementary Table 6). The most remarkable difference was the levels of MSP1 42that acted as a marker for malaria exposure, showing higher levels in those who had clinical malaria, in particular for IgG, IgG1 and IgG2. Overall, the responses showed a general pattern of higher levels at all time points for all vaccination groups in individuals who subsequently presented with a malaria case but it was not signi cant (Supplementary Figs. 31-37 and Supplementary Table 6). DISCUSSION This study con rms that the RTS,S/AS01 Ebooster dose increases total IgG levels against vaccine antigens and elucidates itsFig. 3 Antibody responses against vaccine antigens for months (M) 0, 3, 20, 21, and 32 for IgG, IgG1, and IgG2.

Sanchez et al. 4 npj Vaccines (2020) 46 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Developmentdiffering effect on IgG subclasses and IgM not previously studied. We describe for the rst time the long-term RTS,S/AS01 Eantibody response to different antigens and CSP epitopes. The booster dose increased total IgG, IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 for all vaccine antigens compared to pre-booster levels, and they remained above thelevels of non-vaccinated individuals during the entire follow-upperiod. Remarkably, the fourth dose did not induce an increase in IgG2 levels (although the primary vaccination did) but it increased IgG1 and IgG3 levels, which may explain how the booster led tohigher ef cacy overall. IgG1 and IgG3 can effectively x complement and promote interactions with Fc -receptors on phagocytes 10, which could be contributing to RTS,S-induced protection. IgG2 and IgG4, on the contrary, are non-cytophilicantibodies unable to x complement and to interact with Fc - receptors 10. The pro le of antibody responses seems to be epitope-speci c. Previously, the bulk of studies had only evaluated NANPantibodies and have provided clear evidence that NANP antibodies are associated with protection 6, being the established immunodominant region of the vaccine antigen4. However, there is evidence that antibodies against C-term are involved inphagocytic activity in US naive adults 13, and RTS,S vaccine- induced antibodies to the C-term among children can promote complement xation14. Also, in our previous work we have found that post-primary vaccination, the avidity of the IgG response toCSP C-term was associated with protection 12. Here, we show that the booster dose increases levels of antibodies against both NANP and the C-term, and that the responses against these two regionsmay behave differently. Antibody levels to NANP were highercompared to C-term, but the proportional increase 1 month after the booster dose was not different. Previously it was reported that the IgG levels to NANP were increased by the booster dose, but the peak post-booster levelswere lower than following primary vaccination 6. In this study, we found similar results for IgG subclasses \u2014there was boosting but levels overall were lower than following primary vaccination7. Remarkably, IgG4 levels against CSP kept increasing with time. TheRTS,S pattern differs to other vaccines in which the peak for the booster response is higher than the peak for the primary vaccination18. The unusual response to the booster dose could be caused by different factors. These factors include the responseto primary vaccination19, but also the booster dose or the primary vaccination schedule20,21. For instance, it has been reported that for some vaccines high residual levels of vaccine antibodies have anegative effect on the post-booster response19; however, our study did not nd evidence for a negative correlation between M20 and M21 antibody levels (Supplementary Figs. 38 and 39). There is also evidence from the response to a Meningococcalconjugated vaccine that primary vaccination administered with a short interval doses might lead to higher antibodies at the primary vaccination peak, but a higher number of doses lead to a lowerpost-booster response 20. The effect of the dosing interval on the responses to the RTS,S vaccine was observed on a phase 2 trial that compared a 0, 1, 2 months vs. 0, 1, 7 months schedule and showed that the highest peak was observed following the 0, 1,2 month schedule21. Also, the booster dose might induce different IgG subclass patterns to primary vaccination because it is acting on immune memory cells such as B memory cells and it might be inducing class switch and increasing antibody af nity19,22.Fig. 4 Antibody responses against vaccine antigens for months (M) 0, 3, 20, 21, and 32 for IgG3, IgG4 and IgM.

Sanchez et al. 5 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2020) 46 The AS01 Eadjuvant and the innate response and cytokine milieu that it elicits likely affect the evolution of antibody subclasspatterns observed. In addition, it may be in fluenced by differences in immune development due to older age and environmental exposures19. For instance, it has been reported that malaria transmission affects the antibody subclasses patterns in subjects who had malaria episodes23. Nevertheless, it is important to note that because primary and booster antibody data were notanalyzed at the same time, the comparison of antibodies betweentime points in our study should be interpreted carefully. We are reporting for the rst time the antibody booster response against HBsAg. Although the booster dose did increaseIgG, IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4 antibodies, the increments were lowerthan those of anti-CSP antibodies, and were similar to the response induced by primary vaccination in the Manhi\u00e7a site 7. Interestingly, the results of a trial that analyzed the response to ahepatitis B vaccine booster after RTS,S primary vaccination showed an increased response in HBsAg IgG concentrationscompared to primary vaccination24. The responses to HBsAg may be an indication of the quality of the immune response or the immune status of the child and the capacity to respond tovaccination and it requires further investigation. It has been previously reported that antibodies after primary vaccination are lower in the infant group than in the childrengroup. This may be due to the interference of maternal antibodiesagainst CSP or intrinsic differences in the developing and functional competence of the immune system 5. Antibodies seem to be lower in infants than children also at months 20, 21, and 32but only for total IgG and IgG1 against CSP epitopes, not forHBsAg responses, even though maternal antibodies are no longer present at this age. At the time of the booster, both age groups have passed the critical age of 2 years for immune ontogeny andPrevious by previous clinical malaria: total IgG, IgG1-4 subclasses and IgM at month (M)20, 21, and 32 for RTS,S/AS01 vaccinees with (R3R) and without (R3C) booster, and comparator (C3C).

Sanchez et al. 6 npj Vaccines (2020) 46 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Developmenttheir immune system has achieved a more adult status25,26, therefore, major differences driven by intrinsic changes in the immune system are less likely at this timepoint. Instead,differences detected may re flect a distinct establishment of a memory response in infants and children after primary vaccinationthat differentially affects the boosting of responses. One of the factors identi ed thus far in this and our previous studies 7, with an impact on vaccine responses, is prior malaria exposure. Preceding malaria cases were associated with lower IgG,IgG1, and IgG3 levels to CSP constructs at the time points studied.How malaria episodes may affect immunization outcomes isanother key issue, since it may affect any malaria vaccine andneeds to be addressed in follow-up studies. The study was not powered to assess association of antibodies with malaria risk but we obtained some preliminary ndings. Interestingly, in children with malaria episodes post-booster dose,the IgG2 and IgG3 levels at M21 non-malaria controls, while IgG, IgG1, and IgG4 levels were lower, although with the available sample size this was not statistically signi cant for most comparisons. These results are in line with the ndings of our previous study 7in which IgG2 levels to RTS,S antigens were higher in malaria cases than in controls, whereas IgG1 levels were lower. The booster dose might be increasing protection not onlyby increasing total IgG levels, but also by not inducing IgG2 thatcould be detrimental, or not protective according to our previous results. However, the tendency for malaria cases to be associated with higher levels of IgG3 and lower levels for IgG4 to CSPconstructs was opposite to what was reported to occur afterprimary vaccination 7where a higher ratio between cytophilic (IgG1 and IgG3) to non-cytophilic (IgG2 and IgG4) CSP antibodies was associated with protection. The association between IgG4levels and protection is consistent with ndings of by previous clinical malaria: total IgG, IgG1-4 subclasses and IgM at month (M)20, 21, and 32 for RTS,S/AS01 vaccinees with (R3R) and without (R3C) booster, and comparator (C3C).

Sanchez et al. 7 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2020) 46 et al.27who reported that only IgG4 levels were positively associated with increased vaccine ef cacy in malaria-naive adults under the fractional dose regime. We have also previously found an association between IgG4 responses to non-RTS,S antigens after primary vaccination and protection8. IgG4 antibodies are associated with repeated or long-term exposure to antigens and have been linked to induction of tolerance, for instance higher IgG4/IgE ratios are associated with better food tolerance, as IgG4competes with IgE28. In the context of helminth infections, high IgG4 is associated with asymptomatic infection for some parasites10. However, there is con flicting evidence on the role of IgG2 and IgG4 on protection against malaria, whilst moreinformation exists on the protective role of IgG1 and IgG3. Inthe context of naturally acquired immunity, to non-cytophilic subclasses (IgG2 +IgG4) is in subjects with uncomplicated malaria compared tosubjects with complicated malaria, and higher in subjects protected from malaria 7,29. Additionally, it has been reported that the IgG2/IgG4 ratio is higher in subjects with uncomplicated malaria30. However, it has also been observed that IgG2 and IgG4 with high avidity are found in subjects with uncomplicatedmalaria compared to complicated malaria29. In contrast, the Chaudhury et al.27study assessing avidity and opsonization reported that RTS,S protection was mediated by IgG4 against theC-term of CSP. All of this evidence indicates that not only antibodylevels are important for protection but also the balance between subclasses. We note that the pattern of higher IgG, IgG1, and IgG4 levels to CSP FL and C-term in non-malaria cases was not apparentfor NANP. We previously observed that after primary vaccination, HBsAg antibody responses were associated with malaria protection 7,12.Previous by previous clinical malaria: total IgG, IgG1-4 subclasses and IgM at month (M)20, 21, and 32 for RTS,S/AS01 vaccinees with (R3R) and without (R3C) booster, and comparator (C3C).

The analysis of the phase 3 clinical trial found that children who did not receive the booster dose were at higher risk of severemalaria than the comparator (non-RTS,S) group 3. It was hypothe- sized that the primary vaccination had prevented vaccinees from acquiring natural immunity, as has been predicted for other malaria prevention tools16, increasing the risk of severe malaria in those individuals in whom infection reached the erythrocyticstage. However, on a longer follow-up study of up to 7 years on 3 of 11 sites, no increased risk was found for severe malaria between those groups that received the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine and the controlgroup31. Antibody responses to asexual blood stage antigens have been studied previously with samples from phase 2 clinical trials and showed a reduced antibody response in RTS,S vaccinees, but these trials did not include a booster dose17,32,33. We detected a decreased antibody response to certain vaccine-unrelated P. falciparum antigens after primary vaccination in the phase 3 trial as well8,9. However, we also observed an induction of antibody responses to other P. falciparum antigens following RTS,S vaccination (MSP1-BL2, EBA140, EBA175, and Rh4.2), which could contribute to malaria protection8,9. Here, we did not nd consistent differences in the NAI response between boostergroups except for Rh5. Interestingly and in line with our previousresults, Rh5 IgG and IgG1-2 levels were higher in the RTS,S booster group than in the comparator vaccine groups at M21 and M32, and R3C levels were either higher or did not differ from C3C.456789 1 0Postbooster malaria cases malaria after M21: total IgG, IgG1-4 subclasses and IgM for CSP FL at month (M) 20, 21, and 32 for RTS,S/AS01 vaccinees with (R3R) and without (R3C) booster, and comparator (C3C).

Sanchez et al. 9 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2020) 46 This nding requires future investigation to understand the basis and clinical relevance of this effect, especially since Rh5 is a leading vaccine candidate34, and because Rh5 antibody concen- trations need to be very high to actually confer protection35. However, these observations are important as they may explain why an anti-sporozoite infection vaccine also protects against clinical disease in the parasite blood stage, considering that Rh5 plays an essential role during erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum merozoites36-38. Additionally, IgG to MSP5 showed higher levels after RTS,S booster dose compared to the comparator boostergroup, but this was not statistically signi cant. Our ndings are limited because of a small sample size and because data were obtained only for Manhi\u00e7a. Therefore, a larger longitudinal study with samples from different sites is necessary to corroborate these data. This is particularly important in our casebecause there are some special considerations about Manhi\u00e7a that limits the generalization of these ndings: (1) at the time of the study malaria transmission was low 3,39, (2) there were unexpected results of VE in the phase 3 clinical trial, i.e., VE was lower in the R3R than in the R3C group, contrary to most sites, and (3) Manhi\u00e7a has a high HIV prevalence40. HIV infection was associated with a reduced immunogenicity to the vaccine in a phase 3 trial exploratory analysis but it was concluded that HIV-infected children should not be excluded from RTS,S vaccination41. Despite the constraints, our study provides new and interesting clues to the immune response elicited by the RTS,S booster dose. Additionally, avidity and functional antibody responses should be assessed, and these results integrated with cellular data to address memory responses induced by the booster. This information is necessary for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of456789 1 0Postbooster malaria cases malaria after M21: total IgG, IgG1-4 subclasses and IgM for CSP NANP at month (M) 20, 21, and 32 for RTS,S/AS01 vaccinees with (R3R) and without (R3C) booster, and comparator (C3C).

Results of these studies are required for the rational design and deployment of improved CSP-based vaccines and other malaria vaccines with an increased and long- term ef cacy. METHODS Population and study design This study was performed using plasma samples previously collected from subjects in Manhi\u00e7a, Mozambique, a site of low malaria transmissionintensity 3,39, as part of the MAL067 study ancillary to the phase 3 randomized clinical trial MAL055 (NCT00866619)3. A subset of 50 individuals (24 children 5 -17 months and 26 infants 6 -12 weeks) was selected from those previously analyzed7-9who had available antibodydata from M0 (baseline) and M3 (one month after third dose) and plasma samples for M20 (booster dose), M21, and M32 (Supplementary Table 7).The subjects had either received three doses of the RTS,S/AS01 Evaccine and a RTS,S/AS01 Ebooster (R3R, n=14) at M20, of RTS,S/AS01 E and a comparator booster (R3C, n=19), or three doses and a booster of a comparator vaccine (C3C, n=17) (Supplementary Fig. 40). The comparator vaccines used in the primary series were a Meningococcal C ConjugateVaccine (Menjugate ) in the 6 -12 weeks age category, and a cell-culture rabies vaccine (VeroRab ) in the 5 -17 months age category. The booster comparator was Menjugate for both age groups. Clinical malaria cases were detected by passive case detection and de ned as fever of at least 37.5 \u00b0C and any asexual P. falciparum parasitemia by microscopy 3. The prevalence of HIV infection in the Manhi\u00e7a area was around 40% inadults 40. HIV infection was not a protocol exclusion/inclusion criteria, but only healthy children were included in the study. HIV testing was not a trialprocedure.

MAGPlex beads were coupled separately to: three CSP C-term, NANP-repeat region) and HBsAg that are antigenic components vaccine; seven that were shown to be affected by vaccination in our previous studies7-9and/or that are leading vaccine candidates; and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) as a control for antigens co-expressed with a GST tag (Supplementary Table 8)42. The coupling of the beads to the antigens was performed as described previously43.Antigen-coupled beads were added to a 96-well Clear \u00aeflat bottom plate (Greiner Bio-One) in multiplex BSA, 0.05% Azide pH 7.4 (PBS-BN). Fifty microliters of sample, negative or positive control were added to wells andincubated overnight at 4 \u00baC in a shaker protected from light. Plates werewashed three times with 200 L/well of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 20: 0.05%) using a manual magnetic washer. Then, 100 L of biotinylated secondary antibody were added IgG 1/40,000 for IgG2 PBS-BN. All antibody incubations were performed for45 min, at room temperature, in agitation and protected from light.

Plates were stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight protected from light and read thenext day using the Luminex xMAP \u00ae100/200 analyzer; at least 50 microspheres per analyte were acquired per sample and Report Gain wasset as High PMT. For IgG, IgG1, IgG3, and IgM, 20 serial dilutions 1:2 of a positive control were used to perform antigen-subclass-speci c standard curves. For IgG2, 16 serial dilutions 1:2 were used. For IgG4, no standard curve wasperformed and only one positive control dilution was included. Thepositive control consisted of a WHO from RTS,S/AS02 vaccinated children42,45with high IgG levels against CSP at 1:200. Blanks were added to each plate in duplicatesand two negative controls samples from malaria-naive adults were addedin each plate. Test samples were assayed at three dilutions for IgG (500,20,000, 500,000), IgG1, IgG3 (100, 2500, 100,000) and IgM (100, 1000,25,000) to ensure that at least one dilution lie in the linear range of therespective standard curve, i.e., close to the highest slope between two dilution points. Owing to the low levels previously observed in these samples for IgG2 and IgG4 in Ubillos et al. 7only one dilution (1/50) was used. Sample distribution across plates was designed to ensure a balanceddistribution of vaccination groups, sex, age cohorts, and malaria cases. Thethree time points for each individual and the respective dilutions wereplaced on the same plate. Data were captured using xPonent software, and antibody levels were measured as MFI. Data pre-processing . The standard curve for each antigen-isotype/ subclass-plate was estimated using the drLumi R package flow 46,tted in a 4- or 5-parameter logistic (4-PL or 5-PL) regression model, and datapoints logarithmically transformed. To select the sample dilution for IgG,IgG1, and IgG3 in the linear part of the sigmoidal curve (antigen, isotype/ subclass and plate speci c), an algorithm that detects the two points with the highest slope between them was used. The slope was computed as:m=(MFI i-MFI i+1)/(dilution_factor i-dilution_factor i+1). The mean MFI value of the two points was computed and used as the reference value,but the standard curves were visually inspected and if the model did notconverge, the R 2< 0.9 or the curve maximum values were < 15,000 MFI, a 15,000 MFI reference value was set instead of the highest slope criteria. The nearest MFI of the test sample to the reference value was determinedand the corresponding dilution was selected. Since only one dilution wasused for IgG2 and IgG4, the standard curves were not used to select adilution. The MFI measurement of the selected dilution was correctedmultiplying by its corresponding dilution factor and transformed to log 10 scale to stabilize the variance. Blank and GST signals were not subtracted.Blanks were used to measure background signal, and GST to assess forunspeci c binding to the GST-fused antigens (CSP FL, CSP C-term, and CSP- NANP). Background values were below 500 MFI, and no correlation wasfound between IgG to GST and IgG to GST-fused antigens (SupplementaryFigs. 41 and 42). Statistical analysis Descriptive comparisons of Ig isotype/subclass levels to speci c antigens (log 10transformed MFI) at each visit were done by boxplots with log 10(geometric mean), medians, interquartile ranges (IQR), upper whisker as the smallest between maximum \u00d7 value and Q3 +1.5*IQR and lower whisker as the largest between minimum \u00d7 value and Q1 -1.5*IQR. Wilcoxon-Signed Rank Test between M20 and M21 for the R3R vaccination group, and between M21 and M32 for the R3R and R3C vaccination groupswere performed to determine if the antibody levels changed signi cantly 1 month and 1 year after the booster. Additionally, Mann -Whitney tests were performed to compare the R3R and R3C groups at each timepoint.Fig. 12 RTS,S/AS01 Ebooster and long-term immunogenicity against the blood stage antigen Rh5: total IgG, IgG1-4 subclasses and IgM at month (M) 20, 21, and 32 for RTS,S/AS01 vaccinees with (R3R) and without (R3C) with medians, interquartile ranges (IQR), upper whisker between maximum \u00d7 value and Q3 +1.5*IQR, lower whisker as the largest between minimum \u00d7 and Q1 -1.5*IQR, and log 10(geometric mean(MFI)) (diamond). Non-parametric tests were used to compare the booster response (M20 vs. M21) and the long-term immunogenicity (M21 vs. M32), as well as to compare the R3C and R3R groups at each timepoint.Only p-values < 0.05 after adjustment for multiple testing are shown.

Sanchez et al. 13 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2020) 46 p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using p.adjust on R47by the Holm approach for IgG and for IgM to control for family wise error, and bythe Benjamini -Hochberg approach for IgG1-4, altogether to control for the false-discovery rate since there were more tests. The comparisons betweentime points were corrected separately from the comparisons betweenvaccination groups, likewise the comparisons for vaccine antigens werecorrected separately from blood stage antigens. Data for M0 and M3 from our previous study 7was used to analyze the kinetics of the antibody response throughout the 5 time points in the clinical trial. Adjusted p- values were considered signi cant when <0.05. The qSAT assay of M20, M21, and M32 samples was performed in the same laboratory using thesame reagents and under similar conditions as the assay of the M0 andM3 samples, but they were not executed at the same time and a smaller set of antigens was used. Strati ed analyses and Mann -Whitney tests for independent groups and Wilcoxon-Signed Rank Tests for paired samples were performed betweenage groups and between malaria cases and controls, for each timepoint. p- values were adjusted following the same strategy as above. There were noreported malaria cases between M20 and M21. The change in antibodylevels between M20 was calculated as log 10MFI(M21) -log 10MFI (M20) and compared between individuals who either did or did not present with clinical malaria after M21. All data analysis and plots wereperformed using R packages gridExtra48, dplyr49, ggplot250, tidyr51, and psych52.
