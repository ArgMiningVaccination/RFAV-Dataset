Chafee Department of Revenue Office of Revenue Analysis Issue Date: August 16, 2012 Acknowledgements The 2012 Tax Expenditures Report was prepared at the re quest of Paul L. Dion, Ph.D., Chief of the Office of Revenue Anal ysis in accordance with Rhode Island General Law Chapter 44-48.1. Bethany Hordern, Budget Analyst I/Economist in the Office of Revenue Analysis was the projec t leader for the production of the report including both the derivation of estimates of revenue foregone and the writing of the report. Sunil Pokharel, Revenue Policy Analyst, provided significant technical support to Ms. Hordern. Ms. Hordern was also assisted by Jennifer Kennedy, Chief Implementation Aide in the Office of the Di rector. Much of the information needed to derive estimates was provi ded by the Division of Taxa tion under the direction of the tax administrator, David M. Sullivan. Clearly, the production of this report is not possible without the Division of Taxation's input and assistance. The Office of Revenue Analysis is appreciative of the e fforts made by the Division of Taxation to provide us with the best information avai lable at the time the report was written. iTable of Contents I.

Executive Summary The 2012 Tax Expenditures Report contains informati on on 235 tax expenditure items enacted in Rhode Island General La w as of January 1, 2011. Tax expenditures are legal mandates that provide preferential tax treatment to taxpayers that meet the requirements of the mandates. For the tax expenditure items that did have reliable data from which to estimate the revenue foregone, the total estimated foregone revenue was just over $1.73 billion in Tax Year 2009. The table below shows the amount of estimated foregone revenue, the number of tax expenditure items in each category and the average reliability inde x level by tax expenditure category: Summary Table by Tax Expenditure Category Tax Expenditure Category Tax Year 2009 Cost Number of Items in Each Category Average Reliability Index Level Credits $ 207,467,359 41 1.3 Deductions 262,368,045 23 4.0 Exclusions 64,589,547 26 4.3 Exemptions 1,130,821,428 97 3.5 Modifications 6,204,957 32 1.3 Other Items \u2014 8 5.0 Preferential Tax Rates 58,887,626 4 1.0 Tax Abatement 1,856,908 2 1.0 Tax Deferral \u2014 2 5.0 Total $ 1,732,195,870 235 3.0 The tax expenditure category with the largest number of different items was exemptions with 97. Exemptions also had the largest number of items for which no reliable data existed from which to calcu late foregone revenue at 38, or 39.2 percent of all exemption items. Fina lly, exemptions are also th e tax expenditure category with highest calculated foregone revenue at $1.13 billion or 65.3 percent of the estimated total foregone revenue. The tax expenditure item with the smallest amount of foregone revenue was Tax Abatemen ts at $1,856,908, or 0.1 percent of the estimated total foregone revenue. The table on the next page displays the amount of foregone revenue, the number of tax expenditure items and the average re liability index level by tax type. The tax type with the largest number of tax expe nditure items for which no reliable data existed was the business corporation tax at 33 items, or 55.0 percent of all tax expenditure items in this tax type. The ta x type with the largest amount of foregone revenue was the Sales and Use Tax at $1.03 billion, or 59.6 percent of the estimated total foregone revenue. Several tax t ypes had the smallest amount of foregone revenue at $0. 3 4Summary Table by Tax Type Tax Type Tax Year 2009 Cost Number of Tax Expenditure Items Average Reliability Index Level Alcoholic Beverage Tax $ 1,661 3 3.7 Bank Deposits Tax \u2014 3 2.3 Bank Tax 13,421 23 2.7 Beverage Container Fee 184,330 2 4.5 Business Corporation Tax 83,764,786 60 3.2 Cigarette Tax 2,350,097 4 3.3 Estate Tax 1,338,266 2 3.0 Franchise Tax 0 6 3.7 Generation Skip Transfer Tax 0 1 1.0 Insurance Companies Tax 21,654,825 23 2.4 Motor Carrier Fuel Tax 2,955,425 1 1.0 Motor Fuel Tax 54,268,887 3 1.3 Personal Income Tax 530,507,799 87 1.8 Public Service Corporation Tax 0 21 2.9 Rental Vehicle Surcharge 2,706,873 1 1.0 Real Estate Conveyance Tax \u2014 4 5.0 Sales and Use Tax 1,032,449,500 84 3.5 Total $ 1,732,195,870 328 2.8 The calculation of the revenue foregone for each of the 235 tax expenditure items is assigned a reliability level index on a s cale of one to five with one meaning the calculated foregone revenue is the most reliable possible and five meaning that it is not possible to calculate the foregone revenue of the tax expenditure item. A total of 88, or 37.5 percent of all tax expenditure items received a reliability level index score of one while 80 or 34.0 percent of the 235 tax expenditure items were assigned a reliability index score of five. The remaining 67 tax expenditure items were granted reliability level index scores of two, three or four with 33 of these 67 tax expenditure items receiving a reliability index level of three. The largest amount of calculated foregone revenue for a tax e xpenditure item is the sales and use tax exemption for purch ases used for manufacturing purposes at nearly $306.0 million or 17.7 percent of the total calculated foregone revenue. This tax expenditure item was assigned a reliability index level of three. There were 29 tax expenditure items in tota l which had the smallest possible foregone revenue of $0 and all were assigned reliability level indexes of one. II. Foreword The 2012 Tax Expenditures Report improves upon the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report in several ways. First, the 2012 Tax Expenditures Report contains more complete and more extensive disclosures of comparable tax expenditure items that are in effect in the other New England states. The intent is to provide the reader with a ready description of what the other New England states do with respect to a partic ular tax expenditure item as well as an accurate statutory refere nce should the reader wish to consult the source document for the report's reference directly. Second, the 2012 Tax Expenditures Report's tables of the Summary Results by Tax Expenditure Item and the Summary Results by Tax Type provide the page number where the description of a given tax expend iture item is located. This feature will (hopefully) make it easier for the reader to quickly find whatever tax expenditure item is of interest to them. Third, the information on Recent Tax Expenditures Law Changes has been moved from the back of the document to the fr ont of the document. The reason for this change is to provide the reader with an understanding of what tax expenditure law changes have been enacted prior to th eir diving into the details of each tax expenditure item. Finally, the 2012 Tax Expenditures Report uses Tax Year 2009 as its base tax year data wherever possible and then re ports estimates for Tax Years 2010 through 2013. Technically, the report is supposed to use Tax Year 2010 as the base year but complete Tax Year 2010 data was not availabl e at the various points in time when the report was being prepared. For consiste ncy across tax expenditure items every attempt was made to use data from Tax Y ear 2009 as the base. It should be noted, however, that for some tax expenditure it ems the only data available was for Tax Year 2010 and in those circumstances Tax Year 2010 serves as the base year. It is also possible that more current data is now available for some tax expenditure items and that this data may not be reflected in this report. As always, constructive comments are we lcome and any errors or omissions in the report are the responsibi lity of the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis. Paul L. Dion, Ph.D. Chief, Office of Revenue Analysis Rhode Island Department of Revenue 5III. Introduction Purpose of the Tax Expenditures Report The purpose of the Tax Expenditures Report is to provide information on the cost of tax preference items that are mandated by Rhode Island law, federal law, or other legal directives. Tax expenditure items are not subject to the same public scrutiny as spending appropriations that are made vi a the budget process. Oftentimes, the estimated cost of a tax expenditure item is made only once \u2014 at the time that the tax expenditure item is passed into law. Th e Tax Expenditures Report provides for an accounting of the cost of tax expenditure items on an ongoing basis. By providing this cost information, the Tax Expenditures Report allows these expenditures to be assessed on par with appropriate d expenditures. Absent a Tax Expenditures Report, it would be extremely difficult to assess the co st effectiveness of a tax expenditure vis- \u00e0-vis an appropriated expend iture. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes tax expenditures are simp ly \"spending by another name.\"1 Current Rhode Island Law on Tax Expenditures Reporting Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44-48.1(a)2 mandates that the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis deliver to the General Assembly by the second Tuesday in January of each even numbered year a tax expenditure report. The tax expenditure report must include the minimum information fo r 100.0 percent of the tax expenditures in place on January 1 of the odd numbered year preceding the report's publication. Thus, the 2012 Tax Expenditures Report covers all of the tax expenditures that were in place on January 1, 2011. Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44-48.1(b) defines a tax expenditure as \"any tax credit, deduction, exemption, exclusion, cred it preferential tax rate, tax abatement, and tax deferral that provides preferential treatment to selected taxpayers.\" The term \"credit preferential tax rate\" is not defined in the statute. The Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis has chosen to interpre t this item to mean a \"modification\" or \"preferential tax rate\" and reports on each of these tax expenditure items separately. The Office of Revenue Analysis has dete rmined that, as of January 1, 2011, there were 235 tax expenditure items in effect e ither \"directly through Rhode Island general laws or constitutional provisions or indire ctly through adoption of other tax codes.\" Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44-48.1(c) de lineates the information on each tax expenditure item that must be included in the report. This information includes: (1) the legal reference of the tax expenditure and whether the tax expenditure is the result of a federal or state constitutional, judiciary or statutory mandate; (2) the actual amount of revenue foregone, or an estimate th ereof, from the tax expenditure, in the 1 Levitis, Jason, Nicholas Johnson, and Jeremy Koulish, Promoting State Budget Accountability Through Tax Expenditure Reporting. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities: Washington, D.C., April 2009, page 5. 2 A full copy of the statute governing tax expenditure reporting is contained in Appendix A. 6\"calendar year immediately preceding the publ ication of the report\"; (3) estimates of the revenue foregone in the calendar year in which the report is published and the calendar year immediately following the publicat ion of the report; (4 ) an index of the reliability of each estimate that ranges in va lue from one to five with level one being the most reliable; (5) the identification of the beneficiaries of the tax expenditure by \"number, income, class and industry\"; (6 ) a comparison of th e Rhode Island tax expenditure item to tax expe nditure items of the othe r New England states but particularly Connecticut a nd Massachusetts; (7) \"the da ta sources and analysis methodology\" for each tax expenditure item estimate; and (8) \"i dentification of similar taxpayers or industries\" that do not benefit from the tax expenditure item. To the greatest extent possible the Office of Re venue Analysis has tried to comply with each of these informational mandates. Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44-48.1(d) requi res that each repor t contain a section comprised of recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the Tax Expenditures Report as a tax policy tool. The recomme ndations are to be accompanied with an identification of the resources needed to implement the recommendations and an estimate of the costs associated with the recommendations. History of Rhode Island Law on Tax Expenditures Reporting Rhode Island's governing statute for tax expenditure reporting was passed into law without the Governor's signature on August 9, 1996 (see Rhode Island Public Laws 1996 Chapter 327, Section 1 and Chapte r 394, Section 1). This initial statute required the state tax admini strator to submit annually to the General Assembly beginning in 1998, on or before the sec ond Tuesday in January, \"to the extent possible within the appropriations provided for the purpose\" a tax expenditure report. The report for 1998 was to provide the \"min imum information\" for 25.0 percent of existing tax expenditures. The report fo r 1999 would cover an additional 25.0 percent of the tax expenditures so that 50.0 percent of tax expenditures will have been reported. Similar 25.0 percent increments were required for 2000 and 2001 such that by January 2001, 100.0 percent of tax expenditures will have been reported. Beginning in January 2002, the cycle repeated itse lf so that no report on a tax expenditure item was more than four years old. The definition of tax expenditure was the same as it is in current law as was the requirement for providing the legal reference of each tax expenditure, identifying the beneficiaries of each tax expenditure as well as similar taxpayers or industries that did not benefit from the tax expenditure, and comparing Rhode Island's tax expenditure items to those of other New England states particularly Connecticut and Massachusetts. The original statute also required that the report include the legislative history of each tax expenditure, the \"[D]etermination of the beneficiary's state tax burden\" and a cost/benefit analysis of each tax expenditure item \"including the direct revenue loss from the tax expenditure as well as the economic and tax revenue gains occurring through the ec onomic activity resulting from the tax expenditure.\" On June 25, 1997 (see R hode Island Public Laws 1997 Chapter 30 7 8Section 1) the original statute was amended to delete the requirement of the inclusion of a cost/benefit analysis for each tax expe nditure item in the tax expenditure report. On July 10, 2003 the statute was amended ag ain to change the periodicity of the report from annually to biannually beginning in 2004. In addition, the rolling renewal of 25.0 percent of existing tax expenditure s was changed to require that \"the minimum information on 100.0 percent of tax expenditures in effect on January 1\" of the prior calendar year be reported. The requi rement that the legislative history of a tax expenditure item be reported was elimin ated leaving only the requirement that the legal reference for each tax expenditure item be reported. Further, the original statute was modified to require that an estimate of the foregone revenue that results from each tax expenditure item be reported if th e actual amount cannot be determined and that such estimates be made for the calendar year preceding and following the year in which the report is published as well as th e report's publication year. Additionally, the requirement that the beneficiary of ta x expenditure item's state tax burden be determined was deleted and replaced with th e requirement that the data sources and analysis methodology underlying each estimat e of foregone revenue be provided. Also, the amendment to the statute requ ired each report to include \"a section containing recommendations for improving th e effectiveness of the report as a tax policy tool\" including the resources required and an estimate of the costs associated with these recommendations. Finally, the re vision to the statute required the state tax administrator to \"make available to the General Assembly a plan to improve Rhode Island's tax expenditure reporting effo rt\" by the second Tuesday in January 2004. On June 30, 2006, Rhode Island General Law Chapter 44-48.1 was amended to shift the responsibility for the delivery of the tax expenditure report from \"the state tax administrator, to the extent possible within the appropriations provided for the purpose\" to the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis without regard to appropriations provided for that purpose. In addition, this am endment required the Chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis to \"make available to the General Assembly a plan to improve Rhode Island's tax e xpenditure reporting effort\" by the second Tuesday in January 2004. This latter amendment could not be fulfilled given that the Office of Revenue Analysis wa s not created until June 2006. IV. Interpreting the Report The Index of Reliability Rhode Island General Law \u00a7 44-48.1-(c)2 requires the state tax administrator to \"develop an index of the reliability\" of each estimate of foregone revenue from a given tax expenditure. By statute, the index of reliability is based on a scale of one to five with \"one being most reliable\". The statute further goes on to specify that estimates of foregone revenue that are de rived from actual tax returns \"be assigned reliability level one\" while those estimate s of foregone revenue for which no reliable data exists are to \"be assigned reliability level five\". A perusal of previously published tax expenditures repo rts indicates that no index of reliability has been developed beyond that which is specified in statute. The 2010 Tax Expenditures Report was the first such report to provide such an index.. The 2012 Tax Expenditures Report uses the reliability index that was developed in the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report . The index of reliab ility is shown below: Index of Reliability Interpretation Level One (1) Estimate is from actual Rhode Island tax return data Level Two (2) Estimate is extrapolated from Rhode Island source data Level Three (3) Estimate is from Rhode Island tax simulation model Level Four (4) Estimate is federal/na tional data scaled to Rhode Island Level Five (5) No reliable data exists from which to derive an estimate The end points of the Index of Reliabil ity (i.e., Level One and Level Five) are consistent with their statutory mandates. An estimate of foregone revenue for a tax expenditure item that is assigned an Index of Reliability Level One will be based on actual Rhode Island tax return data from th e calendar year immediately preceding the tax expenditure cutoff date (which is Janua ry 1 of the odd numbered year preceding the report's publication). Give n the fact that an Index of Reliability Level Five indicates that \"no reliable data exists from which to derive an estimate\", tax expenditure items assigned this level will not have an estimate of foregone revenue presented. Rather, the phrase \"no estimate possi ble\" will be presen ted next to the tax expenditure item. The Index of Reliability Levels Two through Four requires some further explanation. An estimate of foregone revenue with an Index of Reliability Level Two is based on data that can be directly s ourced to Rhode Island or an update of a previously derived estimate of the tax expenditure item. So me examples of data that can be directly sourced to Rhode Island include data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. In addition, st ate government agencies, quasi-public agencies, and non- 9governmental organizations are able to pr ovide reliable Rhode Island specific data from which to estimate the foregone revenue of a tax expenditure item. In the case of updating a previously derived estimate the orig inal estimate may be from a previously published tax expenditures repor t, a fiscal note that was completed for a particular piece of legislation during a session of the General Assembly, or an estimate that was derived by the Budget Office, the Division of Taxation, the Office of Revenue Analysis or some other state agency fo r a purpose other than that of the tax expenditures report. When an Index of Reliability Level Two is assigned to the foregone revenue estimate of a tax expenditu re item, the source of the Rhode Island data will be specified. An estimate of foregone revenue for a ta x expenditure item with an Index of Reliability Level Three is derived from a micro simulation model of a particular tax that has been developed and provided by a th ird party vendor. In some cases such a micro simulation model will generate estimates based on underlying Rhode Island economic data rather than actual tax data. The most obvious example of this type of micro simulation model is the Rhode Island Micro Sales Tax Model that was purchased by the General Assembly in 2008 and made available to the Office of Revenue Analysis for the purpose of estimating the revenue impacts from changing sales tax rates, sales tax exemptions, and/or the sales tax base. This model is used extensively to estimate the foregone revenue from the numerous tr ansactions that are exempt from the State's sales and use tax. Finally, an estimate of foregone revenue for a tax expenditure item with an Index of Reliability Level Four is based on federa l / national data that is scaled to Rhode Island. Alternatively, the estima te may be based on federal da ta that is then adjusted by a factor that allows for the extrapolation of the fede ral data to Rhode Island. When an Index of Reliability Level Four is assigned to the foregone revenue estimate of a tax expenditure item, the date on whic h the original estimate was derived will be stated if it is known as will the method used to update the original estimate. In the case of an estimate that is based on federal data that is scaled to Rhode Island, the base federal data will be identified as will the scaling factor. Structure of the Report Prior to the issuance of the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report , tax expenditures reports presented tax expenditure items by tax type. In other words, the primary organizing key was tax type with tax expenditure items appearing under each tax type. For example, in the Tax Expenditures Report, January 2008 , thirty-eight tax expenditure items are listed under the h eading \"Personal Income\" and these tax expenditure items are comprised of modifications, credits, exclusions, adjustments, deductions and preferential tax rates. 3 In addition, when it comes to tax expenditure items, it is often the case that what is available for one tax type will also be made 3 State of Rhode Island, Department of Revenue, Division of Taxation, Tax Expenditures Report, January 2008 , p. 3. This report was prepared by Cecilia C. Vallee, Revenue Analyst at the request of David M. Sullivan, Rhode Island Tax Administrator. 10available for other tax types. For exampl e, the Motion Picture Production Tax Credit allows for a credit of 25.0 percent \"of th e state certified production costs incurred directly attributable to activity within the state provided that the primary locations are within the state of Rhode Island and the to tal production budget as defined herein is a minimum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000).\"4 This credit, which can be transferred or sold, can be used against the \"tax impos ed\" under the state's business corporation tax, financial in stitutions tax, insurance companies gross premiums tax, and the personal income tax. As a result of this type of tax expenditure, tax expenditures reports issued prior to the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report had to include a category labeled \"Tax Preference Item s Applicable to More Than One Tax\"5 in order to consistently cate gorize tax expenditure items. In the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report , the Office of Revenue Analysis adopted a different presentation format. Rather than list the tax expenditure items by the tax type to which they apply, the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report used the category of tax expenditure item as the organizing key. Th at is, each category of tax expenditure item listed each individual tax expenditure item and the tax types to which the individual tax expenditure it em applies. For example, the Motion Picture Production Tax Credit would be categorized under \"Cre dits\" with the busine ss corporation tax, financial institutions tax, insurance companies gross premiums tax, and the personal income tax as the relevant tax types. The 2012 Tax Expenditures Report follows the same approach as was adopted for the 2010 Tax Expenditures Report . To assist readers in the use of the 2012 Tax Expenditures Report , two sets of summary tables are included. The first set of summary tables lists the value of tax expenditures by tax expenditure item. Thus , for example, under the tax expenditure item \"Credits\" the total value of each indivi dual credit without regard to the tax type under which it was used will be shown. The second set of summary tables lists the value of tax expenditures by tax type. Thus, for example, under the tax type \"Personal Income\" the total value of each individual tax expenditure item that is used under the personal income tax will be displayed. Definition of Terms The following definitions will be used when referring to the diffe rent types of tax expenditure items included in this report. Credit : The direct dollar-for-dollar reduction of an individual's tax liability . The value of a tax credit is invariant to a taxpayer's tax bracket. Deduction : An amount subtracted from adjusted gross income when calculating taxable income. The value of a tax deduction is proportional to a taxpayer's tax bracket. Exclusion : An amount or proportion that can be legally excluded from the taxable base prior to the assessment of tax. 4 See Rhode Island General Law subsection 44-31.2-5(a). 5 See Tax Expenditures Report, January 2008 , p. 144. 11 12Exemption : A taxable expenditure , income, or investment on which no tax is levied. A tax exemption may be of limited or permanent duration. Modification : An amount added to or subtracted from gross income to arrive at adjusted gross income. Usually, adjusted gross income is the basis from which taxable income is derived. Preferential Tax Rate : A tax rate made available to certain taxpayer's that is less than the statutory tax rate. Typically, the preferential tax rate is made available to a taxpayer that meets specified criteria. Tax Abatement : Rebate given in levies or taxes under special circumstan ces or as an offset to the performance of particular actions. Tax Deferral : Paying taxes in the future for income earned in the current year, such as through an Individual Retirement A ccount (IRA), 401(k), Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA or Keogh plan . Categorization of Tax Expenditure Items The tables on the following pages show the categorization of tax expenditure items by type and to which taxes the tax expenditure items apply. The individual tax expenditure items are listed alphabetically and those tax expenditure items that originate in the federal Internal Revenue C ode are so indicated.

Any excess of allowable deductions over the gross income in the same year or the amount of such excess apportioned to Connecticut under Conn ecticut General Statute Section 12-218 is an operating loss and is deductible as an operating loss carry-over for operating losses incurred in income years commencing on or after January 1, 2000, in each of the 20 income years following the loss year. Losses may not be carried back. Connecticut Statute: Title 12, Chapter 208, Section12-217(a)(4). Massachusetts : Corporations are allowed a deduction for net operating losses computed under Massachusetts' law. The Massachusetts ne t operating loss is the amount by which the sum of the deductions allowed to arrive at net income, excluding the deductions for net operating loss and the dividends-received deduction exceeds gross income for the taxable year.

Rev. Stat. Ann. 36 Section 5200-A(1)(H), and that, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 172 , was carried back for federal income tax purposes, less the absolute value of loss used in the taxable year of loss to offset any addition modification required by Me. Rev. Stat.

A net operating loss is apportioned in the year incurred according to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. Section 77-A: 3. The law does not allow for the carry-back of losses in any instance. New Hampshire uses 26 U.S.C. Section 172 that was in effect on December 31, 1996 except for the requirement to carry back the loss and the limitation to carry forward for 10 years following the loss year. The net operating loss must be apportioned in the year the loss is incurred and is also a deduction befo re apportionment in the year deducted. 155New Hampshire Statute: Title V, Chapter 77-A, Section 77A: 4, XIII. Vermont : Effective for tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, Vermont enacted a \"stand-alone\" net operating loss deduc tion, in place of the federal net operating loss deduction, by defining \"Vermont ne t operating loss\" (VNOL) as any negative income after allocation and apportionmen t of Vermont net income.

Data Source : Estate Tax Section, Division of Taxa tion. Data is from tax year 2008 estate tax returns when the net taxable estate ex clusion amount was $675,000. Estimates of foregone revenue relate to the increased net taxable estate exclusion amount relative to the $675,000 amount in effect in tax year 2008. The tax year 2009 net taxable estate exclusion amount was also $675,000 so there is no impact from the law on those collections. The growth in estate tax collec tions between tax year 2008 and tax year 2009 and tax year 2009 and tax year 2010 was app lied sequentially to the estimated revenue lost based on tax year 2008 returns using the higher net taxable estate exclusion amount of $850,000.

Bonus Depreciation Provided by JCWAA of 2002 and JGTRRA of 2003 : Statutory Reference : Rhode Island General Law Section 44-61-1 Stated Purpose : No stated purpose given in law. Year Enacted / Year Amended : 2002 / 2008 Description : For purposes of depreciating asset s under Rhode Island General Law Chapters 44-11, 44-14, and 44-30, the bonus depreciation provided under the federal Job Creation and Workers Assistance Act (JCW AA) of 2002 and the federal Jobs Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) of 2003 or any subsequent enactment for federal tax purposes is not allowed for Rhode Is land tax purposes. In the year that those assets are placed in service and in all subse quent years, depreciation for Rhode Island tax purposes shall be allowed on those assets as it would have been computed prior to the enactment of the JCWAA of 2002. The JCWAA of 2002 allowed a special 30.0 percent bonus depreciation deduction in the first year for qualifying property purch ased after September 10, 2001 and before September 11, 2004, for purposes of computi ng federal net income. In addition, the JCWAA of 2002 modified Internal Revenue Code Section 168(k) to allow taxpayers to claim an additional first-year bonus depreciation allowance on any new Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System property when the recovery period is 20 years or less. The additional depreciation allowance is equal to 30.0 percent of the adjusted cost basis of the property after any Internal Revenue Code Section 179 expense deductions are taken. The JGTRRA of 2003 increased th e bonus depreciation deduction from 30 percent to 50 percent for assets purchased after May 5, 2003, but before January 1, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 extended some bonus depreciation rules for certain aircraft as well as other items. The Econom ic Stimulus Act of 2008 reintroduced bonus depreciation of 50.0 percent fo r qualifying investments that were placed in service in 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvest ment Act of 2009 extended the 50.0 percent bonus depreciation for qualifying investments to those that were placed in service in 2009. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased the bonus depreciation for qualified property from 50.0 percent to 100.0 percent for property acquired and placed in service after September 8, 2010 and before Ja nuary 1, 2012. Qualified property acquired on or before September 8, 2010 is eligible for 50.0 percent bonus depreciation provided that it is placed in service prior to January 1, 2013. Rhode Island's disallowance of bonus depreciation is a timing issue. In the year that an asset is put in service and is eligible for the federal bonus depreciation, a Rhode Island taxpayer must take as a modification increasing federal adjusted gross income (AGI) the difference in the bonus depreciation amount a llowed on the federal tax return and the depreciation amount allowed fo r Rhode Island tax purposes. In subsequent years, a Rhode Island taxpayer may take as a modification decreasing federal AGI the difference in the depreciation amount allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes and the depreciation amount allowed on the federal tax return. At th e end of the asset's \"useful\" life, the same amount of depreciation will be realized by the taxpayer on both the federal and the Rhode Island tax returns. Thus, over the life of the asset, there is no net impact on Rhode Island tax collections. 314Data Source : Personal Income Tax: Residents: TY 2009 Statistics of Personal Income, Rhode Island Division of Taxation. Non-resi dents: TY 2009 Data Warehouse, Office of Revenue Analysis calculations. The modification includes both modifications increasing and modifications decreasing Federal Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). Net resident modifications totaled $15,713,063 and ne t non-resident modifications totaled $26,789,600. The total net modifications for r esident and non-resident taxpayers resulted in net modifications that increased AGI for Tax Year 2009. Therefore, there is no revenue foregone from this modification. The number of taxpayers includes those taxpayers that had a net modi fication that either increased AGI or decreased AGI. Business corporations tax: Statistics of Corporate Income, Rhode Island Division of Taxation. The modification includes both bon us depreciation and enhanced Section 179 expensing for C-corporations only and the amounts are not necessarily specific to Rhode Island based activity.. Total modifications decreasing federal taxable income were $12,421,017,384 while total modifications increasing federal taxable income were $36,781,388,957. The total net modification results in increased federal taxable income for TY 2009 and therefore there is no reve nue foregone from this modification. The number of taxpayers is the total number of taxpayers that had a modification increasing or a modification decreasing federal taxabl e income and can include an individual taxpayer in each category provided that the taxpayer simultaneously had a modification decreasing and a modification increasing federal taxable income.

Maine's personal income tax mandates that [T ]he federal adjusted gross income of the taxpayer...be decreased by: [A] fraction of any amount previously added back by the taxpayer to federal adjusted gross income...(1) [W]ith respect to property first placed in service during taxable years beginning in 2002, the adjustment under this paragraph is available for each year during the recovery period, beginning 2 years after the beginning of the taxable year during wh ich the property was first placed in service.

(2) [W]ith respect to all other property, for the taxable year immediately following the taxable year during which the property was first placed in service, the fraction allowed by this paragraph is equal to 5.0 percent of the amount added back previously with resp ect to the property. For each subsequent taxable year during the recovery period, th e fraction is equal to 95.0 percent of the amount added back previously with respect to the property, divided by the number of years in the recovery period minus 2; and (3) [F]or taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, an amount equal to th e net increase in the depreciation deductions allowable under Sections 167 and 168 of the IRC that would have been applicable to that property had the depreciation deduction under I RC, Section 168(k) not been claimed with respect to such property placed in service on or after January 1, 2008 for which an addition was required in a prior year. Maine's tax on corporations contains identical provisions with respect to federal bonus depreciation except that the provisions relate to taxable income rather than federal adjusted gross income.

New Hampshire : New Hampshire defines the term \"United States Internal Revenue Code\" to mean \"[F]or all tax years beginning after January 1, 2000, the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in effect on December 31, 2000.\" Thus, by definition amendments to the Internal Revenue Code th at occurred after December 31, 2000 are not allowable under New Hampshire's business prof its tax and business taxpayers have to adjust the taxable income reported on their federal return before reporting their gross business profits on their New Hampshire business tax return. The adjustment will require: (1) The removal of the federal bonus de preciation in effect for the taxable year; and (2) the inclusion of only the depreciation allowed under the IRC in effect on December 31, 2000.

Expensing of Assets in Lieu of Depreci ation, Section 179 of Internal Revenue Code : Statutory Reference : Rhode Island General Law Section 44-61-1.1 Stated Purpose : No stated purpose given in law. Year Enacted / Year Amended : 2003 / 2008 Description : For purposes of the expensing of assets under Rhode Is land General Law Chapters 44-11, 44-14, and 44-30, the expense deduction shall not exceed $25,000 in any taxable year. The additional expensing of assets under Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code provided by the federal J obs Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) of 2003 or any subsequent enactment for federal tax purposes is not allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes. In the year th at those assets are placed in service and in all subsequent years, expenses and deprecia tion for Rhode Island tax purposes shall be allowed on those assets as it would have been computed prior to the enactment of the JGTRRA of 2003. The expense deduction lim itation of $25,000 applies to tax years beginning January 1, 2007 and thereafter. Prior to the JGTRRA of 2003, businesses c ould expense up to $25,000 under Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code. The amount that could be expensed was reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount by which the cost of qualifying property exceeded $200,000. Therefore, capital investments over $225,000 did not qualify. The JGTRRA 325of 2003 increased the maximum amount of e xpensing to $100,000 and the phase-out to $400,000, allowing purchases of qualifying property up to $500,000 in cost to qualify. These limits were indexed for inflation fo r tax years beginning after 2003. JGTRRA applied to tax years 2003 through 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 extended the JGTRRA of 2003's provisions to tax years 2006 and 2007 and added off- the-shelf computer software to the list of qualifying property. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 ex tended the increased expensing for small businesses under JGTRRA to tax years 2008 and 2009. The Economic Stimulus Act (ESA) of 2008 increased the maximum amount of expensing to $250,000 and the phase- out amount to $800,000 for 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 extended the provisions of the ESA of 2008 to 2009. The Small Business Jobs Act (SBJA) of 2010 increased the section 179 limitations on expensing of depreciable business assets for tax years begi nning in 2010 and 2011 to $500,000 per item and $2.0 million overall. In addition, the SBJA of 2010 temporarily expanded the types of property that qualified for Section 179 expensing to include certain qualified real property. Rhode Island's disallowance of the increased expense deduction u nder Section 179 is a timing issue. In the year that an asset is pl aced in service and is eligible for the federal increased expense deduction, a Rhode Island taxpayer must take as a modification increasing federal adjusted gross income (AGI) the difference in the increased expense deduction amount allowed on the federal tax return and the expense deduction amount allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes which is a maximum of $25,000. In subsequent years, a Rhode Island taxpayer may take as a modification decreasing federal AGI the expense deduction amount that was disallowe d for Rhode Island tax purposes but allowed for federal tax purposes and the expense de duction amount allowed for Rhode Island tax purposes up to a maximum of $25,000. This modification reducing fe deral AGI is taken until the expense deduction amount that was disallowed for Rhode Island tax purposes but allowed for federal tax purposes has been completely utilized. Thus, there is no net impact on Rhode Island tax collections after the asset has been co mpletely expensed.

The modification includes both modifications increasing and modifications decreasing Federal Adjusted Gross Income (A GI). Net resident modifications totaled $24,534,020 and net non-resident modificati ons totaled $7,843,523. The total net modifications for resident and non-resident ta xpayers resulted in a net modification that increased AGI for Tax Year 2009. Therefore, there is no revenue foregone from this modification. The number of taxpayers includes those taxpayers that had a net modification that either increased AGI or decreased AGI. Business corporations tax: Statistics of Corporate Income, Rhode Island Division of Taxation. The modification includes both bon us depreciation and enhanced Section 179 expensing for C-corporations only and the amounts are not necessarily specific to Rhode Island based activity.. Total modifications decreasing federal taxable income were $12,421,017,384 while total modifications increasing federal taxable income were $36,781,388,957. The total net modification results in increased federal taxable income for TY 2009 and therefore there is no reve nue foregone from this modification. The number of taxpayers is the total number of taxpayers that had a modification increasing or a modification decreasing federal taxabl e income and can include an individual 326taxpayer in each category provided that the taxpayer simultaneously had a modification decreasing and a modification increasing federal taxable income.

New Hampshire : New Hampshire defines the term \"United States Internal Revenue Code\" to mean \"[F]or all tax years beginning after January 1, 2000, the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in effect on December 31, 2000.\" Thus, by definition amendments to the Internal Revenue Code th at occurred after December 31, 2000 are not allowable under New Hampshire's business prof its tax and business taxpayers have to adjust the taxable income reported on their federal return before reporting their gross business profits on their New Hampshire business tax return. The adjustment will require: (1) The removal of the Section 179 e xpense allowed under the IRC in effect for the taxable year; and (2) the inclusion of only the Section 179 expense allowed under the IRC in effect on December 31, 2000.

Foreign Sales Corporations (FSC) : Statutory Reference : Rhode Island General La w subsection 44-11-11(d) Stated Purpose : No stated purpose given in law. Year Enacted / Year Amended : 1985 / N/A Description : A corporation which qualifies as a Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) under federal income tax law and has in effect for the entire tax year a valid election under federal law to be treated as a FSC shall not pay the amount of the tax computed under Rhode Island General Law 44-11-2(a). Any in come to shareholders of Foreign Sales Corporations is to be treated in the same manner as it is treated under federal income tax law as it exists on January 1, 1985.\" This tax preference item allows an eligible co rporation which has elected to be treated for federal purposes as a foreign sales corporation to be exempted from the business corporation tax calculated by 44-11-2(a) to the same extent the corporation would be exempted if it were an electing small business corporation. It should be noted that federal tax law provisions for Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs) were enacted in the Tax Reform Act (TRA) of 1984 and codified in sections 921 through 927 of the Internal Revenue Code. In early 2000, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that FSCs constituted an illegal trading subsidy. In response, the United States passed The Extra-Territorial Income Excl usion Act (ETIEA) of 2000 to replace the federal laws governing FSCs. In 2004, th e ETIEA was also ruled an illegal trading subsidy by the WTO. In 2004, President George W. Bush signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 which repealed the federal laws that governed FSCs and the exclusion of extra-territorial income. Data Source : Due to the repeal of the federal laws governing Foreigns Sales Corporations and the favorable tax treatment of extra-territorial income in 2004, it is assumed that no such entities would qualify for the tax expenditure provided under Rhode Island General Law subsection 44-11-11(d).

IX. Recommendations for Improving the Report The tax expenditures report's effectiveness as a tax policy tool is dependent on the report's users' background, knowledge of state tax law and ability to understand the process by which estimates have been de rived by the Office of Revenue Analysis. Although 37.5 percent of the tax expenditure items for which reliable data existed were assigned a reliability level index of \"1\", meaning the source of the derived estimate was actual tax return s, ideally 100.0 percent of th e derived estimates for tax expenditure items for which reliable data ex ists should have as a source actual tax returns. The primary tax type for which actual tax return data does not exist and thus estimates of foregone revenue must be deri ved via less reliable methods is the Sales and Use Tax. Given that the Sales and Use Tax is the second larg est source of state general revenue and that it also is the ta x type for which the greatest amount of foregone revenue was estimated at $1,032,449,500, the Office of Revenue Analysis finds that the quality and quant ity of data collected for the Sales and Use Tax needs to be improved for there to be an increase in the reliability of the foregone revenue estimates for the Sales and Use tax. The Division of Taxation is currently changing the tax return reconciliation process for Sa les and Use Tax filers requiring that more information on exempt sales be provided on th e return with the frequency of reporting being reduced from quarterly to twice a year. Sales and Use taxpayers who are currently required to file th eir monthly returns electronica lly would also be required to file their twice a year reconciliations electronically. In addition, the quantity and qua lity of data for the Busi ness Corporations Tax is lacking. The Business Corporations Ta x, commonly referred to as the corporate income tax, is the tax type with the third largest amount of estimated foregone revenue due to tax expenditure items at $83,764,786 but has the larg est percentage of tax expenditures items at 57.4 percent for wh ich no reliable data exists from which to derive estimates of foregone revenue. This compares to 6.8 percent of tax expenditure items for which no reliable data exists for the Personal Income Tax and 34.5 percent of tax expenditure items for whic h no reliable data exists for the Sales and Use Tax. The Office of Revenue Analysis finds that the qual ity and quantity of data collected for the Business Corporations Tax needs to be improved for there to be an increase in the reliability of the foregone revenue estimates for the Business Corporations Tax. Fortunately, most of th e data that would improve the reporting of Business Corporations tax e xpenditure items is already reported on the taxpayers' tax returns and the crux of the issue in this regard is capturing the relevant data from these returns. The Division of Taxation is in the process of requiring most Business Corporations taxpayers to file their tax re turns electronically allowing for the capture of more data. In the FY 2013 Capital Budget, the Gene ral Assembly approved the Division of Taxation's request for $25.0 million to be dis bursed over a five year period to finance 395the development of an integrated tax system. A fully implemented integrated tax system would provide the Division of Taxa tion with the capability to capture more relevant data from both electronically filed and paper based returns. Of particular importance is the ability to store and access taxpayer returns over a series of years. This capability will allow the Office of Re venue Analysis to derive more precise estimates of foregone revenue from tax expenditure items for the Sales and Use and Business Corporations taxes. Given the approval of th e Division of Taxation's request for an integrated tax system, the Offi ce of Revenue Analysis anticipates that it will have access to better data and that th is access should improve the quality of the semi-annual tax expenditures re port on a going-forward basis. 396Appendix A: Current Statute on Tax Expenditure Reporting TITLE 44 Taxation CHAPTER 44-48.1 Tax Expenditure Reporting SECTION 44-48.1-1 \u00a7 44-48.1-1 Tax expenditure reporting. - (a) On or before the second Tuesday in January of each even numbered year beginni ng in 2004, the chief of the office of revenue analysis, shall deliver a tax expenditure report to the general assembly.
