In addition to being a safe and natural system of medicine, homeopathy also stimulates a person's own healing powers without posing the risk of interactions with conventional drugs. Dr. Ron Shemesh of MindBodySpirit Care in Tampa, Florida is board certified by the American Board of Holistic Medicine. He is committed to helping patients across the Tampa, Florida area restore their health using homeopathy. The Principles and History of Homeopathy Homeopathy was developed in the late 18th century by Samuel Christian Hahnemann, a German physician who had become frustrated and disillusioned by the mainstream medicine of his day. It is founded on the principle of \"like cures like.\" In other words, a medicine can cure a sick person if it can cause a similar sickness in a healthy person. Homeopathy views symptoms not as problems, but as the body's attempt to bring itself back into balance. Rather than opposing or suppressing the symptoms, homeopathy supports the symptoms and helps the body return to health. This is why Allium cepa (red onion) can be used to treat runny nose, watery eyes, and sneezing caused by a cold or allergy attack; peeling a red onion causes those same symptoms. Homeopathic Remedies The medicines used in homeopathy are known as remedies, and they are made from natural sources like plants and minerals. When used as directed by a professional like Dr. Shemesh, they are safe for everyone, even pregnant women, nursing mothers, infants, and children! The same can't be said of conventional medications, which cause a variety of unpleasant and dangerous side effects. Dr. Shemesh supports homeopathic medicine because it is safe, effective, and addresses the root causes of health problems in order to permanently heal the body. This is dramatically different than simply masking symptoms like many modern medicines do. Homeopathy In Tampa, Florida Since homeopathy treatments must be individualized to your specific symptoms, history, body, and needs, your treatment for a health condition could be very different from another patient coping with the same exact condition. You should always seek the guidance of a board certified holistic doctor like Dr. SHemesh to take advantage of this therapeutic system. Whether you are coping with arthritis, asthma, depression, migraines, or any other acute or chronic condition, Dr. Shemesh at MindBodySpirit Care can help you regain your health using the powers of homeopathic medicine.
