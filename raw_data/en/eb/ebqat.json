While metabolism isn't everything, it certainly impacts your health, especially as you age. The good news is you can implement habits that'll support your metabolic function, now and in the future. Moving plenty every day, training to improve muscle mass, and getting deep sleep are all ways to optimize your metabolism. The MetaPWR system helps you live your most powerful life, supporting your metabolism, energy, and health on a cellular level.* Each product offers a specialty, while also supporting and enhancing the benefits of the other products in the system. The foundation of the system is MetaPWR Metabolic Blend, which features proprietary balanced ratios of CPTG Certified Pure Tested Grade\u00ae Grapefruit, Lemon, Peppermint, Ginger, and Cinnamon Bark essential oils. According to an unpublished preclinical study, this essential oil blend may help reduce adipose fat cells when ingested, but more confirming research is needed.* It can also help curb cravings and support healthy metabolic function when ingested.* The MetaPWR system also includes MetaPWR Assist, which helps with blood glucose regulation within the normal range, and MetaPWR Advantage, which tackles metabolism from the perspective of aging.* All the products together are far more effective than just the essential oil blend by itself. The MetaPWR system combines cutting-edge essential oil science and metabolic research to maximize your metabolic health like never before.* Each product in the system contributes something\u2014appetite, normal-range blood glucose management, metabolic energy\u2014and they fit together seamlessly.* The holiday season makes it notoriously difficult to stick to your health goals. Treats galore at parties can quickly derail the best of intentions. Here are three tips that can help you handle the holidays. 1. Avoid an all-or-nothing mentality. For some people, all-or-nothing goals during the holidays lead to misery (or completely missing goals). Depending on your situation, consider adjusting your goals so you're still making moderate progress or choose goals that'll help you maintain the progress you've already made\u2014you can always kick the heat up again in a month. What you want to avoid is losing the progress you've made. For some people, slipping up on unrealistic holiday goals causes them so much frustration and disappointment that they simply throw in the towel. Make goals you can keep\u2014that won't disrupt what you've accomplished so far\u2014while still giving you room to enjoy the season. 2 .Find a buddy. Sometimes it's easier to stick to something when you have a buddy taking the journey with you! Maybe this person is a spouse, another family member, or a good friend\u2014ask around and see if someone wants to be conscious about health goals this holiday season with you. Knowing you aren't doing something alone can go a long way. 3. Use MetaPWR Metabolic Blend to kick cravings to the curb! Taking MetaPWR Metabolic Blend internally can help curb cravings, which makes skipping junk snacks and sugary indulgences much easier.* When cravings come calling, chew MetaPWR Satiety Gum or take a MetaPWR Beadlet or two.* You may find it even more helpful to get in front of the cravings, keeping them from nagging you in the first place. Add a drop or two of MetaPWR Metabolic Blend to your water to drink throughout the day.* You can also take MetaPWR Softgels to help you meet your health goals. The bottom line is you don't have to feel like you're fighting cravings all by yourself. You can reduce and manage them better with a little help from nutrition and MetaPWR.* One of the simple, beautiful things about health is when you improve any aspect of your health or wellness, it benefits other areas as well. Perhaps one of the best examples of this is nutrition. Nutrition is the foundation of all health. When proper nutrition is in place, every other aspect of wellness functions more effectively. This is why the doTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae is at the core of our products. It ensures you have the essential nutrients you need to truly thrive and live a life full of vitality. If you want to transform your metabolism, or if you're trying to maintain the good health you've worked to achieve, nutrition must be part of the equation. You won't get the results you're looking for if you don't have proper nutrition in place. Obviously, proper nutrition starts with eating healthy, balanced meals, but smart, high-quality supplementation ensures nothing gets missed. By taking the LLV every day, you can be confident you're filling any gaps in your nutrition and building a thriving foundation. Over seven million doTERRA Lifelong Vitality Packs have been sold to date. LLV is comprised of three supplements, which are designed to be taken together: Microplex VMz\u00ae, xEO Mega\u00ae, and Alpha CRS+\u00ae. Together, these supplements provide essential nutrients, metabolism benefits, and powerful antioxidants that promote energy, health, and lifelong vitality.* Alpha means first, CRS is an acronym for cellular renewal system, and the plus sign was added to emphasize improvements made to the original product. Alpha CRS+ is formulated to help prolong the longevity or lifespan of cells with polyphenols.* Polyphenols are a powerful group of antioxidants known to protect cells against free radical damage. Free radicals can potentially damage cellular DNA, mitochondria (the molecules that produce chemical energy), and other important cell structures, but consuming antioxidants like polyphenols can help protect cells and their structures.* Using a proprietary blend of natural extracts and ingredients, Alpha CRS+ can combat the effects of aging on cellular health and energy and vitality levels.* Some key ingredients include: The Alpha CRS+ formula is placed in sodium lauryl sulfate-free vegetable capsules. The x stands for astaxanthin (a standardized extract of microalgae), EO stands for essential oil, and Mega represents the omega benefits provided by this complex. xEO Mega contains a propriety blend of CPTG\u00ae essential oils, marine- and land-sourced omega fatty acids, and plant-based ingredients, which work together to provide the body with several important benefits: Main ingredients include: For those who don't wish to consume fish or marine-based products because of diet restrictions or personal preferences, you can take vEO Mega\u00ae instead. Alpha CRS+ and Microplex VMz are already considered vegetarian-friendly, but the marine omega blend in xEO Mega means it can't be labeled as vegan. Instead of using a blend of fish oils, the vEO Mega formula uses plant and algae-based sources to provide a unique blend of essential fatty acids. Microplex combines the words micronutrient and complex, VM stands for vitamins and minerals, and the z represents improvements made to the original product. Along with antioxidants and essential fatty acids, your body needs essential vitamins and minerals to keep its systems functioning properly.* Essential vitamins and minerals can't be produced in sufficient quantities by the body, so we must rely on diet to provide the proper amount of nutrients. Unfortunately, most modern diets lack a variety of vitamins and minerals, often resulting in nutritional deficiencies. Presented in a food-nutrient complex, Microplex VMz provides a variety of vitamins and minerals that help with the growth, function, and cell maintenance.* The supplement formula provides a blend of antioxidant and energy complex vitamins, as well as minerals that are beneficial for metabolism and bone health.* Sometimes vitamins and minerals in supplements can be difficult for your body to recognize or absorb, so Microplex VMz uses a special patented glycoprotein matrix to assist with bioavailability. Bioavailability refers your body's ability to recognize and absorb the vitamins, minerals, and food nutrients. Plus, the formula also contains a blend of enzymes and mineral cofactors to enhance digestion and the assimilation of nutrients.* Key ingredients include: The doTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack comes with a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, so there's every reason to try it for yourself! Now's the time to experience the LLV difference. Put even more power in your daily life by using LLV and the MetaPWR system together. These two systems can provide amazing results in your life. Optimize your metabolism, start achieving your personal wellness goals, and live your most powerful life. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
