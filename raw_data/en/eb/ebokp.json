Equilibrium is a lot more complex than most people are aware. It requires input from our inner ears, our vision, and our somatosensory perception (our contact with the ground perceived with our feet, muscles, and joints). When all parts are working together, our central nervous system receives the correct signals to maintain our center of gravity. However, if one or more parts of this system don't cooperate, a loss of balance can occur. Vertigo, dizziness, or imbalance will affect 70% of Utahns at some point in their lives. Since many balance and vertigo problems originate in the inner ear, seeking the expertise of an audiologist is recommended. Ogden Clinic audiologists are trained to identify different types of inner ear disorders such as: - Meniere's disease - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) - Endolymphatic hydrops - Perilyph fistulas - Ear infections that affect balance and coordination The symptoms of these disorders may be indistinguishable to the patient, but can be effectively diagnosed by your Ogden Clinic audiologist. Acute and Chronic Balance Disorders Problems with equilibrium generally fall into two categories: - Acute: A motion intolerance, dizziness, or event of vertigo that occur in sharp attacks. These episodes usually last a few seconds to several hours. - Chronic: A persistent sense of imbalance that some may refer to as a loss of 'sure-footedness. Diagnosis and treatment for both of these have become very effective in the last 10 years; your treatment begins with a visit to our audiology office. Call Ogden Clinic's Professional Center today to schedule an appointment. Canalith Repositioning Treatment For those who experience brief but intense dizziness when they move their head, the canalith repositioning method is an effective treatment option. Ogden Clinic's audiologists perform this hands-on technique by repositioning the head to remove displaced otoconia (small crystals of calcium carbonate). By repositioning the head and trunk, the otoconia shift from the canal to the utricle of the ear where they dissolve, break up, or re-adhere to the otolithic membrane where they no longer cause dizziness.
