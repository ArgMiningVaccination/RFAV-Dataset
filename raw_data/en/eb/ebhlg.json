Our family has lots of love for you, and it's not just that you smell so good\u2014it's Organic Month too! Our passion for organic has us celebrating all the ways it spells better health for our neighborhoods and the planet; here are just a few. Optimal for the environment, for animals, for farmers, and for you! There's NO dependency on syn- thetic chemicals here, but there IS healthier soil, cleaner water, and more bees and butterflies. Organic means a better life for animals, and better economic opportunities for farm communities. It means LESS pesticide residues in your body and NO artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives in your food. It's a better way to eat! Regenerative, because we can't wait any longer to turn this thing around\u2014we're headed for a planetary breakdown! Organic practices regenerate soil health, supporting its ability to hold water, helping to prevent soil erosion and desertification, and restoring its ability to sequester CO2, providing us with a powerful tool to reverse climate change. Organic farms can also restore biodiversity\u2014from microorgan- isms and plants to birds and bees. Renewal, not removal, is the organic way. GMOs are not allowed. You don't have to think twice\u2014GMOs are never allowed in products labeled or- ganic. They are not allowed in seeds in organic fields nor in feeds at organic dairies. They are not allowed in the pastures on organic ranches nor in the ingredients of organic packaged foods. Organic standards guarantee that it's naturally non-GMO! Accountability means it's a label you can trust, because organic integrity is verified every step of the way. No other label covers as much, making sure your family gets only the best. From seed to final product, from farmland, to harvest, to post-harvest, to manufacturing plants, to packaging materials, organic food is held to stringent standards and inspected by USDA- accredited agencies, so that you can be sure of its authenticity, and that you are getting a product made without concerning or problematic ingredients. Nutrient dense is the organic way. From the soil it grows in, to the fruits and veggies, milk and meat that you bring home, organic has more! Studies show higher levels of antioxidants in organic produce and more omega-3's and CLA (a healthy fat!) in beef and dairy. Plus, our taste buds confirm that it's more delicious. Integrative, because it's about harmonizing with nature, not mono-cropping it. Composting, cover crop- ping, and rotational grazing nourish the soil, beneficial insects help control pests, and biodiversity attracts pollinators\u2014it's how organic helps all the parts work for the whole. Carbon conscious! Organic farming has a lighter carbon footprint, but a heavier impact on CO2 se- questration. The longer one farms organically, the healthier the soil and the more CO2 it can sequester. The Rodale Institute, which has been putting the science behind organic since 1947, has done statistical modeling that shows we could sequester more than 100% of current CO2 emissions if we converted all global croplands and pasture to regenerative organic agriculture. Let's get conscious about regeneration! Our family is proud to prioritize organic groceries on our shelves, organic meat and dairy in our cold cas- es, and to carry ONLY 100% organic produce in all our stores. We hope that this September finds you sinking your teeth into crisp, organic apples, taking deep breaths of fresh air, and joining us to celebrate better health for our neighborhoods and the planet!LETTERFrom the Iselys RECIPE OF THE MONTH ORGANIC PEAR, PECAN & GOAT CHEESE SALAD4 NUTRITION EDUCATION THE HIDDEN COST OF CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURE6 NUTRITION EDUCATION HEALTH SLEEP SOLUTIONS10 NUTRITION EDUCATION NUTRITION BYTES 32 This periodical is intended to present information we feel is valuable to our customers.

Just be sure to make it organic. September is Organic Harvest Month, a time to celebrate the regenerative impacts of organic farming and to honor it with our food choices. Wandering through an organic orchard, thick with fruit and buzzing with the energy of living creatures, is an experience in harmony. It's a place where food is grown without the use of toxic pesticides, where building soil health and nurturing biodiversity are the way of life.9 Sadly, it isn't so in every orchard. Forty-nine pesticide residues were found on conventional pear samples in a recent analysis, including the reproductive toxin carbendazim and several bee-killing insecticides, landing the fruit on the Environmental Working Group's (EWG) \"Dirty Dozen\" list of most contaminated produce. The EWG also found that pears had more pesticide residue on average than any other tree fruit on the list.10 Choose harmony, choose a better future for our planet, choose organic! Someday we shall look back on this dark era of agriculture and shake our heads. How could we have ever believed it was a good idea to grow our food with poisons?8 -Jane Goodall Natural Grocers | 5 When the Green Revolution began to take off in the middle of the 20th century, it was a promise of abundant food; selective breeding resulted in high-yielding crops and irrigation allowed food to be grown in places where it couldn't before. There was a major shift in the way food was grown\u2014industrial-scale agriculture surpassed small to mid-sized family farms as a means to feed millions of Americans. It has become the dominant food production system, but it is a system that is defi ned by monoculture cropping that relies heavily on synthetic chemical fertilizers and pesticides (a broad term which include insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides). There is an emphasis on growing commodity crops like corn and soy that end up as animal feed and in processed junk food. Industrial animal production has grown alongside industrial agriculture, in which a single species of animal is raised in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) to satisfy our desire for cheap meat. The cheap and abundant food that has proliferated in the U.S. relies on a system of agriculture that is costing us all. Costs that are passed on to taxpayers, farm workers, rural communities, our collective public health, and the environment. Let's take a look at some of the hidden costs of conventional agriculture.

NREM is divided into stages 1-3, from falling asleep to light sleep to \"slow-wave sleep,\" or deep sleep, followed by REM (\"dream\") sleep. Over the course of night, we cycle through these phases multiple times, from NREM to REM sleep, with deep sleep predominating in the early part of thenight and bouts of REM sleep getting longer in the latter part of the night. REM sleep is when our brains process and store relevant events of the day, while deep sleep is when tissues are repaired and built, immunity is strengthened, and metabolic waste (including protein plaques and tangles that are associated with Alzheimer's disease) is cleared from our brains. The last thing someone who chronically struggles with sleep wants to hear is how important those nightly z's are, followed by a laundry list of health problems that can ensue from a lack of sleep. Through the fog of exhaustion, they know. But for someone who faces this nightly battle, the harder they chase sleep, the more elusive it can become. Sleep is something that cannot be forced (anyone who has ever found themselves wide awake in the middle of the night knows this), but there are things that can help support the body's natural circadian rhythm and a normal sleep cycle, including lifestyle habits, certain nutrients, and supplements. 10 | Health Hotline References available upon request. THE STRESS CONNECTION It's no secret that anyone living in the modern world deals with stress, and chronic stress can be a major sleep thief. Sleep is a natural shift from the sympathetic (\"fi ght or fl ight\") to the parasympathetic (\"rest and digest\") nervous system, and if all goes well, levels of the stress hormones cortisol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine drop, while levels of melatonin, the hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, increase. But if you are turned on fi ght or fl ight all the time, with chronically elevated cortisol levels, sleep is going to be challenging, if not impossible. If stress is derailing the sleep train, focus on reducing stress levels fi rst. Exercise, yoga, breathing exercises, walks in nature, and meditation can help reduce stress and support sleep. Adaptogens like tulsi (\"holy basil\") and reishi mushroom can help stabilize cortisol levels and are great for supporting the body during times of stress; they can encourage healthy sleep as well.1 2 Nutrients that provide extra stress support include the B-complex vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium, and the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA. THE FOOD CONNECTION While your diet may not be the fi rst thing that comes to mind when contemplating a good night's sleep, what you eat can have a profound eff ect on how well, or poorly, you sleep. There are the obvious dietary tips, like avoiding caff eine in the latter part of the day, but did you know that a diet full of refi ned carbs, grains, and sugars can seriously jeopardize a healthy sleep cycle? This type of diet leads to blood sugar instability, infl ammation, insulin resistance, and cortisol dysregulation, all of which can lead to poor sleep quality. A diet rich in vegetables, healthy fats, and moderate protein supports healthy blood sugar balance, infl ammation levels, and adrenal health. Additionally, consider regularly consuming foods like tart cherry (including tart cherry juice), walnuts, and kiwi, all of which may support healthy sleep.3 FIND YOUR SLEEP SOLUTION Along with getting your stress levels in check and consuming a healthy, nutrient-dense diet, supplementing to build optimal levels of these specifi c nutrients can support a healthy sleep cycle. Magnesium and B vitamins. One of the eff ects of a magnesium defi ciency is sleep disturbance, including less slow wave, or deep sleep, a decrease in total sleep time, and increased waking during the night. Magnesium plays an important role in regulating the body's stress response system (the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, or HPA axis) as well as supporting the normal production of GABA, a neurotransmitter integral to healthy sleep. Magnesium supplementation has been shown to increase deep sleep and reduce nighttime cortisol levels in older adults, as well as help those suff ering from poor sleep quality due to Restless Leg Syndrome.4 5 6 The B vitamins B12, folate, and B6 are required for the synthesis of neurotransmitters involved in sleep, including melatonin and serotonin7 8 9 and vitamin B6 appears to help cells absorb magnesium more eff ectively.10 11 The RDA for magnesium ranges from 310 to 420 mg daily for adults 18 and older.12 Try this in combination with a high- quality B-complex supplement. Vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with poor sleep quality and quantity, with research indicating that levels less than 20 ng/mL can signifi cantly increase the risk of \"unhealthy sleep.\"13 Vitamin D is known to infl uence the activity of hundreds of genes, and now researchers have discovered that it appears to activate two genes which control our circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm aff ects body temperature and hormone production (including melatonin) and is heavily infl uenced by sunlight. Our bodies also naturally produce vitamin D upon exposure to sunlight, leading the researchers to suggest that vitamin D may play an important role in the \"maintenance of circadian rhythms at the cellular level.\"14 Experts recommend maintaining blood levels of vitamin D at 50 ng/mL to support optimal health.15 L-theanine and GABA. This amino acid found in green tea has a calming, relaxing, and anxiety-reducing eff ect.16 It helps support healthy sleep via several changes in the brain including increasing levels of the calming neurotransmitter GABA, which is intimately involved in sleep, while decreasing levels of excitatory neurotransmitters. It also increases alpha brain waves, present during REM sleep.17 L-theanine has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, within about 30 minutes of taking it. GABA is also available as a supplement, and a study published earlier this year found that a combination of L-theanine and GABA was more eff ective compared to either supplement taken alone. Using an animal model, the researchers discovered that taken together, L-theanine and GABA decreased sleep latency, the time it takes to fall asleep, and prolonged sleep duration, including increasing both REM and NREM sleep, deeper sleep during which the body restores and repairs.18 For sleep support and reducing stress, try 100-400 mg of L-theanine19 and 100-200 mg of GABA.20 A foundation of good health is built on a healthy diet, regular movement, and quality sleep. If one of these components is missing, overall health will suff er. Natural sleep aids are abundant, but sometimes the best tactic is to build a foundation for healthy sleep from the ground up by reducing stress, eating well, and supplementing with a few basic nutrients that are known to support your body's sleep- wake cycle.

A JOURNEY IN GELATO Strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries harmonize in the sweetest jam, folded between layers of mascarpone cheese and creamy gelato. Tart, velvety, indulgent\u2014 each spoonful whispers of the journey that started Dolcezza, when founders, Violeta and Robb tasted their destiny in the humid, dark Argentine night. A few years down the road in Washington D.C., they began learning to craft their own, searching for ingredients in orchards and farms nearby. They built relationships with producers who shared their values, bringing grass-grazed milk, fruits, and nuts back to their kitchen to spin into frosty perfection. These days, Dolcezza is a household name in some parts, but they've never forgotten how it started\u2014with clean ingredients, handmade craftsmanship and family working together to share their passion, spoonful by decadent spoonful. From Stracciatella to Salted Caramel, you can fi nd your own journey of bliss in each hand-packed pint at your local Natural Grocers. Any way you travel\u2014your fl avor of happiness will be here waiting, and they call it Dolcezza. $1294SALE 4 lb.BagPER EDAP $18.49 18 | Health Hotline IS YOUR LUNCH TELLING A TRUE STORY?

That's in large part due to agricultural subsidies, which are meant to maintain a stable food supply at relatively low costs, or so it seems. The U.S. spends about $20 billion annually on farm subsidies.1 These payouts were originally introduced in the 1930s as, \"a temporary solution to deal with an emergency;\"2 in other words, to help the small and mid-sized family farms that were hit hard by the Depression and severe weather issues like the Dust Bowl that left crop fi elds barren. These days, they are intended to protect farmers from the variables of farming\u2014weather, pests, market prices, etc.\u2014 and alleviate farmer poverty, but in reality, the majority of subsidies go to large commercial farms with average incomes of $200,000 and average net worths of about $2 million.3 One analysis found that 60 percent of subsidies went to the largest 10 percent of farms.4 Subsidies are supposed to help compensate for the risks of farming, but these payouts essentially give billions of taxpayer dollars to large farm businesses. More than 90 percent of all subsidies go to fi ve crops: wheat, cotton, corn, soybeans, and rice. These subsidies create a surplus of these crops, which are mostly used to make processed junk food or to feed livestock in CAFOs. Meanwhile, more than half of the fresh fruit and almost a third of the fresh vegetables we buy is imported from other countries.5 Subsidies aren't the only economic costs of conventional agriculture\u2014the estimated environmental and public health care costs of excessive pesticide use has been estimated to be about $12 billion dollars annually6 and the cost of treating rural and municipal drinking water supplies contaminated by agricultural fertilizer pollution is in the billions.7 ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS Conventional agriculture relies on large-scale monoculture, meaning farmers grow or produce a single crop or livestock species in one fi eld or farm at a time. This kind of intensive farming requires using (literally) tons of synthetic chemical fertilizers and pesticides. In fact, the U.S. uses more than one billion pounds of pesticides each year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).8 About 85 pesticides used throughout the U.S. have been banned or are in the process of being phased out in Europe, China, and Brazil, mostly because of their harmful impact on human health or the environment, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Environmental Health.9 A reliance on monocultures and the heavy use of pesticides that this type of farming requires leads to a loss of biodiversity,10 including benefi cial pollinators, whose numbers have been drastically declining in recent years. Biodiversity boosts overall ecosystem health and ensures that ecosystems can endure and recover from natural disasters and climate instability.11 In addition to biodiversity, water is also highly aff ected by agricultural runoff . Runoff from fi elds washes pesticides and fertilizers into lakes, rivers, and streams, impacting local wildlife and drinking water for nearby residents. Nitrate, in particular, is one of California's most widespread groundwater pollutants and studies are ongoing about its potential risk to human health.12 The UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences studied the link between agriculture and groundwater and found that \"agricultural fertilizers and animal wastes are by far the largest regional sources of nitrate in groundwater, contributing 96 percent of the nitrate loading to groundwater in these agricultural regions.\"13 Dead zones and algae blooms resulting from agricultural runoff are an ever-growing problem as well. The historic fl ooding of millions of acres of Midwestern farmland earlier this year washed huge amounts of fertilizer and manure into waterways, \"triggering a potentially unprecedented season\" of algae blooms in Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico.14 An algae overgrowth can choke out aquatic life and make water unsafe for swimming and drinking. Further, algae blooms emit large amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, which scientists say can accelerate global methane emissions up to 90 percent over the next century.15 Conventional agriculture also takes a major toll on the soil. Heavy tilling, multiple harvests of the same crop every year, and the heavy use of chemicals depletes valuable soil nutrients and microbes, requiring farmers to use ever increasing amounts of chemical fertilizers to stimulate plant growth. The heavy use of pesticides further depletes important soil microorganisms. The herbicide glyphosate, for example, has been found to negatively impact the diversity, function, and structure of soil microbes and fungi that are vital to soil health.16 A recent United Nations study found that one-third of the Earth's fertile soil is being \"acutely degraded.\" The biggest factor? Conventional agriculture.17 Soil degradation leads to erosion and eventually desertifi cation, making it harder to continue farming and threatening food production.18 Degraded soil also releases carbon into the atmosphere, making it a major contributor to climate change.19 20 $20 BILLION IN ANNUAL FARM SUBSIDIES ONE BILLION POUNDS OF PESTICIDES 2 | Health Hotline 28 | Health Hotline HEALTH COSTS One of the biggest threats of conventional farming to human health is the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs, or bacteria that don't respond to antibiotics. The CDC calls antibiotic resistance, \"one of the world's most pressing public health problems.\"21 About 80 percent of all antibiotics in the U.S. are not used by humans,22 instead, they are administered to cows, pigs, and chickens raised for food in an attempt to keep them healthy in CAFOs. One study found that people living near pig farms or cropland fertilized with pig manure were about 30 percent more likely to contract antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, or MRSA.23 The widespread use of chemical pesticides in conventional agriculture is another major health burden placed on the public, and often, the people most aff ected by them are also the least protected. Farmworkers are on the frontlines working with harmful pesticides, often with very little training or understanding of how the exposure can aff ect their health. Studies have shown that pesticides brought into the home on parents' clothing and skin also put farmworker's children at risk.24 One long-term study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley found that the children of farmworkers and children who lived near fi elds where organophosphate pesticides are sprayed had higher rates of neurodevelopmental problems, including autism, hyperactivity, and reduced IQs.25 26 The damage isn't limited to farmworkers and their children. More than 90 percent of the U.S. population has detectable levels of pesticides, or their metabolites, in their bodies; most of the exposure comes from food and drinking water. Cumulative and chronic pesticide exposure has been linked to numerous health problems, including cancer, reproductive and endocrine problems, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory conditions.28 29 30 Finally, there's the issue of food subsidies. Scientists have tracked how subsidized foods aff ect our health and found that people whose diets contained more subsidized foods (i.e., foods that are highly processed) tended to have worse health than those whose diets contained less.31 Industrial agriculture produces commodity crops like corn and soybeans, which make cheap, overly processed foods. A number of recent studies have found that eating processed foods leads to overeating and weight gain, a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, an increase in cancer risk, and overall risk of all-cause mortality.32THE FUTURE IS ORGANIC The goal of organic agriculture is to conserve and improve soil health and water resources; foster biodiversity; and grow food without the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. When it comes to livestock, organic standards require that animals are managed without the preventative use of antibiotics, are fed certifi ed organic feed, meet certain health and welfare standards, and are managed in a way that conserves natural resources and biodiversity.33 Conventional agriculture was promised to feed the world, but side-by-side studies comparing organic and conventional farming practices have found that organic systems can match or surpass conventional farming in production. A Rodale Institute report found that organic farming \"consistently matched the yields of the conventional system, and produced greater yields than the conventional system under moderate drought conditions.\" Their research also found that organic systems were almost three times as profi table as the conventional ones;34 other research has also found that organic hotspots, or counties with high levels of organic agricultural activity, boost household incomes and reduce poverty levels.35 And while conventional agriculture is a major contributor of greenhouse gases, research has shown CO2 emissions to be up to 66 percent lower in organic farming systems compared to conventional ones.36 37 Organic farming also focuses on restoring soil health, and healthy soil sequesters carbon, helping to reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere.38 It has been estimated that for each one percent increase in soil carbon levels due to organic farming, atmospheric CO2 levels would be reduced by up to two percent.39 Cheap food is plentiful in the U.S. as a result of an unsustainable system of agriculture, one that comes at a major cost to the economy, the environment, and public health. And those costs are shouldered not by the industry causing the damage, but by individual farmers, farmworkers, taxpayers, and the general public. There is a better way. Organic agriculture is a system that boosts the economy, while protecting the environment and public health\u2014 with no hidden costs. references available on request ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT SUPERBUGS Natural Grocers | 29 NATURAL GROCERS\u00ae BRAND 1 LB. | EDAP $3.4920% OFF $279 MADEGOOD\u00ae Organic Soft Baked Mini Cookies Made with organic ingredients like oats, apples, chocolate chips, and brown sugar. 4.25 OZ. | EDAP $3.29$263 MARANATHA\u00ae Select Almond Butters They select only the finest, heart- healthy California almonds.* 12 OZ. | EDAP $9.75$780 PRIMAL KITCHEN\u00ae Avocado Oil Mayonnaise Made with avocado oil and organic cage-free eggs, this delicious condiment isn't one you want to miss! 12 OZ. | EDAP $8.89$711FOUR SIGMATIC \u00ae Select Organic Mushroom Coffee Mixes Stabilized with dual-extracted chaga mushrooms that help to support daily immune VALID AUGUST 30 TO SEPTEMBER 28, 2019 EDAP = Every Day Affordable Price.

One of glyphosate's mechanisms of action is related to its disruption of the shikimate pathway, which is found in the weeds that it targets. The current accepted dogma by those claiming glyphosate is safe is that the shikimate pathway is not found in humans or mammals. However, the shikimate pathway is present in the gut bacteria of mammals (including humans), which are directly related to overall health and mood. A recent study examined the eff ects of glyphosate on gut bacteria of mice and its impact on anxiety and depressive- like behavior. The study separated mice into three groups: The control group was given a saline solution, while the other two groups were given either a 250mg/kg or 500mg/kg dose of glyphosate. The doses used in the study were at or below the levels established by the EPA to have no adverse eff ects. Each group of mice underwent a series of behavior tests after a one-time dose and again at six and 12 weeks. At the end of the study the mice gut microbiota was examined and analyzed. Researchers found that glyphosate lead to anxiety and depressive-like behavior at both six and 12 weeks of exposure. The researchers also found that repeated exposure to glyphosate signifi cantly decreased the overall diversity and abundance of the microbiota, including benefi cial strains such as Lactobacillus bacteria. The researchers highlighted that these changes in the microbiota have been consistently linked with anxiety and depressive-like behavior.This research adds to the growing body of literature that highlights how glyphosate negatively aff ects our health. Glyphosate is widely used in genetically modifi ed foods but is also used in conventionally grown foods such as wheat and oats. The best way to avoid glyphosate in food is to choose organic.

This is mostly attributed to their diet, which prioritized consumption of meat, fi sh, eggs, fruits, vegetables, roots, and nuts, while excluding dairy and grains. Their diets were also void of modern-day processed foods, high in added sugar, salt, and damaged fats. A 2019 meta-analysis conducted by researchers at Tehran University of Medical Sciences sought to fi nd whether adherence to a PD demonstrates favorable eff ects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Primary outcomes included improvements in risk factors such as lipid profi le, blood pressure, weight, and infl ammatory markers. In total, eight human randomized controlled trials with a total of 266 subjects were included in the analysis. Paleolithic diet interventions ranged anywhere from 14 days to two years. Adherence to a PD resulted in signifi cant decreases in weight, waist circumference, BMI, and body fat percentage. Additionally, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were signifi cantly reduced. Some of the most profound results of the study included changes in various blood markers most commonly associated with increased risk for CVD. This included signifi cant decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol, with signifi cant increases in HDL cholesterol. Moreover, measures of C-reactive protein, a well-known infl ammatory marker, were also signifi cantly reduced. Authors of the study concluded that these results provide support for the use of the PD in improving cardiovascular disease risk factors. Diabetes is a growing problem worldwide and results in the body's inability to regulate blood sugar. As a result, many diabetics have higher levels of oxidative stress and lipid dysregulation. High levels of oxidative stress are thought to complicate the development of diabetes over time by increasing the amounts of free radicals in the body, while lipid dysregulation results in decreased HDL cholesterol with increased triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. Combined oxidative stress and lipid dysregulation can increase the risk factors associated with diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease. A recent study investigated the eff ects of a daily multivitamin in 300 Sudanese patients with type-2 diabetes. Participants in the study received either a placebo or a multivitamin which contained the recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals. At the end of the study blood samples were taken that measured vitamins A, E, C and zinc in addition to other metabolic markers such as HDL, triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose. Those participants taking the multivitamin had signifi cant increases in vitamin A, E, and zinc as well as improvements in several metabolic markers, including triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose. The results of this study showed that multivitamin intake increases the amounts of vitamins and minerals in the body which may improve metabolic markers of health. The researchers concluded that improvements made in diabetics taking multivitamins may minimize the complications related to diabetes.MULTIVITAMINS IMPROVE METABOLIC MARKERS IN DIABETICS multivitamin intake increases the amounts of vitamins and minerals in the body which may improve metabolic markers of health results included signi cant decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol NUTRITION BYTES Roundup is the most heavily used herbicide worldwide and its active ingredient, glyphosate, is under scrutiny for its eff ects on environmental and human health.
