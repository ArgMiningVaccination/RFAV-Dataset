The best source of information about availability is [https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine/where-can-i-get-my-vaccine/](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine/where-can-i-get-my-vaccine/). While some places require an appointment, more and more are accepting walk-ins such as Division of Public Health clinics. A list of clinics and other community locations and Federally Qualified Health Centers accepting walk-ins can be found at [https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine/where-can-i-get-my-vaccine/](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine/where-can-i-get-my-vaccine/). While youth under age 18 are only eligible for the Pfizer vaccine at this time, the Division of Public Health recommends that all other adults take any of the vaccines that are available. However, we understand that you may want to compare vaccines. You can see a [comparison chart here](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/177/2021/05/Vaccine-Comparison-Chart.pdf). Vaccine provided at each site is dependent upon supply received. Choice of vaccine is not available as certain locations are only distributing one vaccine. If you have a preference in vaccine, you can contact the location you are receiving your vaccine beforehand to discuss which vaccine is available. When you receive the vaccine, you will receive a card that states which vaccine was provided, including company name, lot number, date received and location. Development/Safety/Effectiveness A vaccine is a substance that teaches your body to recognize that a foreign invader such as a virus or bacteria has entered the body. Once the body recognizes the invader, the body's immune system is activated, and fighter cells and proteins fight the virus or the bacteria. A vaccine is much like a decoy, it tricks the body into thinking it is the virus, but it does not actually cause the disease. It helps your body fend off the virus. All three vaccines, Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson&Johnson are highly effective at preventing COVID-19 related death and hospitalization. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are 95% effective against all forms of COVID infections, and the J&J/Janssen vaccine is 74% effective. In comparison, the annual flu vaccine is typically between 40% and 60% effective in preventing influenza. It is unknown how long the COVID vaccine's effectiveness will last, so an annual vaccine (much like the flu) may be required. The vaccine was developed in a much shorter period of time, due to the obvious need to address the public health threat the pandemic posed to the nation. A shorter development and review time does not mean the vaccine is unsafe. Scientists had a head start: COVID-19 vaccines are built on years of work to develop vaccines for similar viruses. All available vaccines use technologies that researchers have been studying and working with for decades - which included technology advances to map the virus's DNA. A lot of the groundwork was already laid during the search for vaccines to fight Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The Coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is part of a broader family of coronaviruses - and related to SARS and MERS. Researches have been engaged in searching for vaccines for those closely related viruses for several years, so they were not starting from scratch with COVID, according to the Mayo Clinic. Researchers also benefited from a budget of $4.5 billion from the US government, which gave vaccine manufacturers all the resources they needed to accelerate their process. Additionally, the clinical trial process was accelerated by enrolling more people in trials to enhance rapid data collection and earlier analysis of safety data for demographically diverse populations. This also sped up the FDA review process as they have been monitoring the data all along. And, delivery/distribution time was shortened by allowing manufacturing to occur at the same time as instead of after, vaccine approval. Over 250 million doses of the vaccine have been given in the U.S. since December 2020. According to the CDC, COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective! All vaccines are rigorously tested for safety and effectiveness. - More than 100,000 people volunteered in clinical trials for three vaccines\u2014Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson\u2014to make sure the vaccines were safe and worked to prevent COVID-19. - Experts and scientists from the Food and Drug Administration and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reviewed the vaccine development data. Extensive post-monitoring efforts were implemented to safeguard those immunized. - The clinical trial data, along with post trial safety monitoring, showed that the vaccines help prevent COVID-19, serious illness from the disease and are highly effective in preventing hospitalization and death. - There were no serious safety concerns in the clinical trials with any vaccine. Reactions are temporary and most often result in a sore arm, fever, headache, or feeling tired and achy for a day or two. Learn more by watching this YouTube video from the CDC: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bBmQaX2k4w ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bBmQaX2k4w) The side effects have been minimal and temporary for all three vaccines, generally going away within 24 hours. Side effects are normal signs that your body is building protection. The CDC reports it has seen no trends of serious or long-term side effects. To report serious side effects, call 1-800-822-7967 or [vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent](http://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent) . - Pfizer-BioNTech Side Effects: Injection site pain, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, injection site swelling, injection site redness, nausea, feeling unwell and swollen lymph nodes. - Moderna COVID-19 Side Effects: pain and tenderness at the injection site, swelling of the lymph nodes in the arm of the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea, vomiting and fever. - Johnson & Johnson Side Effects: pain, swelling and redness at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, nausea and tiredness within a day or two of receiving the vaccine. Rare Severe Allergic Reactions: In some rare cases, severe allergic reactions have occurred within minutes to an hour of receiving both the Pfizer BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines. Signs of a severe allergic reaction include trouble breathing, swelling of face and throat, rapid heartbeat, dizziness and a rash that covers the whole body. If you experience any of these symptoms call 9-1-1 immediately or go to the nearest hospital. You should not get the COVID-19 vaccine: - If you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or an immediate allergic reaction (within 4 hours - includes hives, swelling, wheezing) - to any ingredient in a COVID-19 vaccine - If you have an allergy to polysorbate 80, do not take the J&J vaccine; discuss with your medical provider if you should receive Pfizer or Moderna instead - If you have an allergy to polyethylene glycol (PEG), do not take Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, you may receive the J&J vaccine - Pfizer-BioNTech: approved for ages 12 years - Moderna: approved for ages 18 years - J&J Janssen: approved for ages 18 years If you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of the vaccine, you should not get a second dose of either of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. An allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen\u00a9 or if they must go to the hospital. Learn about common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines and when to call a doctor. Children and adolescents outside these authorized age groups should not receive COVID-19 vaccination at this time. No permanent long-term side effects of any of the three current COVID-19 vaccines have been identified. Serious side effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unlikely following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination. Fortunately, we have decades of vaccine safety data from other vaccines and we know that long-term side effects are quite rare. Vaccine monitoring has historically shown that side effects generally happen within six weeks of receiving a vaccine dose. For this reason, the FDA required each of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines to be studied for at least two months (eight weeks) after the final dose. Millions of people have received COVID-19 vaccines, and no long-term side effects have been detected. CDC continues to closely monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. If scientists find a connection between a safety issue and a vaccine, FDA and the vaccine manufacturer will work toward an appropriate solution to address the specific safety concern (for example, a problem with a specific lot, a manufacturing issue, or the vaccine itself). All viruses change over time, and these changes (or variants) are expected. Scientists are working to learn more about new COVID-19 variants and their effects on vaccines. Recent studies suggest that the germ-fighting cells created by vaccination are also able to fight against many of the variants. We do know that some of the new variants spread more easily, which may lead to more cases of COVID-19. Learn more about [COVID-19 variants here](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/177/2021/03/COVID_Variant_factsheet_2.26.21.pdf). It has been estimated that up to 25% of adults have a fear of needles, with most needle fears developing during childhood. If you are anxious about receiving the vaccine and may experience lightheadedness, dizziness, or pass out, it is important to inform the vaccinator before receiving your shot. It is especially important to inform your vaccinator of your anxiety if you are at a drive-thru event so you can take extra precautions to avoid a potentially dangerous traffic situation. Additionally, you should consider having someone else drive you if you have a history of any of these symptoms. Some things you can consider to calm your anxiety: - Distracting yourself with a video or song. - Practice deep breathing or meditative techniques. - Wiggle your toes. - Do not look directly at the needle. - Focus on the benefits of the vaccine. Remember, the vaccination will be over in a matter of seconds and will provide long-term protection from a potentially deadly virus. On Aug. 23, 2021, The U.S. Food & Drug Administration granted full approval to the COVID-19 Pfizer BioNTech vaccine for individuals 16 and older. The vaccine will now be marketed to individuals 16 and older under the brand name COMIRNATY (Koe-mir-na-tee). The FDA based its approval on Pfizer's Biologics License Application (BLA), and its updated analysis of the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in people aged 16 and older. The analysis studied 20,000 individuals who received the vaccine and 20,000 individuals who received a placebo and found that the vaccine is 91 percent effective in preventing COVID-19. The FDA found the most common side effects to be pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. The FDA did find that the vaccine does present a higher risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in males under the age of 40, the highest risk being for males ages 12 to 17. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is inflammation of the outside lining of the heart. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and a fast-beating heart. Individuals with symptoms should seek medical attention. The FDA is requiring Pfizer to continue post-marketing studies. The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, as well as the vaccine under its new name COMIRNATY, will continue to be available to individuals requiring a third dose of the vaccine due to a compromised immune system and for individuals between the ages of 12 and 15 under the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine has not been granted EUA for children under the age of 12 yet. The Pfizer and COMIRNATY vaccines are the same. They have the same formula Rumor Control/Myth Busting Health officials must respond to many rumors, and debunk several myths. Your best course of action is visit trusted federal resources for information, including the CDC (cdc.gov). Other sources such as FEMA have a rumor control section: [https://www.fema.gov/disasters/coronavirus/rumor-control#vaccinations](https://www.fema.gov/disasters/coronavirus/rumor-control#vaccination). See some common myths below, and responses from the Division of Public Health. See some common myths below, and responses from the Division of Public Health, or check out our [Myths vs. Facts Information Sheet.](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/177/2021/07/Vaccine_MythsVSFacts_Final_7.27.21.pdf) No. Information about the studies and the candidates can be found on the following website [https://coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/understanding-clinical-studies/](https://coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/understanding-clinical-studies/) or by visiting the manufactures websites. - Johnson and Johnson: Genetically engineered. Does not contain the virus. - Moderna: Genetically engineered. Does not contain the virus. - Pfizer: It contains a small part of the genetic code but does not contain the live virus. No, they cannot give someone COVID-19. mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19. No. They do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. Your body naturally breaks down everything in the vaccine. There is no COVID-19 virus in the vaccine, and none of the vaccines can change your DNA. People who are trying to become pregnant now or who plan to try in the future should receive the COVID-19 vaccine. There is no evidence that fertility problems are a side effect of any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines. In fact thousands of women were pregnant during clinical trials or have since gotten pregnant after getting the vaccine. No loss of fertility has been reported among vaccine trial participants or among the millions who have received the vaccines since their authorization, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). ACOG also says there is no evidence that the vaccine can lead to loss of fertility, saying \"it is scientifically unlikely.\" Women in the clinical trials successfully became pregnant following vaccination and there have been no safety data to suggest that the vaccines impact the ability of a woman to get pregnant. Similarly, the Society for Male Reproduction and Urology recommends that men who desire fertility should be encouraged to get vaccinated when they are eligible. How do Vaccines Work? What are they Made of? The ingredients in Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine are listed [on page 2 here](https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download). The ingredients in Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine are listed [on page 2 here](https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download). The ingredients in Janssen/Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine are listed [on page 3 here](https://www.fda.gov/media/146303/download). See DPH's list of ingredients and allergy information for all three vaccines [here.](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/177/2021/01/20210126-Vaccine-Component-and-Allergy-Information-1.pdf) The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, both FDA-authorized for Emergency Use, require two shots. Individuals need to receive the same brand of vaccine for their second dose to be effective. The second shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be given three weeks after the initial dose. Moderna requires its second shot to be given one month after the original dose. The second dose should be received as close as possible to the 21 day/28 day time, but does not have to be on the precise day and can be administered later without repeating the series. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine only requires one dose. People are encouraged to take whatever vaccine is being offered to them rather than wait for a specific brand. mRNA vaccines, which are what the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are built on, safely teach our cells how to make a protein that in turn teaches your body how to make an antibody that fights the virus that causes COVID-19. This is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies. Specifically, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make a harmless piece of what is called the \"spike protein.\" The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. Once a person receives the vaccine, the instructions (mRNA) are inside the muscle cells and the cells use them to make the protein piece. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them. It does not alter or interact with your DNA in any way. Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn't belong there and begins making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19. The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is those vaccinated gain this protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19. Read this Infographic from the CDC on [How mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Work](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/vaccines/COVID-19-mRNA-infographic_G_508.pdf). The J&J vaccine uses a viral vector (or virus-based platform) to protect you. Learn more about this in this CDC Infographic on [How Viral Vector COVID-19 Vaccines Work](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/vaccines/COVID-19-viral-vector-infographic_D_FINAL-508_030621.pdf). All three vaccines have slight differences, but all have been proven 100% effective in preventing death from COVID-19, based on data obtained in clinical trials. The Division of Public Health recommends that you take whichever vaccine becomes available to you rather than waiting for a specific brand, however, we understand that you may want to compare the vaccines yourself. [You can see a vaccine comparison chart here](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/177/2021/05/Vaccine-Comparison-Chart.pdf). Only in certain situations. The CDC has recently updated its guidance regarding the use of face masks after being fully vaccinated (that's two weeks after your second dose of a two-dose vaccine or two weeks after a dose of J&J). Check out their guidance on [choosing safer activities here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/participate-in-activities.html). In Delaware, face masks are required in the following settings for those Kindergarten age and up regardless of vaccination status: - Public transportation (includes buses, paratransit, taxi, rideshares) - Health care facilities (includes hospitals, medical clinics and offices, specialty medical care, labs, dentists, pharmacies, blood banks/drives, veterinary care) - Home health care staff - State facilities - Correctional facilities - Homeless shelters - Childcare facilities - Schools Unvaccinated people are encouraged to wear face coverings wherever they go. In addition, businesses and municipalities can set stricter requirements than the state guidelines which can be found here: [https://governor.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2021/05/29th-Modification-of-the-Declaration-of-a-SOE-State-of-Delaware-051821.pdf](https://governor.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2021/05/29th-Modification-of-the-Declaration-of-a-SOE-State-of-Delaware-051821.pdf). If I Have or Had COVID You should wait until you've recovered from your symptoms and been cleared to leave isolation. If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccination can provide a higher, more robust, and more consistent level of immunity to protect people from COVID-19 than infection alone. Based on what we know right now, COVID-19 infection provides some protection against reinfection but, we don't know the durability of that protection, the sustainability of that infection, or the level of protection depending on the severity of the previous infection. Given this science, getting vaccinated after infection provides a significant increase in your antibody response and significantly increases your protection against reinfection and severe disease. In laboratory studies, it also appears to improve how well you are able to respond to variants. While people may get some level of protection from a prior infection, there is not currently a standard antibody test or antibody level that can show whether an individual will continue to be at low risk of infection as their immunity wanes. [If I test positive for COVID after my first dose of the vaccine, how long do I have to wait before I get my second dose?](#custom-collapse-0-63362439) People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the [criteria](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html)for discontinuing isolation; those without symptoms should also wait until they [meet the criteria](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) before getting vaccinated. If you've already had a COVID-19 infection, the CDC strongly recommends that you get vaccinated. Available evidence shows that recently fully vaccinated individuals and those recently infected by the virus that causes COVID-19 both have a low risk of subsequent infection for at least 6 months. Beyond that, while people may get some level of protection from a prior infection, we don't know how strong, how uniform, or how durable that protection could be. People's antibody response after infection can vary widely. Vaccination provides a higher, more robust, and more consistent level of immunity to protect people from COVID-19 than infection. People who have already had COVID-19 and have fully recovered should get vaccinated. It gives you longer-lasting and more robust protection, which is needed to conquer the variants currently circulating in this country. Studies have shown that vaccination provides a strong boost in protection in people who have recovered from COVID-19. The protection someone gains from having an infection (called natural immunity) varies depending on the disease, and it varies from person to person. Since this virus is new, we don't know how long natural immunity might last. The level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age; and no currently available test can reliably determine if you are protected after a COVID-19 infection. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine gives most people a high level of protection against COVID-19, even in people who have already been sick with COVID-19. [Emerging evidence](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced-immunity.html#anchor_1635540493225) shows that getting a COVID-19 vaccine after you recover from COVID-19 infection provides added protection to your immune system. [One study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_e&ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM63289&ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20August%206%2C%202021&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM63289) showed that, for people who already had COVID-19, those who do not get vaccinated after their recovery are more than 2 times as likely to get COVID-19 again than those who get fully vaccinated after their recovery. [Emerging evidence](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced-immunity.html#anchor_1635540493225) shows that getting a COVID-19 vaccine after you recover from COVID-19 infection provides added protection to your immune system. [One study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_e&ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM63289&ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20August%206%2C%202021&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM63289) showed that, for people who already had COVID-19, those who do not get vaccinated after their recovery are more than 2 times as likely to get COVID-19 again than those who get fully vaccinated after their recovery. You should receive a vaccine or booster as soon as you complete your isolation (5 days of isolation + 5 days of precautions). CDC says immunity offered by a vaccine or booster is greater than the immunity obtained after infection. COVID-19 vaccination causes a more predictable immune response than infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine gives most people a high level of protection against COVID-19 and can provide [added protection for people who already had COVID-19.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced-immunity.html#anchor_1635540493225) [One study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_w) showed that, for people who already had COVID-19, those who do not get vaccinated after their recovery are more than 2 times as likely to get COVID-19 again than those who get fully vaccinated after their recovery. The [level of protection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced-immunity.html#anchor_1635539961239) people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also [a safer way to build protection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html) than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you [by creating an antibody response](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html) without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can't reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. You can also continue to [have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html) Special Populations Yes. Recognizing the importance of testing within minority populations, vaccine developers worked with community engagement partners to enroll a diverse pool of volunteers in the clinical trials. Thirty-seven percent of volunteers from one manufacturer's clinical trials alone were from racial and ethnic minority groups. Here are the racial and ethnic breakdowns of participants in Pfizer and Moderna's clinical studies Johnson & Johnson's study also included volunteers from diverse racial and ethnic minority groups: Pfizer BioNTech: - Diverse subjects in - 62.1% White - 17.2% Black or African American - 8.3% American Indian or Alaska Native - 5.4% Multiple races - 3.5% Asian - 0.3% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander Find more information on the demographic breakdowns in each vaccine's clinical trials on the [Vaccine Safety and Monitoring page](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine/vaccine-safety-and-monitoring/). Persons 12+ and older with an intellectual, developmental or physical disability can be vaccinated anywhere but some settings are better suited for these individuals, including the patient's primary care provider or a hospital system (if you receive services there). Additionally, Division of Public Health clinics are wheelchair accessible. Find a list of clinics here: [https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine/where-can-i-get-my-vaccine/](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine/where-can-i-get-my-vaccine/).

If you are unable to leave your home due to a disability, you should email [vaccine@delaware.gov](mailto:vaccine@delaware.gov) to ask about options for vaccination in your home. If you are pregnant, you should consider being vaccinated against COVID-19. There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination causes any problem with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta. - Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination causes any problems with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta. - Current safety data on the use of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy does not indicate any safety concerns. - Through the v-safe safety monitoring system, the CDC is observing pregnant women who have received the vaccine. Through mid-April, there have been no issues observed from the more than 94,000 pregnant women who were monitored through v-safe after getting the vaccine. - Breastfeeding is rarely a safety concern with vaccines, and the three authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not thought to be a risk to a breastfeeding infant. When breastfeeding mothers get vaccinated they produce antibodies that can be passed through breastmilk and help protect their children from the virus. - Pregnant women are at increased risk severe illness, and hospitalization from COVID-19. Vaccination can significantly reduce or even prevent these risks. If you have questions about getting vaccinated, talking with a health care provider may might help you make an informed decision. Learn more in [DPH's Fact Sheet on Pregnancy, Breastfeeding and Fertility](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/177/2021/04/DECV33125_Vaccine_PregnancyFactSheet_v22.pdf), and [the CDC's vaccination considerations for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html). If you received a COVID-19 vaccine while pregnant, we encourage you to enroll in v-safe. It's the CDC's smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins after vaccination. A v-safe pregnancy registry has been established to gather information on the health of pregnant women who received a COVID-19 vaccine. If those enrolled in v-safe report that they were pregnant at the time of vaccination or after vaccination, the registry staff might contact them to learn more. Participation is voluntary, and participants may opt out at any time. REGISTER ON YOUR SMARTPHONE AT [vsafe.cdc.gov/en/](http://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/). The CDC is advising people who are due for a mammogram to speak with their medical provider on how long they should wait until after they receive their vaccine to get their mammogram. The vaccine can cause lymph nodes under the arms to swell, which can cause a false reading on a mammogram. According to the CDC, some experts recommend getting a mammogram first before receiving the vaccine or waiting four to six weeks after being vaccinated to get a mammogram. For more details on this and how the vaccine affects other medical procedures visit [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/other-procedures.html#](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/other-procedures.html#) Yes. COVID-19 vaccination is especially important for people with underlying health problems like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and obesity. People with these conditions are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19. Please consult with your health care provider if you have specific questions about the COVID vaccine and your health. Clinical trials for all approved vaccines included participants identified as having at least one condition that put them at increased risk of severe complications of COVID-19. See information from the manufacturers for more detailed information on conditions of persons in clinical trials at [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html) The Pfizer vaccine is currently authorized for use in persons aged 12+. Pfizer is also conducting clinical trials among younger children with results expected in the fall. Moderna is next expected to apply for EUA for use of its vaccine in teens under age 18. While children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults, they are still at risk. Children ages 11-17 account for 1.5 Million cases of COVID in the nation, and nearly 13K cases of COVID have been found in Delaware children ages 5 - 17. Children who cannot be vaccinated yet will be more susceptible to the virus if they do not continue to wear face coverings and keep their distance from other people. DPH continues to review statewide data to determine areas of low vaccination rates and compare it with areas that are considered vulnerable per the [CDC's social vulnerability index](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html). It also ensures that vaccination sites, including individual provider sites and pharmacies, are located in areas that are accessible to all. DPH clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers serve traditionally underserved populations in communities. Additionally, both Delaware's COVID Vaccine Task Force and the Communications subcommittee, include representation from organizations representing communities of color and incorporate their feedback into planning. Similarly, DPH participates in many community-based coalition meetings to answer questions, and gather feedback which aids in decision making. Miscellaneous Vaccines are free to everyone, and providers may not charge out-of-pocket costs to someone getting a vaccine. However, vaccination providers may be able to charge an office visit fee (only if other services were provided) and will be able to charge an administration fee for giving the vaccine - but can seek reimbursement through the vaccine recipient's insurance company, Medicare, Medicaid or the US Health and Rural Services Administration.

[What percentage of the population would need to receive the vaccine for wide-spread immunity to take place?](#custom-collapse-0-977406036) It is still unknown at this time, how long that would take, but the more people who choose to get the vaccine, the greater chance of reaching herd immunity there will be. Testing If you are sick with any of the following symptoms, stay home: fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue, chills, shaking with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, loss of smell or taste. Other symptoms such as abdominal pain or lack of appetite have been identified as potential symptoms related to COVID-19 and may prompt further screening, action or investigation by a medical provider. Visit [https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/testing/](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/testing/) to find a testing location near you, or order a home test kit. The two general types of COVID-19 tests include an \"active infection\" test (PCR tests and antigen tests) to look for presence of the virus that causes COVID-19, or an \"immune response\" test (an antibody test) to look for evidence of previous infection. PCR and antigen tests may use a deep nasal swab, a shallow nasal swab that swabs only at the front of the nostrils, or a throat swab. There are also PCR tests such as the LabCorp pixel test that can be performed by yourself at home. For many people, including those without health insurance, the test may come with no upfront cost. The test is a painless swab of the front of the nose that is mailed to LabCorp, and results are received electronically. More information is available here: [https://www.pixel.labcorp.com/state-de](https://www.pixel.labcorp.com/state-de). Antibody tests can be performed with a finger stick or via a tube of blood drawn by a qualified healthcare provider. Antibody tests for COVID-19 are available through healthcare providers and laboratories. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one. The length of time varies. Those who did not provide an email can expect a phone call from a DPH representative approximately five days after taking the test. Most tests sent to the DPH State Lab are processed within 24 to 48 hours, however, the length of time can vary depending upon the number of tests being run that day. If a sample is sent to, and processed by, a commercial lab, your results may take longer as they are sent out of state for testing. Curative, Walgreens, and State Service centers offer free testing. If you have health insurance, you may be asked to provide that information. Other providers may charge for testing. Maybe. Staff in some occupations work with people at higher risk for contracting the disease, like in health care, or long-term care facilities. Or, they have more frequent contact with members of the general public who may not be social distancing or wearing face coverings, like in the retail or hospitality (food/hotel) industries. Most health care workers and first responders are recommended to be tested once every 4 weeks, and most other critical infrastructure personnel are recommended to be tested at least once a month, however your employer may decide you should be tested more frequently. Discuss with your employer if they have made any arrangements for scheduled testing. Testing on a routine basis (at least once a month) should be considered for employees in these occupations. Increased testing may be needed if an outbreak occurs: | || | |Population||Frequency||Notes| |Correctional Facilities| |Incarcerated Persons||Twice||At booking and at conclusion of quarantine (Day 15) prior to release into general population| |Post-Acute Care Facilities (non-outbreak conditions)| |Asymptomatic Residents||Once every 4 weeks||Testing on a 25% of residents each week)| |Asymptomatic Staff||Once every week||Testing on of staff daily)| |Congregate Settings| |Shelters||Twice||At facility admission, as well as testing on a rotating basis (e.g., 25% of all persons each week)| |Custodial Care Sites (such as Group Homes)||Twice||At facility admission, as well as testing on a rotating basis (25% of all persons each week)| |Workforce and Community| |Asymptomatic Health care Workers and First Responders||Once every 4 weeks||Testing on a rotating basis e.g., 25% of staff each week)| |Asymptomatic Critical Infrastructure Personnel (non-healthcare/first responder)||Once a month minimum||Testing can be more frequent, but no more frequent than once every 14 days.| A variety of testing options exist. Employers should encourage workers to get tested through their occupational health services or through primary care providers. Hospital and community testing sites throughout the state are also available. Employers may choose to provide their own testing events in partnership with commercial laboratories or health system partners. Some employers may be interested in partnering with [LabCorp for COVID-19 at-home tests](https://www.pixel.labcorp.com/at-home-test-kits/covid-19-test). These kits can be shipped to anyone who meets screening criteria. LabCorp can file a claim with any individual's insurance or utilize federal funds to cover the cost of the test. Mild cases of COVID-19 may not require treatment. However, if you have a severe case, Monoclonal antibodies (mAB) can be administered to a patient via intravenous (IV) infusion in order to treat COVID-19. Monoclonal antibody treatment can only be provided under the order of a physician or licensed practitioner. This treatment is authorized for patients meeting the criteria specified in the FDA's Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for these treatments, and, due to the extremely limited supply, patients must: - Have tested positive for COVID-19 within the prior 7 days - Be symptomatic - Be at an increased risk of severe disease - Not yet be sick enough to be hospitalized - Learn more about mAB at [https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/monoclonal-antibody-infusions/](https://coronavirus.delaware.gov/monoclonal-antibody-infusions/) Immediate testing is highly encouraged for those with symptoms, even if you are fully vaccinated, and for those who were exposed to someone with COVID-19 five days prior. Testing is also highly encouraged for anyone who was told by a Delaware Contact Tracer that they may have been exposed to, or were a contact of, someone with COVID-19. Individuals who are not vaccinated should be getting tested once a week. Lastly, those with frequent or high-risk contact with others, including health care workers, first responders, those in the hospitality (food/hotel) industry, and critical infrastructure personnel, are recommended to obtain testing at regular intervals even when they do not have symptoms.
