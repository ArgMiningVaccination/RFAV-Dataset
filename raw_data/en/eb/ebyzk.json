( [7](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1534735407301942)) Milk thistle extract also has antioxidant effects that may help decrease inflammation and protect the liver from damage. ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4665566/)) However, to get the most benefit from milk thistle extract, it is important to choose the right form. Keep reading to learn more about the best milk thistle supplements. Best milk thistle supplement Milk thistle has been used medicinally for thousands of years and its bioactive compound, silybin, has been studied extensively for its ability to support [liver health](https://fullscript.com/blog/liver-health). ( [2](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/22/11/1942/htm)) However, research also indicates that when taken orally, silybin from milk thistle extract is not well absorbed. ( [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16164374/)) Silybin's bioavailability can be improved significantly by combining milk thistle extract with [ phosphatidylcholine](https://fullscript.com/blog/phosphatidylcholine) to create a milk thistle phytosome. ( [2](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/22/11/1942/htm)) Start using supplements in clinical practice Milk thistle phytosome Phytosome technology envelops the herb to create a cell-like structure that can effectively deliver the plant and its active compounds through the gut protecting it from destruction by gastric secretions and gut bacteria, which enhances the bioavailability of the plant. In addition to enhanced absorption, the phosphatidylcholine in the phytosome is also hepatoprotective, offering a synergistic effect when combined with milk thistle. ( [1](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ijhr/article/view/47905)) According to a 2019 prospective, blinded, two-way crossover study featuring 23 healthy volunteers, silybin phytosome demonstrated bioavailability compared to a non-phytosome silymarin extract. ( [4](https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-018-0280-8)) What to look for when buying milk thistle supplements To ensure you choose the best milk thistle supplement with the highest bioavailability possible, be sure the label indicates that the herb has been combined with phosphatidylcholine to create a phytosome. In the form of a dietary supplement, the product can be called milk thistle phytosome, silymarin phytosome, or silybin phytosome. In addition to milk thistle, phytosome technology is used with other herbs such as Ginkgo biloba, grape seed, hawthorn, and others to enhance absorption of the active compounds found in these plants. ( [1](https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ijhr/article/view/47905)) Standardization is a way to ensure that the product has the highest percentage possible of the active compounds found in the plant. Standardized milk thistle phytosome is generally well tolerated with many of the studies featuring a product standardized to contain 70 to 80% silymarin. ( [5](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/1001/p1285.html)) The bottom line Milk thistle extract is a powerful supplement that can benefit health, especially liver health. The key to choosing the best milk thistle supplements is to look for a standardized silymarin phytosome.
