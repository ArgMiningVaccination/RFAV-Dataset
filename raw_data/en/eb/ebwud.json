When you first signed up for Medicare, you received information about what services are covered under Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. Rem ember: Medicare Part A generally helps cover services furnished by institutional providers such as hospitals (for inpatient services) , skilled nursing facilities, or home health agencies. Medicare Part B is for most other medical services (such as physicia n's services and other outpatient services) and certain items (such as durable medical equipment and supplies). Section 2.3 Here is the plan service area for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Although Medicare is a Federal program, Geisinge r Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) is available only to individuals who live in our plan service area.

Section 3.2 The Provider Directory : Your guide to all providers and pharmacies in the plan's network What are \"network providers\" and \"network pharmacies \"? Network providers are the doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, hospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement with us to accept our payment and any plan cost sharing as payment in full. We have arranged for the se providers to deliver covered services to members in our plan. Our Provider Directory also gives you a complete list of our network pharmacies - that means all of the pharmacies that have agreed to fill covered prescriptions for our plan member s. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 1: Getting started as a member 7 Why d o you need to know which providers and pharmacies are part of our network? It is important to know which providers are part of our network because, with limited exceptions, while you are a member of our plan you must use network providers to get your medical care and services. The only exceptions are emergencies, urgently needed care when the network is not available (general ly, when you are out of the area), out -of-area dialysis services, and cases in which Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) authorizes use of out -of-network providers . See Chapter 3 (Using the plan's coverage for your medical services ) for more specific information about emergency, out -of-network, and out -of-area coverage.

In some situations, your plan premium could be more In some situations, your plan premium could be more than the amount listed above in Section 4.1. These situations are described below. Some members are required to pay a late enrollment penalty because they did not join a Medicare drug plan when they firs t became eligible or because they had a continuous period of 63 days or more when they didn't have \"creditable\" prescription drug coverage. (\"Creditable\" mean s the drug coverage is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's standard prescr iption drug coverage .) For these members, the late enrollment penalty is added to the plan's monthly premium. Their premium amount will be the monthly plan premium plus the amount of their late enrollment penalty. o If you are required to pay the late enrollment penalty, the amount of your penalty depends on how long you waited before you enrolled in drug coverage or how many months you were without drug coverage after you became eligible.

The one that pays second, called the \"secondary payer,\" only pays if there are costs left uncovered by the primary coverage. The secondary payer may not pay all of the uncovered costs. These rules apply for employer or union group health plan coverage: If you have retiree coverage, Medicare pays first. If your group health plan coverage is based on your or a family member's current employment, who pays first depends on your age, the size of the employer, and whether you have Medicare based on age, disability, or End -stage Renal Disease (ESRD): 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 1: Getting started as a member 14 o If you're under 65 and disabled and you or your family member is still working, your plan pays first if the employer has 100 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan has more than 100 employees. o If you're over 65 and you or your spouse is still working, the plan pays first if the employer has 20 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan has more than 20 employees. If you have Medicare because of ESRD, your group health plan will pay first for the first 30 months after you become eligible for Medicare. These types of coverage usually pay first for services related to each type: No-fault insurance (including automobile insurance) Liability (including automobile insurance) Black lung benefits Workers' compensation Medicaid and TRICARE never pay first for Medicare -covered services. They only pay after Medicare, employer group health plans, and/or Medigap have paid. If you have other insurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and pharmacy. If you have questions about who pays first, o r you need to update your other insurance information, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) . You may need to give your plan member ID number to your other insurers (once you have confirmed their identity) so yo ur bills are paid correctly and on time. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 2: Important phone numbe rs and resources 15 Chapter 2.

(See Section 6 of this chapter for contact information .) 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 2: Important phone numbe rs and resources 30 If you believe you have qualified for Extra Help and you believe that you are paying an incorrect cost-sharing amount when you get your prescription at a pharmacy, our plan has established a process that allows you to either request assistance in obtaining evidence of your proper co - payment level, or, if you already have the evidence, to provide this evidence to us. Geisinger Gold Pharmacy Member Servic es will assist you with this process. Please call us at 1 -800-988-4861 within 15 days of paying the cost sharing amount that you believe may be incorrect. You may be asked to provide us with documentation about your eligibility for Extra Help and the pha rmacy receipt for the amount in question. Geisinger Gold Pharmacy Member Services will work with you, Medicare, and your pharmacy to assess if you have paid incorrect cost sharing . When we receive the evidence showing your copayment level, we will updat e our system so that you can pay the correct copayment when you get your next prescription at the pharmacy. If you overpay your copayment, we will reimburse you. Either we will forward a check to you in the amount of your overpayment or we will offset futu re copayments. If the pharmacy hasn't collected a copayment from you and is carrying your copayment as a debt owed by you, we may make the payment directly to the pharmacy. If a state paid on your behalf, we may make payment directly to the state. Please c ontact Member Services if you have questions (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) . Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program - The Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program is available nationwide. Because Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) offers additional gap coverage during the Coverage Gap Stage, your out -of-pocket costs will sometimes be lower than the costs described here. Please go to Chapter 6, Section 6 for more information about your coverage during the Coverage Gap Stage. The Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program provides manufacturer discounts on brand name drugs to Part D enrollees who have reached the coverage gap and are not already receiving \"Extra Help.\" A 50% discount on the negotiated price (excluding t he dispensing fee and vaccine administration fee, if any ) is available for those brand name drugs from manufacturers that have agreed to pay the discount. The plan pays an additional 2.5% and you pay the remaining 47.5% for your brand drugs. If you reach the coverage gap, we will automatically apply the discount when your pharmacy bills you for your prescription and your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) will show any discount provided. Both the amount you pay and t he amount discounted by the manufacturer count toward your out -of-pocket costs as if you had paid them and moves you through the coverage gap. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 2: Important phone numbe rs and resources 31 You also receive some coverage for generic drugs. If you reach the coverage gap, the plan pays 21% of the price for generic drugs and you pay the remaining 79% of the price. The coverage for generic drugs works differently than the coverage for brand name drugs. For generic drugs, the amount paid by the plan ( 21%) does not count toward you r out-of-pocket costs. O nly the amount you pay counts and moves you through the coverage gap. Also, the dispensing fee is included as part of the cost of the drug. If you have any questions about the availability of discounts for the drugs you are taking or about the Medicare Cover age Gap Discount Program in general, please contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet ). What if you have coverage from a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP)? If you are enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP), or any other program that provides coverage for Part D drugs (other than Extra Help), you still get the 50% discount on covered brand name drugs. Also, the plan pays 2.5% of the costs of brand drugs in the coverage gap. The 50% discount and the 2.5% paid by the plan is applied to the price of the drug before any SPAP or other coverage. What if you get Extra Help from Medicare to help pay your prescription drug costs? Can you get the discounts? No. If you get Extra Help, you already get coverage for your prescription drug costs during the coverage gap. What if you don't get a discount, and you think you should have? If you think that you have reached the coverage gap and did not get a discount when you paid for your brand name drug, you should review your next Explanation of Benefits (EOB) notice. If the discount doesn't appear on your Explanation of Benefits , you should contact us to make sure that your prescription records are correct and up -to-date. If we don't ag ree that you are owed a discount, you can appeal. You can get help filing an appeal from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) (telephone numbers are in Section 3 of this Chapter) or by calling 1 - 800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633-4227), 24 hours a da y, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1 - 877-486-2048.

It gives definitions of terms and explains the rules you will need to follow to get the medical treatments, services, and other medical care that are covered by the plan. For the details on what medical care is covered by our plan and how much you pay w hen you get this care, use the benefits chart in the next chapter, Chapter 4 ( Medical Benefits Chart, what is covered and what you pay ). Section 1.1 What are \"network providers\" and \"covered services\"? Here are some definitions that can help you understan d how you get the care and services that are covered for you as a member of our plan: \"Providers\" are doctors and other health care professionals licensed by the state to provide medical services and care. The term \"providers\" also includes hospitals and o ther health care facilities. \"Network providers\" are the doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, hospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement with us to accept our payment and your cost -sharing amount as payment in full. We have arranged for these providers to deliver covered services to members in our plan. The providers in our network generally bill us directly for care they give you. When you see a network provider, you usually pay only your share of the cost f or their services. \"Covered services\" include all the medical care, health care services, supplies, and equipment that are covered by our plan. Your covered services for medical care are listed in the benefits chart in Chapter 4. Section 1.2 Basic rules for getting your medical care covered by the plan As a Medicare health plan, Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) must cover all services covered by Original Medicare and must follow Original Medicare's coverage rules. Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) will generally cover your medical care as long as: The care you receive is included in the plan's Medical Benefits Chart (this chart is in Chapter 4 of this booklet). The care you receive is considered medically necessary . \"Medic ally necessary\" means that the services, supplies, or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis , or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 37 You have a network primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. As a member of our plan, you must choose a network PCP (for more information about this, see Section 2.1 in this chapter). o In most situations, your network PCP must give you approval in advance before you can use other providers in the plan's network, such as specialists, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, or home health care agencies. This is called giving you a \"referral.\" For more information about this, see Section 2. 3 of this chapter. o Referrals from your PCP are not requi red for emergency care or urgently needed care. There are also some other kinds of care you can get without having approval in advance from your PCP (for more information about this, see Section 2. 2 of this chapter). You must receive your care from a netwo rk provider (for more information about this, see Section 2 in this chapter). In most cases, care you receive from an out -of- network provider (a provider who is not part of our plan's network) will not be covered. Here are three exceptions: o The plan covers emergency care or urgently needed care that you get from an out - of-network provider. For more information about this, and to see what emergency or urgently needed care means, see Section 3 in this chapter. o If you need medical care that Medicare requires o ur plan to cover and the providers in our network cannot provide this care, you can get this care from an out -of- network provider. Authorization must be obtained from our plan prior to seeking care. In this situation, you will pay the same as you would pa y if you got the care from a network provider. For information about getting approval to see an out -of- network doctor, see Section 2.4 in this chapter. o Kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medicare -certified dialysis facility when you are temporarily outside the plan's service area. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 38 SECTION 2 Use providers in the plan's network to get your medical care Section 2.1 You must choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) to provide and oversee your medical care What is a \"PCP\" and what does the PCP do for you? When you become a member of our plan, you must choose a network provider to be your PCP. Your PCP is a physician who meets state requirements and is trained to give you routine medical care. As we explain below, you will get your routine or basic care from your PCP. Your PCP will also coordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a member of our plan. For example, in order for you to see a specialist, you must get your PCP's approval first. (This is called getting a \" referral\" to a specialist.) Your PCP will provide most of your care and will help you arrange or coordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a member of our plan. This includes x -rays, laboratory tests, therapies, care from doctors who are specialists, hospital admissions, and follow -up care. \"Coordinating\" your services includes checking or consulting with other network provider s about your care and how it is going. If you need certain types of covered services or supplies, you must get approval in advance from your PCP (such as giving you a referral to see a specialist). In some cases, your PCP will need to get prior authorization (prior approval) from us. Since your PCP will provide and coordinate your medical care, you should have all of your past medical records sent to you PCP's office. Chapter 8 Section 1.4 tells you how we will protect the privacy of your medical records and personal health information. How do you choose your PCP? Upon enrollment, you can choose a PCP (Primary Care Provider) by selecting a PCP listed in the Provider Directory, or by obtaining assistance from Member Services. The name and office telephone number of your PCP site is printed on your Geisinger Gold membership card. If there is a particular Geisinger Gold specialist or hospital that you want to use, check first to be sure your PCP makes referrals to that specialist, or uses that hospital. Changing your PCP You may change your PCP for any reason, at an y time. Also, it's possible that your PCP might leave our plan's network of providers and you would have to find a new PCP. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 39 To change your PCP, call Member Services at the telephone number in Chapter 2, Section 1. When you call, be sure to tell Member Ser vices if you are seeing specialists or getting other covered services that needed your PCP's approval (such as home health services or durable medical equipment ). Member Services will help make sure that you can continue with the specialty care and other services you have been getting when you change your PCP. They will also check to be sure the PCP you want to switch to is accepting new patients. Member Services will change your membership record to show the name of your new PCP, and tell you when the change to your new PCP will take effect. They will send you a new membership card that shows the name and phone number of your new PCP unless the change of PCP is within the same primary care site. Section 2.2 What kinds of medical care can you get withou t getting approval in advance from your PCP? You can get services such as those listed below without getting approval in advance from your PCP. Routine women's health care, which include s breast exams, screening mammograms (x - rays of the breast), Pap tests, and pelvic exams as long as you get them from a network provider. Flu shots and pneumonia vaccinations as long as you get them from a network provider . Emergency services from network providers or from out -of-network providers. Urgently needed care from in -network providers or from out -of-network providers when network providers are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible , e.g., when you are temporarily outside of the plan's service area. Kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medicare -certified dialysis facility when you are temporarily outside the plan's service area. (If possible, please call Member Services before you leave the service area so we can help arrange for you to have maintenance dialysis while you are away . Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet. ) Inpatient and outpatient mental health care (as long as you get the service from a mental health provider who participates in Geisinger Health Plan's Designated Behavioral Health Benefit Program). To access mental health and substance abuse services, please call the phone number on the back of your Geisinger Gold Member ID card. Hepatitis B vaccine - If you are at high or intermediate risk of getting Hepatitis B (as long as you get the service from a network provider .) Routine reduction of nails, as long as you get the service from a network provider . See Section 3 for more information. Prostate cancer screening for men age 50 and older, as long as you get these services from a network provider . Colorectal screening exams as long as you get these services from a network provider . 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 40 Routine eye exam and bone mass measurement as long as you get these services from a network provider . HIV testing, if you are at risk, as long as you get these services from a network provider . Geisinger Health Plan health/case management programs, which include Asthma, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Heart Failure (HF), Coronary Artery Disease (previous heart attack, angina, coronary bypass) , Diabetes, High Blood Pressure (Hypertension), Osteoporosis and Tobacco Abuse. Section 2.3 How to get care from specialists and other network providers A specialist is a doctor who provides health care services for a specific disease or part of the body . There are many kinds of specialists. Here are a few examples: Oncologists care for patients with cancer. Cardiologists care for patients with heart conditions. Orthopedists care for patients with certain bone, joint, or muscle conditions. When your PCP thinks that you need specialized treatment, he/she will give you a referral (approval in advance) to see a plan specialist or certain other providers. It is very important to get a referral (approval in advance) from your PCP before you see a plan specialist or certain other providers (there are a few exceptions, including routine women's health care that we explain later in this section). If you don't have a referral (approval in advance) before you get services from a specialist, you may ha ve to pay for these services yourself. If the specialist wants you to come back for more care, check first to be sure that the referral (approval in advance) you got from your PCP for the first visit covers more visits to the specialist . For some types o f services and care, your provider may need to get approval in advance from our plan (this is called getting \" prior authorization\"). Services that need prior authorization are identified by statements in bold italics in the Benefit Table in Chapter 4. You are responsible for making sure that your provider has obtained prior authorization from the plan before you receive care or services that require it. If there are specific specialists you want to use, find out whether your PCP sends patie nts to these specialists . Each plan PCP has certain plan specialists they use for referrals. This means that the Geisinger Gold specialists you can use may depend on which PCP you select . You may generally change your PCP at any time if you want to see a plan specialist that your current PCP can't refer you to. Later in this section, under \"How can you switch to another PCP,\" we tell you how to change your PCP. If there are specific hospitals you want to use, you must first find out whether your PCP us es these hospitals. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 41 What if a specialist or another network provider leaves our plan? Sometimes a specialist, clinic, hospital or other network provider you are using might leave the plan. If this happens, you will have to switch to another provider who is part of our plan. If your PCP leaves our plan, we will let you know and help you choose another PCP so that you can keep getting covered services. We will send you a letter with specific steps to take if your provider leaves our network. If you need car e before your selection of a new provider has been completed, please call Member Services and a representative will assist you with finding a provider and accessing the care you need. Section 2.4 How to get care from out -of-network providers In certain situations, it may be necessary for you to obtain care outside of the plan network. You do not need permission from the plan (called prior authorization) to seek out -of-network emergency or urgent care, but for all other types of care, you are r esponsible for making sure that prior authorization has been obtained before you receive out -of-network care. Except for emergency and urgent Care, we will not pay for out -of-network care you receive without first obtaining prior authorization. To ask for prior authorization, please call the Member Services phone number listed on the back of your membership ID card. The plan covers emergency care or urgently needed care that you get from an out-of- network provider. For more information about this, and to see what emergency or urgently needed care means, see Section 3 in this chapter. You do not need prior authorization to seek emergency or urgent care out of network. If you get emergency or urgent care out of network, your cost is same cost sharing you would pay in network for the same service. If you need medical care that Medicare requires our plan to cover and the providers in our network cannot provide this care, you can get this care from an out-of-network provider. Authorization must be obtained from the plan prior to seeking this type of out -of- network care . In this situation, you will pay the same as you would pay if you got the care from a network provider. For information about getting approval to see an out -of- network doctor, see Section 2.4 in this chapter. Kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medicare -certified dialysis facility when you are temporarily outside the plan's service area. Routine and Medicare -covered eyewear benefits an d hearing aid benefits may be obtained out of network. Prior authorization to go out of network for eyewear or hearing aids is not necessary. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 42 SECTION 3 How to get covered services when you have an emergency or urgent need for care Section 3.1 Getting care if you have a medical emergency What is a \"medical emergency\" and what should you do if you have one? A \"medical emergency\" is when you, or any other prudent layperson with an average knowledge of health and medicine, believe that you have medical symptoms that require immediate medical attention to prevent loss of life, loss of a limb, or loss of function of a limb. The medical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse. If you have a medical emer gency: Get help as quickly as possible. Call 911 for help or go to the nearest emergency room or hospital. Call for an ambulance if you need it. You do not need to get approval or a referral first from your PCP. As soon as possible, make sure that our plan has been told about your emergency. We need to follow up on your emergency care. You or someone else should call to tell us about your emergency care, usually within 48 hours. The number to call is on your Geisinger Gold member ship card. What is covered if you have a medical emergency? You may get covered emergency medical care whenever you need it, anywhere in the world . Our plan covers ambulance services in situations where getting to the emergency room in any other way could endanger your healt h. For more information, see the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4 of this booklet. Emergency care is available worldwide. Contact Member Services for more information about emergency Care coverage outside of the United States. The phone number can be found on the back of your Geisinger Gold membership card, or on the back page of this booklet. For more information about covered emergency medical care, see the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4. If you have an emergency, we will talk with the doctor s who are giving you emergency care to help manage and follow up on your care. The doctors who are giving you emergency care will decide when your condition is stable and the medical emergency is over. After the emergency is over you are entitled to follow -up care to be sure your condition continues to be stable. Your follow -up care will be covered by our plan. If your emergency care is provided by out -of-network providers, we will try to arrange for network providers to take over your care as soon as your medical condition and the circumstances allow. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 43 What if it wasn't a medical emergency? Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have a medical emergency. For example, you might go in for emergency care - thinking that your health is in serious danger - and the doctor may say that it wasn't a medical emergency after all. If it turns out that it was not an emergency, as long as you reasonably thought your health was in serious danger, we will cover your care. However, after the doctor has said that it was not an emergency, we will cover additional care only if you get the additional care in one of these two ways: You go to a network provider to get the additional care. - or - the additional care you get is considered \"urgently needed care\" and you follow the rules for getting this urgent care (for more information about this, see Section 3.2 below). Section 3.2 Getting care when you have an urgent need for care What is \"urgently needed care\"? \"Urgently needed care\" is a non -emergency, unforeseen medical illness, injury, or condition, that requires immediate medical care . Urgently needed care may be furnished by in -network providers or by out -of-network providers when network providers are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible. The unforeseen condition c ould, for example, be an unforeseen flare -up of a known condition that you have. What if you are in the plan's service area when you have an urgent need for care? In most situations, if you are in the plan's service area, we will cover urgently needed care only if you get this care from a network provider and follow the other rules described earlier in this chapter. However, i f the circumstances are unusual or extraordinary, and network providers are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible, we will cover urgently needed care that you get from an out-of-network provider. If you are in the plan's service area and have an urgent need for care, you should contact your PCP's office first, if possible. Many primary care providers reserve some time e ach day to see patients with an urgent need for care. Even after hours, your PCP may be able to assist you, or may be able to direct you to a partnering in -network provider who is on call for urgent after - hours care. You may also call our 24 -hour nurse l ine, Tel -a-nurse, for assistance at 877 -543- 5061. If your PCP and other network providers are unavailable or inaccessible, our plan will cover urgently needed care that you receive at an urgent care center or from an out -of-network provider. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 44 What if you are outside the plan's service area when you have an urgent need for care? When you are outside the service area and cannot get care from a network provider, our plan will cover urgently needed care that you get from any provider. Our plan does not cover urgently needed care or any other care if you receive the care outside of the United States. (Emergency care is covered worldwide. Please refer to Chapter 4 for more information. ) SECTION 4 What if you are billed directly for the full cost of your covere d services? Section 4.1 You can ask us to pay our share of the cost of covered services If you have paid more than your share for covered services, or if you have received a bill for the full cost of covered medical services, go to Chapter 7 ( Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs ) for information about what to do. Section 4.2 If services are not covered by our plan, you must pay the full cost Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) covers all medical services that are medically necessary, are listed in the plan's Medical Benefits Chart (this chart is in Chapter 4 of this booklet) , and are obtained consistent with plan rules. You are responsible for paying the full cost of services t hat aren't covered by our plan, either because they are not plan covered services, or they were obtained out -of-network and were not authorized. If you have any questions about whether we will pay for any medical service or care that you are considering, y ou have the right to ask us whether we will cover it before you get it. If we say we will not cover your services, you have the right to appeal our decision not to cover your care. Chapter 9 ( What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisio ns, appeals, complaints) ) has more information about what to do if you want a coverage decision from us or want to appeal a decision we have already made. You may also call Member Services to get more information about how to do this (phone numbers are pri nted on the back cover of this booklet) . For covered services that have a benefit limitation, you pay the full cost of any services you get after you have used up your benefit for that type of covered service . Costs incurred once a benefit limit has been r eached will not count toward an out -of-pocket maximum. You can call Member Services when you want to know how much of your benefit limit you have already used. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 45 SECTION 5 How are your medical services covered when you are in a \"clinical research study\"? Section 5.1 What is a \"clinical research study\"? A clinical research study (also called a \"clinical trial\") is a way that doctors and scientists test new types of medical care, like how well a new cancer drug works. They test new medical care procedures or d rugs by asking for volunteers to help with the study. This kind of study is one of the final stages of a research process that helps doctors and scientists see if a new approach works and if it is safe. Not all clinical research studies are open to members of our plan. Medicare or our plan first needs to approve the research study. If you participate in a study that Medicare or our plan has not approved, you will be responsible for paying all costs for your participation in the study . Once Medicare or our plan approves the study, someone who works on the study will contact you to explain more about the study and see if you meet the requirements set by the scientists who are running the study. You can par ticipate in the study as long as you meet the requirements for the study and you have a full understanding and acceptance of what is involved if you participate in the study. If you participate in a Medicare -approved study, Original Medicare pays most of t he costs for the covered services you receive as part of the study. When you are in a clinical research study, you may stay enrolled in our plan and continue to get the rest of your care (the care that is not related to the study) through our plan. If you want to participate in a Medicare -approved clinical research study, you do not need to get approval from us or your PCP. The providers that deliver your care as part of the clinical research study do not need to be part of our plan's network of providers. Although you do not need to get our plan's permission to be in a clinical research study, you do need to tell us before you start participating in a clinical research study. Here is why you need to tell us: 1. We can let you know whether the clinical res earch study is Medicare -approved. 2. We can tell you what services you will get from clinical research study providers instead of from our plan. If you plan on participating in a clinical research study, contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed o n the back cover of this booklet) . 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 46 Section 5.2 When you participate in a clinical research study, who pays for what? Once you join a Medicare -approved clinical research study, you are covered for routine items and services you receive as part of the study , including: Room and board for a hospital stay that Medicare would pay for even if you weren't in a study. An operation or other medical procedure if it is part of the research study. Treatment of side effects and complications of the new care. Original M edicare pays most of the cost of the covered services you receive as part of the study. After Medicare has paid its share of the cost for these services, our plan will also pay for part of the costs. We will pay the difference between the cost sharing in O riginal Medicare and your cost sharing as a member of our plan. This means you will pay the same amount for the services you receive as part of the study as you would if you received these services from our plan . Here's an example of how the cost sharing works: Let's say that you have a lab test that costs $100 as part of the research study. Let's also say that your share of the costs for this test is $20 under Original Medicare, but the test would be $10 under our plan's benefits. In this case, Original Medicare would pay $80 for the test and we would pay another $10. This means that you would pay $10, which is the same amount you would pay under our plan's benefits. In order for us to pay for our share of the costs, you will need to submit a request for payment . With your request, you will need to send us a copy of your Medicare Summary Notices or other documentation that shows what services you received as part of the study and how much you owe. Please see Chapter 7 for more information about submitting requests for payment. When you are part of a clinical research study, neither Medicare nor our plan will pay for any of the following : Generally, Medicare will not pay for the new item or service that the study is testing unless Medicare would cover the i tem or service even if you were not in a study. Items and services the study gives you or any participant for free. Items or services provided only to collect data, and not used in your direct health care. For example, Medicare would not pay for monthly CT scans done as part of the study if your medical condition would normally require only one CT scan. Do you want to know more? You can get more information about joining a clinical research study by reading the publication \"Medicare and Clinical Research St udies\" on the Medicare website (http://www.medicare.gov). You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633-4227) , 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1 -877-486-2048. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 47 SECTION 6 Rules for getting care covered in a \"religious non - medical health ca re institution\" Section 6.1 What is a religious non -medical health care institution? A religious non -medical health care institution is a facility that provides care for a condition that would ordinarily be treated in a hospital or skilled nursing facility care. If getting care in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility is against a member's religious beliefs, we will instead provide coverage for care in a religious non -medical health care institution. You may choose to pursue medical care at any time for any reason. This benefit is provided only for Part A inpatient services (non -medical health care services). Medicare will only pay for non -medical health care services provided by religious non -medical health care institutions. Section 6.2 What care from a religious non -medical health care institution is covered by our plan? To get care from a religious non -medical health care institution, you must sign a legal document that says you are conscientiously opposed to getting medical treatment that is \"non -excepted.\" \"Non -excepted\" medical care or treatment is any medical care or treatment that is voluntary and not required by any federal, state, or local law. \"Excepted\" medical treatment is medical care or treatment that you get that is not voluntary or is required under federal, state, or local law. To be covered by our plan, the care you get from a religious non -medical health care institution must meet the following conditions: The facility providing the care must be certified by Medicare. Our plan's cove rage of services you receive is limited to non-religious aspects of care. If you get services from this institution that are provided to you in your home, our plan will cover these services only if your condition would ordinarily meet the conditions for coverage of services given by home health agencies that are not religious non -medical health care institutions. If you get services from this institution that are provided to you in a facility, the following conditions apply: o You must have a medical condition that would allow you to receive covered services for inpatient hospital care or skilled nursing facility care. o - and - you must get approval in advance from our plan before you are admitted to the facility or your stay will not be covered. o Origin al Medicare inpatient hospital coverage limits apply. o For more information about our plan's coverage of services, please see the benefit table in Chapter 4. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 48 SECTION 7 Rules for ownership of durable medical equipment Section 7.1 Will you own the durable med ical equipment after making a certain number of payments under our plan ? Durable medical equipment includes items such as oxygen equipment and supplies, wheelchairs, walkers, and hospital beds ordered by a provider for use in the home. Certain items, suc h as prosthetics, are always owned by the enrollee. In this section, we discuss other types of durable medical equipment that must be rented. In original Medicare, people who rent certain types of durable medical equipment own the equipment after paying co-insurance for the item for 13 consecutive months. As a member of Geisinger Gold , after having rented certain types of plan-covered durable medical equipment (DME) not to exceed 13 consecutive months, the equipment converts from renting the equipment to your ownership. There are only certain types of DME, known as \"capped rental\" DME, that qualify for conversion from rental to member ownership. Capped Rental DME includes items such as wheelchairs, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices and nebulizers. Before converting an equipment rental to member ownership, we may need documentation from your provider stating that you continue to use the equipment and that it is still medically necessary. Not all Geisinger Gold network DME Suppliers are c ontracted for rent to own conversion. For more information about \"capped rental\" DME and which network DME suppliers offer a rent to own option, please call Geisinger Gold at (800) 498 -9731, Monday through Friday from 8am to 8pm for more information. If you choose a DME supplier who does the rent to own option, after the rental period is over and you become the owner, you may be responsible for part of the cost to have the equipment serviced. Please note that accessories and supplies used on, in, or with the DME item are not included in the rental payment cap. You continue to be responsible for cost sharing on these associated items and supplies purchased for you. What happens to payments you have made for durable medical equipment if you switch to Original Medicare? If you switch to Original Medicare after being a member of our plan: If you did not acquire ownership of the durable medical equipment item while in our plan, you will have to make 13 new consecutive payments for the item while in Ori ginal Medicare in order to acquire ownership of the item. Your previous payments while in our plan do not count toward these 13 consecutive payments. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 3: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services 49 If you made payments for the durable medical equipment item under Original Medicare before you joined ou r plan, these previous Original Medicare payments also do not count toward the 13 consecutive payments. You will have to make 13 consecutive payments for the item under Original Medicare in order to acquire ownership. There are no exceptions to this case w hen you return to Original Medicare. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 4: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) 50 Chapter 4.

It includes a Medical Be nefits Chart that list s your covered services and shows how much you will pay for each covered service as a member of Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) . Later in this chapter, you can find information about medical services that are not covered. It also explains limits on certain services. Section 1.1 Types of out -of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services To understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know about the types of out -of-pocket costs yo u may pay for your covered services. A \"copayment\" is the fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical service s. You pay a copayment at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 tells you more about your copayments.) \"Coinsurance\" is the percent age you pay of the total cost of certain medical service s. You pay a coinsurance at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 tells you more about your coinsurance.) Some people qualify for State Medicaid programs to help them pay their out -of-pocket costs for Medicare. (These \"Medicare Savings Programs\" include the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB), Specified Low -Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB), Qualifying Individual (QI), and Qualified Disabled & Working Individuals (QDWI) programs.) If you are enrolled in one of these programs, you may still have to pay a copayment for the service, depending on the rules in your state. Section 1. 2 What is the most you will pay for Medicar e Part A and Part B covered medical services? Because you are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, there is a limit to how much you have to pay out -of-pocket each year for in-network medical services that are covered under Medicare Part A and Part B (see the Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2, below). This limit is called the maximum out -of-pocket amount for medical services. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 4: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) 52 As a member of Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) , the most you will have to pay out -of-pocket for in-network cover ed Part A and Part B services in 2013 is $6,700. The amounts you pay for copayments and coinsurance for in-network covered services count toward this maximum out -of-pocket amount . (The amount you pay for your Part D prescription drugs do not count toward your maximum out -of-pocket amount . In addition, amounts you pay for some services do not count toward your maximum out -of-pocket amount. These services are marked with an asterisk in the Medical Benefits Chart. ) If you reach the maximum out-of-pocket amount of $6,700, you will not have to pay any out -of-pocket costs for the rest of the year for in-network covered Part A and Part B services. However, you must continue to pay the Medicare Part B premium ( unless your Part B premium is paid for you by Medicaid or another third party) . Section 1. 3 Our plan does not allow providers to \"balance bill\" you As a member of Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) , an important protection for you is that you only have to pay your cost-sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow providers to add additional separate charges , called \"balance billing.\" This pr otection ( that you never pay more than your cost-sharing amount) applies even if we pay the provi der less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. Here is how this protection works. If your cost sharing is a copayment (a set amount of dollars, for example, $15.00), then you pay only that amount for any covered services from a network provider. If your cost sharing is a coinsurance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay more than that percentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see: o If yo u receive the covered services from a network provider, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the plan's reimbursement rate ( as determined in the contract between the provider and the plan ). o If you receive the covered services from an out -of-network provider who participates with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for participating providers . (Remember, the plan covers services from out -of-network providers only in certain situations, such as whe n you get a referral.) o If you receive the covered services from an out -of-network provider who does not participate with Medicare , you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for non -participating providers. (Remember, the pl an covers services from out -of-network providers only in certain situations, such as when you get a referral.) 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 4: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) 53 SECTION 2 Use the Medical Benefits Chart to find out what is covered for you and how much you will pay Section 2.1 Your medical benefits and cost s as a member of the plan The Medical Benefits Chart on the following pages lists the services Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) covers and what you pay out -of-pocket for each service. The services listed in the Medical Benefits Chart are covered only when the following coverage requirements are met: Your Medicare -covered services must be provided according to the coverage guidelin es established by Medicare. Your services (including medical care, services, supplies, and equipment) must be medically necessary. \"Medically necessary\" means that the services, supplies, or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis , or treatment of y our medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice. You receive your care from a network provider. In most cases, care you receive from an out-of-network provider will not be covered. Chapter 3 provides more information about requirement s for using network providers and the situations when we will cover services from an out -of-network provider. You have a primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. In most situations, your PCP must give you approval in advance before you can see other providers in the plan's network. This is called giving you a \"referral.\" Chapter 3 provides more information about getting a referral and the situations when you do not need a referral. Some of the services listed in the Medical B enefits Chart are covered only if your doctor or other network provider gets approval in advance (sometimes called \"prior authorization\") from us. Covered services that need approval in advance are marked in the Medical Benefits Chart in bold italics . In addition, the following services not listed in the Benefits Chart require prior authorization: Biofeedback Training For all preventive services that are covered at no cost under Original Medicare, we also cover the service at no cost to you. However, if yo u also are treated or monitored for an existing medical condition during the visit when you receive the preventive service, a copayment will apply for the care received for the existing medical condition. Sometimes, Medicare adds coverage under Original Me dicare for new services during the year. If Medicare adds coverage for any services during 2013, either Medicare or our plan will cover those services. You will see this apple next to the preventive services in the benefits chart . 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 4: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) 54 Medical Benefits Chart Benefits that require prior authorization are identified in the table below by a prior authorization statement in bold italics.

Did you know there are programs to help people pay for their drugs? There are programs to help people with limited resources pay for their drugs. These include \"Extra Help\" and State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs. For more information, see Chapter 2, Section 7. Are you currently getting help to pay for your drugs? If you are in a program that helps pay for your drugs, some information in this Evidence of Coverage about the costs for Part D prescription drugs may not apply to you. We send you a separate insert, called the \"Evidence of Coverage Rider for People Who Get Extra Help Paying for Prescription Drugs\" ( also known as the \"Low Income Subsidy Rider\" or the \"LIS Rider\" ), which tells you about your drug coverage. If you don't have this insert, please call Member Services and ask for \"LIS Rider.\" (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet .) SECTION 1 Introduction Section 1.1 This chapter describes your coverage for Part D drugs This chapter explains rules for using your coverage for Part D drugs . The next chapter tells what you pay for Part D drugs (Chapter 6, What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs ). In addition to yo ur coverage for Part D drugs, Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) also covers some drugs under the plan's medical benefits: The plan covers drugs you are given during covered stays in the hospital or in a skilled nursing facility. Chapter 4 (Medical Benefits Chart, what is covered and what you pay ) tells about the benefits and costs for drugs during a covered hospital or skilled nursing facility stay. Medicare Part B also provides benefits for some drugs. Part B drugs include certain chemot herapy drugs, certain drug injections you are given during an office visit, and drugs you are given at a dialysis facility. Chapter 4 ( Medical Benefits Chart, what is covered and what you pay ) tells about the benefits and costs for Part B drugs. The two examples of drugs described above are covered by the plan's medical benefits. The rest of your prescription drugs are covered under the plan's Part D benefits . 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 86 Section 1.2 Basic rules for the plan's Part D drug coverage The plan will generally cover your drugs as long as you follow these basic rules: You must have a network provider (a doctor or other prescriber) write your prescription. (For more information, see Section 2, Your prescriptions should be written by a network provider. ) You must use a networ k pharmacy to fill your prescription. (See Section 3, Fill your prescriptions at a network pharmacy or through the plan's mail -order service .) Your drug must be on the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) (we call it the \"Drug List\" for short). (See Se ction 4, Your drugs need to be on the plan's \"Drug List .\") Your drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. A \"medically accepted indication \" is a use of the drug that is either approved by the Foo d and Drug Administration or supported by certain reference books. (See Section 4 for more information about a medically accepted indication.) SECTION 2 Your prescriptions should be written by a network provider Section 2.1 In most cases, your prescription must be from a network provider You need to get your prescription (as well as your other care) from a provider in the plan's provider network. This person often is your primary care provider (your PCP). It could also be another professional in our provider network if your PCP has referred you for care. To find network providers, look in the Provider Directory . The plan will cover prescriptions from providers who are not in the plan's network only in a few special circumstances . These include: Prescriptions you get in connection with covered emerge ncy care. Prescriptions you get in connection with covered urgently needed care when network providers are not available. Dialysis you get when you are traveling outside of the plan's service area . Other than these circumstances, you must have approval in advance (\"prior authorization\") from the plan to get coverage of a prescription from an out -of-network provider. If you pay \"out -of-pocket\" for a prescription written by an out -of-network provider and you think we should cover this expense, please contact Member Services or send the bill to us for payment. Chapter 7, Section 2.1 tells how to ask us to pay our share of the cost. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 87 SECTION 3 Fill your prescription at a network p harmacy or through the plan's mail -order service Section 3.1 To have your prescription covered, use a network pharmacy In most cases, your prescriptions are covered only if they are filled at the plan's network pharmacies. (See Section 3.5 for information about when we would cover prescriptions filled at out -of-network pharmacies.) A network pharmacy is a pharmacy that has a contract with the plan to provide your covered prescription drugs. The term \"covered drugs\" means all of the Part D prescription drugs that are covered on the plan's Drug List. Section 3.2 Finding network pharmacies How do you find a network pharmacy in your area? To find a network pharmacy, you can look in your Provider Directory , visit our website (www.MeridianGeisingerGold.com ), or c all Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) . Choose whatever is easiest for you. You may go to any of our network pharmacies. If you switch from one network pharmacy to another, and you need a refill of a drug you h ave been taking, you can ask either to have a new prescription written by a provider or to have your prescription transferred to your new network pharmacy. What if the pharmacy you have been using leaves the network? If the pharmacy you have been using lea ves the plan's network, you will have to find a new pharmacy that is in the network. To find another network pharmacy in your area, you can get help from Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) or use the Provider Directory . You can also find information on our website at www.MeridianGeisingerGold.com . What if you need a specialized pharmacy? Sometimes prescriptions must be filled at a specialized pharmacy. Specialized pharmacies include: Pharmacies that supply drugs for home infusion therapy. Please refer to your Provider Directory to find a home infusion pharmacy provider in your area. For more information, contact Member Services. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 88 Pharmacies that supply drugs for residents of a long -term care facility. Usually, a long-term care facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy. Residents may get prescription drugs through the facility's pharmacy as long as it is part of our network. If your long -term care phar macy is not in our network, please contact Member Services. Pharmacies that serve the Indian Health Service / Tribal / Urban Indian Health Program (not available in Puerto Rico). Except in emergencies, only Native Americans or Alaska Natives have access t o these pharmacies in our network. Pharmacies that dispense drugs that are restricted by the FDA to certain locations or that require special handling, provider coordination, or education on their use. (Note: This scenario should happen rarely.) To locate a specialized pharmacy, look in your Provider Directory or call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) . Section 3.3 Using the plan's mail -order services For certain kinds of drugs, you can use the plan's network mai l-order services. Generally, the drugs available through mail order are drugs that you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or long-term medical condition. Our plan's mail -order service requires you to order at least a 84-day supply of the drug and no more than a 90-day supply . To get order forms and information about filling your prescriptions by mail please call Pharmacy Member Services at 1 -800-988-4861. If you use a mail -order pharmacy not in the plan's network , your prescription will not be cover ed. Usually a mail -order pharmacy order will get to you in no more than ten (10) days. However, sometimes your mail -order may be delayed. If this occurs, Geisinger Gold will coordinate with your retail pharmacist and mail order facility to see that you re ceive necessary medications. Section 3.4 How can you get a long -term supply of drugs? The plan offers two ways to get a long -term supply of \"maintenance\" drugs on our plan's Drug List. ( Maintenance drugs are drugs that you take on a regular basis, for a ch ronic or long -term medical condition.) 1. Some retail pharmacies in our network allow you to get a long -term supply of maintenance drugs. Your Provider Directory tells you which pharmacies in our network can give you a long -term supply of maintenance drugs. You can also call Member Services for more information (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) . 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 89 2. For certain kinds of drugs, you can use the plan's network mail -order services. Our plan's mail -order service requires you to order at least an 84-day supply of the drug and no more than a 90-day supply. See Section 3.3 for more information about using our mail-order services. Section 3.5 When can you use a pharmacy that is not in the plan's network? Your prescription may be covered in ce rtain situations We have network pharmacies outside of our service area where you can get your prescriptions filled as a member of our plan. Generally, we cover drugs filled at an out -of-network pharmacy only when you are not able to use a network pharmacy . Here are the circumstances when we would cover prescriptions filled at an out -of-network pharmacy: If you are unable to get a covered drug in a timely manner within our service area because there are no network pharmacies within a reasonable driving distance that provide 24 -hour service. If you are trying to fill a covered prescription drug that is not regularly stocked at an eligible network retail or mail order pharmacy (these drugs include orphan drugs or other specialty pharmaceuticals). In thes e situations, please check first with Member Services to see if there is a network pharmacy nearby. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) How do you ask for reimbursement from the plan? If you must use an out -of-network pharmacy, you will generally have to pay the full cost (rather than your normal share of the cost) when you fill your prescription. You can ask us to reimburse you for our share of the cost. (Chapter 7, Section 2.1 explains how to ask the plan to pay you back.) SECTION 4 Your drugs need to be on the plan's \"Drug List\" Section 4.1 The \"Drug List\" tells which Part D drugs are covered The plan has a \" List of Covered Drugs (Formulary).\" In this Evidence of Coverage , we call it the \"Drug List\" for short. The drugs on this list are selected by the plan with the help of a team of doctors and pharmacists. The list must meet requirements set by Medicare. Medicare has approved the plan's Drug List. The drugs on the Drug List are only those covered under Medicare Part D (earlier in this chapter, Section 1.1 explains about Part D drugs). 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 90 We will generally cover a drug on the plan's Drug List as long as you follow the other coverage rules explained in this chapter and the use of the drug is a medically acc epted indication. A \"medically accepted indication\" is a use of the drug that is either : approved by the Food and Dr ug Administration . (That is, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the drug for the diagnosis or condition for which it is being prescribed. ) -- or -- supported by certain reference books. (These reference books are the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information, the DRUGDEX Information System, and the USPDI or its successor. ) The Drug List includes both brand name and generi c drugs A generic drug is a prescription drug that has the same active ingredients as the brand name drug. Generally, it works just as well as the brand name drug and usually costs less. There are generic drug substitutes available for many brand name drugs. What is not on the Drug List? The plan does not cover all prescription drugs. In some cases, the law does not allow any Medicare plan to cover certain types of drugs (for more information about this, see Section 8.1 in this chapter). In other cases, we have decided not to include a particular drug on the Drug List. Section 4.2 There are five \"cost -sharing tiers\" for drugs on the Drug List Every drug on the plan's Drug List is in one of five cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher t he cost-sharing tier, the higher your cost for the drug: Cost-sharing tier 1 includes Preferred Generic Drugs. This is the lowest cost sharing tier. Cost-sharing tier 2 includes Non-preferred Generic Drugs. Cost-sharing tier 3 includes Preferred Brand Dr ugs. Cost-sharing tier 4 includes Non -Preferred Brand Drugs. Cost-sharing tier 5 includes specialty drugs, and has 33% coinsurance . Generally, this is the highest cost sharing tier. To find out which cost -sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in th e plan's Drug List. The amount you pay for drugs in each cost -sharing tier is shown in Chapter 6 ( What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs ). 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 91 Section 4.3 How can you find out if a specific drug is on the Drug List? You have three ways to find out: 1. Check the most recent Drug List we sent you in the mail. (Please note: The Drug List we send includes information for the covered drugs that are most commonly used by our members. However, we cover additional drugs that are not included in the printed Drug List. If one of your drugs is not listed in the Drug List, you should visit our website or contact Members Services to find out if we cover it.) 2. Visit the plan's website ( www.MeridianGeisingerGold.com ). The Drug List on the website is always the most curr ent. 3. Call Member Services to find out if a particular drug is on the plan's Drug List or to ask for a copy of the list. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet .) SECTION 5 There are restrictions on coverage for some drugs Section 5.1 Why do some drugs have restrictions? For certain prescription drugs, special rules restrict how and when the plan covers them. A team of doctors and pharmacists developed these rules to help our members use drugs in the most effective wa ys. These special rules also help control overall drug costs, which keeps your drug coverage more affordable. In general, our rules encourage you to get a drug that works for your medical condition and is safe and effective. Whenever a safe, lower -cost dru g will work medically just as well as a higher - cost drug, the plan's rules are designed to encourage you and your provider to use that lower -cost option. We also need to comply with Medicare's rules and regulations for drug coverage and cost sharing. If there is a restriction for your drug, it usually means that you or your provider will have to take extra steps in order for us to cover the drug. If you want us to waive the restriction for you, you will need to use the formal appeals process and ask us to m ake an exception. We may or may not agree to waive the restriction for you. (See Chapter 9, Section 6.2 for information about asking for exceptions.) Section 5.2 What kinds of restrictions? Our plan uses different types of restrictions to help our members use drugs in the most effective ways. The sections below tell you more about the types of restrictions we use for certain drugs. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 92 Restricting brand name drugs when a generic version is available Generally, a \"generic\" drug works the same as a brand name drug and usually costs less. When a generic version of a brand name drug is available, our network pharmacies will provide you the generic version. We usually will not cover the brand name drug when a generic version is available. However, if your provider has told us the medical reason that neither the generic drug nor other covered drugs that treat the same condition will work for you, then we will cover the brand name drug. (Your share of the cost may be greater for the brand name drug than for the generic drug.) Getting plan approval in advance For certain drugs, you or your provider need to get approval from the plan before we will agree to cover the drug for you. This is called \" prior authorization. \" Sometimes the requirement for getting approval in advance helps guide appropriate use of certain drugs. If you do not get this approval, your drug might not be covered by the plan. Trying a different drug first This requirement encourages you to try less costly but just as effective drugs before the plan covers another drug. For example, if Drug A and Drug B treat the same medical condition, the plan may require you to try Drug A first. If Drug A doe s not work for you, the plan will then cover Drug B. This requirement to try a different drug first is called \"step therapy. \" Quantity limits For certain drugs, we limit the amount of the drug that you can have. For example, the plan might limit how many refills you can get, or how much of a drug you can get each time you fill your prescription. For example, if it is normally considered safe to take only one pill per day for a certain drug, we may limit coverage for your prescription to no more than one pi ll per day. Section 5.3 Do any of these restrictions apply to your drugs? The plan's Drug List includes information about the restrictions described above. To find out if any of these restrictions apply to a drug you take or want to take, check the Drug Li st. For the most up -to-date information, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet ) or check our website ( www.MeridianGeisingerGold.com ). If there is a restriction for your drug, it usually means that you or your pro vider will have to take extra steps in order for us to cover the drug. If there is a restriction on the drug you want to take, you should contact Member Services to learn what you or your provider would need to do to get coverage for the drug. If you want us to waive the restriction for you, you will need to use the formal appeals process and ask us to make an exception. We may or may not agree to waive the restriction for you. (See Chapter 9, Section 6.2 for information about asking for exceptions.) 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 93 SECTIO N 6 What if one of your drugs is not covered in the way you'd like it to be covered? Section 6.1 There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way you'd like it to be covered Suppose there is a prescription drug you are currently taking, o r one that you and your provider think you should be taking. We hope that your drug coverage will work well for you, but it's possible that you might have a problem. For example: What if the drug you want to take is not covered by the plan? For example, the drug might not be covered at all. Or maybe a generic version of the drug is covered but the brand name version you want to take is not covered. What if the drug is covered, but there are extra rules or restrictions on coverage for that dr ug? As explained in Section 5, some of the drugs covered by the plan have extra rules to restrict their use. For example, you might be required to try a different drug first, to see if it will work, before the drug you want to tak e will be covered for you . Or there might be limits on what amount of the drug (number of pills, etc.) is covered during a particular time period. In some cases, you may want us to waive the restriction for you. For example, you might want us to cover a certain drug for you withou t having to try other drugs first. Or you may want us to cover more of a drug (number of pills, etc.) than we normally will cover. What if the drug is covered, but it is in a cost -sharing tier that makes your cost sharing more expensive than you think it should be? The plan puts each covered drug into one of five different cost -sharing tiers. How much you pay for your prescription depends in part on which cost -sharing tier your drug is in. There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way that you'd like it to be covered. Your options depend on what type of problem you have: If your drug is not on the Drug List or if your drug is restricted, go to Section 6.2 to learn what you can do. If your drug is in a cost -sharing tier that makes your cost more expensive than you think it should be, go to Section 6.3 to learn what you can do. Section 6.2 What can you do if your drug is not on the Drug List or if the drug is restricted in some way? If your drug is not on the Drug List or is restricted, h ere are things you can do: You may be able to get a temporary supply of the drug (only members in certain situations can get a temporary supply). This will give you and your provider time to change to another drug or to file a request to have the drug cove red. You can change to another drug. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 94 You can request an exception and ask the plan to cover the drug or remove restrictions from the drug. You may be able to get a temporary supply Under certain circumstances, the plan can offer a temporary supply of a dru g to you when your drug is not on the Drug List or when it is restricted in some way. Doing this gives you time to talk with your provider about the change in coverage and figure out what to do. To be eligible for a temporary supply, you must meet the two requirements below: 1. The change to your drug coverage must be one of the following types of changes: The drug you have been taking is no longer on the plan's Drug List . -- or -- the drug you have been taking is now restricted in some way (Section 5 in this chapter tells about restrictions). 2. You must be in one of the situations described below: For those members who were in the plan last year and aren't in a long -term care facility: We will cover a temporary supply of your drug one time only during t he first 90 days of the calendar year . This temporary supply will be for a maximum of a 3 4-day supply, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days. The prescription must be filled at a network pharmacy. For those members who are new to the plan and aren't in a long -term care facility: We will cover a temporary supply of your drug one time only during the first 90 days of your membership in the plan. This temporary supply will be for a maximum of a 3 4- day supply, or less if your prescription is wr itten for fewer days. The prescription must be filled at a network pharmacy. For those members who are new to the plan and reside in a long -term care facility: We will cover a temporary supply of your drug during the first 90 days of your membership in the plan. The first supply will be for a maximum of a 3 1-day supply, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days. If needed, we will cover additional refills during your first 90 days in the plan. For those members who have been in the plan for mo re than 90 days and reside in a long-term care facility and need a supply right away: We will cover one 3 1-day supply, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days. This is in addition to the above long -term care transition supply. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 95 Level of Care Changes Transition Policy: An early refill restriction will not be used to limit access to a member 's Part D benefit. Members changing from one treatment setting to another (e.g. hospital to LTC facility, or hospital to home), admitted to or discharged from a long term care facility or experiencing similar level of care changes may obtain a refill upon admission or discharge. To ask for a temporary supply, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet ). During the time when you are getting a temporary supply of a drug, you should talk with your provider to decide what to do when your temporary supply runs out. You can either switch to a different drug covered by the plan or ask the plan to make an excepti on for you and cover your current drug. The sections below tell you more about these options. You can change to another drug Start by talking with your provider. Perhaps there is a different drug covered by the plan that might work just as well for you. Y ou can call Member Services to ask for a list of covered drugs that treat the same medical condition. This list can help your provider find a covered drug that might work for you. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) You can ask for an exception You and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception for you and cover the drug in the way you would like it to be covered. If your provider says that you have medical reasons that justify asking us for an excepti on, your provider can help you request an exception to the rule. For example, you can ask the plan to cover a drug even though it is not on the plan's Drug List. Or you can ask the plan to make an exception and cover the drug without restrictions. If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 9, Section 6. 4 tells what to do . It explains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare to make sure your request is handled promptly and fairly. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 96 Section 6.3 What can you do if your d rug is in a cost -sharing tier you think is too high? If your drug is in a cost-sharing tier you think is too high, here are things you can do: You can change to another drug If your drug is in a cost -sharing tier you think is too high, s tart by talking wi th your provider. Perhaps there is a different drug in a lower cost -sharing tier that might work just as well for you. You can call Member Services to ask for a list of covered drugs that treat the same medical condition. This list can help your provider f ind a covered drug that might work for you. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) You can ask for an exception For drugs in Tier 4(Non -Preferred Brand Drugs) or in Tier 2 (Non -Preferred Generic Drugs) , you and y our provider can ask the plan to make an exception in the cost -sharing tier for the drug so that you pay less for it. If your provider says that you have medical reasons that justify asking us for an exception, your provider can help you request an exception to the rule. If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 9, Section 6. 4 tells what to do . It explains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare to make sure your request is handled promptly and fairly. Drugs in some of our cost -sharing tiers are not eligible for this type of exception. We do not lower the cost -sharing amount for drugs in Tier 1 (Preferred Generic Drugs), Tier 3 (Preferred Brand Drugs) or Tier 5 (Specialty Drugs) . SECTION 7 What if your c overage changes for one of your drugs? Section 7.1 The Drug List can change during the year Most of the changes in drug coverage happen at the beginning of each year (January 1). However, during the year, the plan might make many kinds of changes to the Dr ug List. For example, the plan might: Add or remove drugs from the Drug List . New drugs become available, including new generic drugs. Perhaps the government has given approval to a new use for an existing drug. Sometimes, a drug gets recalled and we decid e not to cover it. Or we might remove a drug from the list because it has been found to be ineffective. Move a drug to a higher or lower cost -sharing tier . Add or remove a restriction on coverage for a drug (for more information about restrictions to cove rage, see Section 5 in this chapter). 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 97 Replace a brand name drug with a generic drug. In almost all cases, we must get approval from Medicare for changes we make to the plan's Drug List. Section 7.2 What happens if coverage changes for a drug you are taki ng? How will you find out if your drug's coverage has been changed? If there is a change to coverage for a drug you are taking , the plan will send you a notice to tell you. Normally, we will let you know at least 60 days ahead of time . Once in a while, a drug is suddenly recalled because it's been found to be unsafe or for other reasons. If this happens, the plan will immediately remove the drug from the Drug List. We will let you know of this change right away. Your provider will also know about this chan ge, and can work with you to find another drug for your condition. Do changes to your drug coverage affect you right away? If any of the following types of changes affect a drug you are taking, the change will not affect you until January 1 of the next year if you stay in the plan: If we move your drug into a higher cost -sharing tier. If we put a new restriction on your use of the drug. If we remove your drug from the Drug List, but not because of a sudden recall or because a new generic drug has replaced it. If any of these changes happens for a drug you are taking, then the change won't affect your use or what you pay as your share of the cost until January 1 of the next year. Until that date, you probably won't see any increase in your payments or any added restriction to your use of the drug. However, on January 1 of the next year, the changes will affect you. In some cases, you will be affected by the coverage change before January 1 : If a brand name drug you are taking is replaced by a new ge neric drug , the plan must give you at least 60 days' notice or give you a 60 -day refill of your brand name drug at a network pharmacy. o During this 60 -day period, you should be working with your provider to switch to the generic or to a different drug that we cover. o Or you and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception and continue to cover the brand name drug for you. For information on how to ask for an exception, see Chapter 9 ( What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) ). 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 98 Again, if a drug is suddenly recalled because it's been found to be unsafe or for other reasons, the plan will immediately remove the drug from the Drug List. We will let you know of this change right away. o Your provider will also know about this change, and can work with you to find another drug for your condition. SECTION 8 What types of drugs are not covered by the plan? Section 8.1 Types of drugs we do not cover This section tells you what kinds of prescription drugs are \"excluded.\" This means Medicare does not pay for these drugs. If you get drugs that are excluded, you must pay for them yourself . We won't pay for the drugs that are listed in this section. The only exception: If the requested drug is found upon appeal to be a drug that is not excluded under Part D and we should have paid for or covered it because of your specific situation. (For information about appealing a decision we have made to not cover a drug, go to Chapter 9, Section 6.5 in this booklet.) Here are three general rules about drugs that Medicare drug plans will not cover under Part D: Our plan's Part D drug coverage cannot cover a drug that would be covered under Medicare Part A or Part B. Our plan cannot cover a drug purchased outside the United States and its territories. Our plan usually cannot cover off -label use. \"Off -label use\" is any use of the drug other than those indicated on a drug's label as approved by the Food and Drug Adminis tration. o Generally, coverage for \"off -label use\" is allowed only when the use is supported by certain reference books. These reference books are the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information, the DRUGDEX Information System, and the USPDI or its successor. If the use is not supported by any of these reference books, then our plan cannot cover its \"off -label use.\" Also, by law, these categories of drugs are not covered by Medicare drug plans : Non-prescription drugs (also called over -the-counter dr ugs) Drugs when used to promote fertility Drugs when used for the relief of cough or cold symptoms Drugs when used for cosmetic purposes or to promote hair growth Prescription vitamins and mineral products, except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparation s 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 99 Drugs when used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction, such as Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, and Caverject Drugs when used for treatment of anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain Outpatient drugs for which the manufacturer seeks to require that associated tests or monitoring services be purchased exclusively from the manufacturer as a condition of sale Barbiturates, except when used to treat epilepsy, cancer, or a chronic mental health disorder If you receive Extra Help paying for your drugs , your state Medicaid program may cover some prescription drugs not normally covered in a Medicare drug plan. Please contact your state Medicaid program to determine what drug coverage may be available to you. (You can find phone numbers and contact informat ion for Medicaid in Chapter 2, Section 6.) SECTION 9 Show your plan membership card when you fill a prescription Section 9.1 Show your membership card To fill your prescription, show your plan membership card at the network pharmacy you choose. When you sh ow your plan membership card, the network pharmacy will automatically bill the plan for our share of your covered prescription drug cost. You will need to pay the pharmacy your share of the cost when you pick up your prescription. Section 9.2 What if you d on't have your membership card with you? If you don't have your plan membership card with you when you fill your prescription, ask the pharmacy to call the plan to get the necessary information. If the pharmacy is not able to get the necessary information, you may have to pay the full cost of the prescription when you pick it up . (You can then ask us to reimburse you for our share. See Chapter 7, Section 2.1 for information about how to ask the plan for reimbursement.) 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 100 SECTION 10 Part D drug coverage in spe cial situations Section 10.1 What if you're in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility for a stay that is covered by the plan? If you are admitted to a hospital or to a skilled nursing facility for a stay covered by the plan, we will generally cover the c ost of your prescription drugs during your stay. Once you leave the hospital or skilled nursing facility, the plan will cover your drugs as long as the drugs meet all of our rules for coverage. See the previous parts of this section that tell about the rul es for getting drug coverage. Chapter 6 ( What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs ) gives more information about drug coverage and what you pay. Please Note: When you enter, live in, or leave a skilled nursing facility, you are entitled to a special enrollment period. During this time period, you can switch plans or change your coverage. (Chapter 10, Ending your membership in the plan , tells when you can leave our plan and join a different Medicare plan.) Section 10.2 What if you're a resident in a lo ng-term care facility? Usually, a long -term care facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy, or a pharmacy that supplies drugs for all of its residents. If you are a resident of a long -term care facility, you may get your prescription drugs thr ough the facility's pharmacy as long as it is part of our network. Check your Provider Directory to find out if your long -term care facility's pharmacy is part of our network. If it isn't, or if you need more information, please contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) . What if you're a resident in a long -term care facility and become a new member of the plan? If you need a drug that is not on our Drug List or is restricted in some way, the plan will cover a temporary supply of your drug during the first 90 days of your membership. The first supply will be for a maximum of a 31-day supply , or less if your prescription is written for fewer days. If needed, we will cover additional refills during your first 90 days in the plan. If you have been a member of the plan for more than 90 days and need a drug that is not on our Drug List or if the plan has any restriction on the drug's coverage, we will cover one 31-day supply, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 101 During the time when you are getting a temporary supply of a drug, you should talk with your provider to decide what to do when your temporary supply runs out. Perhaps there is a different drug covered by the plan that might work just as w ell for you. Or you and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception for you and cover the drug in the way you would like it to be covered. If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 9, Section 6. 4 tells what to do . Section 10.3 What if you're also getting drug coverage from an employer or retiree group plan? Do you currently have other prescription drug coverage through your (or your spouse's) employer or retiree group? If so, please contact that group's benefits administrator. He or she can help you determine how your current prescription drug coverage will work with our plan. In general, if you are currently employed, the prescription drug coverage you get from us will be secondary to your employer or retiree group coverage. That means your group coverage would pay first. Special note about 'creditable coverage': Each year your employer or retiree group should send you a notice that tells if your prescription drug coverage for the next calendar year is \"creditable\" and the choices you have for drug coverage. If the coverage from the group plan is \" creditable ,\" it means that the plan has drug coverage that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's standard pres cription drug coverage . Keep these notices about creditable coverage , because you may need them later. If you enroll in a Medicare plan that includes Part D drug coverage, you may need these notices to show that you have maintained creditable coverage. If you didn't get a notice about creditable coverage from your employer or retiree group plan, you can get a copy from your employer or retiree plan's benefits administrator or the employer or union. SECTION 11 Programs on drug safety and managing medication s Section 11.1 Programs to help members use drugs safely We conduct drug use reviews for our members to help make sure that they are getting safe and appropriate care. These reviews are especially important for members who have more than one provider who p rescribes their drugs. We do a review each time you fill a prescription. We also review our records on a regular basis. During these reviews, we look for potential problems such as: 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 5: Using the plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs 102 Possible medication errors Drugs that may not be necessary because you are taking another drug to treat the same medical condition Drugs that may not be safe or appropriate because of your age or gender Certain combinations of drugs that could harm you if taken at the same time Prescriptions written for drugs that have ingred ients you are allergic to Possible errors in the amount (dosage) of a drug you are taking. If we see a possible problem in your use of medications, we will work with your provider to correct the problem. Section 11.2 Programs to help members manage their medications We have programs that can help our members with special situations. For example, some members have several complex medical conditions or they may need to take many drugs at the same time, or they could have very high drug costs. These programs are voluntary and free to members. A team of pharmacists and doctors developed the programs for us. The programs can help make sure that our members are using the drugs that work best to treat their medical conditions and help us identify possible medicat ion errors. If we have a program that fits your needs, we will automatically enroll you in the program and send you information. If you decide not to participate, please notify us and we will withdraw you from the program. If you have any questions about these progra ms, please contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 103 Chapter 6.

Did you know there are programs to help people pay for their drugs? There are programs to help people with limited resources pay for their drugs. These include \"Extra Help\" and State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs. For more information, see Chapter 2, Section 7. Are you currently getting help to pay for your drugs? If you are in a program that helps pay for your drugs, some information in this Evidence of Coverage about the costs for Part D prescription drugs may not apply to you. We send you a separate insert, called the \"Evidence of Coverage Rider for People Who Ge t Extra Help Paying for Prescription Drugs\" ( also known as the \"Low Income Subsidy Rider\" or the \"LIS Rider\" ), which tells you about your drug coverage. If you don't have this insert, please call Member Services and ask for the \"LIS Rider.\" (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet .) SECTION 1 Introduction Section 1.1 Use this chapter together with other materials that explain your drug coverage This chapter focuses on what you pay for your Part D prescription drugs. To keep things simple, we use \"drug\" in this chapter to mean a Part D prescription drug. As explained in Chapter 5, not all drugs are Part D drugs - some drugs are covered under Medic are Part A or Part B and other drugs are excluded from Medicare coverage by law . To understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know the basics of what drugs are covered, where to fill your prescriptions, and what rules to follow when you get your covered drugs. Here are materials that explain these basics: The plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary). To keep things simple, we call this the \"Drug List.\" o This Drug List tells which drugs are covered for you. o It also tells which of the five \"cost -sharing tiers\" the drug is in and whether there are any restrictions on your coverage for the drug. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 106 o If you need a copy of the Drug List, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this bookle t). You can also find the Drug List on our website at www.MeridianGeisingerGold.com . The Drug List on the website is always the most current. Chapter 5 of this booklet. Chapter 5 gives the details about your prescription drug coverage, including rules you need to follow when you get your covered drugs. Chapter 5 also tells which types of prescription drugs are not covered by our plan. The plan's Provider Directory . In most situations you must use a network pharmacy to get your covered drugs (see Chapter 5 f or the details). The Provider Directory has a list of pharmacies in the plan's network . It also tells you which pharmacies in our network can give you a long -term supply of a drug (such as filling a prescription for a three - month's supply). SECTION 2 What you pay for a drug depends on which \"drug payment stage\" you are in when you get the drug Section 2.1 What are the drug payment stages for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) members ? As shown in the table below, there are \"drug payment stages\" for your prescription drug coverage under Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) . How much you pay for a drug depends on which of these stages you are in at the time you get a prescription filled or refilled . 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 107 Stage 1 Initial Coverage St age Stage 2 Coverage Gap Stage Stage 3 Catastrophic Coverage Stage You begin in this stage when you fill your first prescription of the year. During this stage, the plan pays its share of the cost of your drugs and you pay your share of the cost. You stay in this stage until your year -to-date \"total drug costs\" (your payments plus any Part D plan's payments) total $2,970. (Details are in Section 5 of this chapter.) During this stage, you pay 47.5% of the price for brand name drugs (plus a portion of the dispensing fee) and 79% of the price for generic drugs. You stay in this stage until your year -to-date \"out-of- pocket costs\" (your payments) reach a total of $4,750. This amount and rules for counting costs toward this amount have been set by Medic are. (Details are in Section 6 of this chapter.) During this stage, the plan will pay most of the cost of your drugs for the rest of the calendar year (through December 31, 2013). (Details are in Section 7 of this chapter.) SECTION 3 We send you reports that explain payments for your drugs and which payment stage you are in Section 3.1 We send you a monthly report called the \"Explanation of Benefits\" (the \"EOB\") Our plan keeps track of the costs of your prescription drugs and the payments you have made when you get your prescriptions filled or refilled at the pharmacy. This way, we can tell you when you have moved from one drug payment stage to the next. In particular, there are two types of costs we keep track of: We keep track of how much you have paid. This is called your \" out-of-pocket \" cost. We keep track of your \" total drug costs .\" This is the amount you pay out -of-pocket or others pay on your behalf plus the amount paid by the plan. Our plan will prepare a written report called the Explanation of B enefits (it is sometimes called the \"EOB\") when you have had one or more prescriptions filled through the plan during the previous month . It includes: Information for that month . This report gives the payment details about the prescriptions you have fill ed during the previous month. It shows the total drug costs, what the plan paid, and what you and others on your behalf paid. Totals for the year since January 1. This is called \"year -to-date\" information. It shows you the total drug costs and total payments for your drugs since the year began. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 108 Section 3.2 Help us keep our information about your drug payments up to date To keep track of your drug costs and the payments you make for drugs, we use records we get from pharmacies. Here is how you can help us keep your information correct and up to date: Show your membership card when you get a prescription filled. To make sure we know about the prescriptions you are filling and what you are paying, show your plan membership card every time you get a prescription filled. Make sure we have the information we need. There are times you may pay for prescription drugs wh en we will not automatically get the information we need to keep track of your out -of-pocket costs. To help us keep track of your out -of-pocket costs, you may give us copies of receipts for drugs that you have purchased. ( If you are billed for a covered dr ug, you can ask our plan to pay our share of the cost. For instructions on how to do this, go to Chapter 7, Section 2 of this booklet.) Here are some types of situations when you may want to give us copies of your drug receipts to be sure we have a complet e record of what you have spent for your drugs: o When you purchase a covered drug at a network pharmacy at a special price or using a discount card that is not part of our plan's benefit. o When you made a copayment for drugs that are provided under a drug manufacturer patient assistance program. o Any time you have purchased covered drugs at out -of-network pharmacies or other times you have paid the full price for a covered drug under special circumstances. Send us information about the payments others have m ade for you. Payments made by certain other individuals and organizations also count toward your out -of-pocket costs and help qualify you for catastrophic coverage. For example, payments made by a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program, an AIDS drug assis tance program, the Indian Health Service, and most charities count toward your out -of-pocket costs. You should keep a record of these payments and send them to us so we can track your costs. Check the written report we send you. When you receive an Explan ation of Benefits (an EOB) in the mail, please look it over to be sure the information is complete and correct. If you think something is missing from the report, or you have any questions, please call us at Member Services (phone numbers are printed on th e back cover of this booklet). Be sure to keep these reports. They are an important record of your drug expenses. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 109 SECTION 4 There is no deductible for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Section 4.1 You do not pay a deductible for Your Part D drugs There is no deductible for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) . You begin in the Initial Coverage Stage when you fill your first prescription of the year. See Section 5 for information about your coverage in the Initial Coverage Stage. SECTION 5 During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share of your drug costs and you pay your share Section 5.1 What you pay for a drug depends on the drug and where you fill your prescription During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays it s share of the cost of your covered prescription drugs, and you pay your share (your copayment or coinsurance amount ). Your share of the cost will vary depending on the drug and where you fill your prescription. The plan has five cost-sharing tiers Every drug on the plan's Drug List is in one of five cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher the cost-sharing tier number, the higher your cost for the drug: Cost-sharin g tier 1 includes Preferred Generic Drugs. This is the lowest cost sharing tier. Cost-sharing tier 2 includes Non-preferred Generic Drugs. Cost-sharing tier 3 includes Preferred Brand Drugs. Cost-sharing tier 4 includes Non -Preferred Brand Drugs. Cost-sharing tier 5 includes specialty drugs, and has 33% coinsurance . Generally, this is the highest cost sharing tier. To find out which cost -sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in the plan's Drug List. Your pharmacy choices How much you pay for a drug depends on whether you get the drug from: A retail pharmacy that is in our plan's network A pharmacy that is not in the plan's network The plan's mail -order pharmacy 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 110 For more information about these pharmacy choices and filling your prescriptions, see Chapter 5 in this booklet and the plan's Provider Directory. Section 5.2 A table that shows your costs for a one-month supply of a drug During the Initial Coverage Stage, your share of the cost of a covered drug will be either a copayment or coinsurance. \"Copayment\" means that you pay a fixed amount each time you fill a prescri ption. \"Coinsurance\" means that you pay a percent of the total cost of the drug each time you fill a prescription. As shown in the table below, the amount of the copayment or coinsurance depends on which cost-sharing tier your drug is in. Please note: If your covered drug costs less than the copayment amount listed in the chart, you will pay that lower price for the drug. You pay either the full price of the drug or the copayment amount, whichever is lower . We cover prescriptions filled at out -of-netwo rk pharmacies in only limited situations. Please see Chapter 5, Section 3.5 for information about when we will cover a prescription filled at an out -of-network pharmacy. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 111 Your share of the cost when you get a one-month supply (or less) of a cover ed Part D prescription drug from: Network pharmacy (up to a 34-day supply) Network long -term care pharmacy (up to a 34-day supply) Out-of-network pharmacy (Coverage is limited to certain situations; see Chapter 5 for details.) (up to a 34-day supply) Cost -Sharing Tier 1 (Preferred coinsurance 33% coinsurance Section 5.3 A table that shows your costs for a long -term (90-day) supply of a drug For some drugs, you can get a long -term supply (also called an \"extended supply\") when you fill your prescription. A long -term supply is a 90-day supply. (For details on where and how to get a long-term supply of a drug, see Chapter 5.) The table below sh ows what you pay when you get a long -term (90-day) supply of a drug. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 112 Please note: If your covered drug costs less than the copayment amount listed in the chart, you will pay that lower price for the drug. You pay either the full price of the drug or the co payment amount, whichever is lower . Your share of the cost when you get a long -term (90-day) supply of a covered Part D prescription drug from: Network pharmacy (90-day supply) The plan's mail -order service (90-day supply) Cost Tier Generic Drugs) $9 copay $9 copay copay $21 $117 copay copay $207 copay Cost -Sharing Tier 5 (Specialty Drugs) A long -term supply is not available for drugs in Tier 5 A long -term supply is not available for drugs in Tier 5 Section 5.4 You stay in the Initial Coverage Stage until your total drug costs for the year reach $ 2,970 You stay in the Initial Coverage Stage until the total amount for the prescription drugs you have filled and refilled reaches the $2,970 limit for the Initial Coverage Stage . Your total drug cost is based on adding together what you have paid and what any Part D plan has paid: What you have paid for all the covered drugs you have gotten since you started with your first drug purchase of the year. (See Section 6.2 for more information about how Medicare calculates your out -of-pocket costs.) This includes : o The total you paid as your share of the cost for your drugs during the Initial Coverage Stage. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 113 What the plan has paid as its share of the cost for your drugs during the Initial Coverage Stage. (If you were enrolled in a different Part D plan at any time during 2013 , the amount that plan paid during the Initial Coverage Stage also counts toward your total drug costs.) The Explanation of Benefits (EOB) that we send to you will help you keep track of how much you and the plan have spent for your drugs during the year. Many people do not reach the $2,970 limit in a year. We will let you know if you reach this $2,970 amount. If you do reach this amount, you will leave the Initial Coverage Stage and move on to the Coverage Gap Stage. SECTION 6 During the Cover age Gap Stage, the plan provides some drug coverage Section 6.1 You stay in the Coverage Gap Stage until your out -of-pocket costs reach $ 4,750 When you are in the Covera ge Gap Stage, preferred generic drugs in cost-sharing tier 1 are covered the same way as they are in the Initial Coverage Stage. You pay a $3 copayment for preferred generic drugs. The Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program provides manufacturer discounts on brand name drugs when you are in the Coverage Gap Stage. You pay 47.5% of the negotiated price (excluding the dispensing fee and vaccine administration fee, if any) for brand name drugs . Both the amount you pay and the amount discounted by the manufacturer count toward your out -of- pocket costs as if you had paid them and moves you through the coverage gap. You also receive some coverage for non-preferred generic drugs. You pay no more than 79% of the cost for generic drugs and the plan pays the rest. For generic drugs, the amount paid by the plan ( 21%) does not count toward your out -of-pocket costs. Only the amount you pay counts and moves you through the coverage gap. You continue paying the discounted price for brand name drugs and no more than 79% of the costs of generic drugs until your yearly out -of-pocket payments reach a maximum amount that Medicare has set. In 2013 , that amount is $ 4,750. Medicare has rules about what counts and what does not count as your out -of-pocket costs. When you reach an out -of-pocket limit of $4,750 , you leave the Coverage Gap Stage and move on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 114 Section 6.2 How Medicare calculates your out -of-pocket costs for prescription drugs Here are Medicare's rules that we must follow when we keep track of your out -of-pocket costs for your drugs. These payments are included in your out -of-pocket costs When you add up your out -of-pocket costs, you can include the payments listed below (as long as they are for Part D covered drugs and you followed the ru les for drug coverage that are explained in Chapter 5 of this booklet): The amount you pay for drugs when you are in any of the following drug payment stages: o The Initial Coverage Stage. o The Coverage Gap Stage. Any payments you made during this calendar year as a member of a different Medicare prescription drug plan before you joined our plan. It matters who pays: If you make these payments yourself , they are included in your out -of-pocket costs. These payments are also included if they are made on your behalf by certain other individuals or organizations. This includes payments for your drugs made by a friend or relative, by most charities, by AIDS drug assistance programs, by a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program that is qu alified by Medicare, or by the Indian Health Service. Payments made by Medicare's \"Extra Help\" Program are also included. Some of the payments made by the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program are included. The amount the manufacturer pays for your brand name drugs is included. But the amount the plan pays for your generic drugs is not included. Moving on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage: When you (or those paying on your behalf) have spent a total of $ 4,750 in out -of-pocket costs within the calendar year, you will move from the Coverage Gap Stage to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 115 These payments are not included in your out -of-pocket costs When you add up your out -of-pocket costs , you are not allowed to include any of these types of payments for prescription drugs: Drugs you buy outside the United States and its territories. Drugs that are not covered by our plan. Drugs you get at an out -of-network pharmacy that do not meet the plan's requirements for out -of-network coverage. Non-Part D drugs, including prescription drugs covered by Part A or Part B and other drugs excluded from coverage by Medicare. Payments you make toward prescription drugs not normally covered in a Medicare Prescrip tion Drug Plan. Payments made by the plan for your generic drugs while in the Coverage Gap. Payments for your drugs that are made by group health plans including employer health plans. Payments for your drugs that are made by certain insurance plans and government - funded health programs such as TRICARE and the Veteran's Administration. Payments for your drugs made by a third -party with a legal obligation to pay for prescription costs (for example, Worker's Compensation). Reminder: If any other organizatio n such as the ones listed above pays part or all of your out-of-pocket costs for drugs, you are required to tell our plan. Call Member Services to let us know (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). How can you keep track of your out-of-pocket total? We will help you . The Explanation of Benefits (EOB) report we send to you includes the current amount of your out -of-pocket costs (Section 3 in this chapter tells about this report). When you reach a total of $ 4,750 in out -of-pocket costs for the year, this report will tell you that you have left the Coverage Gap Stage and have moved on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. Make sure we have the information we need . Section 3 .2 tells what you can do to help make sure t hat our records of what you have spent are complete and up to date. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 116 SECTION 7 During the Catastrophic Coverage Stage, the plan pays most of the cost for your drugs Section 7.1 Once you are in the Catastrophic Coverage Stage, you will stay in this stage for the rest of the year You qualify for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage when your out -of-pocket costs have reached the $4,750 limit for the calendar year. Once you are in the Catastrophic Coverage Stage, you will stay in this payment stage until the end of t he calendar year. During this stage, the plan will pay most of the cost for your drugs. Your share of the cost for a covered drug will be either coinsurance or a copayment, whichever is the larger amount: o -either - coinsurance of 5% of the cost of the dru g o -or - $2.65 copayment for a generic drug or a drug that is treated like a generic. Or a $ 6.60 copayment for all other drugs. Our plan pays the rest of the cost. SECTION 8 What you pay for vaccinations covered by Part D depends on how and where you get them Section 8.1 Our plan has separate coverage for the Part D vaccine medication itself and for the cost of giving you the vaccination shot Our plan provides coverage of a number of Part D vaccines. We also cover vaccines that are considered medical bene fits. You can find out about coverage of these vaccines by going to the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, Section 2.1. There are two parts to our coverage of Part D vaccinations: The first part of coverage is the cost of the vaccine medication itself . The vaccine is a prescription medication. The second part of coverage is for the cost of giving you the vaccination shot . (This is sometimes called the \"administration\" of the vaccine.) What do you pay for a Part D vaccination? What you pay for a Part D vaccination depends on three things: 1. The type of vaccine (what you are being vaccinated for). 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 117 o Some vaccines are considered medical benefits. You can find out about your coverage of these vaccines by going to Chapter 4, Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay). o Other vaccines are considered Part D drugs. You can find these vaccines listed in the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) . 2. Where you get the vaccine medication. 3. Who gives you the vaccination shot. What you pay at the time you get the Part D vaccination can vary depending on the circumstances. For example: Sometimes when you get your vaccination shot, you will have to pay the entire cost for both the vaccine medication and for getting the vaccinatio n shot. You can ask our plan to pay you back for our share of the cost. Other times, when you get the vaccine medication or the vaccination shot, you will pay only your share of the cost. To show how this works, here are three common ways you might get a Part D vaccination shot. Remember you are responsible for all of the costs associated with vaccines (including their administration) during the Coverage Gap Stage of your benefit. Situation 1: You buy the Part D vaccine at the pharmacy and you get your v accination shot at the network pharmacy. (Whether you have this choice depends on where you live. Some states do not allow pharmacies to administer a vaccination.) You will have to pay the pharmacy the amount of your coinsurance or copayment for the vaccin e itself. Our plan will pay for the cost of giving you the vaccination shot. Situation 2: You get the Part D vaccination at your doctor's office. When you get the vaccination, you will pay for the entire cost of the vaccine and its administration. You can then ask our plan to pay our share of the cost by using the procedures that are described in Chapter 7 of this booklet ( Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs ). You will be reimbursed the amount you paid less your normal coinsurance or copayment for the vaccine (including administration) less any difference between the amount the doctor charges and what we normally pay. (If you get Extra Help, we will reimburse yo u for this difference.) 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 118 Situation 3: You buy the Part D vaccine at your pharmacy, and then take it to your doctor's office where they give you the vaccination shot. You will have to pay the pharmacy the amount of your coinsurance or copayment for the vaccine itself. When your doctor gives you the vaccination shot, you will pay the entire cost for this service. You can then ask our plan to pay our share of the cost by using the procedures described in Chapter 7 of this booklet. You w ill be reimbursed the amount charged by the doctor for administering the vaccine less any difference between the amount the doctor charges and what we normally pay. (If you get Extra Help, we will reimburse you for this difference.) Section 8.2 You may wan t to call us at Member Services before you get a vaccination The rules for coverage of vaccinations are complicated. We are here to help. We recommend that you call us first at Member Services whenever you are planning to get a vaccination . (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet .) We can tell you about how your vaccination is covered by our plan and explain your share of the cost. We can tell you how to keep your own cost down by using providers and pharmacies in our network. If you are not able to use a network provider and pharmacy, we can tell you what you need to do to get payment from us for our share of the cost. SECTION 9 Do you have to pay the Part D \"late enrollment penalty\"? Section 9.1 What is the Part D \" late enrollment penalty\"? Note: If you receive \"Extra Help\" from Medicare to pay for your prescription drugs, the late enrollment penalty rules do not apply to you. You will not pay a late enrollment penalty, even if you go without \"creditable\" prescription drug coverage. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 119 You may pay a financial penalty if you did not enroll in a plan offering Medicare Part D drug coverage when you first became eligible for this drug coverage or you experienced a continuous period of 63 days or more when you didn't have creditable prescription drug cover age. (\"Creditable prescription drug coverage\" is coverage that meets Medicare's minimum standards since it is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug coverage.) The amount of the penalty depends on how long y ou waited to enroll in a creditable prescription drug coverage plan any time after the end of your initial enrollment period or how many full calendar months you went without creditable prescription drug coverage. You will have to pay this penalty for as l ong as you have Part D coverage. When you first enroll in Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) , we let you know the amount of the penalty. Your late enrollment penalty is considered your plan premium. If you do not pay your late enrollment pe nalty, you could be disenrolled from the plan. Section 9.2 How much is the Part D late enrollment penalty? Medicare determines the amount of the penalty. Here is how it works: First count the number of full months that you delayed enrolling in a Medicare d rug plan, after you were eligible to enroll. Or count the number of full months in which you did not have creditable prescription drug coverage, if the break in coverage was 63 days or more. The penalty is 1% for every month that you didn't have creditable coverage. For example, if you go 14 months without coverage, the penalty will be 14%. Then Medicare determines the amount of the average monthly premium for Medicare drug plans in the nation from the previous year. For 2013 , this average premium amount is $31.17 . This amount may change for 2014. To get your monthly penalty, you multiply the penalty percentage and the average monthly premium and then round it to the nearest 10 cents. In the example here it would be 14% times $ 31.17. This equals $ 4.36, which rounds to $ 4.40. This amount would be added to the monthly premium for someone with a late enrollment penalty . There are three important things to note about this monthly late enrollment penalty: First, the penalty may change each year , because the average monthly premium can change each year. If the national average premium (as determined by Medicare) increases, your penalty will increase. Second, you will continue to pay a penalty every month for as long as you are enrolled in a plan that has Medic are Part D drug benefits. Third, if you are under 65 and currently receiving Medicare benefits, the late enrollment penalty will reset when you turn 65. After age 65, your late enrollment penalty will be based only on the months that you don't have coverag e after your initial enrollment period for aging into Medicare. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 120 Section 9.3 In some situations, you can enroll late and not have to pay the penalty Even if you have delayed enrolling in a plan offering Medicare Part D coverage when you were first eligible, sometimes you do not have to pay the late enrollment penalty. You will not have to pay a penalty for late enrollment if you are in any of these situations: If you already have prescription drug coverage that is expected to pay, on average, at least as muc h as Medicare's standard prescription drug coverage . Medicare calls this \"creditable drug coverage .\" Please note : o Creditable coverage could include drug coverage from a former employer or union, TRICARE, or the Department of Veterans Affairs. Your insurer or your human resources department will tell you each year if your drug coverage is creditable coverage. This information may be sent to you in a letter or included in a newsletter from the plan. Keep this information, because you may need it if you join a Medicare drug plan later. Please note: If you receive a \"certificate of creditable coverage\" when your health coverage ends, it may not mean your prescription drug coverage was creditable. The notice must state that you had \"creditable\" prescription drug coverage that expected to pay as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug plan pays. o The following are not creditable prescription drug coverage: p rescription drug discount cards, free clinics, and drug discount websites. o For additional information a bout creditable coverage, please look in your Medicare & You 2013 Handbook or call Medicare at 1 -800-MEDICARE (1 -800- 633-4227). TTY users call 1 -877-486-2048. You can call these numbers for free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you were without creditable coverage, but you were without it for less than 63 days in a row. If you are receiving \"Extra Help\" from Medicare. Section 9.4 What can you do if you disagree about your late enrollment penalty? If you disagree about your late enrollment penalty, you or your representative can ask for a review of the decision about your late enrollment penalty. Generally, you must request this review within 60 days from the date on the letter you receive stating you have to pay a late enrollment penalty. Call Member Services to find out more about how to do this (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) . 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 121 Important: Do not stop paying your late enrollment penalty while you're waiting for a review of the decision about your late enrollment penalty. If you do, you could be disenrolled for failure to pay your plan premiums. SECTION 1 0 Do you have to pay an extra Part D amount because of your income? Section 1 0.1 Who pays an extra Part D amount because of i ncome? Most people pay a standard monthly Part D premium. However, some people pay an extra amount because of their yearly income. If your income is $85,000 or above for an individual (or married individuals filing separately) or $170,000 or above for marr ied couples, you must pay an extra amount directly to the government for your Medicare Part D coverage. If you have to pay an extra amount, Social Security, not your Medicare plan, will send you a letter telling you what that extra amount will be and how to pay it . The extra amount will be withheld from your Social Security, Railroad Retirement Board, or Office of Personnel Management benefit check , no matter how you usually pay your plan premium , unless your monthly benefit isn't enough to cover the extr a amount owed . If your benefit check isn't enough to cover the extra amount , you will get a bill from Medicare . The extra amount must be paid separately and cannot be paid with your monthly plan premium. Section 1 0.2 How much is the extra Part D amount? If your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) as reported on your IRS tax return is above a certain amount, you will pay an extra amount in addition to your monthly plan premium . The chart below shows the extra amount based on your income. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 122 If you filed a n individual tax return and your income in 201 1 was: If you were married but filed a separate tax return and your income in 2011 was: If you filed a joint tax return and your income in 201 1 was: This is the monthly cost of your extra Part D amount (to be paid in addition to your plan premium) Equal to or less than $85,000 Equal to or less than $85,000 Equal to or less than $170,000 $0 Greater than $85,000 and less than or equal to $107,000 Greater than $170,000 and less than or equal to $214,000 $11.60 Greater than $107,000 and less than or equal to $160,000 Greater than $214,000 and less than or equal to $320,000 $29.90 Greater than $160,000 and less than or equal to $214,000 Greater than $85,000 and less than or equal to $129,000 Greater than $320,000 and less than or equal to $428,000 $48.30 Greater than $214,000 Greater than $129,000 Greater than $428,000 $66.60 Section 1 0.3 What can you do if you disagree about paying an extra Part D amount? If you disagree about paying an extra amount because of your income, you can ask Social Security to review the decision. To find out more about how to do this, contact Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1 -800-325-0778). Section 1 0.4 What happens if you do not pay the extra Part D amount? The extra amount is paid directly to the government (not your Medicare plan) for your Medicare Part D coverage. If you are required to pay the extra amount and you do not pay it, you will be disenrolled from the plan and lose prescription drug coverage .2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 7: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered med ical services or drugs 123 Chapter 7. Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs SECTION 1 Situations in which you should ask us to pay our share of the cost of your covered services or drugs ................................ .......... 124 Section 1.1 If you pay our plan's share of the cost of your covered services or drugs, or if you receive a bill, you can ask us for payment ........................... 124 SECTION 2 How to ask us to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received ................................ ................................ ............................. 126 Section 2.1 How and where to send us your request for payment ................................ ......126 SECTION 3 We will consider your request for payment and say yes or no ...... 127 Section 3.1 We check to see whether we should cover the service or drug and how much we owe ................................ ................................ ................................ .127 Section 3.2 If we tell you that we will not pay for all or part of the medical care or drug, you can make an appeal ................................ ................................ ........ 128 SECTION 4 Other situations in which you should save your receipts and send copies to us ................................ ................................ .............. 128 Section 4.1 In some cases, you should send copies of your receipts to us to help us track your out -of-pocket drug costs ................................ ............................... 128 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 7: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered med ical services or drugs 124 SECTION 1 Situations in which you shoul d ask us to pay our share of the cost of your covered services or drugs Section 1.1 If you pay our plan's share of the cost of your covered services or drugs, or if you receive a bill, you can ask us for payment Sometimes when you get medical care or a pre scription drug, you may need to pay the full cost right away. Other times, you may find that you have paid more than you expected under the coverage rules of the plan. In either case, you can ask our plan to pay you back (paying you back is often called \"r eimbursing\" you). It is your right to be paid back by our plan whenever you've paid more than your share of the cost for medical services or drugs that are covered by our plan. There may also be times when you get a bill from a provider for the full cost of medical care you have received. In many cases, you should send this bill to us instead of paying it. We will look at the bill and decide whether the services should be covered. If we decide they should be covered, we will pay the provider directly. Here are examples of situations in which you may need to ask our plan to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received. 1. When you've received emergency or urgently needed medical care from a provider who is not in our plan's network You can receive emergency services from any provider, whether or not the provider is a part of our network. When you receive emergency or urgently needed care from a provider who is not part of our network, you are only responsible for paying your share of the cost, not for the entire cost. You should ask the provider to bill the plan for our share of the cost. If you pay the entire amount yourself at the time you receive the care, you need to ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. Send us the b ill, along with documentation of any payments you have made. At times you may get a bill from the provider asking for payment that you think you do not owe. Send us this bill, along with documentation of any payments you have already made. o If the provider is owed anything, we will pay the provider directly. o If you have already paid more than your share of the cost of the service, we will determine how much you owed and pay you back for our share of the cost. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 7: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered med ical services or drugs 125 2. When a network provider sends you a bill you think you should not pay Network providers should always bill the plan directly, and ask you only for your share of the cost. But sometimes they make mistakes, and ask you to pay more than your share. You only have to pay your cost -sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow providers to add additional separate charges, called \"balance billing.\" This protection (that you never pay more than your cost -sharing amount) applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. For more information about \"balance billing,\" go to Chapter 4, Section 1. 3. Whenever you get a bill from a network provider that you think is more than you should pay, send us the bill. We will contact the provider directly and resolve the billing problem. If you have already paid a bill to a network provider, but you feel that you paid too much, send us the b ill along with documentation of any payment you have made and ask us to pay you back the difference between the amount you paid and the amount you owed under the plan. 3. If you are retroactively enrolled in our plan. Sometimes a person's enrollment in th e plan is retroactive. (Retroactive means that the first day of their enrollment has already passed . The enrollment date may even have occurred last year.) If you were retroactively enrolled in our plan and you paid out -of-pocket for any of your covered s ervices or drugs after your enrollment date, you can ask us to pay you back for our share of the costs. You will need to submit paperwork for us to handle the reimbursement. Please call Member Services for additional information about how to ask us to pay you back and deadlines for making your request. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) 4. When you use an out -of-network pharmacy to get a prescription filled If you go to an out -of-network pharmacy and try to use your membership card to fill a prescription, the pharmacy may not be able to submit the claim directly to us. When that happens, you will have to pay the full cost of your prescription. (We cover presc riptions filled at out -of-network pharmacies only in a few special situations. Please go to Chapter 5, Sec. 3.5 to learn more.) Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 7: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered med ical services or drugs 126 5. When you pay the full cost for a prescription because you don't have your plan membership card with you If you do not have your plan membership card with you, you can ask the pharmacy to call the plan or to look up your plan enrollment information. However, if the pharmacy cannot g et the enrollment information they need right away, you may need to pay the full cost of the prescription yourself. Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. 6. When you pay the full cost for a presc ription in other situations You may pay the full cost of the prescription because you find that the drug is not covered for some reason. For example, the drug may not be on the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) ; or it could have a requirement or r estriction that you didn't know about or don't think should apply to you. If you decide to get the drug immediately, you may need to pay the full cost for it. Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back. In some situations, we may need to get more information from your doctor in order to pay you back for our share of the cost. All of the examples above are types of coverage decisions. This means that if we deny your request for payment, you can appeal our decision. Chapter 9 of this booklet ( What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) ) has information about how to make an appeal. SECTION 2 How to ask us to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received Section 2.1 How and where to send us your request for payment Send us your request for payment, along with your bill and documentation of any payment you have made. It's a good idea to make a copy of your bill and receipts for your records. To make sure you are giving us all the informati on we need to make a decision, you can fill out our claim form to make your request for payment. You don't have to use the form, but it will help us process the information faster. Either download a copy of the form from our website (www.MeridianGeisinger Gold.com ) or call Member Services and ask for the form. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet. ) 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 7: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered med ical services or drugs 127 Mail your request for payment together with any bills or receipts to us at this address: Medical Care Reimbursement Requests: Geisinger Gold P.O. Reimbursement Requests: Geisinger Gold Attn: Pharmacy Department 100 N. Academy Avenue Danville, PA 17822 -3246 You must submit your claim to us within three (3) year s of the date you received the service, item, or drug. Contact Member Services if you have any questions (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) . If you don't know what you should have paid , or you receive bills and you don't know what to do about those bills, we can help. You can also call if you want to give us more information about a request for payment you have already sent to us. SECTION 3 We will consider your request for payment and say yes or no Section 3.1 We check to see whet her we should cover the service or drug and how much we owe When we receive your request for payment, we will let you know if we need any additional information from you. Otherwise, we will consider your request and make a coverage decision. If we decide that the medical care or drug is covered and you followed all the rules for getting the care or drug, we will pay for our share of the cost. If you have already paid for the service or drug, we will mail your reimbursement of our share of the cost to you. If you have not paid for the service or drug yet, we will mail the payment directly to the provider. (Chapter 3 explains the rules you need to follow for getting your medical services covered . Chapter 5 explains the rules you need to follow for getting you r Part D prescription drugs covered .) If we decide that the medical care or drug is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will not pay for our share of the cost. Instead, we will send you a letter that explains the reasons why we are not se nding the payment you have requested and your rights to appeal that decision. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 7: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered med ical services or drugs 128 Section 3.2 If we tell you that we will not pay for all or part of the medical care or drug, you can make an appeal If you think we have made a mistake in turning down your reque st for payment or you don't agree with the amount we are paying, you can make an appeal. If you make an appeal, it means you are asking us to change the decision we made when we turned down your request for payment. For the details on how to make this appe al, go to Chapter 9 of this booklet ( What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) ). The appeals process is a formal process with detailed procedures and important deadlines. If making an appeal is new to you, you will find it helpful to start by reading Section 4 of Chapter 9. Section 4 is an introductory section that explains the process for coverage decisions and appeals and gives definitions of terms such as \"appeal.\" Then after you have read Section 4, you can go to the section in Chapter 9 that tells what to do for your situation: If you want to make an appeal about getting paid back for a medical service, go to Section 5. 3 in Chapter 9. If you want to make an appeal about getting paid back for a drug, go to Section 6. 5 of Chapter 9. SECTION 4 Other situations in which you should save your receipts and send copies to us Section 4.1 In some cases, you should send copies of your receipts to us to help us track your out -of-pocket drug costs There are some situat ions when you should let us know about payments you have made for your drugs. In these cases, you are not asking us for payment. Instead, you are telling us about your payments so that we can calculate your out -of-pocket costs correctly. This may help you to qualify for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage more quickly. Here are two situations when you should send us copies of receipts to let us know about payments you have made for your drugs: 1. When you buy the drug for a price that is lower than our price Sometimes when you are in the Coverage Gap Stage you can buy your drug at a network pharmacy for a price that is lower than our price. For example, a pharmacy might offer a special price on the drug. Or you may have a discount card that is outside our benefit that offers a lower price. Unless special conditions apply, you must use a network pharmacy in these situations and your drug must be on our Drug List. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 7: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered med ical services or drugs 129 Save your receipt and send a copy to us so that we can have your out -of-pocket expenses count t oward qualifying you for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. Please note: If you are in the Coverage Gap Stage, we may not pay for any share of these drug costs. But sending a copy of the receipt allows us to calculate your out -of- pocket costs correctly and m ay help you qualify for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage more quickly. 2. When you get a drug through a patient assistance program offered by a drug manufacturer Some members are enrolled in a patient assistance program offered by a drug manufacturer that is outside the plan benefits. If you get any drugs through a program offered by a drug manufacturer, you may pay a copayment to the patient assistance program. Save your receipt and send a copy to us so that we can have your out -of-pocket expenses count t oward qualifying you for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. Please note: Because you are getting your drug through the patient assistance program and not through the plan's benefits, we will not pay for any share of these drug costs. But sending a copy of the receipt allows us to calculate your out -of-pocket costs correctly and may help you qualify for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage more quickly. Since you are not asking for payment in the two cases described above, these situations are not considered coverage decisions. Therefore, you cannot make an appeal if you disagree with our decision. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 8: Your rights and responsibilities 130 Chapter 8.

For other types of problems , you need to use the process for making complaints . Both of these processes have been approved by Medicare. To ensure fairness and prompt handling of your problems, each process has a set of rules, procedures, and deadlines that must be followed by us and by you. Which one do you use? That depends on the type of problem you are having. The guide in Section 3 will help you identify the right process to use. Section 1.2 What about the legal terms? There are technical legal terms for some of the rules, proced ures, and types of deadlines explained in this chapter. Many of these terms are unfamiliar to most people and can be hard to understand. To keep things simple, this chapter explains the legal rules and procedures using simpler words in place of certain le gal terms. For example, this chapter generally says \"making a complaint\" rather than \"filing Organization\" \"Independe nt Review Entity.\" It also uses abbreviations as little as possible. However, it can be helpful - and sometimes quite important - for you to know the correct legal terms for the situation you are in. Knowing which terms to use will help you communicate mo re clearly and accurately when you are dealing with your problem and get the right help or information for your situation. To help you know which terms to use, we include legal terms when we give the details for handling specific types of situations. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 144 SECTI ON 2 You can get help from government organizations that are not connected with us Section 2.1 Where to get more information and personalized assistance Sometimes it can be confusing to start or follow through the process for dealing with a problem.

Section 3.1 Should you use the process for coverage decisions and appeals? Or should you use the process for making complaints? If you have a problem or concern, you only need to read the parts of this chapter that apply to your situation. The guide that follows will help. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 145 To figure out which part of this chapter will help with your specific problem or concern, START HERE Is your problem or concern about your benefits or coverage? (This includes problems about whether particular medical care or prescription drugs are covered or not, the way in which they are covered, and problems related to payment for medical care or prescription drugs.) Yes. My problem is about benefits or co verage. Go on to the next section of this chapter, Section 4, \"A guide to the basics of coverage decisions and making appeals .\" No. My problem is not about benefits or coverage. Skip ahead to Section 10 at the end of this chapter: \"How to make a complaint about quality of care, waiting times, customer service or other concerns.\" 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 146 COVERAGE DECISIONS AND APPEALS SECTION 4 A guide to the basics of coverage decisions and appeals Section 4.1 Asking for coverage decisions and makin g appeals: the big picture The process for coverage decisions and making appeals deals with problems related to your benefits and coverage for medical services and prescription drugs, including problems related to payment. This is the process you use for i ssues such as whether something is covered or not and the way in which something is covered. Asking for coverage decisions A coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount we will pay for your medical services or drugs. For example, your plan network doctor makes a (favorable) coverage decision for you whenever you receive medical care from him or her or if your network doctor refers you to a medical specialist . You or your doctor can also contact us and ask for a coverage decision if your doctor is unsure whether we will cover a particular medical service or refuses to provide medi cal care you think that you need. In other words, if you want to know if we will cover a medical service before you receive it, you can ask us to make a coverage decision for you. We are making a coverage decision for you whenever we decide what is covered for you and how much we pay. In some cases we might decide a service or drug is not covered or is no longer covered by Medicare for you. If you disagree with this coverage decision, you can make an appeal. Making an appeal If we make a coverage decision and you are not satisfied with this decision, you can \"appeal\" the decision. An appeal is a formal way of asking us to review and change a coverage decision we have made. When you make an appeal, we review the coverage decision we have made to check to see if we were following all of the rules properly. Your appeal is handled by different reviewers than those who made the original unfavorable decision. When we have completed the review we give you our decision . 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 147 If we say no to all or part of your Level 1 Ap peal, you can go on to a Level 2 Appeal. The Level 2 Appeal is conducted by an independent organization that is not connected to us. (In some situations, your case will be automatically sent to the independent organization for a Level 2 Appeal. If this hap pens, we will let you know. In other situations, you will need to ask for a Level 2 Appeal.) If you are not satisfied with the decision at the Level 2 Appeal, you may be able to continue through several more levels of appeal. Section 4.2 How to get help w hen you are asking for a coverage decision or making an appeal Would you like some help? Here are resources you may wish to use if you decide to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision: You can call us at Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet ). To get free help from an independent organization that is not connected with our plan, contact your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (see Section 2 of this chapter). Your doctor can make a request fo r you. o For Part D prescription drugs, your doctor or other prescriber can request a coverage determination or a Level 1 or 2 appeal on your behalf. To request any appeal after Level 2, your doctor or other prescriber must be appointed as your representati ve. o For medical care, a doctor can make a request for you. Your doctor can request a coverage decision or a Level 1 appeal on your behalf. If your appeal is denied at Level 1, it will be automatically forwarded to Level 2. To request any appeal after Level 2, your doctor must be appointed as your representative. You can ask someone to act on your behalf. If you want to, you can name another person to act for you as your \"representative\" to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal. o There may be someone who is already legally authorized to act as your representative under State law. o If you want a friend, relative, your doctor or other provider, or other person to be your representative, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) and ask for the \"Appointment of Representative\" form . (The form is also available on Medicare's website at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/cmsforms/downloads/cms1696.pdf or on our website at www.MeridianGeisingerGold.com .) The form gives that person permission to act on your behalf. It must be signed by you and by the person who you would like to act on your behalf. You must give us a copy of the signed form. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 148 You also have the right to hire a lawyer to act for you. You may contact your own lawyer, or get the name of a lawyer from your local bar association or other referral service. There are also groups that will give you free legal services if you qualify. However, you are not required to hire a lawyer to ask for any kind of coverage decisio n or appeal a decision. Section 4.3 Which section of this chapter gives the details for your situation? There are four different types of situations that involve coverage decisions and appeals. Since each situation has different rules and deadlines, we giv e the details for each one in a separate section: Section 5 of this chapter: \"Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal\" Section 6 of this chapter: \"Your Part D prescription drugs: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal\" Section 7 of this chapter: \"How to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think the doctor is discharging you too soon\" Section 8 of this chapter: \"How to ask us to keep covering certain medical services if you think your coverage is ending too soon\" ( Applies to these services only : home health care, skilled nursing facility care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services) If you're not sure which section you should be using, p lease call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet ). You can also get help or information from government organizations such as your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (Chapter 2, Section 3, of this booklet has t he phone numbers for this program). SECTION 5 Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal ? Have you read Section 4 of this chapter ( A guide to \"the basics\" of coverage decisions and appeals )? If not, you may want to read it before you start this section. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 149 Section 5.1 This section tells what to do if you have problems getting coverage for medical care or if you want us to pay you back for our share of the cost of your care This section is about your benefits for medical care and services. These benefits are described in Chapter 4 of this booklet: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay ). To keep things simple, we generally refer to \"medical care coverage\" or \"medical care\" in th e rest of this section, instead of repeating \"medical care or treatment or services\" every time. This section tells what you can do if you are in any of the five following situations: 1. You are not getting certain medical care you want, and you believe th at this care is covered by our plan. 2. Our plan will not approve the medical care your doctor or other medical provider wants to give you, and you believe that this care is covered by the plan. 3. You have received medical care or services that you believe should be covered by the plan, but we have said we will not pay for this care. 4. You have received and paid for medical care or services that you believe should be covered by the plan, and you want to ask our plan to reimburse you for this care. 5. You are being told that coverage for certain medical care you have been getting that we previously approved will be reduced or stopped, and you believe that reducing or stopping this care could harm your health. NOTE: If the coverage that will be stopp ed is for hospital care, home health care, skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services , you need to read a separate section of this chapter because special rules apply to these types of care. Here's wh at to read in those situations: o Chapter 9, Section 7: How to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think the doctor is discharging you too soon . o Chapter 9, Section 8: How to ask us to keep covering certain medical services if you think y our coverage is ending too soon. This section is about three services only: home health care, skilled nursing facility care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services. For all other situations that involve being told that medical care you have been getting will be stopped, use this section (Section 5) as your guide for what to do. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 150 Which of these situations are you in? If you are in this situation: This is what you can do: Do you want to find out whether we will cover the medical care or services you want? You can ask us to make a coverage decision for you. Go to the next section of this chapter, Section 5.2 . Have we already told you that we will not cover or pay for a medical service in the way that you want it to be covered or paid for? You can make an appeal . (This means you are asking us to reconsider.) Skip ahead to Section 5.3 of this chapter. Do you want to ask us to pay you back for medical care or services you have already received and paid for? You can send us the bill. Skip ahead to Section 5.5 of this chapter. Section 5.2 Step -by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision (how to ask our plan to authorize or provide the medical care coverage you want) Legal Terms When a coverage decision involves your medical care, it is called an \"organization determination.\" Step 1: You ask our plan to make a coverage decision on the medical care you are requesting. If your health requires a quick response, you should ask us to make a \"fast coverage decision.\" Legal Terms A \"fast coverage decision\" is called an \"expedited determination.\" How to request coverage for the medical care you want Start by calling , writing, or faxing our plan to make your request for us to provide coverage for the medical care you want. You, your doctor, or your representative can do this. For the details on how to contact us, go to Chapter 2, Section 1 and look for the section called, How to contact us when you are asking for a coverage decision about your medical care . 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 151 Generally we use the standard deadlines for giving you our decision When we give you our decision, we will use the \"standard\" deadlines unless we have agreed to use the \"fast\" deadlines. A standard coverage decision means we will give you an answer within 14 days after we receive your request. However, we can take up to 14 more calendar days if you ask for more time, or if we need information (such as medical records from out -of-network providers ) that may benefit you. If we decide to take extra days to make the decision, we will tell you in writing. If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to take extra days. When you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint within 24 hours. (The process for making a complaint is differ ent from the process for coverage decisions and appeals. For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Section 10 of this chapter.) If your health requires it, ask us to give you a \"fast coverage decision\" A fast coverage decision means we will answer within 72 hours. o However, we can take up to 14 more calendar days if we find that some information that may benefit you is missing (such as medical records from out-of-network providers) , or if you need time to get information to us for the review. If we decide to take extra days, we will tell you in writing. o If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to take extra days. (For more information about the proces s for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Section 10 of this chapter.) We will call you as soon as we make the decision. To get a fast coverage decision, you must meet two requirements: o You can get a fast coverage decision only if you are as king for coverage for medical care you have not yet received . (You cannot get a fast coverage decision if your request is about payment for medical care you have already received. ) o You can get a fast coverage decision only if using the standard deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function. If your doctor tells us that your health requires a \"fast coverage decision,\" we will automatically agree to give you a fast coverage decision. If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor's support, we will decide whether your health requires that we give you a fast coverage decision. o If we decide that your medical condition does not meet the requirements for a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that says so (and we will use the standard deadlines instead). 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 152 o This letter will tell you that if your doctor asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give a fast coverage decision. o The letter will als o tell how you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to give you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested. (For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Sectio n 10 of this chapter.) Step 2: We consider your request for medical care coverage and give you our answer. Deadlines for a \"fast\" coverage decision Generally, for a fast coverage decision, we will give you our answer within 72 hours . o As explained above, w e can take up to 14 more calendar days under certain circumstances. If we decide to take extra days to make the coverage decision, we will tell you in writing. o If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decisio n to take extra days. When you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint within 24 hours. (For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Section 10 of this chapter.) o If we do not give you our answer within 72 hours (or if there is an extended time period, by the end of that period), you have the right to appeal. Section 5.3 below tells how to make an appeal. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the medical care coverage we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we received your request. If we extended the time needed to make our coverage decision, we will provide the coverage by the end of that extended period. If our answer is n o to part or all of what you requested, we will send you a detailed written explanation as to why we said no. Deadlines for a \"standard\" coverage decision Generally, for a standard coverage decision, we will give you our answer within 14 days of receiving your request. o We can take up to 14 more calendar days (\"an extended time period\") under certain circumstances. If we decide to take extra days to make the coverage decision, we will tell you in writing. o If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to take extra days. When you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint within 24 hours. (For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Section 10 of this chapter.) 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 153 o If we do not give you our answer within 14 days (or if there is an extended time period, by the end of that period), you have the right to appeal. Section 5.3 below tells how to make an appeal. If our answ er is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the coverage we have agreed to provide within 14 days after we received your request. If we extended the time needed to make our coverage decision, we will provide the coverage by the end of that extended period. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested , we will send you a written statement that explains why we said no. Step 3: If we say no to your request for coverage for medical care, you decide if you want to make an appeal. If we say no, you have the right to ask us to reconsider - and perhaps change - this decision by making an appeal. Making an appeal means making another try to get the medical care coverage you want. If you decide to make an appeal, it means you are going on to Level 1 of the appeals process (see Section 5.3 below). Section 5.3 Step -by-step: How to make a Level 1 Appeal (how to ask for a review of a med ical care coverage decision made by our plan) Legal Terms An appeal to the plan about a medical care coverage decision is called a plan \"reconsideration.\" Step 1: You contact us and make your appeal. If your health requires a quick response, you must ask for a \"fast appeal.\" What to do To start an appeal you, your doctor, or your representative, must contact us. For details on how to reach us for any purpose related to your appeal, go to Chapter 2, Sec tion 1 look for section called, How to contact us when you are making an appeal about your medical care. If you are asking for a standard appeal, make your standard appeal in writing by submitting a signed request. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 154 o If you have someone appealing our decisio n for you other than your doctor, your appeal must include an Appointment of Representative form authorizing this person to represent you. (To get the form, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) and ask for the \"Appointment of Representative\" form. It is also available on Medicare's website at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/cmsforms/downloads/cms1696.pdf or on our website at www.MeridianGeisingerGold.com .) While we can accept an appeal request without the form, we cannot complete our review until we receive it. If we do not receive the form within 44 days after receiving your appeal request (our deadline for making a decision on your appeal), your appeal request will be sent to the Independent Review Organization for dismissal. If you are asking for a fast appeal, make your appeal in writing or call us at the phone number shown in Chapter 2, Section 1 ( How to contact us when y ou are making an appeal about your medical care ). You must make your appeal request within 60 calendar days from the date on the written notice we sent to tell you our answer to your request for a coverage decision. If you miss this deadline and have a goo d reason for missing it, we may give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of good cause for missing the deadline may include if you had a serious illness that prevented you from contacting us or if we provided you with incorrect or incomplete inform ation about the deadline for requesting an appeal. You can ask for a copy of the information regarding your medical decision and add more information to support your appeal. o You have the right to ask us for a copy of the information regarding your appeal. o If you wish, you and your doctor may give us additional information to support your appeal. If your health requires it, ask for a \"fast appeal\" (you can make a request by calling us) Legal Terms A \"fast appeal\" is also called an \"expedited reconsideration.\" If you are appealing a decision we made about coverage for care you have not yet received, you and/or your doctor will need to decide if you need a \"fast appeal.\" The requirements and procedures for getting a \"fast appeal\" are the same as those for getting a \"fast coverage decision.\" To ask for a fast appeal, follow the instructions for asking for a fast coverage decision. (These instructions are given earlier in th is section.) If your doctor tells us that your health requires a \"fast appeal,\" we will give you a fast appeal. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 155 Step 2: We consider your appeal and we give you our answer. When our plan is reviewing your appeal, we take another careful look at all of the information about your request for coverage of medical care. We check to see if we were following all the rules when we said no to your request. We will gather more information if we need it. We may contact you or your doctor to get more information. Deadl ines for a \"fast\" appeal When we are using the fast deadlines, we must give you our answer within 72 hours after we receive your appeal . We will give you our answer sooner if your health requires us to do so. o However, if you ask for more time, or if we need to gather more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more calendar days. If we decide to take extra days to make the decision, we will tell you in writing. o If we do not give you an answer wi thin 72 hours (or by the end of the extended time period if we took extra days), we are required to automatically send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an independent organization. Later in this section, we te ll you about this organization and explain what happens at Level 2 of the appeals process. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the coverage we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we receive your appeal. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you a written denial notice informing you that we have automatically sent your appeal to the Independent Review Organization for a Level 2 Appeal. Deadlines for a \"standard\" appeal If we are using the standard deadlines, we must give you our answer within 30 calendar days after we receive your appeal if your appeal is about coverage for services you have not yet received. We will give you our decision sooner if your health cond ition requires us to. o However, if you ask for more time, or if we need to gather more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more calendar days. o If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decisi on to take extra days. When you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint within 24 hours. (For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Section 10 of this chapter.) 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 156 o If we do not giv e you an answer by the deadline above (or by the end of the extended time period if we took extra days), we are required to send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an independent outside organization. Later in t his section, we tell about this review organization and explain what happens at Level 2 of the appeals process. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the coverage we have agreed to provide within 30 days after we receive your appeal. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested , we will send you a written denial notice informing you that we have automatically sent your appeal to the Independent Review Organization for a Level 2 Appeal. Step 3: If our plan says no to part or all of your appeal, your case will automatically be sent on to the next level of the appeals process. To make sure we were following all the rules when we said no to your appeal, we are required to send your appeal to the \"I ndependent Review Organization.\" When we do this, it means that your appeal is going on to the next level of the appeals process, which is Level 2. Section 5.4 Step -by-step: How to make a Level 2 Appeal If we say no to your Level 1 Appeal, your case will automatically be sent on to the next level of the appeals process. During the Level 2 Appeal, the Independent Review Organization reviews the decision we made when we said no to your first appeal. This organization decides whether the decision we made shou ld be changed. Legal Terms The formal name for the \"Independent Review Organization\" is the \"Independent Review Entity.\" It is sometimes called the \"IRE.\" Step 1: The Independent Review Organization reviews your appeal. The Independent Review Organization is an independent organization that is hired by Medicare . This organization is not connected with us and it is not a government agency. This organization is a company chosen by Medicare to handle the job of being the Independent Review Organization. Medic are oversees its work. We will send the information about your appeal to this organization. This information is called your \"case file.\" You have the right to ask us for a copy of your case file . You have a right to give the Independent Review Organization additional information to support your appeal. Reviewers at the Independent Review Organization will take a careful look at all of the information related to your appeal. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 157 If you had a \"fast\" appeal at Level 1, you will also have a \"fast\" appea l at Level 2 If you had a fast appeal to our plan at Level 1, you will automatically receive a fast appeal at Level 2. The review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal within 72 hours of when it receives your appeal. However, if the Independent Review Organization needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more calendar days . If you had a \"standard\" appeal at Level 1, you will also have a \"standard\" appeal at Level 2 If you had a standard appeal to our plan at Level 1, you will automatically receive a standard appeal at Level 2. The review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal within 30 calendar days of when it receives your appeal. However, if th e Independent Review Organization needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more calendar days . Step 2: The Independent Review Organization gives you their answer. The Independent Review Organization will tell you its dec ision in writing and explain the reasons for it. If the review organization says yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize the medical care coverage within 72 hours or provide the service within 14 calendar days after we receive the decis ion from the review organization. If this organization says no to part or all of your appeal , it means they agree with us that your request (or part of your request) for coverage for medical care should not be approved. (This is called \"upholding the deci sion.\" It is also called \"turning down your appeal.\") o The written notice you get from the Independent Review Organization will tell you the dollar value that must be in dispute to continue with the appeals process. For example, to continue and make another appeal at Level 3, the dollar value of the medical care coverage you are requesting must meet a certain minimum. If the dollar value of the coverage you are requesting is too low, you cannot make another appeal, which means that the decision at Level 2 is final. Step 3: If your case meets the requirements, you choose whether you want to take your appeal further. There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If your Level 2 Appeal is turned do wn and you meet the requirements to continue with the appeals process, you must decide whether you want to go on to Level 3 and make a third appeal. The details on how to do this are in the written notice you got after your Level 2 Appeal. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 158 The Level 3 Appe al is handled by an administrative law judge. Section 9 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. Section 5.5 What if you are asking us to pay you for our share of a bill you have received for medical care? If you want to ask us for payment for medical care, start by reading Chapter 7 of this booklet: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs . Chapter 7 describes the situations in which you may need to ask for reimbursement or to pay a bill you have received from a provider. It also tells how to send us the paperwork that asks us for payment. Asking for reimbursement is asking for a coverage decision from us If you send us the paperwork that asks for reimbursement, you are asking us to make a coverage decision (for more information about coverage decisions, see Section 4.1 of this chapter). To make this coverage decision, we will check to see if the medical ca re you paid for is a covered service (see Chapter 4: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) ). We will also check to see if you followed all the rules for using your coverage for medical care (these rules are given in Chapter 3 of this bo oklet: Using the plan's coverage for your medical services ). We will say yes or no to your request If the medical care you paid for is covered and you followed all the rules, we will send you the payment for our share of the cost of your medical care with in 60 calendar days after we receive your request. Or, if you haven't paid for the services, we will send the payment directly to the provider. When we send the payment, it's the same as saying yes to your request for a coverage decision.) If the medical care is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will not send payment. Instead, we will send you a letter that says we will not pay for the services and the reasons why in detail . (When we turn down your request for payment, it's the same as saying no to your request for a coverage decision.) What if you ask for payment and we say that we will not pay? If you do not agree with our decision to turn you down, you can make an appeal . If you make an appeal, it means you are asking us to change the coverage decision we made when we turned down your request for payment. To make this appeal, follow the process for appeals that we describe in part 5.3 of this section . Go to this part for step -by-step instructions. When you are following these instructio ns, please note: 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 159 If you make an appeal for reimbursement, we must give you our answer within 60 calendar days after we receive your appeal. (If you are asking us to pay you back for medical care you have already received and paid for yourself, you are not allowed to ask for a fast appeal.) If the Independent Review Organization reverses our decision to deny payment, we must send the payment you have requested to you or to the provider within 30 calendar days. If the answer to your appeal is yes at any stag e of the appeals process after Level 2, we must send the payment you requested to you or to the provider within 60 calendar days. SECTION 6 Your Part D prescription drugs: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal ? Have you read Section 4 of this chapter ( A guide to \"the basics\" of coverage decisions and appeals )? If not, you may want to read it before you start this section. Section 6.1 This section tells you what to do if you have problems getting a Part D drug or you want us to pay you back for a Part D drug Your benefits as a member of our plan include coverage for many prescription drugs. Please refer to our plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) . To be covered, the drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. (A \"medically accepted indication\" is a use of the drug that is either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or supported by certain reference books. See Chapter 5, Section 4 for more information about a medically accepted indication.) This section is about your Part D drugs only. To keep things simple, we generally say \"drug\" in the rest of this section, instead of repeating \"covered outpatient prescription drug\" or \"Part D drug\" every time. For details about what we mean by Part D drugs, the List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) , rules and restrictions on coverage, and cost information, see Chapter 5 ( Using our plan's coverage for your Part D prescription drugs ) and Chapter 6 (What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs ). Part D coverage decisions and appea ls As discussed in Section 4 of this chapter, a coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount we will pay for your drugs. Legal Terms An initial coverage decision about your Part D drugs is called a \"coverage determination.\" Here are examples of coverage decisions you ask us to make about your Part D drugs: 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 160 You ask us to make an exception, including: o Asking us to cover a Part D drug that is not on the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) o Asking us to wai ve a restriction on the plan's coverage for a drug (such as limits on the amount of the drug you can get) o Asking to pay a lower cost -sharing amount for a covered non -preferred drug You ask us whether a drug is covered for you and whether you satisfy any a pplicable coverage rules. (For example, when your drug is on the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) but we require you to get approval from us before we will cover it for you.) o Please note: If your pharmacy tells you that your prescription cannot be filled as written, you will get a written notice explaining how to contact us to ask for a coverage decision . You ask us to pay for a prescription drug you already bought. This is a request for a coverage decision about payment. If you disagree with a coverage decision we have made, you can appeal our decision. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 161 This section tells you both how to ask for coverage decisions and how to request an appeal. Use the chart below to help you determine which part has information for your situation: Which of these situations are you in? Do you need a drug that isn't on our Drug List or need us to waive a rule or restriction on a drug we cover? You can ask us to make an exception. (This is a type of coverage decision.) Start with Section 6.2 of this chapter. Do you want us to cover a drug on our Drug List and you believe you meet any plan rules or restrictions (such as getting approval in advance) for the drug you need? You can ask us for a coverage decision. Skip ahead to Section 6.4 of this chapter. Do you want to ask us to pay you back for a drug you have already received and paid for? You can ask us to pay you back. (This is a type of coverage decision.) Skip ahead to Section 6.4 of this chapter. Have we already told you that we will not cover or pay for a drug in the way that you want it to be covered or paid for? You can make an appeal. (This means you are asking us to reconsider.) Skip ahead to Section 6.5 of this chapter. Section 6.2 What is an exception? If a drug is not covered in the way you would like it to be covered, you can ask us to make an \"exception.\" An exception is a type of coverage decision. Similar to other types of coverage decisions, if we turn down your request for an exception, you can appeal our decision. When you ask for an exception, your doctor or other prescriber will need to explain the medical reasons why you need the exception approved. We will then consider your request. Here are three examples of exceptions that you or your doctor or other prescriber can ask us to make: 1. Covering a Part D drug for you that is not on our List of Covered Drugs (Formulary). (We call it the \"Drug List\" for short.) Legal Terms Asking for coverage of a drug that is not on the Drug List is sometimes called ask ing for a \"formulary exception.\" 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 162 If we agree to make an exception and cover a drug that is not on the Drug List, you will need to pay the cost -sharing amount that applies to drugs in Tier 4 for brand name drugs or Tier 2 for generic drugs . You cannot ask for an exception to the copayment or coinsurance amount we require you to pay for the drug. 2. Removing a restriction on our coverage for a covered drug . There are extra rules or restrictions that apply to certain drugs on our List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) (for more information, go to Chapter 5 and look for Section 5). Legal Terms Asking for removal of a restriction on coverage for a drug is sometimes called asking for a \"formulary exception.\" The extra rules and restrictions on coverage for certain drugs include: o Being required to use the generic version of a drug instead of the brand name drug. o Getting plan approval in advance before we will agree to cover the drug for you. (This is sometimes called \"prior authorization.\") o Being requi red to try a different drug first before we will agree to cover the drug you are asking for. (This is sometimes called \"step therapy.\") o Quantity limits . For some drugs, there are restrictions on the amount of the drug you can have. If we agree to make an exception and waive a restriction for you, you can ask for an exception to the copayment or coinsurance amount we require you to pay for the drug. 3. Changing coverage of a drug to a lower cost -sharing tier. Every drug on our Drug List is in one of five cost-sharing tiers. In general, the lower the cost -sharing tier number, the less you will pay as your share of the cost of the drug. Legal Terms Asking to pay a lower preferred price for a covered non-preferred drug is sometimes called asking for a \"tiering exception.\" If your drug is in Tier 4 (Non-Preferred Brand Drugs ) you can ask us to cover it at the cost-sharing amount that applies to drugs in Tier 3, Preferred Brand Drugs. This would lower your share of the cost for the drug. If your drug is in Tier 2 (Non -Preferred Generic Drugs) you can ask us to cover it at the cost -sharing amount that applies to drugs in Tier 1 (Preferred Generic Drugs). This would lower your share of the cost for the drug. You cannot ask us to change the cost -sharing tier for any drug in Tier 5 (Specialty Drugs) . 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 163 Section 6.3 Important things to know about asking for exceptions Your doctor must tell us the medical reasons Your doctor or other prescriber must give us a statement that explains the medical reasons for requesting an e xception. For a faster decision, include this medical information from your doctor or other prescriber when you ask for the exception. Typically, our Drug List includes more than one drug for treating a particular condition. These different possibilities are called \"alternative\" drugs. If an alternative drug would be just as effective as the drug you are requesting and would not cause mor e side effects or other health problems, we will generally not approve your request for an exception. We can say yes or no to your request If we approve your request for an exception, our approval usually is valid until the end of the plan year. This is tr ue as long as your doctor continues to prescribe the drug for you and that drug continues to be safe and effective for treating your condition. If we say no to your request for an exception, you can ask for a review of our decision by making an appeal. Sec tion 6.5 tells how to make an appeal if we say no. The next section tells you how to ask for a coverage decision, including an exception. Section 6.4 Step -by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision, including an exception Step 1: You ask us to make a coverage decision about the drug(s) or payment you need. If your health requires a quick response, you must ask us to make a \"fast coverage decision.\" You cannot ask for a fast coverage decision if you are asking us to pay you back f or a drug you already bought. What to do Request the type of coverage decision you want. Start by calling, writing, or faxing us to make your request. You, your representative, or your doctor (or other prescriber) can do this. For the details, go to Chapte r 2, Section 1 and look for the section called, How to contact us when you are asking for a coverage decision about your Part D prescription drugs . Or if you are asking us to pay you back for a drug, go to the section called, Where to send a request that a sks us to pay for our share of the cost for medical care or a drug you have received . You or your doctor or someone else who is acting on your behalf can ask for a coverage decision. Section 4 of this chapter tells how you can give written permission to so meone else to act as your representative. You can also have a lawyer act on your behalf. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 164 If you want to ask us to pay you back for a drug, start by reading Chapter 7 of this booklet: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medica l services or drugs. Chapter 7 describes the situations in which you may need to ask for reimbursement. It also tells how to send us the paperwork that asks us to pay you back for our share of the cost of a drug you have paid for. If you are requesting an exception, provide the \" supporting statement.\" Your doctor or other prescriber must give us the medical reasons for the drug exception you are requesting. (We call this the \" supporting statement.\") Your doctor or other prescriber can fax or mail the state ment to us. Or your doctor or other prescriber can tell us on the phone and follow up by faxing or mailing a written statement if necessary. See Sections 6.2 and 6.3 for more information about exception requests. If your health requires it, ask us to give you a \"fast coverage decision\" Legal Terms A \"fast coverage decision\" is called an \"expedited coverage determination.\" When we give you our decision, we will use the \"standard\" deadlines unless we have agreed to use the \"fast\" deadlines. A standard coverage decision means we will give you an answer within 72 hours after we receive your doctor's statement. A fast coverage decision means we will answer within 24 hours. To get a fast coverage decision, you must meet two requirements: o You can get a fast coverage decision only if you are asking for a drug you have not yet received . (You cannot get a fast coverage decision if you are asking us to pay you back for a drug you have already bought.) o You can get a fast coverage decision only if using the standar d deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function. If your doctor or other prescriber tells us that your health requires a \"fast coverage decision,\" we will automatically agree to give you a fast coverage decision. If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own (without your doctor's or other prescriber's support), we will decide whether your health requires that we give you a fast coverage decision. o If we decide that your medical condition does not meet the requirements for a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that says so (and we will use the standard deadlines instead). o This letter will tell you that if your doctor or other prescribe r asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give a fast coverage decision. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 165 o The letter will also tell how you can file a complaint about our decision to give you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you reques ted. It tells how to file a \"fast\" complaint, which means you would get our answer to your complaint within 24 hours. (The process for making a complaint is different from the process for coverage decisions and appeals. For more information about the proce ss for making complaints, see Section 10 of this chapter.) Step 2: We consider your request and we give you our answer. Deadlines for a \"fast\" coverage decision If we are using the fast deadlines, we must give you our answer within 24 hours . o Generally, this means within 24 hours after we receive your request. If you are requesting an exception, we will give you our answer within 24 hours after we receive your doctor's statement supporting your request. We will give you our answer sooner if yo ur health requires us to. o If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an independent outside organization. Later in this section, we tell about this review organi zation and explain what happens at Appeal Level 2. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must provide the coverage we have agreed to provide within 24 hours after we receive your request or doctor's statement supporting your request . If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you a written statement that explains why we said no. Deadlines for a \"standard\" coverage decision about a drug you have not yet received If we are using the standard deadlines, we must give you our answer within 72 hours. o Generally, this means within 72 hours after we receive your request. If you are requesting an exception, we will give you our answer within 72 hours after we receive your doctor's statement supporting your request. We will give you our answer sooner if your health requires us to. o If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an inde pendent organization. Later in this section, we tell about this review organization and explain what happens at Appeal Level 2. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested - 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 166 o If we approve your request for coverage, we must provide the covera ge we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we receive your request or doctor's statement supporting your request. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested , we will send you a written statement that explains why we said no. Deadlin es for a \"standard\" coverage decision about payment for a drug you have already bought We must give you our answer within 14 calendar days after we receive your request. o If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an independent organization. Later in this section, we tell about this review organization and explain what happens at Appeal Level 2. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we are also required to make payment to you within 14 calendar days after we receive your request. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested , we will send you a written statement that explains why we said no. Step 3: If we say no to your cov erage request, you decide if you want to make an appeal. If we say no, you have the right to request an appeal. Requesting an appeal means asking us to reconsider - and possibly change - the decision we made. Section 6.5 Step -by-step: How to make a Level 1 Appeal (how to ask for a review of a coverage decision made by our plan) Legal Terms An appeal to the plan about a Part D drug coverage decision is called a plan \"redetermination.\" Step 1: You contact us and make your Level 1 Appeal. If your health requires a quick response, you must ask for a \"fast appeal.\" What to do To start your appeal, you (or your representative or your doctor or other prescriber) must contact us. o For details on how to reach us by phone, fax, or mail for any purpose related to your appeal, go to Chapter 2, Section 1, and look for the section called, How to contact us when you are making an appeal about your Part D prescription drugs. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 167 If you are aski ng for a standard appeal, make your appeal by submitting a written request. If you are asking for a fast appeal, you may make your appeal in writing or you may call us at the phone number shown in Chapter 2, Section 1 (How to contact us when you are making an appeal about your part D prescription drugs). You must make your appeal request within 60 calendar days from the date on the written notice we sent to tell you our answer to your request for a coverage decision. If you miss this deadline and have a goo d reason for missing it, we may give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of good cause for missing the deadline may include if you had a serious illness that prevented you from contacting us or if we provided you with incorrect or incomplete inform ation about the deadline for requesting an appeal. You can ask for a copy of the information in your appeal and add more information. o You have the right to ask us for a copy of the information regarding your appeal. o If you wish, you and your doctor or other prescriber may give us additional information to support your appeal. If your health requires it, ask for a \"fast appeal\" Legal Terms A \"fast appeal\" is also called an \"expedited redetermination.\" If you are appealing a decision our plan made about a drug you have not yet received, you and your doctor or other prescriber will need to decide if you need a \"fast appeal.\" The requirements for getting a \"fast appeal\" are the same as those for getting a \"fast cover age decision\" in Section 6.4 of this chapter. Step 2: Our plan considers your appeal and we give you our answer. When our plan is reviewing your appeal, we take another careful look at all of the information about your coverage request. We check to see if we were following all the rules when we said no to your request. We may contact you or your doctor or other prescriber to get more information. Deadlines for a \"fast\" appeal If we are using the fast deadlines, we must give you our answer within 72 hours after we receive your appeal . We will give you our answer sooner if your health requires it. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 168 o If we do not give you an answer within 72 hours, we are required to send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an Indepen dent Review Organization. Later in this section, we tell about this review organization and explain what happens at Level 2 of the appeals process. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must provide the coverage we have agreed to pr ovide within 72 hours after we receive your appeal. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you a written statement that explains why we said no and how to appeal our decision. Deadlines for a \"standard\" appeal If we are us ing the standard deadlines, we must give you our answer within 7 calendar days after we receive your appeal. We will give you our decision sooner if you have not received the drug yet and your health condition requires us to do so. If you believe your heal th requires it, you should ask for \"fast\" appeal. o If we do not give you a decision within 7 calendar days, we are required to send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an Independent Review Organization. Later in this section, we tell about this review organization and explain what happens at Level 2 of the appeals process. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested - o If we approve a request for coverage, we must provide the coverage we have agreed to provide as quickly as your health requires, but no later than 7 calendar days after we receive your appeal. o If we approve a request to pay you back for a drug you already bought, we are required to send payment to you within 30 calendar days after we receive your appeal request. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested , we will send you a written statement that explains why we said no and how to appeal our decision. Step 3: If we say no to your appeal, you decide if you want to continue with the appeals process and make another appeal. If we say no to your appeal, you then choose whether to accept this decision or continue by making another appeal. If you decide to make another appeal, it means your appe al is going on to Level 2 of the appeals process (see below). 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 169 Section 6.6 Step -by-step: How to make a Level 2 Appeal If we say no to your appeal, you then choose whether to accept this decision or continue by making another appeal. If you decide to go on to a Level 2 Appeal, the Independent Review Organization reviews the decision we made when we said no to your first appeal. This organization decides whether the decision we made should be changed. Legal Terms The formal name for the \"Independent Review Organization\" is the \"Independent Review Entity.\" It is sometimes called the \"IRE.\" Step 1: To make a Level 2 Appeal, you must contact the Independent Review Organization and ask for a review of your case. If we say no to your Level 1 Appeal, the written notice we send you will include instructions on how to make a Level 2 Appeal with the Independent Review Organization. These instructions will tell who can make this Level 2 Appeal, what deadlines you must follow , and how to reach the review organization. When you make an appeal to the Independent Review Organization, we will send the information we have about your appeal to this organization. This information is called your \"case file.\" You have the right to ask us for a copy of your case file . You have a right to give the Independent Review Organization additional information to support your appeal. Step 2: The Independent Review Organization does a review of your appeal and gives you an answer. The Independent Review Organization is an independent organization that is hired by Medicare . This organization is not connected with us and it is not a government agency. This organization is a company chosen by Medicare to review our decisions about your Part D benefits with us. Reviewers at the Independent Review Organization will take a careful look at all of the information related to your appeal. The organization will tell you its decision in writing and explain the reasons for it. Deadlines for \"fast\" appeal at Leve l 2 If your health requires it, ask the Independent Review Organization for a \"fast appeal.\" If the review organization agrees to give you a \"fast appeal,\" the review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal within 72 hours after it receives your appeal request. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 170 If the Independent Review Organization says yes to part or all of what you requested, we must provide the drug coverage that was approved by the review organization within 24 hours after we receive the decision from the review organization. Deadlines for \"standard\" appeal at Level 2 If you have a standard appeal at Level 2, the review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal within 7 calendar days after it receives your appeal. If the Independent R eview Organization says yes to part or all of what you requested - o If the Independent Review Organization approves a request for coverage, we must provide the drug coverage that was approved by the review organization within 72 hours after we receive the decision from the review organization. o If the Independent Review Organization approves a request to pay you back for a drug you already bought, we are required to send payment to you within 30 calendar days after we receive the decision from the review organization. What if the review organization says no to your appeal? If this organization says no to your appeal, it means the organization agrees with our decision not to approve your request. (This is called \"upholding the decision.\" It is also called \" turning down your appeal.\") To continue and make another appeal at Level 3, the dollar value of the drug coverage you are requesting must meet a minimum amount. If the dollar value of the coverage you are requesting is too low, you cannot make another app eal and the decision at Level 2 is final. The notice you get from the Independent Review Organization will tell you the dollar value that must be in dispute to continue with the appeals process. Step 3: If the dollar value of the coverage you are requestin g meets the requirement, you choose whether you want to take your appeal further. There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If your Level 2 Appeal is turned down and you meet the requirem ents to continue with the appeals process, you must decide whether you want to go on to Level 3 and make a third appeal. If you decide to make a third appeal, the details on how to do this are in the written notice you got after your second appeal. The Le vel 3 Appeal is handled by an administrative law judge. Section 9 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 171 SECTION 7 How to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think the doctor is discharging you too soon When you are admitted to a hospital, you have the right to get all of your covered hospital services that are necessary to diagnose and treat your illness or injury. For more information about our coverage for your hospital care, including any limitations on this coverage, see Chapter 4 of this booklet: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) . During your hospital stay, your doctor and the hospital staff will be working with you to prepare for the day when you will leave the ho spital. They will also help arrange for care you may need after you leave. The day you leave the hospital is called your \" discharge date .\" Our plan's coverage of your hospital stay ends on this date. When your discharge date has been decided, your doctor or the hospital staff will let you know. If you think you are being asked to leave the hospital too soon, you can ask for a longer hospital stay and your request will be considered. This section tells you how to ask. Section 7.1 During your inpatient hosp ital stay, you will get a written notice from Medicare that tells about your rights During your hospital stay, you will be given a written notice called An Important Message from Medicare about Your Rights. Everyone with Medicare gets a copy of this notice whenever they are admitted to a hospital. Someone at the hospital (for exampl e, a caseworker or nurse) must give it to you within two days after you are admitted. If you do not get the notice, ask any hospital employee for it. If you need help, please cal l Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) . You can also call 1 -800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633- 4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1 -877-486-2048. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 172 1. Read this notice carefully and ask questions if you don't understand it. It tells you about your rights as a hospital patient, including: Your right to receive Medicare -covered services during and after your hospital stay, as ordered by your doctor. This includes the right to know what these services are, who will pay for them, and where you can get them. Your right to be involved in any decisions about your hospital stay, and know who will pay for it. Where to report any concerns you have about quality of your hospital care. Your right to appeal your disch arge decision if you think you are being discharged from the hospital too soon . Legal Terms The written notice from Medicare tells you how you can \"request an immediate review.\" Requesting an immediate review is a formal, legal way to ask for a delay in your discharge date so that we will cover your hospital care for a longer time. (Section 7.2 below tells you how you can request an immediate review.) 2. You must sign the written notice to show that you received it and understand your rights. You or som eone who is acting on your behalf must sign the notice. (Section 4 of this chapter tells how you can give written permission to someone else to act as your representative.) Signing the notice shows only that you have received the information about your rights. The notice does not give your discharge date (your doctor or hospital staff will tell you your discharge date). Signing the notice does not mean you are agreeing on a discharge date. 3. Keep your c opy of the signed notice so you will have the information about making an appeal (or reporting a concern about quality of care) handy if you need it. If you sign the notice more than 2 days before the day you leave the hospital, you will get another copy b efore you are scheduled to be discharged. To look at a copy of this notice in advance, you can call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) or 1-800 MEDICARE (1 -800- 633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users s hould call 1 -877-486-2048.

Before you start, understand what you need to do and what the deadlines are. Follow the process. Each step in the first two levels of the app eals process is explained below. Meet the deadlines. The deadlines are important. Be sure that you understand and follow the deadlines that apply to things you must do. Ask for help if you need it . If you have questions or need help at any time, please call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). Or call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program, a government organization that provides personalized assistance (see Section 2 of this chapter). During a Level 1 Appeal, the Quality Improvement Organization reviews your appeal. It checks to see if your planned discharge date is medically appropriate for you. Step 1: Contact the Quality Improvement Organization in your state and ask for a \"fast review\" of your hospital discharge. You must act quickly. Legal Terms A \"fast review\" is also called an \"immediate review.\" What is the Quality Improvement Organization? This organization is a group of doctors and other health care professionals who are paid by the Federal government. These experts are not part of our plan. This organization is paid by Medicare to check on and help improve the quality of care for people with M edicare. This includes reviewing hospital discharge dates for people with Medicare. How can you contact this organization? The written notice you received ( An Important Message from Medicare About Your Rights ) tells you how to reach this organization. (Or find the name, address, and phone number of the Quality Improvement Organization for your state in Chapter 2, Section 4, of this booklet.) Act quickly: To make your appeal, you must contact the Quality Improvement Organization before you leave the hospital and no later than your planned discharge date. (Your \"planned discharge date\" is the date that has been set for you to leave the hospital.) 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 174 o If you meet this deadline, you are allowed to stay in the hospital after your discharge date without paying for it while you wait to get the decision on your appeal from the Quality Improvement Organization. o If you do not meet this deadline, and you decide to stay in the hospital after your planned discharge date, you may have to pay all of the costs for hospital care you receive after your planned discharge date. If you miss the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement Organization about your appeal, you can make your appeal directly to our plan instead. For details about this other way to make your appeal, see Section 7.4. Ask for a \"fast review\": You must ask the Quality Improvement Organization for a \"fast review\" of your discharge. Asking for a \"fast review\" means you are asking for the organization to use the \"fast\" deadlines for an appeal instead of using the standard deadlines. Legal Terms A \"fast review \" is also called an \" immediate review \" or an \" expedited review .\" Step 2: The Quality Improvement Organization conducts an independent review of your case. What happens during this review? Health professionals at the Quality Improvement Organization (we will call them \"the reviewers\" for short) will ask you (or your representative) why you believe coverage for the services should continue. You don't have to prepare anything in writing, but you may do so if you wish. The reviewers will also look at your medical information, talk with your doctor, and review information that the hospital and we have given to them. By noon of the day after the reviewers informed our plan of your appeal, you will also get a written notice that gives your planned discharge date and explains in detail the reasons why your doctor, the hospital, and we think it is right (medically appropriate) for you to be discharged on that date. Legal Terms This written explanation is called the \" Detailed Notice of Discharge.\" You can get a sample of this notice by calling Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) or 1-800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633- 4227 ), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. (TTY users should call 1 -877-486-2048.) Or you can see a sample notice online at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/BNI/ 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 175 Step 3: Within one full day after it has all the needed information, the Quality Improvement Organization will give you its answer to your appeal. What happens if the answer is yes? If the review organization says yes to your appeal, we must keep providing your covered inpatient hospital services for as long as these services are medically necessary. You will have to keep paying your share of the costs (such as deductibles or copayments, if these apply). In addition, there may be limitations on your covered hospital services. (See Chapter 4 of this booklet). What happens if the answer is no? If the review organization says no to your appeal, they are sa ying that your planned discharge date is medically appropriate. If this happens, our coverage for your inpatient hospital services will end at noon on the day after the Quality Improvement Organization gives you its answer to your appeal. If the review or ganization says no to your appeal and you decide to stay in the hospital, then you may have to pay the full cost of hospital care you receive after noon on the day after the Quality Improvement Organization gives you its answer to your appeal. Step 4: If the answer to your Level 1 Appeal is no, you decide if you want to make another appeal. If the Quality Improvement Organization has turned down your appeal, and you stay in the hospital after your planned discharge date, then you can make another appeal. Making another appeal means you are going on to \"Level 2\" of the appeals process. Section 7.3 Step -by-step: How to make a Level 2 Appeal to change your hospital discharge date If the Quality Improvement Organization has turned down your appeal, and you stay in the hospital after your planned discharge date, then you can make a Level 2 Appeal. During a Level 2 Appeal, you ask the Quality Improvement Organization t o take another look at the decision they made on your first appeal. If we turn down your Level 2 Appeal, you may have to pay the full cost for your stay after your planned discharge date. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 176 Here are the steps for Level 2 of the appeal process: Step 1: You co ntact the Quality Improvement Organization again and ask for another review. You must ask for this review within 60 calendar days after the day when the Quality Improvement Organization said no to your Level 1 Appeal. You can ask for this review only if yo u stayed in the hospital after the date that your coverage for the care ended. Step 2: The Quality Improvement Organization does a second review of your situation. Reviewers at the Quality Improvement Organization will take another careful look at all of t he information related to your appeal. Step 3: Within 14 calendar days, the Quality Improvement Organization reviewers will decide on your appeal and tell you their decision. If the review organization says yes: We must reimburse you for our share of the costs of hospital care you have received since noon on the day after the date your first appeal was turned down by the Quality Improvement Organization. We must continue providing coverage for your inpatient hospital care for as long as it is medically necessary . You must continue to pay your share of the costs and coverage limitations may apply. If the review organization says no: It means they agree with the decision they made on your Level 1 Appeal and will not change it. This is called \"upholding the decision.\" The notice you get will tell you in writing what you can do if you wish to continue with the review process. It will give you the details about how to go on to the next level of appeal, which is handled by a judge. Step 4: If the answer is no, you will need to decide whether you want to take your appeal further by going on to Level 3. There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If the review organization turns down your Level 2 Appeal, you can choose whether to accept that decision or whether to go on to Level 3 and make another appeal. At Level 3, your appeal is reviewed by a judge. Section 9 in this cha pter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 177 Section 7.4 What if you miss the deadline for making your Level 1 Appeal? You can appeal to us instead As explained above in Section 7.2, you must act quickly to contact the Quality Improveme nt Organization to start your first appeal of your hospital discharge. (\"Quickly\" means before you leave the hospital and no later than your planned discharge date). If you miss the deadline for contacting this organization, there is another way to make yo ur appeal. If you use this other way of making your appeal, the first two levels of appeal are different. Step -by-Step: How to make a Level 1 Alternate Appeal If you miss the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement Organization, you can make an appeal to us, asking for a \"fast review.\" A fast review is an appeal that uses the fast deadlines instead of the standard deadlines. Legal Terms A \"fast\" review (or \"fast appeal\") is also called an \"expedited appeal\" . Step 1: Contact us and ask for a \"fast review.\" For details on how to contact our plan, go to Chapter 2, Section 1 and look for the section called, How to contact our plan when you are making an appeal about your medical care . Be sure to ask for a \"fast review .\" This means you are asking us to give you an answer using the \"fast\" deadlines rather than the \"standard\" deadlines. Step 2: We do a \"fast\" review of your planned discharge date, checking to see if it was medically appropriate. During this review, we take a look at all of the information about your hospital stay. We check to see if your planned discharge date was medically appropriate. We will check to see if the decision about when you should leave the hospital was fair and followed all the rules. In this situation, we will use the \"fast\" deadlines rather than the standard deadlines for giving you the answer to this review. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 178 Step 3: We give you our decision within 72 hours after you ask for a \"fast review\" (\"fast appeal\"). If we say yes to your fast appeal, it means we have agreed with you that you still need to be in the hospital after the discharge date, and will keep providing your covered inpatient hospital services for as long as it is medically necessary. It also means that we have agreed to reimburse you for our share of the costs of care you have received since the date when we said your coverage would end. (You must pay your share of the costs and there may be coverage limitations that apply.) If we say no to your fast appeal, we are saying that you r planned discharge date was medically appropriate. Our coverage for your inpatient hospital services ends as of the day we said coverage would end. o If you stayed in the hospital after your planned discharge date, then you may have to pay the full cost of hospital care you received after the planned discharge date. Step 4: If we say no to your fast appeal, your case will automatically be sent on to the next level of the appeals process. To make sure we were following all the rules when we said no to your f ast appeal, we are required to send your appeal to the \"Independent Review Organization.\" When we do this, it means that you are automatically going on to Level 2 of the appeals process. Step -by-Step: How to make a Level 2 Alternate Appeal If we say no to your Level 1 Appeal, your case will automatically be sent on to the next level of the appeals process. During the Level 2 Appeal, the Independent Review Organization reviews the decision we made when we said no to your \"fast appeal.\" This organization dec ides whether the decision we made should be changed. Legal Terms The formal name for the \"Independent Review Organization\" is the \"Independent Review Entity.\" It is sometimes called the \"IRE.\" Step 1: We will automatically forward your case to the Independent Review Organization. We are required to send the information for your Level 2 Appeal to the Independent Review Organization within 24 hours of when we tell you that we are saying no to your first appeal. (If you think we are not meeting this de adline or other deadlines, you can make a complaint. The complaint process is different from the appeal process. Section 10 of this chapter tells how to make a complaint.) 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 179 Step 2: The Independent Review Organization does a \"fast review\" of your appeal. The reviewers give you an answer within 72 hours. The Independent Review Organization is an independent organization that is hired by Medicare . This organization is not connected with our plan and it is not a government agency. This organization is a compa ny chosen by Medicare to handle the job of being the Independent Review Organization. Medicare oversees its work. Reviewers at the Independent Review Organization will take a careful look at all of the information related to your appeal of your hospital d ischarge. If this organization says yes to your appeal, then we must reimburse you (pay you back) for our share of the costs of hospital care you have received since the date of your planned discharge. We must also continue the plan's coverage of your inpatient hospital services for as long as it is medically necessary. You must continue to pay your share of the costs. If there are coverage limitations, these could limit how much we would reimburse or how long we would continue to cover your services. If this organization says no to your appeal, it means they agree with us that your planned hospital discharge date was medically appropriate. o The notice you get from the Independent Review Organization will tell you in writing what you can do if you wish to continue with the review process. It will give you the details about how to go on to a Level 3 Appeal, which is handled by a judge. Step 3: If the Independent Review Organization turns down your appeal, you choose whether you want to take your appeal further. There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If reviewers say no to y our Level 2 Appeal, you decide whether to accept their decision or go on to Level 3 and make a third appeal. Section 9 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 180 SECTION 8 How to ask us to keep covering certain medical services if you think your coverage is ending too soon Section 8.1 This section is about three services only: Home health care, skilled nursing facility care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services This section is about the f ollowing types of care only: Home health care services you are getting. Skilled nursing care you are getting as a patient in a skilled nursing facility. (To learn about requirements for being considered a \"skilled nursing facility,\" see Chapter 12, Definit ions of important words .) Rehabilitation care you are getting as an outpatient at a Medicare -approved Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) . Usually, this means you are getting treatment for an illness or accident, or you are recovering from a major operation. (For more information about this type of facility, see Chapter 12, Definitions of important words .) When you are getting any of these types of care, you have the right to keep getting your covered services for that type of care for as long as the care is needed to diagnose and treat your illness or injury. For more information on your covered services, i ncluding your share of the cost and any limitations to coverage that may apply, see Chapter 4 of this booklet: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) . When we decide it is time to stop covering any of the three types of care for you, we are required to tell you in advance. When your coverage for that care ends, we will stop paying our share of the cost for your care. If you think we are ending the coverage of your care too soon, you can appeal our decision . This section tells you how to ask for an appeal. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 181 Section 8.2 We will tell you in advance when your coverage will be ending 1. You receive a notice in writing. At least two days before our plan is going to stop covering your care, the agency or facility that is providing your care wi ll give you a notice. The written notice tells you the date when we will stop covering the care for you. The written notice also tells what you can do if you want to ask our plan to change this decision about when to end your care, and keep covering it fo r a longer period of time. Legal Terms In telling you what you can do, the written notice is telling how you can request a \"fast -track appeal.\" Requesting a fast -track appeal is a formal, legal way to request a change to our coverage decision about when to stop your care. (Section 5.3 below tells how you can request a fast-track appeal.) Legal Terms The written notice is called the \" Notice of Medicare Non -Coverage.\" To get a sample copy, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) or 1- 800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633-4227, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1 -877- 486-2048.). Or see a copy online at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/BNI/ 2. You must sign the written notice to show that you received it. You or someone who is acting on your behalf must sign the notice. (Section 4 tells how you can give written permission to someone else to act as your representative.) Signing the notice shows only that you have received the information about when your coverage will stop. Signing it does not mean you agree with the plan that it's time to stop getting the care. Section 8.3 Step -by-step: How to make a Level 1 Appeal to have our plan cover your care for a longer time If you want to ask us to cover your care for a longer period of time, you will need to use the appeals process to make this request. Before you start, understand what you need to do and what the deadlines are. Follow the process. Each step in the first two levels of the appeals process is explained below. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 182 Meet the deadlines. The deadlines are important. Be sure that you understand and follow the deadlines that apply to things you must do. The re are also deadlines our plan must follow. (If you think we are not meeting our deadlines, you can file a complaint. Section 10 of this chapter tells you how to file a complaint.) Ask for help if you need it . If you have questions or need help at any time , please call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). Or call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program, a government organization that provides personalized assistance (see Section 2 of this chapter). During a Level 1 Appeal, the Quality Improvement Organization reviews your appeal and decides whether to change the decision made by our plan. Step 1: Make your Level 1 Appeal: contact the Quality Improvement Organization in your state and ask for a review. You mus t act quickly. What is the Quality Improvement Organization? This organization is a group of doctors and other health care experts who are paid by the Federal government. These experts are not part of our plan. They check on the quality of care received b y people with Medicare and review plan decisions about when it's time to stop covering certain kinds of medical care. How can you contact this organization? The written notice you received tells you how to reach this organization. (Or find the name, address, and phone number of the Quality Improvement Organization for your state in Chapter 2, Section 4, of this booklet.) What should you ask for? Ask this organization to do an independent review of whether it is medically appropriate for us to end cove rage for your medical services. Your deadline for contacting this organization. You must contact the Quality Improvement Organization to start your appeal no later than noon of the day after you receive the written notice telling you when we will stop covering your care . If you miss the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement Organization about your appeal, you can make your appeal directly to us instead. For details about this other way to make your appeal, see Section 8. 5. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 183 Step 2: The Quality Impr ovement Organization conducts an independent review of your case. What happens during this review? Health professionals at the Quality Improvement Organization (we will call them \"the reviewers\" for short) will ask you (or your representative) why you beli eve coverage for the services should continue. You don't have to prepare anything in writing, but you may do so if you wish. The review organization will also look at your medical information, talk with your doctor, and review information that our plan ha s given to them. By the end of the day the reviewers informed us of your appeal, and you will also get a written notice from us that explains in detail our reasons for ending our coverage for your services. Legal Terms This notice explanation is called the \" Detailed Explanation of Non -Coverage.\" Step 3: Within one full day after they have all the information they need, the reviewers will tell you their decision. What happens if the reviewers say yes to your appeal? If the reviewers say yes to your appea l, then we must keep providing your covered services for as long as it is medically necessary. You will have to keep paying your share of the costs (such as deductibles or copayments, if these apply). In addition, there may be limitations on your covered services (see Chapter 4 of this booklet). What happens if the reviewers say no to your appeal? If the reviewers say no to your appeal, then your coverage will end on the date we have told you. We will stop paying its share of the costs of this care. If you decide to keep getting the home health care, or skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services after this date when your coverage ends, then you will have to pay the full cost of this care yourself. Step 4: If the answer to your Level 1 Appeal is no, you decide if you want to make another appeal. This first appeal you make is \"Level 1\" of the appeals process. If reviewers say no to your Level 1 Appeal - and you choose to continue getting care after your coverage for the care has ended - then you can make another appeal. Making another appeal means you are going on to \"Level 2\" of the appeals process. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 184 Section 8.4 Step -by-step: How to make a Level 2 Appeal to have our plan cover your care for a longer time If the Quality Improvement Organization has turned down your appeal and you choose to continue getting care after your coverage for the care has ended, then you can make a Level 2 Appeal. During a Level 2 Appeal, you ask the Quality Improvement Organi zation to take another look at the decision they made on your first appeal. If we turn down your Level 2 Appeal, you may have to pay the full cost for your home health care, or skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facil ity (CORF) services after the date when we said your coverage would end. Here are the steps for Level 2 of the appeal process: Step 1: You contact the Quality Improvement Organization again and ask for another review. You must ask for this review within 60 days after the day when the Quality Improvement Organization said no to your Level 1 Appeal. You can ask for this review only if you continued getting care after the date that your coverage for the care ended. Step 2: The Quality Improvement Organization does a second review of your situation. Reviewers at the Quality Improvement Organization will take another careful look at all of the information related to your appeal. Step 3: Within 14 days, the Quality Improvement Organization reviewers will decide o n your appeal and tell you their decision. What happens if the review organization says yes to your appeal? We must reimburse you for our share of the costs of care you have received since the date when we said your coverage would end. We must continue pro viding coverage for the care for as long as it is medically necessary. You must continue to pay your share of the costs and there may be coverage limitations that apply. What happens if the review organization says no? It means they agree with the decisio n we made to your Level 1 Appeal and will not change it. The notice you get will tell you in writing what you can do if you wish to continue with the review process. It will give you the details about how to go on to the next level of appeal, which is han dled by a judge. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 185 Step 4: If the answer is no, you will need to decide whether you want to take your appeal further.

You can appeal to us instead As explained above in Section 8.3, you must act quickly to contact the Quality Improvement Organization to start your first appeal (within a day or two, at the most). If yo u miss the deadline for contacting this organization, there is another way to make your appeal. If you use this other way of making your appeal, the first two levels of appeal are different. Step -by-Step: How to make a Level 1 Alternate Appeal If you mis s the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement Organization, you can make an appeal to us, asking for a \"fast review.\" A fast review is an appeal that uses the fast deadlines instead of the standard deadlines. Here are the steps for a Level 1 Altern ate Appeal: Legal Terms A \"fast\" review (or \"fast appeal\") is also called an \"expedited appeal\" .

Be sure to ask for a \"fast review .\" This means you are asking us to give you an answer using the \"fast\" deadlines rather than the \"standard\" deadlines. Step 2: We do a \"fast\" review of the d ecision we made about when to end coverage for your services. During this review, we take another look at all of the information about your case. We check to see if we were following all the rules when we set the date for ending the plan's coverage for ser vices you were receiving. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 186 We will use the \"fast\" deadlines rather than the standard deadlines for giving you the answer to this review. (Usually, if you make an appeal to our plan and ask for a \"fast review,\" we are allowed to decide whether to agree to yo ur request and give you a \"fast review.\" But in this situation, the rules require us to give you a fast response if you ask for it.) Step 3: We give you our decision within 72 hours after you ask for a \"fast review\" (\"fast appeal\"). If we say yes to your f ast appeal, it means we have agreed with you that you need services longer, and will keep providing your covered services for as long as it is medically necessary. It also means that we have agreed to reimburse you for our share of the costs of care you ha ve received since the date when we said your coverage would end. (You must pay your share of the costs and there may be coverage limitations that apply.) If we say no to your fast appeal, then your coverage will end on the date we have told you and we will not pay after this date. We will stop paying its share of the costs of this care. If you continued to get home health care, or skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services after the date when we said your coverage would end, then you will have to pay the full cost of this care yourself. Step 4: If we say no to your fast appeal, your case will automatically go on to the next level of the appeals process. To make sure we were following all the rules when we said no to your fast appeal, we are required to send your appeal to the \"Independent Review Organization.\" When we do this, it means that you are automati cally going on to Level 2 of the appeals process.

There are three additional levels of appeal after Level 2, for a total of five levels of appeal. If reviewers say no to your Level 2 Appeal, you can choose whether to accept that decision or whether to go on to Level 3 and make another appeal. At Level 3, your appeal is reviewed by a judge. Section 9 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process . 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 188 SECTION 9 Taking your appeal to Level 3 and beyond Section 9.1 Levels of Appeal 3, 4, and 5 for Medical Service Appeals This section may be appropriate for you if you have made a Level 1 Appeal and a Level 2 Appeal, and both of your appeals have been tur ned down. If the dollar value of the item or medical service you have appealed meets certain minimum levels, you may be able to go on to additional levels of appeal. If the dollar value is less than the minimum level , you cannot appeal any further. If the dollar value is high enough, the written response you receive to your Level 2 Appeal will explain who to contact and what to do to ask for a Level 3 Appeal. For most situations that involve appeals, the last three l evels of appeal work in much the same way. Here is who handles the review of your appeal at each of these levels. Level 3 Appeal A judge who works for the Federal government will review your appeal and give you an answer. This judge is called an \"Administ rative Law Judge.\" If the Administrative Law Judge says yes to your appeal, the appeals process may or may not be over - We will decide whether to appeal this decision to Level 4. Unlike a decision at Level 2 (Independent Review Organization), we have the right to appeal a Level 3 decision that is favorable to you. o If we decide not to appeal the decision, we must authori ze or provide you with the service within 60 days after receiving the judge's decision. o If we decide to appeal the decision, we will send you a copy of the Level 4 Appeal request with any accompanying documents. We may wait for the Level 4 Appeal decision before authorizing or providing the service in dispute. If the Administrative Law Judge says no to your appeal, the appeals process may or may not be over . o If you decide to accept this decision that turns down your appeal, the appeals process is over. o If you do not want to accept the decision, you can continue to the next level of the review process. If the administrative law judge says no to your appeal, the notice you get will tell you what to do next if you choose to continue with your appeal. Level 4 Appeal The Medicare Appeals Council will review your appeal and give you an answer. The Medicare Appeals Council works for the Federal government. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 189 If the answer is yes, or if the Medicare Appeals Council denies our request to review a favorable Level 3 Appeal decision, the appeals process may or may not be over - We will decide whether to appeal this decision to Level 5. Unlike a decision at Level 2 (Independent Review Organization), we have the right to appeal a Level 4 decision that is favorable to you. o If we decide not to appeal the decision, we must authorize or provide you with the service within 60 days after receiving the Medicare Appeals Coun cil's decision. o If we decide to appeal the decision, we will let you know in writing. If the answer is no or if the Medicare Appeals Council denies the review request, the appeals process may or may not be over . o If you decide to accept this decision that turns down your appeal, the appeals process is over. o If you do not want to accept the decision, you might be able to continue to the next level of the review process. If the Medicare Appeals Council says no to your appeal, the notice you get will tell yo u whether the rules allow you to go on to a Level 5 Appeal. If the rules allow you to go on, the written notice will also tell you who to contact and what to do next if you choose to continue with your appeal. Level 5 Appeal A judge at the Federal District Court will review your appeal. This is the last step of the administrative appeals process. Section 9.2 Levels of Appeal 3, 4, and 5 for Part D Drug Appeals This section may be appropriate for you if you have made a Level 1 Appeal and a Level 2 Appeal, and both of your appeals have been turned down.

If you are asking for a decision or making an appeal, you use that process, not the complaint process. However, if you have already asked us for a coverage decision or made an appeal, and you think that we are not responding quickly enough, y ou can also make a complaint about our slowness.

If you believe we are not meeting the deadlines for giving you a coverage decision or an answer to an appeal you have made, you can make a complaint. When a coverage decision we made is reviewed and we are told that we must cover or reimburse you for certain medical services or drugs, there are deadlines th at apply. If you think we are not meeting these deadlines, you can make a complaint. When we do not give you a decision on time, we are required to forward your case to the Independent Review Organization. If we do not do that within the required deadline, you can make a complaint. Section 10.2 The formal name for \"making a complaint\" is \"filing a grievance\" Legal Terms What this section calls a \"complaint\" is also called a \"grievance.\" Another term for \"making a complaint\" is \"filing a grievance.\" Another way to say \" using the process for complaints\" is \"using the process for filing a grievance.\" 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 194 Section 10.3 Step -by-step: Making a complaint Step 1: Contact us promptly - either by phone or in writing.

You may also make an appeal if you disagree with our decision to stop services that you are receiving.

Cost sharing includes any combination of the following three types of payments: (1) any deductible amount a plan may impose before services or drugs are covered; (2) any fixed \"copayment\" amount that a plan requires when a specific service or drug is received; or (3) any \"coinsura nce\" amount, a percentage of the total amount paid for a service or drug, that a plan requires when a specific service or drug is received.

In general, if you bring your prescription to a pharmacy and the pharmacy tells you the prescription isn't covered under your plan, that isn't a coverage determination. You need to call or write to your plan to ask for a formal decision about the coverage. Coverage determinations are called \"coverage decisions\" in this booklet. Chapter 9 explains how to ask us for a coverage decision. Covered Drugs - The term we use to mean all of the prescription drugs covered by our plan.

Custodial Care - Custodial care is personal care provided in a nursing home, hospice, or other facility setting when you do not need skilled medical care or skilled nursing care. Custodial care is personal care that can be provided by people who don't have professional skills or training, such as help with activities of daily living like bathing, dressing, eating, getting in or out of a bed or chair, moving around, and using the bathroom.

Covered services are listed in the Benefits Chart in Chapter 4 under the heading \"Home Health Care.\" If you need home health care services, our plan will cover these services for you provided the Medicare coverage requirements are met. Ho me health care can include services from a home health aide if the services are part of the home health plan of care for your illness or injury. They aren't covered unless you are also getting a covered skilled service. Home health services don't include the services of housekeepers, food service arrangements, or full -time nursing care at home.

Initial Enrollment Period - When you are first eligible for Medicare, the period of time when you can sign up for Medicare Part B. For example, if you're eligible for Part B w hen you turn 65, your Initial Enrollment Period is the 7 -month period that begins 3 months before the month you turn 65, includes the month you turn 65, and ends 3 months after the month you turn 65. Late Enrollment Penalty - An amount added to your monthly premium for Medicare drug coverage if you go without creditable coverage (coverage that is expect ed to pay, on average, at least as much as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage) for a continuous period of 63 days or more. You pay this higher amount as long as you have a Medicare drug plan. There are some exceptions. For example, if you receive Extra Help from Medicare to pay your prescription drug plan costs, the late enrollment penalty rules do not apply to you. If you receive Extra Help, you do not pay a penalty, even if you go without \"creditable\" prescription drug coverage. 2013 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic 300 $0 Deductible Rx (HMO) Chapter 12: Definitions of important words 213 List of Covered Drugs (Formulary or \"Drug List\") - A list of prescription drugs covered by the plan.
