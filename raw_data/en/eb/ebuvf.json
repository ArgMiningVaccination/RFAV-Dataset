An acupuncturist places very fine steel needles at \"acupoints\" on the body of the patient. The needles balance the qi or life energy of the body and trigger the production of molecules that aid in the relief of various symptoms and diseases. Read on to learn more about acupuncture and how it can help in keeping your body healthy. What is acupuncture? Fine, solid, metallic needles are inserted into the skin during acupuncture. They are then stimulated by either gentle, targeted hand movements or electrical stimulation. According to practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, the human body has over 2,000 acupuncture points that are connected by meridians. The body's general health is a result of the energy flow that these channels facilitate. A disruption in the flow of energy might result in disease. It is thought that by applying acupuncture to those points, one might improve Qi flow and subsequently one's health. Acupuncture should not be used on everyone. If you decide to see an acupuncturist, talk to your doctor first and seek out a person who is certified and has the required training and credentials. Does acupuncture hurt? Acupuncture might not be suitable for you if you don't like needles. The procedure often involves a practitioner putting a lot of tiny, delicate needles into your skin. Because the needles are so fine, most people claim that it doesn't hurt. But since you must remain still as they penetrate your skin; it might feel uncomfortable. The needles are considerably smaller than those in a flu vaccine, so it won't be very uncomfortable. When the needle is inserted, you might experience a tiny bit of pain, but this normally passes quickly. How can acupuncture affect your body? The central nervous system is said to be influenced by acupuncture sites. Chemicals are then released into the brain, muscles, and spinal cord. These metabolic alterations may activate the body's inherent capacity for healing and foster both physical and psychological wellbeing. Acupuncture is a good therapy in conjunction with traditional therapies to treat the following conditions: Addiction Anxiety Arthritis Asthma Chronic Fatigue Depression Dermatology Problems Diabetic neuropathy Emotional Wellbeing Facial Rejuvenation Fibromyalgia Headaches Migraine Infertility Menopause Pain of all kinds Psoriasis Sexual Dysfunction Skin Problems Sleep - Insomnia Smoking Secession Stress Thyroid Is acupuncture safe? When performed by a skilled professional, acupuncture rarely has complications or adverse side effects. In the United States, the FDA has the authority to regulate acupuncture needles. All needles must be labeled correctly, sterile, non-toxic, and solid. Only trained and licensed professionals may use acupuncture needles. Receiving acupuncture from unregistered professionals might be dangerous. Inexperienced medical staff or those who use non-sterile needles have the potential to cause damage to the CNS (central nervous system), infections, and organ punctures. How often should you get acupuncture? How your body responds, and the complexity of your ailment will define how many appointments you must get. A weekly appointment is the norm for patients. Others seek care regularly based on how long the results last. Your acupuncturist will recommend an acceptable schedule for you. The benefits of acupuncture might not all be apparent after your initial or second session. If you want to give acupuncture a try, schedule at least five appointments. Are other treatments required beside acupuncture? Avoid using acupuncture to put off visiting a doctor about a health issue. Most of the time, acupuncture is used in conjunction with other therapies. For instance, a person with persistent pain will probably use both acupuncture and medicine. A patient with cancer would utilize acupuncture in addition to cancer treatments. No matter how great acupuncture makes you feel, you should keep taking the medications that your doctor has prescribed.
