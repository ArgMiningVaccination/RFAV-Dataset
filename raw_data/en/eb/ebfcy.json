Each one of our providers is patient-centered, meaning that YOU are at the center of every single decision. Please read more about our providers [here](https://www.thekoaclinic.com/practitioners). Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) complete intensive four-year, graduate-level medical school programs and are required to pass professional board exams to become licensed as primary care physicians. In addition to studying pharmaceutical drugs, diagnosis and treatment like an MD, NDs also study natural and holistic approaches to treatment. In the State of Hawaii, NDs are licensed to prescribe all pharmaceutical drugs with the exception of the controlled substances like opioid pain pills, addictive anti-anxiety and sleep meds, and medical marijuana. A cornerstone of the naturopathic approach which differs from an MD, or allopathic approach, is the \"therapeutic order.\" This is a set of guidelines that starts with minimally invasive treatments, such as diet and lifestyle habits, then moves on to herbs and supplements, then drugs, and finally, surgery. While more invasive, or \"higher order,\" treatments may be appropriate for some patients and/or certain disease, we are often able to successfully treat and sometimes even reverse diseases using only the \"lower order\" therapies. NDs believe in the body's natural ability to heal and our treatments and decision-making reflects this belief. The Naturopathic Therapeutic Order: - Reestablish the foundation of health - Identify cause and remove the obstacles to cure - Stimulate self-healing - Use the healing power of nature - Support weakened or damaged systems/organs - Build up deficiencies in diet or lifestyle - Address structural integrity - Correct alignment of bones and muscles - Treat pathology - With natural or substances or drugs depending on severity - Palliative treatment - Treat or suppress symptoms with natural substances or drugs depending on severity - Higher order interventions - Surgery or drugs to maintain health and life For more information on the training, education, and practice of Naturopathic Physicians, please refer to the website of the [American Association "}
