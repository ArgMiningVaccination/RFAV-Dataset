The body is a highly complex web of interrelated functions, all of which need to act in concert with one another. Our goal is to hone in on what core systems of the body are out of balance and restore their function using natural treatments. Chinese Herbal Medicine We specialize in preparing custom formulas from our extensive herbal pharmacy. Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine is the oldest and most comprehensive form of herbal medicine in the world. Chinese herbs are often combined into formulas customized for your specific needs and changed gradually as your condition improves. This allows us to match your signs and symptoms exactly, and enhance the formulas positive effects. Chinese herbs are effective and safe when prescribed by a well-trained herbal practitioner. Careful attention to dosage, combinations of herbs, and any known drug-herb interactions are covered in comprehensive Chinese herbal medicine education programs. Elizabeth has over 3000 hours of training in Oriental Medicine and is NCCAOM Herbal Board Certified. We only use Evergreen herbs, the most trusted GMP certified herb manufacturer in the US. Each batch is checked for safety against bacteria, fungus, heavy metals, and pesticides. All extracts from Evergreen herbs are derived from nature. They do not contain harsh chemicals, fillers, alcohol or preservatives, and are very gentle to your system. Functional Nutrition & Lab Analysis Chronic health problems begin when the body attempts to correct an underlying imbalance by stealing resources needed elsewhere in order to compensate.

If further lab testing is needed, a second 1 hour consult will be needed to go over results before we recommend a plan. Follow-up visits to recheck and adjust your plan are about 20-30 minutes.
