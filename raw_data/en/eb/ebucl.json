If the virus has shown us anything it is our vulnerability to unknown pathogens. With the Covid-19 virus mutating - which viruses do, even with the vaccine, we are not guaranteed protected. As viruses and other environmental pathogens tend to live amongst us, now more than ever we have realised the importance of having a strong immune system, if not for prevention than to avoid long term effects. It is time to look towards the wisdom of traditional practices such as Ayurveda for natural ways to build our resistance and our ability to recover. Immunity according to Ayurveda The Ayurvedic view of immunity is based on the concept of inherited reserve and acquired reserve. In the Ayurvedic Classics, it is literally known as 'vyadhi-kshmatva' or 'self-avoidance of disease'. Vyadhi-kshmatva is composed of two words - Vyadhi + Kshamatva where Vyadhi means 'Disease' or 'Illness' and defines 3 types of immunity: Sehaja vyadhi-kshmatva- That which we inherit by birth and is genetic. Vyadhija vyadhi-kshmatva- That which develops when an antigen pervades our body. Our immune system generates specific antibodies against that specific antigen to protect our body. Yuktikrit Vyadhi-kshmatva: That which is acquired through a healthy diet, lifestyle, and general well-being. Factors that either build our immunity or cause it to decline are: - Our unique Prakruti (natural body constitution), healthy Kapha's tend to have a better immune system than Vata's. - Health of Ojas (the essence of our Dhatu's or body tissues) - Agnibala or our digestive power - Balance or equilibrium of the Doshas within us - State of Mind or Mansika Doshas Health of Ojas: The quality of your inherited (Sahaj) and acquired (yukti) organ reserve is generically known as Ojas. Ojas holds a special place in Ayurveda as it nourishes and orders the functioning of the body. To fight infections and pathogens is to build Ojas -the essence of our inherited organ reserve, digested nutrition, and our experiences. If it is depleted, disease can set in. Agnibala, our digestive power: A good digestion and Gut health are key in Ayurveda. A healthy digestion nourishes the tissues (sapta dhatu), which in turn feeds the heart and builds immunity. If digestion is impaired, then it cannot metabolize the appropriate nutrients required for nourishment of the tissues and results in the depletion of Ojas. A weak digestive fire accumulates toxic, known as ama, which can clog the channels and obscure nutritional absorption and emotional assimilation. State of Mind - Mansika Doshas The seat of Ojas is the heart and therefore emotional balance and nourishment plays an integral part in normal functioning of our immune system. From the heart originate prana; the source of breath, manas; mental balance and rasa the source for nutrition. Therefore, Ayurveda emphasis on daily rituals (Dina Charya) that nourish both the physical body and emotional heart for a strong immune system. Increase immunity the healthy way. To enhance our immune function from an Ayurvedic context comes from having a balanced healthy diet, lifestyle including daily rituals and incorporating herbs, that maintain balance of the Doshas, strengthen our digestion and build healthy tissues (Ojas). Diet and your immune system: The foundations of a healthy immune system are based on a whole food diet, avoidance of eating poor quality foods that have been refined, heavily processed and are stale or rancid. Avoid over-eating and stimulants such as coffee and alcohol which lower Agni and immunity. Our Nutrition directly affects Ojas and builds or weakens our immunity. Natural, organic food is always best but not always essential, its far more important to have a whole food diet. Include vegetables that are loaded with macro and micro-nutrients, antioxidants, carotenoids, all essential for a healthy defensive system. Eat a diet rich in vitamin A, B, C, E, iodine, selenium, manganese, zinc. Increase chlorophyll rich foods such as spinach, collard greens, mustard greens, spirulina, parsley, and broccoli. Yellow and orange vegetables such as carrots, squash and pumpkin rich in beta-carotene. Most fruits are loaded with various vitamins and minerals that are required in traces and play a major role in the healthy functioning of our body and strengthen our immune system. Add fresh fruits such as Berries, apricots, apple and among citrus fruits -oranges, which are a rich source of Vitamin C that helps to build new cells and strengthen our immune system. Dry fruits and nuts such as Almonds, walnuts, and raisins, are a good source of potassium, magnesium, Vitamin A, Vitamin B, Vitamin C, all essential for a strong defence. Pulses are a rich source of protein and our building blocks. I tend to favour Green Gram (mung beans) - as its easier to digest and rich in folate and potassium, antioxidants. Sprouted Mung beans are a great way to boost your immunity. Spices: Adding spice to your winter diet is a natural way to maintain and restore the functions of the immune system. Spices such as ginger, turmeric, Tulsi and garlic have anti-bacterial and anti-microbial properties and possess immune-modulator properties as well as keeping the digestion strong. Milk and Ghee Milk and Ghee paly a vital role in Ayurveda towards building Ojas. Milk is considered a complete food, full of nutrients, provided you are not lactose intolerant. I usually recommend my clients to have Golden Milk (milk with turmeric) over the winter months and sometimes even recommend adding 1 teaspoon of ghee for those with Gut issues. Lifestyle and Daily Rituals Along with a healthy diet, a healthy lifestyle is also important. Yoga, Pranayama, and regular exercise are all factors that boost a strong immune system. Being outdoors in nature with enough exposure to Vitamin D are invaluable to a healthy immune system. Daily rituals (Dina Charya) are the cornerstone of maintaining good health. A good winter wellness routine would be: - Starting the day with a glad of warm water and honey, to stimulate the digestion and help move the bowels. Honey is also a great for eliminating toxins. - Brushing your teeth and scraping your tongue - Oil pulling using sesame oil or [medicated mouth wash](https://triveda.co.uk/products/daily-mouth-wash)to remove pathogens. - Keeping our bodies naturally lubricated through daily abhyanga (self-massage) and avoiding dryness from the winter months, which builds our bodies defence, calms the mind, and grounds our central nervous system. [Dhanvantari Tailam](https://triveda.co.uk/products/daily-massage-oil)is suitable for massage throughout the year. Allow to soak in for 20 minutes before you shower. - Nasya: Instil 1 -2 drops of [Anu Tailam](https://triveda.co.uk/products/nasya-oil)in each nostril to lubricate the nasal passages and protect them against pathogens.
