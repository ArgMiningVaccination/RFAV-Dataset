After living in several countries, he observed those who had a healthy diet rich in [fruits and vegetables](https://www.healthcanal.com/nutrition/best-fruit-vegetable-supplements) were generally healthy. In contrast, those who experienced food insecurity and lacked proper nutrition were often unwell. As his interest in nutrition grew, Dr. Howard began to learn more about phytonutrients, or phytochemicals, which are compounds a plant develops to stay healthy and prevent damage. Although Dr. Howard found that phytonutrients are beneficial to humans to maintain optimal health, he realized there wasn't just one phytonutrient that was a magical cure. As research progressed, he discovered thousands of phytonutrients found in plant-based foods that work together to promote overall health and wellness. With his newfound knowledge, Dr. Howard founded Balance of Nature to combat the lack of nutritional value in standard diets today and provide people with proper nutrition and a variety of phytonutrients to live healthier lives.

Is It Safe To Use? Generally, the Balance of Nature products is safe for most people. According to their website, all products are tested in an independent laboratory by a third party. However, it does not appear that there are any public lab reports available at this time. To add even more concern, in 2019, the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/evig-llc-dba-balance-nature-580888-08202019)[1] (FDA) sent a warning letter to Balance of Nature because their products were not meeting Current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and they did not have a system in place to verify supplement quality. The letter also reports that the company claimed its products could prevent, cure, or treat disease, which is against the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Let's see what customers say about the product: Balance of Nature Whole Health System Ingredients All products offered by Balance of Nature are made from 100% natural, whole foods and are free of additives, fillers, added sugars, pesticides, or synthetics. They're also non-GMO and gluten-free. As of today, over 500 million products have been sold worldwide. One of their best sellers is the Whole Health System, which includes their Fruits and Veggies capsules and Fiber & Spice blend. From seeds to the skin, Balance of Nature utilizes every part of the produce they source to keep its natural chemistry. Many companies use heat and light that result in oxidation, causing many nutrients to be destroyed. Balance of Nature uses a unique system of flash-drying fruits and veggies to prevent oxidation resulting in a pure, clean fruit and vegetable supplement. Unfortunately, Balance of Nature Supplements does not have a \"USDA Organic\" seal. According to the company, this is mainly because they sometimes go outside of the United States to get higher-quality produce. Balance of Nature reports that products from other countries go through rigorous testing to ensure it is free of pesticides, harmful chemicals, and heavy metals. In addition to its dietary supplement, Balance of Nature also offers health coaching to educate and support preferred customers both mentally and physically. If you choose to buy without signing up for the preferred customer subscription, you will not have access to the Health Coaching Program.

Most of the complaints are related to poor customer service, delayed shipping, and the product simply not working. Let's dig a little deeper into what real users are saying about Balance of Nature products. Balance of Nature Honest Reviews \"I'm on my third month of this stuff - hasn't done anything for me yet. I am a 62-year-old man in good shape looking for more energy. This stuff is definitely not the answer. Avoid the advertising hype and just stay away.\" 1 out of 5 stars, verified Amazon rating.Michael \"I've watched all their commercials with testimonials and thought why not to try it. But after receiving Balance or Nature, it stinks to high heaven. Still it for a while and discontinued after 2 weeks. I did not notice a single difference in how I felt but did notice losing money out of my bank account for wasting money on this product. I also bought their Cinnamon Fiber, and that was awful!! And do not recommend it at all. You're better off with a great tasting of Metamucil as fiber instead. Oh, and another thing is that I could not find an ingredients list anywhere. Even if they say they make this stuff in a cold refrigerated environment to ensure freshness, I can guarantee it's probably not. I'd stay away from this product.\" 1 out of 5 stars, verified Amazon rating.Tommy Health Benefits Of Balance of Nature As most of us know, eating a diet rich in fruits and veggies may [reduce the risk](https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/downloads/fruits-vegetables/2018/2018-fruit-vegetable-report-508.pdf#:~:text=Eating%20a%20diet%20rich%20in%20fruits%20and%20vegetables,including%20heart%20disease%2C%20type%C2%A02%C2%A0diabetes%2C%20some%20cancers%2C%20and%20obesity.)[2] of obesity and chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. Balance of Nature does not claim to cure or prevent disease but emphasizes the importance of plant-based foods to help our body repair itself. Though the company has researched the effectiveness of its fruit and veggie supplements, none of the studies are published in peer-reviewed journals. One [clinical trial](https://cms.balanceofnature.com/admin/uploads/file/branding-guide/cirrhosis-study-hep-c-study.pdf)[3] from 2004-2006 evaluated the use of Balance of Nature on patients with chronic hepatitis in the cirrhotic stage. The experimental group received triple doses of Balance of Nature for different durations of time. The study concluded that Balance of Nature might improve liver function in those with cirrhosis. Another animal [study](https://cms.balanceofnature.com/admin/uploads/file/branding-guide/the-effects-of-balance-of-nature-upon-lactation-in-rats.pdf)[4] on lactating rats suggested that Balance of Nature may increase milk production and prolactin level. Additional studies on fruit and vegetable powders similar to those offered by the company have also shown potential health benefits. One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16775552/)[5] discovered that fruit and vegetable food supplements might reduce exercise-induced oxidative stress. However, the study also notes the need for additional research. In one [clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3023145/)[6], healthcare professionals in Germany were given a fruit or vegetable supplement or a placebo for eight months. Researchers discovered that the group who took the fruit and vegetable supplements had 20% fewer moderate or severe cold symptom days. A 2019 [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6912365/)[7] took a look at the effect of fruit and vegetable concentrate supplementation on risk factors for non-communicable diseases. Researchers found that taking encapsulated fruit and vegetable concentrate may decrease risk factors associated with heart disease. However, these studies were small, and more research should be done to further investigate the potential benefits of supplementation. One [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5548066/)[8] from 2017 found that psyllium supplementation may help improve symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Potential Risks & Side Effects Dr. Howard reports Balance of Nature supplements are safe for most people, including those who are pregnant or nursing. They're also safe for children. According to their website, Balance of Nature products will not interfere with any other medications. However, the Fruits blend does contain grapefruit. Some medicines are known to interact with grapefruit and can cause side effects if taken together. The veggie capsules also contain soybean, which is probably not safe for people with a soy allergy. It's always important to talk to your physician before starting dietary supplements, even if it only contains fruits and veggies. If you're not used to a high-fiber diet, adding a dietary fiber supplement may cause unwanted gastrointestinal discomfort, including gas, abdominal cramps, and bloating. How To Take Balance of Nature Vitamins? According to their website, you should take three Fruits and three Veggies capsules each day for a total of 6 capsules. You can choose to swallow the entire capsule with a beverage, chew the pill as a treat, or break open the capsule and sprinkle the fruit and vegetable powders on top of your meals. They're also safe to cook with and can be added to baked goods, smoothies, eggs, and more. Users should consume the Fiber & Spice blend once daily. To make the fiber drink, mix two scoops in a glass of water or apple juice. Where To Buy Balance of Nature Supplements?
