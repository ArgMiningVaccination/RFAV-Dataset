He has gotten me to a place where I'm now the healthiest I have ever been in my adult life! I have been lucky to be a patient at A Balanced Life Healthcare. It is conveniently located in the inner Southeast, at a tastefully decorated space. Nothing about it looks or feels as a doctor's office - and I mean that in the best possible way. The atmosphere is warm, welcoming, and calm Dr. Kahn is the first doctor I felt comfortable enough to go to repeatedly. She's wonderful. She's thoughtful, nice, compassionate, and she listens to you. Like really listens. She gets a picture of your health as a whole, rather than just concentrating on one thing. Never have I received such thoughtful and comprehensive healthcare from a primary care physician than at A Balanced Life Healthcare with Dr. Sean Horan. They have a thorough, compassionate and professional way of addressing my health concerns. They share their wide breadth of knowledge and have referred me to specialists when my concerns fall outside their function as primary care physicians. Thank you for all your hard work and care! Dr. Julie Kahn is the best health care doctor I've had in her field. I had a Mirena put in by her & had the best experience, she is personal & caring... I'd had a previous experience of the Mirena inserted by a doctor where the experience wasn't sensitive & the doctor was not as cautious. I highly recommend Dr. Kahn! I see both Dr. Kahn and Dr. Horan and I am huge fans of both. I am newish to Portland and consider myself lucky to have found such thoughtful and thorough doctors, and a real bonus for being in the same practice. They go above and beyond with their patients and I highly recommend them to anyone seeking the same excellent care. I would see Dr. Khan over anyone else because she makes me feel calm and comfortable during each appointment. You can't get that with just any doctor. She listens and truly cares about every detail. Don't go anywhere else! Dr. Horan has been a fantastic provider... I 100% would recommend Dr. Horan to others, especially if you are in the LQBTQIA+ community. The office feels cozy and comfortable. It feels like it would be a welcoming place for all. I can't say enough good things I'm so grateful A Balanced Life came into my path and even more grateful Dr Julie Khan has been taking care of my needs over the last year. It's a blessing there are state programs to help me receive care I need and it's an extra blessing I have such an open and caring doctor to help me. She listens fully and always makes sure I am comfortable throughout my appointment. Dr. Sean Horan approached each of the (many) concerns I had with an openness and candid approach unfamiliar to me in healthcare settings. He listened and educated me consistently while showing compassion and humility that made treatments much more comfortable. Over the course of a few months I'm feeling confident in my care and health and am very grateful to Dr. Horan for that. Dr. Kahn is a very kind and caring individual. She is sincerely interested in your needs and helping you with your health goals. Dr. Horan is absolutely amazing! He is skilled, non-intrusive, SO caring and just a good doctor. As a queer person it feels like I have an ally in my health and I feel seen in options for my care without judgement. It feels like he's really looking out for you, like a true community doctor. Every word in his bio feels true for me. Dr. Kahn is wonderful. She takes so much time going over your health and listening before every exam, I've never felt so comfortable with a doctor. I didn't have insurance for a few years and the office was always so helpful in making sure I got as much covered as I could through various programs. I can't recommend her enough! I've been a patient of Dr. Horan for about a year now. He is amazing. He is thoughtful, non-judgemental, and as kind as can be. I've had some negative experiences with doctors being pushy and I have never felt that way with Sean. Being into health/wellness I am big on natural medicine, so it's very comforting knowing that at this clinic I will have both perspectives, medical and herbal/medicinal. I am so glad that I found A Balanced Life Health Care!
