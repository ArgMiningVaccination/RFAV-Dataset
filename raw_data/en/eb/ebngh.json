The workshopbrought together academics, grassrootsworkers and activists to dialogue on healthdevelopment work in tribal India, histori-cally and in the current political climate. David Hardiman began by introducing the theme of medical power as it relatesto the tribal peoples of India. Since the late19th century, an increasing number ofgroups have sought to provide healthcarefor these people. The British colonial rulerswere concerned above all with controllingand opening the tribal territories to exploittheir forests and other resources, and theyestablished dispensaries that catered largelyfor officials rather than the mass of thepeople. They were followed by protestantmissionaries, who provided medical careas a means to gain the sympathy of tribalpeoples with a view to ultimately convert-ing them to Christianity. This process wasinitially contested during the early 20thcentury by Gandhian and other national-ists, with their own views on sanitation,cleanliness and health. After independencein 1947, the state extended its programmethrough primary health centres (PHCs)and various preventive campaigns - suchas vaccination, inoculations, and DDTspraying to eliminate mosquitoes. Others entered the scene, such as committedNGO workers, catholic fathers and nuns,evangelistic faith healers, religious organisations, and po litical and quasi- political groups. Despite all this attention,healthcare in these areas is at best patchy,and generally highly inadequate. In India as a whole, the tribal peoples today make up about 8 per cent of the totalpopulation of over one billion. They belongto a range of kinship-based communitiesassociated with interior regions that areoften hilly with poor soil. During thecolonial period, they were excluded fromlarge tracts of their homelands, which werereserved for government-controlled for-ests. Subsequently, many have been dis-placed through large-scale irrigation andother development projects. As a result ofthese processes, many are unable now tomake a living from the low-grade landthey retain, and have to work as migrantlabourers outside their own region, forexample as seasonal agricultural labourersand on construction sites in the towns andmore prosperous rural areas. Their con-ditions of work are very bad, they live intemporary camps or slums, and wages arelow and often paid only partially. Theirgeneral condition is characterised bypoverty, social exclusion, susceptibility toexploitation, and poor health. The desireto provide improved health services forthe tribal tracts has a number of causes.For some, such as NGO workers and a fewdedicated doctors, there is a commitmentto social service. For others, such as many official health workers, it is just a careerposting which they have to fulfil on theorders of their employer, the government.Politicians have a vested interest in ap-pearing to provide healthcare in such areas,for the scheduled tribes are importantwithin the modern Indian political system.Since Indian independence in 1947, theirvote has been decisive in a significantnumber of parliamentary and state assem-bly seats. In Gujarat, for example, 26 outof a total of 18 state assembly seats(14 percent) are reserved for the sched-uled tribes, which in tight elections wouldbe enough to determine the result. For thisreason, different political fractions of thedominant classes have a strong interest inextending their power and influence overthe tribal peoples, and health and healingis a major weapon in their armoury in thisrespect. In addition, improved healthprofiles in such tracts help to open themup for economic exploitation by outsiders,as well as to provide a potential base fora growing market in internal tourism. The keynote address was then given by Jan Breman, who raised the question asto why we should focus on the tribal peoplein such a workshop. Taking an EPW article of 1993 by A M Shah as his startingpoint, 1 Breman argued - contra to Shah - that it is important to distinguish tribalpeoples from other poor and disadvan-taged people in India. While Shah arguedthat the concept of the \"tribe\" was a co-lonial construct that worked to divide theHindu community, Breman argued thatcaste Hindus have always seen the tribalsas a people apart, labelling them withderogatory terms such as 'kaliparaj' (\"blackpeople\") or 'janglis' (the \"wild and un-tamed\"). Today, rather than being inte-grated within the wider Hindu society onequal terms, they are accepted only in somuch as they are prepared to accept theirlot as a highly exploited and subservientworking class. At best, they can be incor-porated as a caste at the lower levels ofthe caste system. Breman therefore con-cluded that it is important to treat tribalpeople as a separate analytic category, inpart because the history of the expropria-tion of their resources and subsequent socialincorporation has its own particularquality, and in part because they continue'Healing, Medical Power and the Poor: Contestsin Tribal India' A recent workshop in Surat on access to healing and medical intervention for tribal people brought together academics, grassroots workers and activists and revealed deterioratingtraditional systems and inadequate and/or exploitative state and private interventions for these communities. Rather than exoticising and romanticising tribal communities, it is theirpauperisation that needs to be addressed and remedied.CommentaryEconomic and Political Weekly April 21, 2007 1405to be discriminated against and stigmatised. His address did not go unnoticed in theGujarati press, which is known for itsespousal of a strong Hindutva line, andwhich set about distorting what he had saidto create sensationalist headlines. Forexample, the local Surat daily The Gujarat Mitra stated that Hardiman (sic) had claimed that \"tribals are not Hindus\". Infact, Breman had been trying to show theadverse ways in which many tribals arebecoming Hinduised - but this subtletywas ignored. Their failure to even get thename of the presenter correct also revealedthe shoddiness of their reporting. Follow-ing that, in a subsequent issue of the samepaper, Swami Ambrishanand of the HinduMilan Mandir challenged Hardiman - to prove that tribals are not Hindus.The English language press in Gujarat, onthe other hand, took a largely noncommit-tal line, avoiding controversy. Indigenous Healing Systems In the first thematic session, the focus was on the tribal systems of healing,particularly how such forms of healinghave changed over time, and their roletoday. The myths and legends of the tribalpeople reveal that they suffered from awide range of ailments - endemic as wellas epidemic - in the past. They were leftlargely to their own devices when ill, withmost healing being carried out by relativesand neighbours using herbal and other folkremedies. Tribal specialists or 'ojha'), who divination andexorcism, the more intractable cases.These people were highly respected andhad considerable social power. These formsof indigenous healing have continued andevolved, and are still practised very widelyin tribal areas to this day. Today, some ofthese healers practise a hybrid form ofhealing that combines ritual with variousquasi-allopathic or complementarymedical practices. In general, colonialofficials, missionaries and the western-educatedIndian elites have been un-sympathetic towards such practices, thoughin recent years drug companies as well asforest officials have sought to exploit theirknowledge of herbal remedies. Suchhealers do not generally like to impart theirknowledge to others, and this can createtensions. In his paper, Minoo Parabia argued that his investigations in tribal south Gujarathad revealed the use of over 2,000 speciesof medicinal plants, a number far higher than the plant remedies known about inayurvedic medicine (in all, ayurvedic textsspeak of about 650 plants, 250 of whichcannot be properly identified). He esti-mated that in India as a whole, tribal peopleuse about 6,000 species in their healing.There is here, he argued, a rich resourcethat is being under-utilised, especially asthere is evidence that some of these plantscan treat conditions that are consideredincurable in allopathic medicine. As it is,modern development is leading to a rapiddeterioration in the tribal environment, witha resulting destruction and loss of manyof these plants. He himself is working ona scheme to enable tribal healers to begranted plots of forest land where they cangrow and collect plants, process them, andthen practise from a special centre at Ahwain the Dangs. In the next paper, S Kamegam provided a detailed account of a healing ritualperformed by the Kani tribe of the TamilNadu-Kerala border region, which is knownas 'Chattrupattu'. This is a community-based ritual that is designed to rid thewhole social space of malign influences.Despite the advent of modern medicalfacilities, the ritual continues to be popu-lar, as it satisfies a demand for community-based healing over and above the moreindividualistic forms of healing providedby allopathy. The main problem with it is that it costs a lot to perform, as the ritual specialists have to be provided with aconsiderable amount of paraphernalia. In his paper, Amit Mitra adopted a sceptical tone towards the whole subjectof indigenous medicine. He said that ourknowledge of it came originally fromcolonial officials and missionaries. Theclassic work on tribal medicine was writ-ten by the Norwegian missionary Bodding,who worked amongst the Santals ofJharkhand from 1889 to 1933. Bodding,he argued, tended to exoticise indigenousbeliefs about disease and healing, focusingin particular on beliefs about witchcraftand evil spirits. He also propagatedromanticised beliefs about the healingpowers of forest plants and herbs. As it is,since the 1940s, the Santals have reliedmainly on allopathic healers, who provide\"fast\" medicine such as injections and salinedrips - normally at a very high price. Manyof these are quacks without formal quali-fications. In a survey that he carried outin Dumka district, he found that 45 per centof tribals consulted a private doctor withsome form of qualification, 19 per centwent to quacks, 5 per cent went to a government establishment, 2 per cent useda medical shop only, while only 2 per centconsulted the 'ojha' and 'jaributi' (tradi-tional healers). The remainder (27 per cent)failed to get any treatment at all. Mitraargued that the forest environment inJharkhand has deteriorated to such an extentthat no healing herbs are effectively avail-able. Calls for indigenous medicine to berevived take no heed of this present reality.They rely on romanticised notions of atribal past that in itself can be questioned.The paper proved controversial, both interms of its critique of colonial forms ofknowledge and the extent to which itsfindings were more widely applicable. Itwas argued that Bodding was a carefulethnographer whose findings have beenreinforced in subsequent anthropologicalstudies, and also that divination andexorcism continue to be widely practisedin tribal regions to heal psychosomaticproblems. This latter area was ignored inthe paper that had focused only on physicalailments and their treatment. Also, it wasargued that Mitra had failed to show howand why allopathic treatment has becomemore popular in recent decades. Scientific Medicine and Faith Healing There were two papers in this panel, one by David Hardiman on Christian therapiesin tribal Gujarat, and the other by PradipChattopadhyay on Christian and national-ist healing for the Santals of Bankura andBirbhum districts of West Bengal. In hispaper, Hardiman argued that the mission-aries began to focus on the tribal regionsof Gujarat from the 1880s onwards. Therelevant missions were all protestant -there were no Roman catholic missionsworking in these areas until the 1960s.They found that they could win sympathyand converts through medical work, andthey therefore invested much energy andfinance in establishing dispensaries andhospitals. They were the first people toprovide biomedical care for the tribals inany systematic way. The missionaries ofteninsisted that Christian converts renouncethe indigenous healers, who they viewedas their rivals, and this could give rise tolocal conflicts. The foreign protestantmissionaries won very few converts intribal Gujarat, largely because of suchconflicts. This has changed in recent yearsas Indian Christians, mainly from southIndia, have won a wider base through aEconomic and Political Weekly April 21, 2007 1406very different form of therapy - that of faith healing. Although this can in onesense be seen as a form of indigenisation- with Indian pastors using methods thatare understood and appreciated by tribalpeoples - we may understand it also as theassertion of an alternative form of healingthat is every bit as \"modern\" as allopathicmedicine. Faith healing by bodies such asthe Pentecostalists has come to the fore inrecent years as much in the rich countriesof the west as in the poor and underde-veloped tribal belts of India. Moreover, itlikewise has a global presence, as reportsfrom tribal villages in India of miraculouscures through faith are consumed asnarratives of healing by a worldwide Chris-tian audience through the internet. 2 In his paper, Pradip Chattopadhyay argued thatthe santals have had a holistic understand-ing of health, in which healing is rootedwithin the community. In recent years,however, fractures have appeared in thisholistic approach, with the emergence ofmore individualistic health-seekingbehaviour and the growth of a medicalmarket place. In the discussion that followed, Jan Breman argued that allopathic medicinefocuses on the individual in isolation froma social context, and thus fails to satisfya continuing desire for community-basedhealing. The popularity of healing dramasperformed by evangelical Christians shouldbe understood in such terms. On the wholehowever, such healing performances arelikely to be strongest in situations in whichthe community retains some integrity. Inthe case of the highly depressed and ex-ploited halpatis of the plains regions ofsouth Gujarat, it is hard to find any greatsense of community solidarity or evenstrong religiosity and he had heard somepeople say that \"my god is my liquor\".They drink to dull the physical and mentalpain of their lives, they lack access to eitherindigenous or allopathic forms of healing,and most die before the age of fifty, oftenthrough liver cirrhosis. The problem hereis above all one of intense exploitation andgrinding poverty. Large numbers of dis-placed and migrant tribal people live suchlives in India today. Private Practitioners The third session of the workshop was on private practitioners. Gauri Raje pre-sented a paper on private doctors in theDangs district of Gujarat. The doctors thatshe studied are a very individualised group,with no strong community base in the area. They come from various parts of India, andbelong to many different castes. Some,who have had full medical training and aremore scrupulous in their practice, are highlyrespected, tending to cater for the localsocial and political elites. Others are poorlyqualified, or lack any qualifications at all(one even claimed to have forgotten wherehe had qualified from!). They treat a rangeof acute illnesses, such as fevers, respira-tory infections, as well as general \"weak-ness\" (a common complaint). These doc-tors rely mainly on penicillin injectionsand saline bottles. Their abilities are nottaken for granted, and a botched treatmentcan lead to a sudden end to practice. Theytend to divide areas of work amongthemselves, being often fiercely posses-sive of \"their\" villages. They often givetreatment on credit, taking from 40 per centto 50 per cent in interest, thus establishingthemselves in a patron-client relationshiptowards their tribal patients. The tribals donot however assume that such doctors arebetter in all circumstances, and many ill-nesses are still treated by local healers -the bhagats. The quacks do not in generalintrude into this sphere of healing. Ingeneral, it is believed that private medicineis superior to state medicine. If treatmentis given free of charge, as at a PrimaryHealth Centre, it is assumed that the doctorhas no liability to cure properly, and that the medicine will be no good. In his paper, M Saji examined the prob- lems faced by tribal people who takeadvantage of reservations to gain medicaltraining. He found that they are oftendiscriminated against in medical colleges,finding it hard, for example, to clear theoral tests conducted by high casteexaminers. They also face discriminationwhen they start to practise. He argued thatthe dominant medical discourse in Indiamakes it very hard for tribals to gainlegitimacy within the medical system.Constant questions are raised about theiralleged incompetence on the grounds thatineptitude is rewarded over and above meritfor political reasons. Non-governmental Work Continuing in the tradition established by the missionaries and then nationalists,many non-governmental organisations arenow involved in health projects of one sortor another in tribal areas. Bina Sengarprovided a history of one such group,Archvahini in Gujarat. The project wasinitiated in 1977 by doctors associatedwith the Sarvodaya movement, with onebase initially in Mangrol on the banks ofthe Narmada. They believed in providinghigh-quality allopathic treatment in a INSTITUTE FOR DEFENCE STUDIES AND ANALYSES CHAIR IN DEFENCE ECONOMICS The above Chair has been set up at the Institute to promote policy-oriented research in the area of Defence Economics.

They have with some success fought the notionthat \"good\" allopathy lies in the use ofinjections and drips, and have gained areputation in the area for providing effec-tive cures by other forms of treatment. AnilPatel, currently in charge at Mangrol, isa strong advocate of allopathic treatment,stating that he is prepared to be open minded about non-allopathic remedies, but only if they have been proved through clinicaltests. Asish Satav, a Gandhian, then talkedabout his own Melghat, a tribalarea of eastern Maharashtra. He talkedabout the severe health problems found inthis backward tract, with high infantmortality, acute malnutrition, widespreadtuberculosis, anaemia, malaria and AIDS.There is also serious addiction to alcoholand tobacco amongst the tribal people ofthat area. He described how his projectprovides all-round clinical and preventivecare, and also runs a campaign to persuadepeople to give up liquor and tobacco. Inboth cases, dedicated work by committeddoctors had achieved admirable results inparticular localities. The question that arosein the discussion was to what extent suchmodels could be duplicated on a widerbasis, given the severe lack of such dedi-cated medical workers in India in general.What happens when the charismatic indi-viduals who run such schemes depart thescene or retire? There were also short presentations of four NGO health projects in Gujarat. SonalShroff spoke about a project among tribalpeople who were displaced thirty-five yearsago by the Ukai dam on the Tapi river insouth Gujarat. The displacement area is aparticularly depressed one, with a largeproportion of the population relying onmigrating out annually to earn their live-lihood. Shroff pointed out that most NGOand other health projects are village-based,which means that migrants have no accessto such facilities for most of the year.Being considered \"non-residents\" in theplains regions where they work, they areunable to access effective healthcare there.Ketan Zaveri spoke about his work for theBhansali Trust, and Shubhalaxmiand Dhare about their work for SEWA.SEWA is a trade union of women workingin the informal sector, and it works mainlyto facilitate access for its members togovernment healthcare. However, it alsoencourages self-medication through herbalremedies and ayurvedic treatment.Ashwin Shah and then talkedabout their work at Kharel in Navsaridistrict. Although this area is in close proxi- mity to a number of medical centres, thelocal halpati community as well as theincoming tribal migrant labourers makevery little use of such facilities. Instead, theyrely on their own devices, such as brandingwith a hot iron. There is very high malnutri-tion caused by poverty, and high rates ofinfant mortality. The doctors found it parti-cularly hard to persuade the halpatis tomake use of their facilities, due to - so theysaid - their poverty, ignorance and super-stitious beliefs. Alcohol addiction is a parti-cularly grave problem amongst the localtribals, and most die before the age of 50. These presentations brought out the fact that NGOs are faced with a variety of localproblems, and that they adopt many dif-ferent approaches to healing. Some adherestrictly to allopathy; others are more eclec-tic in their approach. Much depends on theparticular political and ideological lean-ings of each group. Some are much moresuccessful than others. It was pointed outin the discussion that the government hasbeen depending increasingly on NGOs tocarry out fundamental health work in India.In this, the Indian government is merelyfollowing wider directives laid down bybodies such as the World Bank and WorldTrade Organisation that have an ideologi-cal commitment to decreasing governmen-tal welfare programmes. 3 Funds are being increasingly channelled into the NGOsector, allowing for the proliferation ofmany sub-standard, or even bogus NGOs.It also absolves the government of respon-sibility for healthcare. NGOs may lack theappropriate qualifications and facilities forthe tasks they take on, and they are alsonot accountable to the electorate. Althoughit is clear that government health projectsare often mistrusted - for good reason -it was agreed that NGOs can never be anadequate substitute for systematic healthschemes implemented by the state. Nomads and Women There were two papers in the last the- matic session - one on migrant cattleherders, and the other on women's health.Chakraverti Mahajan spoke on the tran-shumant gujjar pastoralists Muslim community wasdesignated a \"criminal tribe\" by the colo-nial state, and although they were denotifiedin 1952, they still continue to be regardedwith suspicion by the police and authori-ties. In 1991 they were designated as ascheduled tribe. Their annual migration topastures in the Himalayas has been re- placed increasingly by migration to placesin the plains, for example to the Punjaband Haryana. Being often on the move,they used in the past to take care of theirown health needs. Today, they tend to besuspicious of state medicine. For example,during the recent polio vaccination cam-paign they refused to allow their childrento be vaccinated, on the grounds that it ledto impotence and sterility. After theythreatened the vaccinators, the police werecalled and the children were vaccinated byforce. Nowadays, they tend to look toquacks for treatment, haggling with themover the treatment and price of medicine.In the discussion, Jan Breman commentedthat qualified allopathic doctors generallyadopt a haughty attitude towards theirpatients, diagnosing and prescribing with-out debate. Quacks are different; they aremore interactive with their patients, debat-ing the problem and negotiating the treat-ment. They sell their medications, makingthem seem efficacious and they may evenbargain. This makes them more approach-able for people such as the gujjars. Ratnawali presented a paper on the health problems of women in tribal south Gujarat.She argued that they still depend to a largeextent on their traditional remedies, suchas divination, exorcism, herbal remedies,branding with a hot iron, and incisionsinto the skin. For childbirth, women resortmainly to 'dais' (traditional birth atten-dants), whom they generally trust morethan doctors to deliver their babies. Thedais cannot however cope with difficultcases. The dais use local herbal remedies(e g, placing herbs on the womb to facili-tate delivery), although in many cases theyhave in recent years received some medi-cal training as well. There are also so-called \"female health workers\" who areresponsible for family planning; they takewomen to be sterilised, and generally lackany medical skills. The general picture isone of severe deficiency in any modernmedical facilities for tribal women.Ratnawali said that she had found thatwhen good facilities are made available,tribal women generally make use of themwillingly. Pauperised Tribal of Modern India In the final discussion, Jan Breman spoke with great feeling of the contradictoryattitudes that high caste and elite peopleadopt towards tribal people. Over the pastEconomic and Political Weekly April 21, 2007 1408century they have been increasingly inte- grated into caste society as a subordinatecaste, so that they are often depicted nowas \"backward Hindus\". Despite this, theunderstanding is that they have not yetbeen entirely tamed, as they retain someof their older beliefs, customs and formsof community solidarity. There is acontinuing feeling among caste Hindus thattribal people can exercise a malign poweragainst them, for example through theirdiviners and exorcists. At the same time,they are also romanticised, as being fun-loving, childlike, in touch with nature,always dancing and playing their flutes.Researchers tend to go in search of the\"purest\" tribals, deep in the hills and forests.They exoticise their customs, includingtheir modes of healing. For example,branding with a hot iron is depicted as a\"tribal\" remedy. Yet, it was practised bycaste Hindus not so long ago, as is clearfrom a reading of biographies of SardarVallabhbhai Patel, who is praised for hiscourage in branding himself with a red rotiron as a boy. This exoticising merely feedsa desire by the middle class to keep alivetheir dreams of a paradise lost. In reality,the large majority of tribal people in Indiatoday live in highly degraded environ-ments, or survive by migrant labour incommercial farms and other enterprises onthe plains, or in cities. Yet, where are theresearchers studying the tribal in the tran-sitory labour-camp, or in the city slum?They are few and far in between. Thispauperised class has very little access tohealth care of any sort. They are frequentlyaddicted to liquor, and die at a compara-tively young age. Today, for the mostpart,the study of contemporary tribalsneeds to focus on their pauperised condi-tions of life, and the ongoing discrimi-nation that they face in caste society. Itwas on this salutary note that theworkshop ended.
