Please visit the [Interim COVID-19 vaccine schedules](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html) to obtain the most updated guidance on COVID-19 vaccinations. Guidance for use of Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine has been removed as the vaccine is [no longer available](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/index.html) in the United States. The [FDA amended the EUA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-bivalent-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-booster-dose?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalentto provide for a single booster dose of the vaccine in children 6 months through 4 years of age at least 2 months after completion of primary vaccination. Now that the COVID-19 vaccines are widely available for children and adolescents 6 months and older, parents and caregivers may have questions for you. Answering their questions and providing your expert opinion about COVID-19 vaccines can help reassure them about the safety of vaccinating their children. To guide you and your practice team in these conversations, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) has provided common questions, quick answers, and resources from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assist you in these important discussions. Click to watch this Q&A session with Dr. Sterling Ransone, AAFP president and Dr. Cameron Webb, White House COVID-19 Response Team senior advisor. They cover multiple topics, including: Virus mutations are common, and SARS-CoV-2 variants continue being detected. The CDC is monitoring these variants and tracking spread across the U.S., as well as the effect on infection and disease. Researchers are also checking vaccine effectiveness against the different variants. As of Nov. 30, the CDC recognized [Omicron as a new variant of concern](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant.html). There aren't a lot of details at this time. They will continue tracking the mutation and its impact. This past summer and fall, the Delta variant spread faster and caused more infections. According to the CDC, it has It is important to note that all the variants appear to have increased efficiency in spreading from person to person so the use of mitigation measures like masks, ventilation, hand washing, physical distancing, and quarantine are paramount. A Variant Classification scheme that defines three classes of SARS-CoV-2 variants has been developed and information for the different variants is provided at the links below: The B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants circulating in the United States are classified as variants of concern. Use the [CDC's map](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#global-variant-report-map) to see where the different variants are found in the U.S. COVID-19 vaccines with EUAs for booster doses and pediatric vaccines. See the [CDC's effectiveness overview](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Feffectiveness.html). The American Medical Association continues publishing COVID-19 vaccine and administration codes. Their unique structure allows for tracking and accommodating multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Check out information on the [CDC's COVID-19 site](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html), including: Expect updates to this site, plus [CDC's Vaccination and Immunization site](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/), as more information is available. It's critical that jurisdictions and federal entities receiving vaccine have information to implement an effective COVID-19 vaccination program. "}
