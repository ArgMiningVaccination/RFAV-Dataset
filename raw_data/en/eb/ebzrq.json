Here's what you need to know The University of Florida on Wednesday [told many of its employees they will need to be vaccinated](https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/coronavirus/2021/10/28/some-uf-uf-health-employees-subject-federal-covid-19-vaccine-mandate/8580648002/) unless they qualify for an exemption due to religious belief, but while there is no real test to determine who can assert such an objection it may not be the trump card some expect. Few mainstream religions have tenets that forbid or even discourage medical care such as vaccination against COVID-19. Still, some people of faith are citing their religion as a reason why they won't get the COVID-19 vaccine. Can there be a sincerely held religious belief that should allow someone to avoid vaccination? \"The short answer is yes,\" said Dr. David Hackett, professor in the Department of Religious Studies at UF. Legal challenge: [Florida challenges Biden Administration with lawsuit over COVID vaccine rules](https://www.theledger.com/story/news/local/2021/10/28/desantis-florida-sues-biden-administration-vaccine-rules/8580453002/) More: [Florida Surgeon General Ladapo was rushed into UF College of Medicine job, emails show](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2021/10/27/joseph-ladapo-fast-tracked-university-florida-college-medicine-ron-desantis-mask/6173664001/) The trickier issue for employers is figuring out how to handle such objections. \"Employers can say they are going to require a vaccination but they have to be very careful whenever someone claims a religious objection,\" said Ron Kozlowski, a Gainesville attorney. Kozlowski said many large employers considering religious objections to vaccine mandates won't inquire too rigorously about those beliefs. But that doesn't mean they have no options. Brad Areheart, a professor at the University of Tennessee with expertise in employment law, said employers don't face a high bar in making accommodations based on religious beliefs. \"It's much easier for an employer to say the accommodation you are seeking will burden our organization,\" Areheart said. \"Being religious doesn't give everyone a basis for exemption.\" The federal law called Title VII requires employers to consider requests for religious accommodations but does not protect social, political, or economic views, or personal preferences of employees who seek exemptions from a COVID-19 vaccination requirement. There are no \"magic words\" necessary to assert a religious objection but employees would need to say that there is a conflict between their sincerely held religious beliefs and the employer's vaccination requirement. Employees are entitled to a reasonable accommodation, but not necessarily the one they prefer, according [ to an article this week](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/eeoc-updates-covid-19-guidance-to-address-vaccine-mandate-religious-exemptions) in the National Law Review. And an employer need not grant a religious accommodation if it would prohibit the employee from performing essential functions of their position. What religions say about vaccinations So what is the basis for an objection to vaccination due to religious belief? White evangelical Protestants are the only religious group that didn't reach a majority when asked in a [Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) ](https://www.prri.org/)and [ Interfaith Youth Core (IFYC) ](https://ifyc.org/)poll if they believe they should get vaccinated because it \"helps protect everyone\" and \"is a way to live out the religious principle of loving my neighbors.\" Only 43% of white evangelical Protestants agreed with those statements, compared to 56% of Black Protestants and 61% of Hispanic Protestants, [according to the survey.](https://www.prri.org/research/religious-vaccines-covid-vaccination/) One way white evangelical Protestants say their faith is against the vaccine is by talking of eternal life, like [ Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves](https://governorreeves.ms.gov/) did in late August. \"When you believe in eternal life \u2014 when you believe that living on this earth is but a blip on the screen \u2014 then you don't have to be so scared of things,\" Reeves said. That belief, that God controls everything, is a core belief of evangelicals, said PRRI Director of Research Natalie Jackson. There are many religious arguments for and against the COVID-19 vaccination. Here are some of the major religions' beliefs about it: Catholicism Catholic officials expressed initial concerns about the use of cell lines from aborted fetuses in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, but ultimately said Catholics could still get the vaccine if it was the only one available. In a [March statement,](https://www.usccb.org/news/2021/us-bishop-chairmen-doctrine-and-pro-life-address-use-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine) the [United States Conference of Catholic Bishops](https://www.usccb.org/) said \"being vaccinated can be an act of charity that serves the common good.\" Almost 80% of white Catholics were accepting of the vaccine in July, according to a PRRI study, and Hispanic Catholics were one of the religious groups whose vaccine acceptance increased the most. It went from 56% in March to 80% in June, according to PRRI. Other Christians Christians, not including Catholics, were 77% accepting of vaccines, [according to PRRI's release in July.](https://www.prri.org/research/religious-vaccines-covid-vaccination/) The vast majority of Christian denominations have no theological opposition to vaccines, including Eastern Orthodox, Amish, Anglican, Baptist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mennonites, Quakers and Pentecostal Christians, according to [Vanderbilt University Medical Center research. ](https://www.vumc.org/health-wellness/news-resource-articles/immunizations-and-religion) Christian denominations with a theological opposition to vaccination The only Christian denominations that cite a theological reason for opposing vaccines are the Dutch Reformed Church and Church of Christ, Scientist, according to Vanderbilt. Some members of the Dutch Reformed Church decline vaccines because it \"interferes with divine providence,\" while others accept it as a gift from God, Vanderbilt research shows. Other research points to illnesses from smallpox vaccines in the 19th century as a reason some in the religion do not want vaccines. Denominations that believe in faith healing, or laying hands on people in order to heal their illnesses, also likely don't believe in vaccines. [Church of Christ, Scientist, ](https://www.christianscience.com/)teaches that prayer will alleviate and prevent disease, so members may request vaccine exemptions, the Vanderbilt research shows. The denomination doesn't strictly prohibit vaccination, though. In [ a release on the church's website, ](https://www.christianscience.com/press-room/a-christian-science-perspective-on-vaccination-and-public-health)officials say that most members rely on prayer for healing. \"So we've appreciated vaccination exemptions and sought to use them conscientiously and responsibly, when they have been granted,\" the release states. \"Church members are free to make their own choices on all life-decisions, in obedience to the law, including whether or not to vaccinate their children. These aren't decisions imposed by their church.\" Islam The [ Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)](https://isna.net/) released information [encouraging people to get the vaccine](https://isna.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Press-Release-NMCTF-COVID-Vaccines-12.22.2020.pdf) and to take other precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \"One of the highest objectives of Islamic law is to preserve and protect human life,\" said [Imam Mohamed Magid, ](https://isna.net/imam-magid/)former president of the ISNA and the executive imam of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society Center in Sterling, Virginia. Magid spoke for a [Religion News Service (RNS) recorded interview ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ur63vU5YbI)on the COVID-19 vaccine in January. \"Muslims have done preventive medicine throughout history, and Muslims are among the first people to believe in the idea of vaccination,\" [Magid said, according to RNS. ](https://ifyc.org/article/faith-and-covid-19-vaccine-muslims-were-among-first-believe-vaccines) \"The idea of preventing harm comes from the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, who said, if there's any contagious disease in a city, you should not enter that city or leave it. If you contract that sickness, you should not go on to spread it. This is the theological foundation for vaccination.\" Early on during COVID-19 vaccination efforts, there were concerns expressed that pork products \u2014 which the religion forbids followers to consume \u2014 might be in the vaccines. ISNA said in its release that the vaccines don't contain pork products. Judaism Jewish people support vaccination, as one of the most important tenets of the religion is preserving life. Protecting one's health is a mitzvah, or obligation, according to [Chabad.org. ](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2870103/jewish/What-Does-Jewish-Law-Say-About-Vaccination.htm) \"It is not enough to deal with health issues as they arise; we must take precautions to avoid danger,\" the site states. The [Central Conference of American Rabbis](https://www.ccarnet.org/ccar-resolutions/central-conference-of-american-rabbis-resolution-on-the-covid-19-vaccination/), the [Union for Reform Judaism ](https://urj.org/blog/vaccinating-most-vulnerable-requires-proactive-congregational-effort)and the [Orthodox Union](https://www.ou.org/covid19/) all released statements supporting vaccination. \u2014 Danae King at the Columbus Dispatch provided material on teaching among religions in this article.
