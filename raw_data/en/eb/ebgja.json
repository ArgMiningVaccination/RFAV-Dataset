What Comirnaty is and what it is used for Comirnaty is a vaccine used for preventing COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age and older. The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. As Comirnaty does not contain the virus to produce immunity , it cannot give you COVID -19. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 2. What you need to know before you receive Comirnaty Comirnaty should not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given this vaccine in the past . 2 2023 -0086009, 2023- 0086179 you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection . you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. However, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood -clots. you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system . There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Comirnaty (see section 4). These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 to 11 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. Most cases of myocarditis and pericarditis recover. Some cases required intensive care support and fatal cases have been seen. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur. As with any vaccine, Comirnaty may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. The efficacy of Comirnaty may be lower in people who are immunocompromised. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID -19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor. Children Comirnaty 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is not recommended for children aged under 12 years. There are paediatric formulations available for infants aged 6 months and above and children below 12 years of age. For details, please refer to the Package Leaflet for other formulations . The vaccine is not recommended for infants aged under 6 months . Other medicines and Comirnaty Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine. Pregnancy and breast -feeding If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor , nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine. Comirnaty can be used during pregnancy. A large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with Comirnaty during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Comirnaty can be given during breast -feeding. Driving and using machines Some of the effects of vaccination mentioned in section 4 ( Possible side effects) may temporarily affect your ability to drive or use machines. Wait until these effects have worn off before you drive or use machines. 3 2023 -0086009, 2023- 0086179 Comirnaty contains potassium and sodium This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium -free'. This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'. 3. How Comirnaty is given Comirnaty is given after dilution as an injection of 0.3 mL into a muscle of your upper arm. You will receive 1 injection , regardless whether you have received a COVID -19 vaccine before . If you were previously vaccinated with a COVID -19 vaccine, you should not receive a dose of Comirnaty until at least 3 months after the most recent dose. If you are immunocompromised, you may receive additional doses of Comirnaty . If you have any further questions on the use of Comirnaty, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 4.
