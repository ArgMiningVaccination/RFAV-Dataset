This therapy originated thousands of years ago and is based on the idea that energy (called \"Chi\") flows within the body along certain paths called meridians. When the flow of Chi energy is blocked, the body is out of balance, and this causes health problems. Acupuncturists use sterile, single-use needles to restore the correct flow of Chi, which returns harmony to the body The needles are typically left in the skin for 10-20 minutes. Sometimes the therapist will give them a little twist also, to increase the healing effect. It sounds painful, doesn't it? But, the needles used are very thin - just 2-3 times bigger than a mosquito's nose and much smaller than anything used in Western medicine. In fact, many people report not feeling the needles going in at all. "}
