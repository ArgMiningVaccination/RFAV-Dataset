This work is so powerful that it gained popularity in the West, and we are in gratitude to this great Spirit to share its unique medicine. Kambo is one of the most powerful natural ways to strengthen the immune system, and it's used to clear away \"Panema\" (negative energy). It is non-psychoactive. The healing works on deep physical, mental, emotional, energetic and spiritual levels. A ceremony takes around 1 hr /person, and though known to be a tough one, endless rewards await on the other side of surrender. Kambo should always be taken with a properly trained person. Preparation: At least 3 days prior to ceremony, a mindful diet is recommended with no intake of salt, sugar, greasy food, alcohol, drugs, and sex. Your mantra for the ceremony is a clear intention you come with, and the preparation to the days leading up are echoing this mantra. The same diet is recommended for 3 days after the ceremony- especially that your body has been \"rebooted\".
