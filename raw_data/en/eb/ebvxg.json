These microorganisms can in vitro synthesize secondary metabolites similar to metabolites produced in vivo by their host plants. If microorganisms are isolated from certain plants, there is undoubtedly a strong possibility of obtaining beneficial endophytes strains producing host-specific secondary metabolites for their potential applications in sustainable agriculture, pharmaceuticals and other industrial sectors. Few products derived from endophytes are being used for cultivating resilient crops and developing non-toxic feeds for livestock. Our better understanding of the complex relationship between endophytes and their host will immensely improve the possibility to explore their unlimited functionalities. Successful production of host-secondary metabolites by endophytes at commercial scale might progressively eliminate our direct dependence on high-valued vulnerable plants, thus paving a viable way for utilizing plant resources in a sustainable way.", "sitename": "AIMS Microbiology", "date": "2021-02-04", "cleaned_text": "| [1] || Saikkonen K, Faeth SH, Helander M, et al.
