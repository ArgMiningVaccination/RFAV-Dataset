Though the practice of meditation has been around for centuries, it has recently become a popular choice for those seeking natural ways to find serenity. Below is an example as to how you can try meditation. How to Meditate - Sit or Lie down in a safe, clean, comfortable and quiet space away from distractions. - Focus on your breathing. Take deep, slow breaths. - Focus your mind on only your breathing. Do not allow it to wander or think about anything except the sound and function of the air entering and exiting your lungs. - Focus on speaking positive affirmations such as: \"I am safe\" or \"I am happy\" or \"I am at peace\" - Consciously tell your body to relax. Unclench your jaw, drop your shoulders and let your arms hang by your sides. There are also many essential oils that can aid in your meditation routine.
