He began his career as a CPA with PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York.JAY ALIX In providing unprecedented philanthropic support, Jay Alix pledged to help Mayo Clinic \"recruit the best of future generations of talented students and create an innovative curriculum that enables them to achieve dramatic advances in medical science, technology and patient care.\" To recognize his vision and generosity, Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine is named in his honor. As a business professional, member of the Mayo Clinic Board of Trustees and grateful patient, Mr. Alix remains inspired by Mayo's commitment to solving the world's most serious and complex medical challenges \u2014 one patient at a time. A devoted advocate for Mayo Clinic, Mr. Alix works alongside Mayo leaders, driving transformational change rooted in Mayo Clinic's vision and core values. Mr. Alix is a noted philanthropist and founder of the turnaround consulting firm AlixPartners, the global advisory firm and industry standard for providing comprehensive solutions for companies facing complex operating, financial, legal and restructuring challenges. He has led and advised on some of the largest and most complex restructurings and turnarounds of the past four decades, including leading the creation, design and development of the highly successful restructuring and turnaround plan to bring General Motors in and out of bankruptcy in just 40 days. Having sold control of the firm in 2006, today Alix serves as one of 15 board members and a mentor to AlixPartners' leaders.

First established in 1915, Mayo's graduate degrees were initially awarded in partnership with the University of Minnesota. Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences became an independent, degree-granting institution in 1983. For the past quarter century, our world-renowned faculty have worked within Mayo Clinic's unique three-shield environment of the clinic, research and education to recruit, empower and nurture future scientists (M.S. and Ph.D.) and physician scientists (M.S./M.D. and M.D./Ph.D.) to explore the world and innovate. Such exploration and innovation is critical to solving unmet health care needs. Integral to the goals of Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences is the creation of a diverse workforce that is prepared to improve health equity through discovery and innovation. Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences has also been a vital part of the expansion of Mayo Clinic into a three-site institution \u2014 from the original site in Rochester, Minnesota to major graduate training in Jacksonville, Florida and both Scottsdale and Phoenix, Arizona. This novel configuration and nearly three-decade experience in distance graduate education has been showcased in the challenges presented by the recent COVID pandemic, demonstrating both the global reach and substantive local impact at each campus. This commencement articulates the critical nature of fundamental research in addressing major societal needs. Each of these graduates from the class of 2023 represents new, cutting-edge technology, innovations in health care delivery, public policy, regulatory science and new methods to make innovations more broadly available across the world through entrepreneurship, partnerships and novel ventures.

First, to the patients of Mayo Clinic \u2014 thank you for allowing us to work to become truly worthy of caring for you during your most vulnerable moments. In our four years, you have taught us about showing up for the needs of patients more than any textbook ever could. Second, to the Mayo Clinic faculty, consultants, fellows and residents who have guided our development from medical students to physicians \u2014 thank you for establishing medical excellence as the bare minimum and for simultaneously imbuing us with the Mayo Clinic values of integrity, compassion, patient-centered care and collaboration. Thank you for modeling what it means to be a physician and for preparing us for the challenges that await. Third, to the MCASOM deans, staff and administrators \u2014 thank you for working tirelessly to attend to the behind- the-scenes details that ensured our education ran smoothly. With your guidance, we adapted to COVID-19, virtual learning and interviews and every challenge in between. Thank you for the psychological safety of knowing you were in our corners and working in many unseen ways to support and uplift our dreams of becoming physicians. Next, to the benefactors of Mayo Clinic \u2014 thank you for helping to ensure that MCASOM had the resources to offer us a world-class education. We appreciate your generosity and commitment to our medical education. To our fellow students \u2014 thank you for your profound impact on our medical education and growth as both physicians and human beings. We are better for the diversity of opinions, lived experiences and interests within our class and honestly could not have survived this journey without each other. Finally, to our family and friends \u2014 thank you for enduring this journey with us and keeping us motivated at crucial moments. Thank you for being so patient with us. You have made many sacrifices to be with us, to be available when we need you and to support our dreams. Minnesota Doctor of Medicine We accomplished our dreams and arrived at today's success because each and every one of you remained steadfast in your support of us. Today \u2014 because of that support, patience and encouragement \u2014 we graduate. Today, we become physicians, but you are the unsung heroes. It is not lost on us that we would not have arrived here today without you.

Work for the advancement of all humanity By pronouncing this Oath, I commit myself to these standards and goals.
