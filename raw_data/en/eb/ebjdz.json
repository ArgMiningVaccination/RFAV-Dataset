They may lack biomedical explanations but as they become better researched some, such as physical therapy, diet, and acupuncture, become widely accepted whereas others, such as humors or radium therapy, quietly fade away. Therapies are termed as Complementary when used in addition to conventional treatments and as Alternative when used instead of conventional treatment. Alternative therapies include, but are not limited to the following disciplines: folk medicine, herbal medicine, diet fads, homeopathy, faith healing, new age healing, chiropractic, acupuncture, naturopathy, massage, and music therapy. We believe alternative medicine should be considered a supplement to - not a replacement for - traditional medicine. Also, keep these points in mind: - When viewing sites maintained by adherents of a particular alternative approach, be aware that they are going to be enthusiastic about their methods. Be skeptical, but open-minded. - Although anecdotal evidence may be valid, look for scientific evidence that a procedure works. Unfortunately, many unorthodox therapies have not been subjected to rigorous scientific testing - even though they might be effective in certain instances. - When people believe a therapy will work, they will sometimes sense an improvement. This phenomenon, known as the \"Placebo Effect,\" tends to confound things, especially in alternative medicine. - Before trying any new technique or alternative approach, discuss the possible side effects and ramifications with your physician or healthcare provider.
