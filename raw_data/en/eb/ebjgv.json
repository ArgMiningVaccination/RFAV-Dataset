However, grandfathered health plans must comply with certain other consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act, for example, the elimination of lifetime limits on benefits. Questions regarding which protections apply and which protections do not apply to a grandfathered health plan and what might cause a plan to change from grandfathered health plan status can be directed to the Plan Administrator at: Commonwealth of Kentucky , Office of Legal Services 501 High Street Third Floor Frankfort, KY 40601 You may also cont act the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services at www.healthreform.gov.

Precertification is not a guarantee of coverage. If you or your covered dependents are to receive a service which requires precertifica tion, you or your qualified practitioner must contact Humana by telephone or in writing.

Not all qualified practitioners including pathologists, radiologists, anesthesiologists, and emergency room physicians who provide services at PAR hospitals are PAR qualified practitioners . If services are provided to you by such facility based Non-PAR qualified practitioners at a PAR hospital, this Plan will pay for those services at the PAR provider benefit percentage. Facility based Non-PAR qualified practitioners may require payment from you for any amount not paid by this Plan. If possible, you may want to verify whether services are available from a PAR qualified practitioner. In the event that a specific medical service cannot be provided by or through a PAR provider , a covered person is entitled to coverage for medically necessary covered expenses obtained through a Non-PAR provider when approved by this Plan on a case by case basis. PAR PROVIDER DIRECTORY KEHP will automatically provide, without charge, information to you about how you can access a directory of PAR providers appropriate to your service area. An online directory of PAR providers is available to you and accessible via Humana's website at www.human a.com . This directory is subject to change. Due to the possibility of PAR providers changing status, please check the online directory of PAR providers prior to obtaining services . If you do not have access to the online directory, contact Humana at the customer service number on the back of your identification (ID) card prior to services being rendered or to request a directory.

This does not prevent your qualified practitioner from providing or perfor ming the procedure, treatment or supply, however, the procedure, treatment or supply will not be a covered expense . COORDINATION OF BENEFITS 80 BENEFITS SUBJECT TO THIS PROVISION Benefits described in this Plan are coordinated with benefits provid ed by other plans under which you are also covered. This is to prevent duplication of coverage and a resulting increase in the cost of medical coverage. For this purpose, a plan is one which covers medical or dental expenses and provides benefits or services by group, franchise or blanket insurance coverage. This includes group -type contracts not available to the general public, obtained and maintained only because of the covered person's membership in, or connection with, a particular organization or gr oup, whether or not designated as franchise, blanket, or in some other fashion. Plan also includes any coverage provided through the following: 1. Employer, trustee, union, employee benefit, or other association; or 2. Governmental programs, programs mandated by state statute, or sponsored or provided by an educational institution. This Coordination of Benefits provision does not apply to any individual policies or Blanket Student Accident Insurance provided by, or through, an educational institution. Allowa ble expense means any eligible expense , a portion of which is covered under one of the plans covering the person for whom claim is made. Each plan will determine what is an allowable expense according to the provisions of the respective plan. When a plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be deemed to be both an allowable expense and a benefit paid. EFFECT ON BENEFITS One of the plans involved will pay benefits fir st. This is called the primary plan. All other plans are called secondary plans. When this Plan is the secondary plan, the sum of the benefit payable will not exceed 100% of the total allowable expenses incurred under this Plan and any other plans inclu ded under this provision. ORDER OF BENEFIT DET ERMINATION In order to pay claims , it must be determined which plan is primary and which plan(s) are secondary. A plan will pay benefits first if it meets one of the following conditions: 1. The plan has no co ordination of benefits provision; 2. The plan covers the person as an employee ; 3. For a child who is covered under both parents' plans, the plan covering the parent whose birthday (month and day) occurs first in the calendar year pays before the plan covering the other parent. If the birthdates of both parents are the same, the plan which has covered the person for the longer period of time will be determined the primary plan; If a plan other than this Plan does not include provision 3, then the gender rule (male pays primary) will be followed to determine which plan is primary. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) 81 4. In the case of dependent children covered under the plans of divorced or separated parents, the following rules apply: a. The plan of a parent who has custody will pay the benefits fir st; b. The plan of a step -parent who has custody will pay benefits next; c. The plan of a parent who does not have custody will pay benefits next; d. The plan of a step -parent who does not have custody will pay benefits next. There may be a court decree which give s one parent financial responsibility for the medical or dental expenses of the dependent children. If there is a court decree, the rules stated above will not apply if they conflict with the court decree. Instead, the plan of the parent with financial r esponsibility will pay benefits first. 5. If a person is laid off or is retired or is a dependent of such person, that plan covers after the plan covering such person as an active employee or dependent of such employee . If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule will be ignored. If the above rules do not apply or cannot be determined, then the plan that covered the person for the longest period of time will pay first. COORDINAT ION OF BENEFITS WITH MEDICARE TRICARE AS SECONDARY PAYER Generally, TRICARE is intended to be the secondary payer to health benefit, insurance, and third -party plans. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1079(j)(1); 32 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 and (b). When TRICARE is secondary, a b enefit may not be paid under TRICARE if a person is enrolled in, or covered by, any other insurance, medical service, or health plan, including any plan offered by a third -party payer, to the extent that the benefit is also a benefit under the other plan. In the case of individuals with health coverage through their current employment, the employer insurance plan shall be the first payer, Medicare shall be the second payer, and TRICARE shall be the third payer. For example, if an individual is covered by TRICARE and also by an employer -sponsored plan, and a particular treatment or procedure is covered by both, the employer - sponsored plan must pay first. The TRICARE rules prohibit employers from providing financial or other incentives for a TRICARE eligible employee not to enroll (or to terminate enrollment) under a health plan that would (in the case of such enrollment) be a primary plan. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1097c(a)(1); DoD Reg. \u00a7 199.8(d)(6), 75 Fed. Reg. 18051 (Apr. 9, 2010). This plan is compliant with 10 U .S.C. \u00a7 1097c and 32 CFR \u00a7 199.8. When an employer employs 100 or more persons, the benefits of this Plan will be payable first for a covered person who is under age 65 and eligible for Medicare . The benefits of Medicare will be payable second. MEDICARE PART A means the Social Security program that provides hospital insurance benefits. MEDICARE PART B means the Social Security program that provides medical insurance benefits. A covered person is considered to be eligible for Medicare on the earliest da te coverage under Medicare could become effective for him or her. COORDINA TION OF BENEFITS (continued) 82 OPTIONS Federal Law allows this Plan's actively working covered employees age 65 or older and their covered spouses who are eligible for Medicare to choose one of the following options: OPTION 1 - The benefits of this Plan will be payable first and the benefits of Medicare will be payable second. OPTION 2 - Medicare benefits only. The covered person and his or her dependents , if any, will not be covered by this Plan. Each covered empl oyee and each covered spouse will be provided with the choice to elect one of these options at least one month before the covered employee or the covered spouse becomes age 65. All new covered employees and newly covered spouses age 65 or older will also be offered these options. If Option 1 is chosen, its issue is subject to the same requirements as for a covered employee or dependent who is under age 65. Under Federal law, there are two categories of persons eligible for Medicare . The calculation and payments of benefits by this Plan differs for each category. CATEGORY 1 - Medicare Eligibles are actively working covered employees age 65 or older and their age 65 or older covered spouses, and age 65 or older covered spouses of actively working covered employees who are under age 65. CATEGORY 2 - Medicare Eligibles are any other covered persons entitled to Medicare , whether or not they enrolled for it. This category includes, but is not limited to, retired covered employees and their spouses or covered dependents of a covered employee other than his or her spouse. CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF BENEFITS For covered persons in Category 1, benefits are payable by this Plan without regard to any benefits payable by Medicare . Medicare will then determine it s benefits. For covered persons in Category 2, Medicare benefits are payable before any benefits are payable by this Plan. The benefits of this Plan will then be reduced by the full amount of all Medicare benefits the covered person received RIGHT OF RE COVERY This Plan reserves the right to recover benefit payments made for an allowable expense under this Plan in the amount which exceeds the maximum amount this Plan is required to pay under these provisions. This right of recovery applies to this Plan against: 1. Any person(s) to, for or with respect to whom, such payments were made; or 2. Any other insurance companies, or organizations which according to these provisions, owe benefits due for the same allowable expense under any other plan. This Plan alone will determine against whom this right of recovery will be exercised. CLAIM PROCEDURES 83 SUBMITTING A CLAIM This section describes what a covered person (or his or her authorized representative) must do to file a claim for Plan benefits. A claim must be filed with Humana in writing and delivered to Humana by mail, postage prepaid, or by e -mail. However, a submission to obtain pre -authorization may also be filed with Humana by telephone; Claims must be submitted to Humana at the address indica ted in the documents describing this Plan or claimant's identification card. Claims will not be deemed submitted for purposes of these procedures unless and until received at the correct address; Also, claims submissions must be in a format acceptable t o Humana and compliant with any applicable legal requirements. Claims that are not submitted in accordance with the requirements of applicable federal law respecting privacy of protected health information and/or electronic claims standards will not be ac cepted by this Plan ; Claims submissions must be timely. Claims must be filed as soon as reasonably possible after they are incurred, and in no event later than 15 months after the date of loss, except if you were legally incapacitated. Plan benefits ar e only available for claims that are incurred by a covered person during the period that he or she is covered under this Plan; Claims submissions must be complete. They must contain, at a minimum: a. The name of the covered person who incurred the covered e xpense ; b. The name and address of the health care provider ; c. The diagnosis of the condition; d. The procedure or nature of the treatment; e. The date of and place where the procedure or treatment has been or will be provided; f. The amount billed and the amount of the covered expense not paid through coverage other than Plan coverage, as appropriate; g. Evidence that substantiates the nature, amount, and timeliness of each covered expense in a format that is acceptable according to industry standards and in compliance wit h applicable law. A general request for an interpretation of Plan provisions will not be considered to be a claim . Requests of this type, such as a request for an interpretation of the eligibility provisions of this Plan , should be directed to the Plan Administrator . Mail medical claims and correspondence to: Humana Claims Office P.O. Box 146 01 Lexington, KY 40512 -4601 CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 84 MISCELLANEOUS MEDICAL CHARGES If you accumulate bills for medical items you purchase or rent yourself , send them to Humana at leas t once every three months during the year (quarterly). The receipts must include the patient name, name of the item, date item was purchased or rented and name of the provider of service . PROCEDURAL DEFECTS If a pre-service claim submission is not made in accordance with this Plan 's procedural requirements, Humana will notify the claimant of the procedural deficiency and how it may be cured no later than within five (5) days (or within 24 hours, in the case of an urgent care claim ) following the failure. A post-service claim that is not submitted in accordance with these claims procedures will be returned to the submitter. ASSIGNMENTS AND REPR ESENTATIVES A covered person may assign his or her right to receive Plan benefits to a health care provider only with the consent of Humana, in its sole discretion, except as may be required by applicable law. Assignments must be in writing. If a document is not sufficient to constitute an assignment, as determined by Humana, then this Plan will not consider an a ssignment to have been made. An assignment is not binding on this Plan until Humana receives and acknowledges in writing the original or copy of the assignment before payment of the benefit. If benefits are assigned in accordance with the foregoing parag raph and a health care provider submits claims on behalf of a covered person , benefits will be paid to that health care provider . In addition, a covered person may designate an authorized representative to act on his or her behalf in pursuing a benefit claim or appeal. The designation must be explicitly stated in writing and it must authorize disclosure of protected health information with respect to the claim by this Plan , Humana and the authorized representative to one another. If a document is not suf ficient to constitute a designation of an authorized representative, as determined by Humana, then this Plan will not consider a designation to have been made. An assignment of benefits does not constitute designation of an authorized representative. Any document designating an authorized representative must be submitted to Humana in advance, or at the time an authorized representative commences a course of action on behalf of a claimant . At the same time, the authorized representative should also provid e notice of commencement of the action on behalf of the claimant to the claimant , which Humana may verify with the claimant prior to recognizing the authorized representative status. In any event, a health care provider with knowledge of a claimant's medi cal condition acting in connection with an urgent care claim will be recognized by this Plan as the claimant's authorized representative. Covered persons should carefully consider whether to designate an authorized representative. An authorized represent ative may make decisions independent of the covered person , such as whether and how to appeal a claim denial. CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 85 CLAIMS DECISIONS After submission of a claim by a claimant , Humana will notify the claimant within a reasonable time, as follows: Pre-Service Claims Humana will notify the claimant of a favorable or adverse determination within a reasonable time appropriate to the medical circumstances, but no later than 15 days after receipt of the claim by this Plan . However, this period may be extended by an additional 15 days, if Humana determines that the extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of this Plan . Humana will notify the affected claimant of the extension before the end of the initial 15 -day period, the circumstances requiring the extension, and the date by which this Plan expects to make a decision. If the reason for the extension is because of the claimant's failure to submit information necessary to decide the claim , the notice of extension will describe the required inform ation. The claimant will have at least 45 days from the date the notice is received to provide the specified information. Urgent Care Claims Humana will determine whether a claim is an urgent care claim . This determination will be made on the basis of information furnished by or on behalf of a claimant . In making this determination, Humana will exercise its judgment, with deference to the judgment of a physician with knowledge of the claimant's condition. Accordingly, Humana may require a claimant to clarify the medical urgency and circumstances that support the urgent care claim for expedited decision -making. Humana will notify the claimant of a favorable or adverse determination as soon as possible, taking into account the medical urgency particular to the claimant's situation, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of the urgent care claim by this Plan . However, if a claim is submitted that does not provide sufficient information to determine whether, or to what extent, expenses are covered or p ayable under this Plan , notice will be provided by Humana as soon as possible, but not more than 24 hours after receipt of the urgent care claim by this Plan . The notice will describe the specific information necessary to complete the claim . The claima nt will have a reasonable amount of time, taking into account his or her circumstances, to provide the necessary information but not less than 48 hours. Humana will notify the claimant of this Plan's urgent care claim determination as soon as possible, b ut in no event more than 48 hours after the earlier of: 1. This Plan's receipt of the specified information; or 2. The end of the period afforded the claimant to provide the specified additional information. CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 86 Concurrent Care Decisions Humana will notify a claimant of a concurrent care decision that involves a reduction in or termination of benefits that have been pre -authorized. Humana will provide the notice sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow the claimant to appeal and obtain a determination on review of the adverse determination before the benefit is reduced or terminated. A request by a claimant to extend a course of treatment beyond the period of time or number of treatments that is a claim involving urgent care will be de cided by Humana as soon as possible, taking into account the medical urgency. Humana will notify a claimant of the benefit determination, whether adverse or not within 24 hours after receipt of the claim by this Plan , provided that the claim is submitted to this Plan at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the prescribed period of time or number of treatments. Post-Service Claims Humana will notify the claimant of a favorable or adverse determination within a reasonable time, but not later than 30 d ays after receipt of the claim by this Plan . However, this period may be extended by an additional 15 days if Humana determines that the extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of this Plan . Humana will notify the affected claimant of the extension before the end of the initial 30 -day period, the circumstances requiring the extension, and the date by which this Plan expects to make a decision. If the reason for the extension is because of the claimant's failure to submit information ne cessary to decide the claim , the notice of extension will describe the required information. The claimant will have at least 45 days from the date the notice is received to provide the specified information. Humana will make a decision no later than 15 d ays after the earlier of the date on which the information provided by the claimant is received by this Plan or the expiration of the time allowed for submission of the additional information. TIMES FOR DECISIONS The periods of time for claims decisions presented above begin when a claim is received by this Plan , in accordance with these claims procedures. PAYMENT OF CLAIMS Many health care providers will request an assignment of benefits as a matter of convenience to both provider and patient. Also as a matter of convenience, Humana will, in its sole discretion, assume that an assignment of benefits has been made to certain Network Providers . In those instances, Humana will make direct payment to the hospital , clinic or physician's office, unless Huma na is advised in writing that you have already paid the bill. If you have paid the bill, please indicate on the original statement, \"paid by employee, \" and send it directly to Humana . You will receive a written explanation of an adverse determination . Humana reserves the right to request any information required to determine benefits or process a claim . You or the provider of services will be contacted if additional information is needed to process your claim . CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 87 When an employee's child is subject to a m edical child support order, Humana will make reimbursement of eligible expenses paid by you, the child, the child's non -employee custodial parent, or legal guardian, to that child or the child's custodial parent, or legal guardian, or as provided in the medical child support order. Payment of benefits under this Plan will be made in accordance with an assignment of rights for you and your dependents as required under state Medicaid law. Benefits payable on behalf of you or your covered dependent after dea th will be paid, at this Plan's option, to any family member(s) or your estate. Humana will rely upon an affidavit to determine benefit payment, unless it receives written notice of valid claim before payment is made. The affidavit will release this Plan from further liability. Any payment made by Humana in good faith will fully discharge it to the extent of such payment. Payments due under this Plan will be paid upon receipt of written proof of loss. INITIAL DENIAL NOTICES Notice of a claim denial (i ncluding a partial denial) will be provided to claimants by mail, postage prepaid, or by e -mail, as appropriate, within the time frames noted above. However, notices of adverse decisions involving urgent care claims may be provided to a claimant orally within the time frames noted above for expedited urgent care claim decisions. If oral notice is given, written notification will be provided to the claimant no later than 3 days after the oral notification. A claims denial notice will state the specific r eason or reasons for the adverse determination , the specific Plan provisions on which the determination is based, and a description of this Plan's review procedures and associated timeline. The notice will also include a description of any additional mate rial or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary. The notice will describe this Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures. The notice will also disclose any internal Plan rule, protocol or similar criterion that was relied on to deny the claim . A copy of the rule, protocol or similar criterion relied upon will be provided to a claimant free of charge upon request. If the adverse det ermination is based on medical necessity, experimental, investigational or for research purposes, or similar exclusion or limit, the notice will provide either an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for the determination, applying the terms of this Plan to the claimant's medical circumstances, or a statement that such explanation will be provided free of charge upon request. In the case of an adverse decision of an urgent care claim , the notice will provide a description of this Plan's exped ited review procedures applicable to such claims . CLAIM PROCEDURES (continued) 88 APPEALS / GRIEVANCES If your medical claims have been denied, you have the right to file an appeal or grievance to Humana.

You will be notified in advance when the Open Enrollment Period is to begin and how long it will last. If you initially decline d coverage for yourself or your dependents at the time you were initially eligible for coverage, you will be able to enroll yourself and/or your eligible dependents during the Open Enrollment Period. Your coverage , if you are age 19 or older, will be subject to the pre-existing condition limitation. EMPLOYEE ELIGIBILITY You are eligible for coverage if the following conditions are met: 1. You are an employee or retiree who meets the eligibility requirements of the employer ; and 2. You participate in a state -sponsored retirement system; or 3. You are a School Board Member as defined in KRS 18A.225. Your eligibility date is as determined by the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ). EMPLOYEE EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE You must enroll in a manner acceptable to the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ). 1. If your completed enrollment forms are signed by you within 3 5 days after your hire date, your coverage is effective on the 1st day of the 2nd . Your coverage may be effective at a later date as determined by the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ). 2. If your completed enrollment forms are signed by you more than 3 5 days after your hire date, you are a late applicant and you will not be eligible for c overage under this Plan until the next annual Open Enrollment P eriod or until you experience a permitted qualifying event . Your coverage is effective as determined by the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ). DEPENDENT ELIGIBILITY Dependent eligibili ty requirements are outlined in the Definitions section of this document. Adding a dependent to the Plan who does not meet the KEHP eligibility rules may be considered insurance fraud. A dependent will be effective as outlined in the Dependent Effective Date of Coverage section. Each dependent is eligible for coverage on: 1. The date the employee is eligible for coverage, if he or she has dependents who may be covered on that date; or 2. The date of birth of the employee's natural -born child; or ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 94 3. The date a child is placed for adoption under the employee's legal guardianship, or the date which the employee incurs a legal obligation for total or partial support in anticipation of adoption; or 4. The date a covered employee's child is determined to b e eligible as an alternate recipient under the terms of a medical child support order . The covered employee may cover dependents only if the employee is also covered. Check with your employer immediately on how to enroll for dependent coverage. Late enr ollment will result in denial of dependent coverage until the next annual Open Enrollment Period. In any event, no person may be simultaneously covered as both an employee and a dependent under a KEHP Health Plan(s) . If both parents are eligible for cove rage, the dependent may only enroll under one Plan . The Department of Employee Insurance requires supporting documentation to verify the eligibility of any dependent enrolled or requesting to be enrolled in the Plan . DEPENDENT EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE If the employee wishes to add to the Plan a newborn dependent, a newly adopted dependent, or a newly placed for adoption dependent , an enrollment form must be completed and submitted to the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ). The newborn dependent's , the newly adopted dependent's, or the newly placed for adoption dependent's effective date of coverage is determined as follows: 1. If the completed enrollment forms are signed by you within 60 days after the newborn dependent's, the newly adopted depen dent's, or the newly placed for adoption dependent's eligibility date, that newborn dependent, the newly adopted dependent, or the newly placed for adoption dependent is covered on the date he or she is eligible. 2. If the completed enrollment forms are s igned by you more than 60 days after the newborn dependent's, the newly adopted dependent's, or the newly placed for adoption dependent's eligibility date, the newborn dependent, the newly adopted dependent, or the newly placed for adoption dependent is a late applicant . The newborn dependent, the newly adopted dependent, or the newly placed for adoption dependent will not be eligible for coverage under this Plan until the next annual Open Enrollment Period. Newborn dependents will be covered for an initi al period of 31 days from the date of birth. Coverage for newborns will continue beyond 31 days only if the employee completes and submits a signed enrollment form within the timeframe outlined above. If the employee wishes to add to the Plan other depen dent(s), in addition to the newborn, the newly adopted dependent , or the newly placed for adoption dependent , an enrollment form must be completed and submitted to the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ). ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 95 The dependent's effective date of coverage is determined as follows: 1. If the completed enrollment forms are signed by you within 35 days after the newborn dependent's, the newly adopted dependent's, or the newly placed for adoption dependent's eligibility date , that newborn dependent and other dependents are covered on the date he or she is eligible. 2. If the completed enrollment forms are signed by you more than 35 days after the newborn dependent's eligibility date , the newborn dependent and other dependents are a late applicant . The newborn dependent and other dependent s will not be eligible for coverage under this Plan until the next annual Open Enrollment Period . If the employee wishes to add other dependent(s) to the Plan , due to experiencing a qualifying event (other than birth, adoption, or placement for adoption), the dependent's effective date of coverage is determined as follows: 1. If the completed enrollment forms are signed by you within 35 days after the qualifying event that dependent is covered on the coverage effective date as set forth in the qualifying events in Exhibit A at the end of this document. 2. If the completed enrollment forms are signed by you more than 35 days after the dependent's eligibility date, the dependent is a late applicant . The dependent will not be eli gible for coverage under this Plan until the next annual Open Enrollment Period . The dependent is covered as determined by the employer . No dependent's effective date will be prior to the covered employee's effective date of coverage. If your dependent child becomes an eligible employee of the employer or becomes an employee of another employer , he or she may no longer be eligible as your dependent under this Plan . Please refer to the Definitions section for dependent requirements. A dependent child ag e 19 through the age of 25 who becomes eligible for other group coverage through full-time employment is no longer eligible for coverage under this Plan FAMILY CROSS -REFERENCE PAYMENT OPTION To be eligible to elect the cross -reference payment option, eac h of the following requirements must be met: you must cover at least one dependent ; the members must be legally married (husband and wife); the members must be eligible employees or retirees * of a group participating in the Kentucky Employees ' Health Pla n; the members must elect the same coverage; and both members must sign the appropriate documentation during the enrollment process and file with their agency's Insurance Coordinators. Failure to meet any one of the above requirements means that you are not eligible for the cross -reference payment option. ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued ) 96 * Members of the Judicial and Legislators Retirement Plans are not eligible to elect the cross -reference payment option. TERMINATING THE FAMILY CROSS -REFERENCE PAYMENT OPTION Employees will not be eligible to continue the cross -reference payment option if one spouse loses eligibility ( e.g. terminates employment, becomes part -time, or goes on leave without pay). 1. A Family Cross -Reference payment option is a legislatively mandated payment option for t wo (2) eligible employees or retirees . Thus, the Family Cross -Reference payment option has two (2) planholders. If either planholder loses employment for any reason (voluntary or involuntary), the Family Cross - Reference payment option terminates as eligi bility to participate in the Family Cross -Reference payment option has ceased. Only eligible employees may be planholders under the KEHP. Additionally, upon loss of employment that former planholder has lost planholder eligibility status and can only be co vered as a dependent on that existing plan. As a result, the remaining planholder will default to parent -plus coverage (from Family Cross -Referencing) reflecting the loss of planholder status of the former planholder. Should the remaining planholder wish t o elect dependent coverage for that former planholder, he or she may make that election for dependent coverage within 35 days of the date of loss of coverage of the former planholder. If the remaining planholder wishes to drop to single coverage, he or sh e may do so by submitting a drop form or new application within 35 days of the date of loss of coverage of the former planholder. The remaining planholder will NOT be responsible for the full regular family contribution unless that former planholder is a dded back to the plan as a dependent, which creates a traditional family plan. MEDICAL CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS An individual who is a child of a covered employee may be enrolled for coverage under this Plan in accordance with the direction of a Qualified M edical Child Support Order (QMCSO) or a National Medical Support Notice (NMSN). A QMCSO is a state court order or judgment, including approval of a settlement agreement that: (a) provides for support of a covered employee's child; (b) provides for health care coverage for that child; (c) is made under state domestic relations law (including a community property law); (d) relates to benefits under this Plan ; and (e) is \"qualified\" in that it meets the technical requirements of applicable law. QMCSO also m eans a state court order or judgment that enforces a state Medicaid law regarding medical child support required by Social Security Act \u00a71908 (as added by Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993). An NMSN is a notice issued by an appropriate agency of a state or local government that is similar to a QMCSO that requires coverage under this Plan for the dependent child of a non -custodial parent who is (or will become) a covered person by a domestic relations order that provides for health care coverage. Procedures for determining the qualified status of medical child support orders are available at no cost upon request from the Plan Administrator . ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 97 PRE -EXISTING CONDITION LIMITATION Benefits for pre-existing conditions are limited under this Plan . Pre-existing condition is defined in the Definitions section. Once you or your dependents obtain health plan coverage, you are entitled to use evidence of that coverage to reduce or eliminate any pre-existing condition limitation period that might otherwise be imposed when you become covered under a subsequent health plan. Evidence may include a certificate of prior creditable coverage . The length of any pre-existing condition limitation period under the subsequent health plan must be reduced by the number of d ays of creditable coverage . Prior to imposing a pre-existing condition limitation, Humana will: 1. Notify you in writing of the existence and terms of any pre-existing condition limitation; 2. Notify you of your right to request a certificate of creditable cov erage from any applicable prior plans; 3. Notify you of your right to submit evidence of creditable coverage to Humana to reduce the length of any pre-existing condition limitation; and 4. Offer to request a certificate of prior creditable coverage on your behalf. If, after receiving evidence of creditable coverage , Humana determines the creditable coverage is not sufficient to completely offset this Plan's pre-existing condition limitation period, Humana will: 1. Notify you in writing of its determination; 2. Notify you of the source and substance of any information on which it relied; and 3. Provide an explanation of appeal procedures and allow a reasonable opportunity to submit additional evidence of creditable coverage . Humana may modify an initial determinatio n of creditable coverage if it determines the individual did not have the claimed creditable coverage , provided Humana: 1. Notifies you of such reconsideration in writing disclosing its determination; 2. Notifies you with the source and substance of any inform ation on which it relied; and 3. Provides an explanation of appeal procedures and allows a reasonable opportunity to submit additional evidence of creditable coverage . Alternate means of providing evidence of creditable coverage may include an explanation o f benefits, correspondence from a plan, pay stubs showing a payroll deduction of premium for health plan coverage, third party statements verifying period(s) of coverage, information obtained by telephone, and any other relevant document providing evidence of period(s) of health coverage. ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 98 The pre-existing condition limitation does not apply to: 1. pregnancy; 2. genetic information in the absence of diagnosis; 3. domestic violence; or 4. newborn children, or children adopted before the age of 18, if they are enrol led under the Plan within 60 days of the date of birth, the date the child is legally adopted, or the date the child is legally placed for adoption (or 35 days, if other dependents are also being enrolled). 5.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS If your em ployer continues to pay required contributions and does not terminate the Plan, your coverage will remain in force for a period of time as determined by your employer for a layoff, during an approved medical leave of absence, during a period of total disab ility, during an approved non -medical leave of absence, during an approved military leave of absence or during part -time status . TERMINATING EMPLOYMENT KEHP is a current pay health insurance plan. If you leave employment between the 1st and the 15th of the month, your health insurance coverage will terminate on the 15th of the same month. If you leave employment between the 16th and the end of the month, your health insurance coverage will terminate on the last day of the same month. REINSTATEMENT OF CO VERAGE If your coverage under this Plan was terminated after a period of layoff, total disability , approved medical leave of ab sence, approved non -medical leave of ab sence or during part -time status and you are now returning to work, your coverage is effe ctive as determined by your employer . The eligibility period requirement with respect to the reinstatement of your coverage will be determined by your employer . The pre-existing condition limitation wi ll apply if there is a 63 -day lapse in coverage . If your coverage under this Plan was terminated after an approved military leave of absence (other than USERRA) or during part -time status and you are now returning to work, your coverage is effective as determined by your employer . The eligibility period re quirement with respect to the reinstatement of your coverage will be determined by your employer . The pre-existing condition limitation will be waived. If your coverage under the Plan was terminated due to a period of service in the uniformed services covered under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, your coverage is effective immediately on the day you return to work. Eligibility waiting periods and pre- existing condition limitations will be imposed only to the extent they were applicable prior to the period of service in the uniformed services. ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 99 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA) If you are granted a leave of absence (Leave) by the employer as required by the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act, you may continue to be covered under this Plan for the duration of the Leave under the same conditions as other employees who are in an eligible class and covered by this Plan. If you choose to terminate coverage during the Leave, or if coverage terminates as a result of no npayment of any required contribution, coverage may be reinstated on the date you return to eligible class following the end of the Leave. Charges incurred after the date of reinstatement will be paid as if you had been continuously covered. EXTENDED BEN EFITS If, on the date your coverage terminates under this Plan , you or your covered dependents are totally disabled as a result of a covered bodily injury or sickness , this Plan will continue to provide medical benefits until the earliest of the followin g: 1. Until coverage for the total disability has been obtained under another group policy; or 2. The date your physician certifies you are no longer totally disabled ; or 3. The date you receive benefits equal to any maximum benefit shown on the Schedule of Bene fits; or 4. The end of twelve consecutive months immediately following the date of your termination of coverage. This period of time is measured from the date your coverage is terminated under this Plan , to the same calendar day of the next succeeding month s. The Extended Benefits provision applies only to covered expenses for the disabling condition which existed on the date your coverage terminated. This Plan must remain in effect. RETIREE COVERAGE If you are a retiree who is under age 65 or is age 65 or older and non -Medicare eligible, you may enroll or continue coverage under the Plan for you and any of your eligible dependents . Please see your retirement system for more details. SURVIVORSHIP COVERAGE If the employee dies while dependent coverage i s in force, the surviving dependent spouse and dependent children may continue to be covered through the COBRA provision. If you previously declined coverage under this Plan for yourself or any eligible dependents , due to the existen ce of other health coverage (including COBRA), and that coverage is now lost or exhausted , this Plan permits you, your dependent spouse , and any eligible dependents to be enrolled for medical benefits under this Plan due to any of the following qualifying events : ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 100 1. Loss of coverage due to any of the following: a. Legal separation or annulment ; b. Divorce; c. Cessation of dependent status (such as attaining the limiting age); d. Death; e.

Employer contributions towards the other coverage have been terminated. Employer contributions include contributions by any current or former employer (of the individual or another person ) that was contributing to coverage for the individual. 3. COBRA coverage under the other plan has since been exhausted. If you are a covered employee or an otherwise eligible employee , who either did not enroll or did not enroll dependents when eligible, you now have the opportunity to enroll yourself and/or any previously eligible dependents or any newly acquired dependents when due to any of the following changes: 1. Marriage; 2. Birth; 3. Adoption or placement for adoption ; 4. Loss of eligibility due to terminat ion of Medicaid or State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) coverage; or 5. Eligibility for premium assistance subsidy under Medicaid or SCHIP. You may elect coverage under this Plan provided enrollment is within 35 days , 60 days from such event as identified in #4 and #5 above from the qualifying event or as listed in the Dependent Effective Date of Coverage section. You may be required to provide proof that the qualifying event has occurred due to one of the reasons listed before coverage under this Plan will be effective. Coverage under this Plan will be effective the 1st day of the month following the signature date of the enrollment form, but not before the event occurs, unless otherwise specified in this section. In the case of a dependent' s birth, enrollment is effective on the date of such birth , provided the appropriate paperwork is received . In the case of a dependent's adoption or placement for adoption, enrollment is effective on the date of such adoption or placement for adoption , provided the appropriate paperwork is received . ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE (continued) 101 If you become eligible for coverage under this Plan through the special enrollment provision, benefits under this Plan will be subject to the pre-existing condition limitation as defined within the Definition s section if you are age 19 or older . If you apply more than 35 days after a qualifying event, 60 days from such event as identified in #4 and #5 above or as listed in the Dependent Effective Date of Coverage section, you are considered a late applicant and will not be eligible for coverage under this Plan until the next annual Open Enrollment Period. Please see your employer for more details. If an employee or dependent changes Insurance Carriers during open enro llment, the existing coverage with the prior Insurance Carrier will terminate on December 31, except for the following: 1. If a covered member is hospitalized when coverage would normally terminate, the prior Insurance Carrier that covered the member's hospitalization during the previous plan year would continue coverage until the member is released from the hospital or transferred to another facility. At the time the member is released from the hospital or transferred to a new facility, the succeeding Insurance Carrier will assume responsibility for that member . It is the member's responsibility to ensure that a transfer or re -hospitalization is to a participating facility in compliance with all Plan delivery rules. 2. If a member has family coverage and a covered dependent is hospitalized when coverage would normally terminate due to a change in Insurance Carriers, the hospitalized family member would continue his/her prior coverage until discharge from the hospital or transfer to another facility. All other covered dependents not hospitalized at the date the new coverage begins would be transferred to the new Plan on the date the new coverage starts (not on the date the hospitalized dependent is released or transferred). 3. If a covered member is not at work and/or is on unofficial leave without pay or otherwise continuing to pay for his/her own health insurance premiums on the group coverage, that participant will begin coverage with his/her succeeding Insurance Carrier on January 1, even though he/sh e is not at work. These provisions take precedence over all Extension of Benefits clauses and Actively at Work clauses contained in any of the Insurance Carrier's standard commercial contracts in compliance KRS 304.18 if an employee , spouse , or dependent who is enrolled in the Plan becomes entitled to coverage ( e.g., becomes enrolled) under Part A or Part B of Medicare , other than coverage consisting solely of benefits under section 1928 of Social Sec urity Act, the employee may make a prospective election change to cancel coverage of that employee , spouse , or dependent , under the Plan . In addition, if an employee , spouse or dependent who has been entitled to coverage under Medicare loses eligibility fo r such coverage, the employee may make a prospective election to commence coverage of that employee , spouse , or dependent under the Plan . Coverage may be elected under this Plan provided enrollment is within 35 days from the entitlement of Medicare . TERMINATION OF COVERAGE 102 Coverage terminates on the earliest of the following: 1. The date this Plan terminates; 2. The end of the period for which any required contribution was due and not paid; 3. As determined by your employer when you enter full -time military, naval or air service , except coverage may continue during an approved military leave of absence as indicated in the Special Provisions; 4. The date determined by your employer , when you fail to be in an eligible class of persons according to the eligibility requirements of the employer ; 5. For all employees , as determined by your employer , following termination of employment with the employer ; 6. The date determined by your employer you request termination of coverage to be effective for yourself based on valid qualifying event guidelines ; 7. For any benefit, the date the benefit is remove d from this Plan ; 8. For your dependents , the date your coverage terminates; 9. For a dependent , the date determined by your employer the dependent enters full -time milita ry, naval or air service ; 10. For a dependent , the date determined by your employer such covered person no longer meets the definition of dependent ; or 11. The date determined by your employer you request termination of coverage to be effective for your dependen ts based on valid qualifying event guidelines . If you or any of your covered dependents no longer meet the eligibility requirements, you and your employer are responsible for notifying your Insurance Coordinator of the change in status. Coverage will not continue beyond the end of the month in which eligibility ends even if notice has not been given to Humana , employer , or Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ). 103 SECTION 4 GENERAL PROVISIONS AND REIMBURSEMENT/ SUBROGATION GENERAL PROVISIONS 104 The following provisions are to protect your legal rights and the legal rights of this Plan . PLAN ADMINISTRATION The Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ) has established a nd continues to maintain this Plan for the benefit of its employees and their eligible dependents as provided in this document. Benefits under this Plan are provided on a self -insured basis, which means that payment for benefits is ultimately the sole fin ancial responsibility of the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ). Certain administrative services with respect to this Plan , such as claims processing, are provided under a services agreement. Humana is not responsible, nor will it assume responsibil ity, for benefits payable under this Plan . Any changes to this Plan , as presented in this Summary Plan Description , must be properly adopted by the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ), and material modifications must be timely disclosed in writing and included in or attached to this document. A verbal modification of this Plan or promise having the same effect made by any person will not be binding with respect to this Plan . RESCISSION This Plan will rescind coverage only due to fraud or an intentio nal misrepresentation of a material fact. Rescission is a cancellation or discontinuance of coverage that has a retroactive effect. A cancellation or discontinuance is not a rescission if the cancellation or discontinuance of coverage has only a prospect ive effect, or the cancellation or discontinuance of coverage is effective retroactively, to the extent it is attributable to a failure to timely pay premium or costs of coverage. CONTESTABILITY This Plan has the right to contest the validity of your coverage under the Plan at any time. RIGHT TO REQUEST OVE RPAYMENTS This Plan reserves the right to recover any payments made by this Plan that were: 1. Made in error; or 2. Made to you or any party on your behalf where this Plan determines the payment to you or any party is greater than the amount payable under this Plan. This Plan has the right to recover against you if this Plan has paid you or any other party on your behalf. TIME LIMIT ON CERTAI N DEFENSES A claim will not be reduced or denied after two yea rs from the effective date of the benefit because a disease or physical condition not excluded and causing the loss existed before the benefit effective date . WORKERS' COMPENSATION NOT AFFECTED This Plan is not issued in lieu of, nor does it affect any r equirement for coverage by any Workers' Compensation or Occupational Disease Act or Law. GENERAL PROVISIONS (continued) 105 WORKERS' COMPENSATIO N If benefits are paid by this Plan and this Plan determines you received Workers' Compensation for the same incident, this Plan has the right t o recover as described under the Reimbursement/Subrogation provision. This Plan will exercise its right to recover against you even though: 1. The Workers' Compensation benefits are in dispute or are made by means of settlement or compromise; 2. No final det ermination is made that bodily injury or sickness was sustained in the course of, or resulted from, your employment; 3. The amount of Workers' Compensation due to medical or health care is not agreed upon or defined by you or the Workers' Compensation carrie r; 4. The medical or health care benefits are specifically excluded from the Workers' Compensation settlement or compromise. You hereby agree that, in consideration for the coverage provided by this Plan , you will notify Humana of any Workers' Compensation claim you make, and that you agree to reimburse this Plan as described above. MEDICAID This Plan will not take into account the fact that an employee or dependent is eligible for medical assistance or Medicaid under state law with respect to enrollment, determining eligibility for benefits, or paying claims . If payment for Medicaid benefits has been made under a state Medicaid plan for which payment would otherwise be due under this Plan , payment of benefits under this Plan will be made in accordance wit h a state law which provides that the state has acquired the rights with respect to a covered employee to the benefits payment. CONSTRUCTION OF PLAN TERMS The Plan Manager (Humana) has the sole right to construe and prescribe the meaning, scope and appli cation of each and all of the terms of this Plan , including, without limitation, the benefits provided thereunder, the obligations of the beneficiary and the recovery rights of this Plan; such construction and prescription by the Plan Manager (Humana) shall be final and uncontestable. REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION 106 RIGHT OF RECOVERY These provisions apply when Plan benefits are paid as a result of injuries or illnesses you sustained and you have a right to a recovery or received a recovery. SUBROGATI ON This Plan reserves all rights of subrogation. This means that the Plan has the right to recover its previously paid benefit payments from any award, settlement, or damages that you or your dependent may receive or to which you may become entitled. It a lso means that the Plan has the right to take action on your behalf to obtain an award, settlement, or damages. The Plan shall have the first lien upon all awards, settlements, or damages subject to its subrogation or reimbursement rights listed below. Thi s lien shall be in the amount of benefits provided or the amount of benefits that will be provided under the Plan , plus the reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, to enforce the Plan's rights. The beneficiary agrees that by accepting and in retur n for the payment of covered expenses by the Plan in accordance with the terms of this Plan: 1. The Plan has the right to recover payments for benefits paid for by the Plan . 2. The Plan has the right to recover payment for benefits paid by the Plan to or on behalf of you or your dependent from any award, settlement, or damages that you or your dependent may become entitled to or receive as a result of an accident , a person's fault or negligence, or any other circumstance under which you or your dependent has the right to recover from any other party. 3. The Plan may recover its benefit payments for any type of benefit which may be paid by the Plan , such as medical, dental, vision, mental, disability, supplemental accident , or accidental death or dismember ment benefits. 4. An \"award, settlement, or damages\" includes any award, settlement, damages (whether equitable, legal, compensatory, etc.), compensation, benefits, or any other payment of any kind. The amount may be paid by formal court award, informal c ompromise, redemption agreement, application for benefits, or otherwise. The amount also may be paid in a lump sum, installment, or annuity payments (such as income replacement). The Plan has the right to recover from all of these amounts. 5. An \"award, s ettlement, or damages\" includes amounts of any type, kind, nature, or character, regardless of whether the amount identifies or covers the Plan's benefit payments, otherwise relates to medical benefits, or is specifically limited to certain kinds of damage s or payments. In addition, attorneys' fees or any other costs associated with the amount will not reduce the amount of the Plan's reimbursement. This Plan has the first priority to recover from your award, settlement, or damages. The Plan's first priority lien also will apply regardless of whether you or your dependent is or was made whole from the award, settlement, or damages, whether before or after the Plan's subrogation recovery. This Plan precludes the operation of the \"make -whole\" and \"common fund\" doctrines. REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION (continued) 107 6. Your \"right to recover\" from any other party means that you or your dependent has the right to recover damages or expenses from another party, such as an individual, partnership, corporation, government, or other entity, as well as against that party's respective insurance carriers or governmental fund, for causing an injury or illness to you or your dependent or otherwise with respect to any injury or illness incurred by you or your covered dependent . This right to recover from any other pa rty also includes your own insurance carrier, such as your automobile insurance, automobile no -fault coverage, homeowners, personal accident , general liability, or life insurance carrier. It also includes a second medical insurance or other non -insured med ical or other coverage. It also includes uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage or programs. The Plan has the right to recover from any of these parties, or any other parties, in connection with your illness or injury. In the event you or your depend ent is entitled to or receives an award, settlement, or damages from any party (which includes the other party's or your own insurance carrier or coverage), the Plan has the first lien upon the award, settlement, or damages and must be reimbursed for its b enefit payments made to you or your dependent , or on your behalf. The Plan's first lien supersedes any right that the Plan participant may have to be \"made whole.\" In other words, the Plan is entitled to the right of first reimbursement out of any award, s ettlement, or damages the Plan participant procures or may be entitled to procure regardless of whether the Plan participant has received compensation for any of his or her damages or expenses, including any of his or her attorneys' fees or costs. Additio nally, the Plan's right of first reimbursement will not be \"set -off\" or reduced for any reason, including attorneys' fees, costs, comparative negligence, limits of collectability or responsibility, or otherwise. As a condition to receiving benefits under t he Plan , the Plan participant agrees that acceptance of benefits is constructive notice of this provision. Reimbursement to the Plan must be made immediately upon entitlement or receipt of any award, settlement, or damages. The Plan will charge interest at a reasonable rate for any delay in reimbursement. PLAN'S RIGHT TO ASSERT CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF The Plan has the right, if it so chooses, to assert rights on your behalf to obtain an award, settlement, or damages. Specifically, through subrogation, the Plan is entitled to all claims , demands, actions, and rights of recovery which you or your dependent may have against or from any party to the extent of the Plan's benefit payments. In addition, this Plan is entitled to attorneys' fees incurred in asserting rights on your behalf. The Plan does not require you or your dependent to pursue a claim against another party. However, as stated above, the Plan reserves the right to directly pursue recovery against another party on your behalf, should you or your depe ndent elect not to pursue an award, settlement, or damages against or from a party. MISCELLANEOUS SUBROGATION You, your dependent , your attorneys, or anyone acting on your behalf legally cannot do anything to prejudice the rights of the Plan in the exerc ise of its subrogation rights to recover from, or assert your rights to obtain, an award, settlement, or damages. The Plan's subrogation rights also extend to the guardian or estate of you and your dependent . The Plan's subrogation provisions will apply w ithout limitation by the Plan's Coordination of Benefits provisions, unless the Coordination of Benefits provisions would result in a greater recovery for the Plan. REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION (continued) 108 DUTY TO COOPERATE As a condition to participating in the Plan and receiving benefits und er the Plan , you and your dependent agree to be bound by all of the Plan's provisions, including, but not limited to, the Plan's subrogation provisions. The Plan will make benefit payments on a claim on the condition that you or your dependent , upon entitl ement or receipt of any award, settlement, or damages, will fully reimburse the Plan for the Plan's benefit payments and for expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs of suit, regardless of an action's outcome) incurred by the Plan in collecting this a mount. As a precondition to receiving benefits under the Plan , you and your dependent must enter into agreement with the Plan to reimburse the Plan for its benefit payments from any award, settlement, or damages pursuant to the Plan's subrogation provision s. In this agreement, you also must agree to assign direct payment to the Plan from any award, settlement, or damages to the extent of the Plan's benefit payments. You and your dependent also otherwise must sign and deliver any and all instruments, papers, and reimbursement agreements required by the Plan necessary for the Plan's reimbursement right. You and your dependent also are required to do whatever is requested or necessary in order to fully execute and to fully protect all the Plan's rights and to do nothing that would interfere with or diminish those rights. Further, you and your dependent must notify the Plan in writing of any proposed settlement and obtain the Plan's written consent before signing any release or agreeing to any settlement. In any event, the Plan's benefit payments for any current or historical claims under the Plan on your behalf will be deemed to be the equivalent of you or your covered dependent entering into an agreement to reimburse the Plan and otherwise signing and delivering any instruments and papers as required by the Plan . In the event that you or your dependent fails to enter into the foregoing agreement, or to otherwise comply with such requests, the Plan is entitled to withhold or deny benefits otherwise due under the Plan until you do so. RETENTION OF AN ATTORNEY If you or your attorney receives any recovery (whether by award, settlement, damages, compromise, or otherwise), you have an absolute obligation to immediately tender the recovery to the Plan under the terms of this provision. If you or your attorney does not immediately tender the recovery to the Plan , you will be deemed to hold the recovery in constructive trust for the Plan , because you or your attorney is not the rightful owner of the recovery and should n ot be in possession of the recovery until the Plan has been fully reimbursed. PARTICIPANT'S NONCOMPLIANCE If you or your dependent do not comply with the provisions of this section, the Plan Administrator shall have the authority, at its sole discretion, to deny payment of any claims for benefits by you and to deny or reduce future benefits payable (including payment of future benefits for other injuries or illnesses) under the Plan by the amount due as reimbursement to the Plan . The Plan Administrator may also, at its sole discretion, deny or reduce future benefits (including future benefits for other injuries or illnesses) under any other group benefits plan maintained by the Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ). The reductions will equal the amount o f the required reimbursement. If the Plan must bring an action against you to enforce this provision, then you agree to pay the Plan's attorneys' fees and costs, regardless of the action's outcome. REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION (continued) 109 RIGHT TO COLLECT NEEDED INFORMATION You must cooperate with Humana and when asked, assist Humana by: Authorizing the release of medical information including the names of all providers from whom you received medical attention; Obtaining medical information and/or records from any provider as requested by Human a; Providing information regarding the circumstances of your sickness or bodily injury ; Providing information about other insurance coverage and benefits, including information related to any bodily injury or sickness for which another party may be liable to pay compensation or benefits; and Providing information Humana requests to administer the Plan . Failure to provide the necessary information will result in denial of any pending or subsequent claims , pertaining to a bodily injury or sickness for which the information is sought, until the necessary information is satisfactorily provided. REIMBURSEMENT/SUBROGATION EXCLUSIONS Any covered expenses to the extent of any amount received from others for the bodily injuries or losses which necessitate such ben efits. Without limitation, \"amounts received from others\" specifically includes, but is not limited to, liability insurance, worker's compensation, uninsured motorists, underinsured motorists, \"no -fault\" and automobile med -pay payments or recovery from an y identifiable fund regardless of whether the beneficiary was made whole . 110 SECTION 5 NOTICES IMPORTANT NOTICES FOR EMPLOYEES AND SPOUSES AGE 65 AND OVER 111 Federal law may affect your coverage under this Plan. The Medicare as Secondary Payer rules were enacted by an amendment to the Social Security Act. Also, additional rules which specifically affect how a large group health plan provides coverage to employees (or their spouses) over age 65 were added to the Social Security Act and to the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, the health care plan of an employer that has at least 20 employees must operate in compliance with these rules in providing plan coverage to plan participants who have \"current employment stat us\" and are Medicare beneficiaries, age 65 and over. Persons who have \"current employment status\" with an employer are generally employees who are actively working and also persons who are NOT actively working as follows: Individuals receiving disability benefits from an employer for up to 6 months; or Individuals who retain employment rights and have not been terminated by the employer and for whom the employer continues to provide coverage under this Plan . (For example, employees who are on an approve d leave of absence). If you are a person with \"current employment status\" who is age 65 and over (or the dependent spouse age 65 and over of an employee of any age), your coverage under this Plan will be provided on the same terms and conditions as are ap plicable to employees (or dependent spouses ) who are under the age of 65. Your rights under this Plan do not change because you (or your dependent spouse ) are eligible for Medicare coverage on the basis of age, as long as you have \"current employment stat us\" with your employer . You have the option to reject plan coverage offered by your employer , as does any eligible employee . If you reject coverage under your employer's Plan , coverage is terminated and your employer is not permitted to offer you coverag e that supplements Medicare covered services . This includes any Medicare Supplement coverage that may be available to you as a result of your retirement through a Kentucky Retirement System. If you (or your dependent spouse ) obtain Medicare coverage on t he basis of age, and not due to disability or end -stage renal disease, this Plan will consider its coverage to be primary to Medicare when you have elected coverage under this Plan and have \"current employment status\". If a Medicare eligible employee is re-employed by any agency of the Commonwealth in a position working at least 100 hours per month (or otherwise eligible for benefits pursuant to KRS 18A.225), he or she will be eligible to re -enroll (or to remain enrolled) in the Kentucky Employees' Health Plan. While a Medicare eligible retiree is actively employed by the Commonwealth and eligible to participate in the KEHP, federal law provides that he or she is not eligible to receive coverage from any Kentucky retirement system (including the Kentucky Re tirement System, Judicial/Legislative Retirement, and Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System, etc.) that supplements the employee's Medicare coverage. According to federal Medicare laws, a health plan must pay primary to Medicare . Therefore, any health cove rage the employee receives from a Kentucky -sponsored program (KEHP) must pay for Medicare - covered expenses, up to the limit of his or her coverage under the Kentucky program, before applying to Medicare for payment. If an employee is currently receiving Medicare supplemental coverage from one of the Kentucky retirement system(s), the employee should drop this supplemental coverage while he or she is actively employed and eligible to participate in the KEHP. IMPORTANT NOTICES FOR EMPLOYEES AND SPOUSES AGE 65 AND OVER 112 If a Medicare eligible reemployed employee elects KEHP health plan or the \"waiver\" HRA, it must pay primary ( e.g. before) to Medicare covered expenses. If you have any questions about how coverage under this Plan relates to Medicare coverage, please contact your Medicare office . PRIVACY OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (continued) 113 This Plan is required by law to maintain the privacy of your protected health information in all forms including written, oral and electronically maintained, stored and transmitted information and to provide individuals with not ice of this Plan's legal duties and privacy practices with respect to protected health information . This Plan has policies and procedures specifically designed to protect your health information when it is in electronic format. This includes administra tive, physical and technical safeguards to ensure that your health information cannot be inappropriately accessed while it is stored and transmitted to Humana and others that support this Plan. In order for this Plan to operate, it may be necessary from t ime to time for health care professionals, the Plan Administrator , individuals who perform Plan -related functions under the auspices of the Plan Administrator , Humana and other service providers that have been engaged to assist this Plan in discharging its obligations with respect to delivery of benefits, to have access to what is referred to as protected health information . A covered person will be deemed to have consented to use of protected health information about him or her for the sole purpose of hea lth care operations by virtue of enrollment in this Plan . This Plan must obtain authorization from a covered person to use protected health information for any other purpose. Individually identifiable health information will only be used or disclosed for purposes of Plan operation or benefits delivery. In that regard, only the minimum necessary disclosure will be allowed. The Plan Administrator , Humana, and other entities given access to protected health information , as permitted by applicable law, will safeguard protected health information to ensure that the information is not improperly disclosed. Disclosure of protected health information is improper if it is not allowed by law or if it is made for any purpose other than Plan operation or benefits d elivery without authorization. Disclosure for Plan purposes to persons authorized to receive protected health information may be proper, so long as the disclosure is allowed by law and appropriate under the circumstances. Improper disclosure includes disclosure to the employer for employment purposes, employee representatives, consultants, attorneys, relatives, etc. who have not executed appropriate agreements effective to authorize such disclosure. Humana will afford access to protected health informati on in its possession only as necessary to discharge its obligations as a service provider , within the restrictions noted above. Information received by Humana is information received on behalf of this Plan . Humana will afford access to protected health i nformation as reasonably directed in writing by the Plan Administrator , which shall only be made with due regard for confidentiality. In that regard, Humana has been directed that disclosure of protected health information may be made to the person(s) ide ntified by the Plan Administrator . Individuals who have access to protected health information in connection with their performance of Plan-related functions under the auspices of the Plan Administrator will be trained in these privacy policies and relev ant procedures prior to being granted any access to protected health information . Humana and other Plan service providers will be required to safeguard protected health information against improper disclosure through contractual arrangements. PRIVACY OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (continued) 114 In addition , you should know that the employer /Plan Sponsor (Commonwealth of Kentucky ) may legally have access, on an as -needed basis, to limited health information for the purpose of determining Plan costs, contributions, Plan design, and whether Plan modifications are warranted. In addition, federal regulators such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor may legally require access to protected health information to police federal legal requirements about privacy. Covered persons may have access to protected health information about them that is in the possession of this Plan , and they may make changes to correct errors. Covered persons are also entitled to an accounting of all disclosures that may be made by any person who acquir es access to protected health information concerning them and uses it other than for Plan operation or benefits delivery. In this regard, please contact the Plan Administrator . Covered persons are urged to contact the originating health care professional with respect to medical information that may have been acquired from them, as those items of information are relevant to medical care and treatment. And finally, covered persons may consent to disclosure of protected health information , as they please. Please see the Kentucky Employees' Health Plan Notice of Privacy Practices and HIPAA Privacy and Security Policies for additional information. CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS 115 THE CONSOLIDATED OMN IBUS BUDGET RECONCIL IATION ACT OF 1986 (COBRA) CONTINUATION OF BENE FITS On April 7, 1986, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( COBRA ) was signed into law. This federal law applies to employers with 20 or more employees. The law requires that employers offer employees and/or thei r dependents continuation of medical coverage at group rates in certain instances where there is a loss of group insurance coverage. ELIGIBILITY A qualified beneficiary under COBRA law means an employee , employee's spouse or dependent child covered by th is Plan on the day before a qualifying event . A qualified beneficiary under COBRA law also includes a child born to the employee during the coverage period or a child placed for adoption with the employee during the coverage period. EMPLOYEE : An employe e covered by the employer's Plan has the right to elect continuation coverage if coverage is lost due to one of the following qualifying events : Termination (for reasons other than gross misconduct , as defined by your employer ) of the employee's employmen t or reduction in the hours of employee's employment; or Termination of retiree coverage when the former employer discontinues retiree coverage within one year before or one year after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. SPOUSE : A spouse covered by the employer's Plan has the right to elect continuation coverage if the group coverage is lost due to one of the following qualifying events : The death of the employee ; Termination of the employee's employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct , as defin ed by your employer ) or reduction of the employee's hours of employment with the employer ; Divorce or legal separation from the employee ; The employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits; or Termination of a retiree spouse's coverage when the former employer discontinues retiree coverage within one year before or one year after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. DEPENDENT CHILD : A dependent child covered by the employer's Plan has the right to continuation coverage if group coverage is lost due to on e of the following qualifying events : The death of the employee -parent; The termination of the employee -parent's employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct , as defined by your employer ) or reduction in the employee -parent's hours of employment w ith the employer ; The employee -parent's divorce or legal separation; CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS (continued) 116 Ceasing to be a \" dependent child\" under this Plan; The employee -parent becomes entitled to Medicare benefits; or Termination of the retiree -parent's coverage when the former employe r discontinues retiree coverage within one year before or one year after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. LOSS OF COVERAGE Coverage is lost in connection with the foregoing qualified events, when a covered employee , spouse or dependent child ceases to b e covered under the same Plan terms and conditions as in effect immediately before the qualifying event (such as an increase in the premium or contribution that must be paid for employee , spouse or dependent child coverage). If coverage is reduced or elim inated in anticipation of an event (for example, an employer eliminating an employee's coverage in anticipation of the termination of the employee's employment, or an employee eliminating the coverage of the employee's spouse in anticipation of a divorce o r legal separation), the reduction or elimination is disregarded in determining whether the event causes a loss of coverage. A loss of coverage need not occur immediately after the event, so long as it occurs before the end of the Maximum Coverage Period. NOTICES AND ELECTION This Plan provides that coverage terminates for a spouse due to legal separation or divorce or for a child when that child loses dependent status. Under the law, the employee or qualified beneficiary has the responsibility to infor m the Plan Administrator (see Plan Description Information) if one of the above events has occurred. The qualified beneficiary must give this notice within 60 days after the event occurs. (For example, an ex -spouse should make sure that the Plan Administ rator is notified of his or her divorce, whether or not his or her coverage was reduced or eliminated in anticipation of the event). When the Plan Administrator is notified that one of these events has happened, it is the Plan Administrator's responsibili ty to notify Humana who has contracted with a COBRA Service Provider who will in turn notify the qualified beneficiary of the right to elect continuation coverage. For a qualified beneficiary who is determined under the Social Security Act to be disabled at any time during the first 60 days of COBRA coverage, the continuation coverage period may be extended 11 additional months. The disability that extends the 18 -month coverage period must be determined under Title II (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability I nsurance) or Title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act. To be entitled to the extended coverage period, the disabled qualified beneficiary must provide notice to the COBRA Service Provider within the initial 18 month coverage per iod and within 60 days after the date of the determination of disability under the Social Security Act. Failure to provide this notice will result in the loss of the right to extend the COBRA continuation period. For termination of employment, reduction in work hours, the death of the employee , the employee becoming covered by Medicare or loss of retiree benefits due to bankruptcy, it is the Plan Administrator's responsibility to notify Humana who has contracted with a COBRA Service Provider who will in t urn notify the qualified beneficiary of the right to elect continuation coverage. Under the law, continuation coverage must be elected within 60 days after Plan coverage ends, or if later, 60 days after the date of the notice of the right to elect continu ation coverage. If continuation coverage is not elected within the 60 day period, the right to elect coverage under this Plan will end. CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL BENEF ITS (continued) 117 A covered employee or the spouse of the covered employee may elect continuation coverage for all covered dependents , even if the covered employee or spouse of the covered employee or all covered dependents are covered under another group health plan (as an employee or otherwise) prior to the election. The covered employee , his or her spouse and dependent child, however, each have an independent right to elect continuation coverage. Thus a spouse or dependent child may elect continuation coverage even if the covered employee does not elect it. Coverage will not be provided during the election period. However, if the ind ividual makes a timely election, coverage will be provided from the date that coverage would otherwise have been lost. If coverage is waived before the end of the 60 day election period and the waiver revoked before the end of the 60 day election period, coverage will be effective on the date the election of coverage is sent to the COBRA Service Provider . On August 6, 2002, The Trade Act of 2002 (TAA), was signed in to law. Workers whose employment is adversely affected by international trade (increased import or shift in production to another country) may become eligible to receive TAA. TAA provides a second 60 -day COBRA election period for those who become eligible for assistance under TAA. Pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974, an individual who is eithe r an eligible TAA recipient or an eligible alternative TAA recipient and who did not elect continuation coverage during the 60 -day COBRA election period that was a direct consequence of the TAA -related loss of coverage, may elect continuation coverage duri ng a 60 -day period that begins on the first day of the month in which he or she is determined to be TAA -eligible individual, provided such election is made not later than 6 months after the date of the TAA -related loss of coverage. Any continuation covera ge elected during the second election period will begin with the first day of the second election period and not on the date on which coverage originally lapsed. TAA created a new tax credit for certain individuals who became eligible for trade adjustment assistance (eligible individuals). Under the new tax provisions, eligible individuals can either take a tax credit or get advance payment of 65% of premiums paid for qualified health insurance, including continuation coverage. If you have questions abou t these new tax provisions, you may call the Health Care Tax Credit Customer Contact Center toll -free at 1 -866-628-4282. TTD/TTY callers may call toll -free at 1-866-626-4282. The Plan Administrator shall require documentation evidencing eligibility of TAA benefits. This Plan need not require every available document to establish evidence of TAA. The burden for evidencing TAA eligibility is that of the individual applying for coverage under this Plan . MAXIMUM COVERAGE PER IOD Coverage may continue up to: 18 months for an employee and/or dependent whose group coverage ended due to termination of the employee's employment or reduction in hours of employment; 36 months for a spouse whose coverage ended due to the death of the employee or retiree , divorc e, or the employee becoming entitled to Medicare at the time of the initial qualifying event ; 36 months for a dependent child whose coverage ended due to the divorce of the employee parent, the employee becoming entitled to Medicare at the time of the ini tial qualifying event , the death of the employee , or the child ceasing to be a dependent under this Plan ; CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS (continued) 118 For the retiree , until the date of death of the retiree who is on continuation due to loss of coverage within one year before or one year after the employer filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. DISABILITY An 11 -month extension of coverage may be available if any of the qualified beneficiaries are determined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to be disabled. The disability has to have started at som e time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18 - month period of continuation coverage. The qualified beneficiary must provide notice of such determination prior to the end of the initial 18 -month co ntinuation period to be entitled to the additional 11 months of coverage. Each qualified beneficiary who has elected continuation coverage will be entitled to the 11 -month disability extension if one of them qualifies. If a qualified beneficiary is deter mined by SSA to no longer be disabled, you must notify this Plan of that fact within 30 days after SSA's determination. SECOND QUALIFYING EVENT An 18 -month extension of coverage will be available to spouses and dependent children who elect continuation c overage if a second qualifying event occurs during the first 18 months of continuation coverage. The maximum amount of continuation coverage available when a second qualifying event occurs is 36 months. Such second qualifying event may include the death of a covered employee , divorce or separation from the covered employee , the covered employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), or a dependent child's ceasing to be eligible for coverage as a dependent under this Plan . These events can be a second qualifying event only if they would have caused the qualified beneficiary to lose coverage under this Plan if the first qualifying event had not occurred. You must notify this Plan within 60 days after the second qualifying event occurs if you want to extend your continuation coverage. TERMINATION BEFORE T HE END OF MAXIMUM CO VERAGE PERIOD Continuation coverage will terminate before the end of the maximum coverage period for any of the following reasons: The employer no longer provides group health coverage to any of its employees ; The premium for continuation is not paid timely; The individual on continuation becomes covered under another group health plan (as an employee or otherwise); however, if the new plan coverag e contains any exclusion or limitation with respect to any pre-existing condition , then continuation coverage will end for this reason only after the exclusion or limitation no longer applies or prior creditable coverage satisfies the exclusion or limitati on; NOTE: The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 requires portability of health care coverage effective for plan years beginning after June 30, 1997, an exclusion or limitation under the other group health plan may not app ly at all to the qualified beneficiary , depending on the length of his or her prior creditable coverage. Portability means once you obtain health insurance, you will be able to use evidence of that insurance to reduce or eliminate any pre -existing medical condition limitation period (under certain circumstances) when you move from one health plan to another. CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS (continued) 119 The individual on continuation becomes entitled to Medicare benefits; If there is a final determination under Title II or XVI of the Social Security Act that an individual is no longer disabled; however, continuation coverage will not end until the month that begins more than 30 days after the determination; The occurrence of any event (e.g. submission of a fraudulent claim ) permitting termination of coverage for cause under this Plan . TYPE OF COVERAGE; PR EMIUM PAYMENT If continuation coverage is elected, the coverage must be identical to the coverage provided under the employer's Plan to similarly situated non -COBRA beneficiaries. This means that if the coverage for similarly situated non -COBRA beneficiaries is modified, coverage for the individual on continuation will be modified. The initial premium payment for continuation coverage is due by the 45th day after coverage is elected. The initial premium includes charges back to the date the continuation coverage began. All other premiums are due on the first of the month for which the premium is paid, subject to a 31 day grace period. The COBRA Service Provider must provide the individual with a quote of the total monthly premium . Premium for continuation coverage may be increased, however, the premium may not be increased more than once in any determination period. The determination period is a 12 month period which is established by this Plan . The monthly premium payment to this Plan for continuing coverage must be submitted directly to the COBRA Service Provider . This monthly premium may include the employee's share and any portion previously paid by the employer . The monthly premium must be a reasonable estimate of the cost of providing coverage under this Plan for similarly situated non -COBRA beneficiaries. The premium for COBRA continuation coverage may include a 2% administration charge. However, for qualified beneficiaries who are re ceiving up to 11 months additional coverage (beyond the first 18 months) due to disability extension (and not a second qualifying event ), the premium for COBRA continuation coverage may be up to 150% of the applicable premium for the additional months. Qu alified beneficiaries who do not take the additional 11 months of special coverage will pay up to 102% of the premium cost. OTHER INFORMATION Additional information regarding rights and obligations under this Plan and under federal law may be obtained b y contacting the COBRA Service Provider or Humana. It is important for the covered person or qualified beneficiary to keep the Plan Administrator , COBRA Service Provider and Humana informed of any changes in marital status, or a change of address.

PREMIUM PAYMENT If continuation of Plan coverage is elected under USERRA, the employee or dependent is responsible for payment of the applicable cost of coverage. If the employee is absent for 30 days or less, the cost will be the amount the employee would otherwise pay for coverage. For absences exceeding 30 days, the cost may be up to 102% of the cost of coverage under this Plan . This includes the employee's share and any portion previously paid by the employer . DURATION OF COVERAGE Elected continuation coverage under USERRA will continue until the earlier of: 24 months beginning the first day of absence from employment due to service in the unif ormed services; or The day after the employee fails to apply for, or return to employment, as required by USERRA, after completion of a period of service.

The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program is a Federal program that was established under the Affordable Care Act. Under the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, the Federal government reimburses a plan sponsor of a n employment -based health plan for some of the costs of health care benefits paid on behalf of, or by, early retirees and certain family members of early retirees participating in the employment - based plan. By law, the program expires on January 1, 2014. Under the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, your plan sponsor may choose to use any reimbursements it receives from this program to reduce or offset increases in plan participants' premium contributions, co - payments, deductibles, co -insurance, or other o ut-of-pocket costs. If the plan sponsor chooses to use the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program reimbursements in this way, you, as a plan participant, may experience changes that may be advantageous to you, in your health plan coverage terms and conditions, for so long as the reimbursements under this program are available and this plan sponsor chooses to use the reimbursements for this purpose. A plan sponsor may also use the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program reimbursements to reduce or offset increases in i ts own costs for maintaining your health benefits coverage, which may increase the likelihood that it MEDICAID AND THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) 124 Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Offer Free Or Low -Cost Health Coverage To Children And Families If you are eligible for health coverage from your employer , but are unable to afford the premiums, some States have premium assistance programs that can help pay for coverage.

If you qualify, you can ask the State if it has a program that might help you pay the premiums for an employer -spons ored plan. Once it is determined that you or your dependents are eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP, your employer's health plan is required to permit you and your dependents to enroll in the plan - as long as you and your dependents are eligible, but not already enrolled in the employer's plan. This is called a \"special enrollment\" opportunity, and you must request coverage within 60 days of being determined eligible for premium assistance .

Proc. 2008 -48 applies (regarding certain children of divorced or separated p arents who receive more than half of their support for the calendar year from one or both parents and are in the custody of one or both parents for more than half of the calendar year). Because this plan is \"grandfathered\", this plan is not required to ext end coverage to children who are eligible for coverage under another employer's group health plan ( e.g., eligible under the plan of the child's own employer). This plan has interpreted this to mean the child full -time employer. A \"grandfathered\" plan canno t deny coverage if a child is eligible for coverage under another parent's group health plan, however. A \"child\" is an individual who is the employee's son, daughter, stepson, or stepdaughter, and includes both a legally adopted individual of the employee and an individual lawfully placed with the employee for legal adoption by the employee.
