Initial ConsultationYour first consultation will last between 60-90 minutes. During this time we will examine your presenting health concern and goals, your medical history, your different body systems and how they are functioning, as well as your current diet and lifestyle. This discussion will help us to see how your health is from a holistic view and will form the basis for developing a personalised treatment plan for you. You will be asked before the appointment to complete a form detailing the above areas so that we can use our time together effectively and it also allows your practitioner to clarify and discuss any areas that are key in your treatment plan. You will also be asked to provide copies of any relevant medical tests related to your presenting health concern. At the end of the consultation, you will be provided with an initial treatment plan and guidance on when you should return for your next appointment. Your treatment plan is always tailored to you and may include herbal medicine and nutrition therapy that is backed by scientific research, as well as diet and lifestyle changes. Follow up consultations Follow up consultations last for 60 minutes or 45 minutes depending on the complexity of your case. We will use this time to discuss any changes you have experienced, including any improvements and modifications may be made to further tailor your treatment plan. "}
