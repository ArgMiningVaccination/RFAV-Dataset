It still enjoys mass support in several countries. The contribution of Unani Me dicine in the development of medical sciences is well known. J abir ibn Hayyan [737-815 AD] is the first known pharmacist who invented the method of drug development in its present form. Zakariya R azi (Rhazes) [865-925 AD] is the first physician who started the practice of recording Clinical History and establishment of Hospitals. Abu al-Qasim Zahrawi al-Andalus i (Albucasis) [936-1036 AD] was the first surgeon who invented many surgical tools. Besides, there were several others who cont ributed to the development of medical science. Ibn Sina (Avicenna) [980-1037 AD] laid down the Standard Medical curriculum for the first time and compiled his well-known treatise Al-Qanun fi'l Tibb. Ibn Bay tar [1197-1248 AD] was the first Botanist who described the distinct features of medicinal plants in a scientific manner. In India, Unani Medicine enjoys wider acceptance among the people. Since independence, the Government of India have been extending increasing support and funds for the multifaceted development of Unani Medicine as well as other indigenous systems of medicine. As far as Unani Medicine is concerned, India is the world leader having the widest network of educational, research, healthcare and pharmaceutical institutions of this system. The Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM), an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India since its inception in 1978 is engaged in developing scientific research on various applied and fundamental aspects of Unan i Medicine. The Council has over the years emerged as the leading research organization for Unani Medicine and has obtained significant strides in its research programmes covering Clinical Research, Drug Standardization, Survey and Cultivat ion of Medicinal Plants and Literary Research. The progress of the Council has at tracted the attention of the scientific community both in the country and abro ad. The CCRUM is also busy developing collaborations with leading research institut ions of medical and allied sciences to develop and provide safe and satisfactory solutions to health problems. It is heartening to note that World Health Organization (WHO) since the Declaration of Alma Ata (1978) has been taking great interest in the revival of Traditional Medicine including Unani Medicine. The idea behind this was to make essential healthcare within the reach of larg er sections of population worldwide at an affordable cost. vi The present work on \"Standardization of Unani Medicine Terminology\" has been carried out by the CCRUM in collaboration with the WHO. This project aimed at standardizing and defining the various or iginal Arabic, Persian and Urdu terms used in Unani Medicine in English with a view to making them understandable to a wider English-knowing world. This is indeed a commendable initiative. This volume contains both clinical and non-clin ical terms along with their explanations. For the correct pronunciation of the terms, standard diacritical marks have been adopted. It goes without saying that the present work will help develop a better understanding of the classical concepts of Unani Medicine. I wish to express our deep gratitude to the WHO for the support, and to the Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, especially the Secretary and Joint Secretary of the Department, for their patronage. Thanks are also due to Hakim Syed Asad Pasha, Deputy Advisor (Unani) and Hakim Mukhtar Ahmad Qasmi, Assistant Advisor (Unani), both at Department of AYUSH, and all the experts and scholars associated with this project, from different Institutes i.e. AMU, Aligarh, National Institute of Unani Medicine, Bengaluru, A&U Karol Bagh, New Delhi and Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi for their respective contributions. I must also appreciate Hakim Ziauddin Ah mad, Principal Investigator and other officers of the Council who have worked very hard to make the project a reality. It should be hoped that this present vo lume would serve a meaningful resource for the researchers, and would be welcom ed among the scientific community. 28 March 2012 Prof. S.

However, it has undergone several transformations and is known at present by different names in different parts of the world, such as Greco-Arab Medicine, Ionian Medicine, Arab Medicine, Islamic Medicine, Traditional Medicine, etc. It was the Greek philosopher physician Hippocrates, regard ed as the Father of Medicine who liberated Medicine from the realm of supersti tion and magic, and gave it the status of a science. It advanced with the wealth of scientific thought and influence of men of learning of that age like Aristotle, Theophrastus, Dioscorides and Galen. The system traveled to Rome, Alexandria, Byzan tine, finally arriving at Jundishapur in Iran. In the middle of the Eight Century AD it entered Baghdad under the rule of Abbasid dynasty where it received a warm welcome and the leading luminaries of learning belonging to different religions, Musl ims, Christians and others gravitated towards it and focused their energies to translate intellectual heritage of philosophy and Medicine into Arabic lang uage. Within a span of a century [750- 850 AD], a large number of important wor ks of different sciences were translated into Arabic, paving way for their further advancement. A house of wisdom known as Bayt al- Hikma flourished during the caliphate of Harun Rashid [786-808 AD] and M amun Rashid [813-833 AD] under the of renowned physician Hunayn ibn Is haq [809-877 AD] which produced great scholars AD], Qus ta ibn Luqa [d. 912 AD] etc. Incidentally, that age also witnessed the emergence of some great scientists, physicians, surgeons and authors like In sum, the Unani Medicine amalgamated the best in contemporary systems of traditional Medicine in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Persia, India, China and other Middle East and Far East Countries. The system was introduced in India by the Iranians and took firm roots in the soil becoming a native very soon. The Sultans of Delhi, the Khilj is, the Tughlaqs and the Mughal emperors not only provided st ate patronage to the system but enrolled some Unani physicians as court physicians. During the 13 th and 17th century Unani Medicine had its heyday in India as the system enjoyed popular support throughout the length and breadth of the country. Valuable contributions by Akbar Arzani [d.1721 AD], Abu Bakr K ashani, i Khan [1669-1749 AD] were also made during xvi this period. The scholars and physicians of Unani Medicine settled in India were not content with the known advantages of the drugs and subjected them to clinical trials and experiments making important additions to the scope of Medicine. The trend continued till the downfall of Mugh al empire. However, as Unani Medicine found favour with the public it continued to flourish in India till today. It would be unfair to ignore th e crucial support provided by Shar ifi family of Delhi, 'Azizi family of Lucknow and the Ni zam of Hyderabad that helped the Unani Medicine to survive against all odds duri ng the British rule. History would be incomplete without paying a fitting tribute to Hakim A'zam Khan [1813-1902 AD], a great physician and author of several marvelous books on Medicine e.g. Iksir-i A'zam, Qarabadin-i A'zam and Muhit-i A'zam, etc. which continue to be revered as the most authentic books on Unani Medicine in Persian language, even after about 200 years of their publication. The imprints of the contributions of Hakim Ajmal Khan, an outstanding scholar and physician of Unani Medicine, are visible in the form of Ayurvedic and Un ani Tibbia College, Delhi even today. His firm belief in Unani Medicine which led to discovery of antihypertensive activity of Asrol (Rauwolfia serpentina) is a well known saga. The Maj idi Family of Delhi, especially Hakim 'Abdul Hamid who made valuable contribution by modernizing the Unani Drug Industry and setting up an Instit ute of History of Medicine and Medical Research (IHMMR) which now stands merged with J ami'a Hamdard, New Delhi. The 'Uthm ani family of Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh) deserves acclaim for the support to the cause of Unani Medicine who dedicated a large college and hospital for education and training in Unani Medicine which is now running under the State control and the Niamath family of Chennai (Tamil Nadu) for their unflinching support of Unani Medicine. On the other side of spectrum were scholars like Hakim H adi Husayn Mur adabadi [b.19th [1906-1972 AD] who rendered im portant classics available in Arabic and Persian languages into Urdu th us filling a great void and illuminating the path of learning for the students of Unani Medicine who are not familiar with these languages. After independence, the Indian systems of Medicine got a boost through a Government initiative when in 1969 the Government of India established Central Council for Research in Indian Medicine and Homoeopathy (CCRIMH) to promote research in different Indian Systems of Medicine namely Ayurveda, Unani Medicine, Siddha, Yoga & Naturopathy and Homoeopathy. The CCRIMH later spilt into separate Councils for each system. Today, there is a full fledged Department for these Systems of Medicine, known as Department of AYUSH, under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, which has xvii been entrusted the task of overall developme nt of all these systems. With its large network of educational and research institutions, hospitals and registered practitioners Unani Medicine forms an integral part of National Healthcare delivery system in India. Theories and Philosophies of Unani Medicine Unani Medicine is based upon the theo ry of humours, which presupposes the presence of four humours in the body, namely blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. The temperaments of persons are expressed accordingly by the words sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric and melancholic according to preponderance of the respective humour. The humours themselves are assigned temperaments. Blood is hot and moist; phlegm , cold and moist; yellow bile, hot and dry; black bile , cold and dry. Likewise, the drugs are also considered to have temperaments which are classified on the basis of their potency into grades or degrees. In Unani Medicine, the human body is considered to comprise of the following seven components, each having a close relation with the state of health of an individual: 1. Arkan: States of matter and the materials entering into and forming a part of everything in the universe 2. Mizaj: Bodily temperament 3. Akhlat: Body fluids 4. Ruh: The vital force or life force 5. A'da': Fully grown organs 6. Quwa: The bodily powers or faculties 7. Af 'al: The corporeal functions Besides, there is a residual power of self preservation or adjustment endowed by the nature, called medicatrix naturae, which strives to restore any disturbance within the limits of the constitutional state of an individual. States of the Body According to Unani physicians, states of the body are categorized in three groups as under: 1. Sihhat (Health): in which the entire bodily functions are performed normally. 2. Marad (Disease): is opposite of the heal th in which one or more functions or forms of the body organs are at fault. 3. La Sihhat La Marad (Neither health nor disease): the term is applied for a state of neither complete health nor disease e.g. old people or those convalescing. xviii Diagnostic Methods From the very beginning, Unani physicians have laid great emphasis on the investigation of the cause of disease an d employed following means to determine the cause and nature of disease for correct diagnosis. Pulse \u0081 Quantity \u0081 Force \u0081 Duration of movement \u0081 Condition \u0081 Volume \u0081 Duration of rest period \u0081 Palpation of the pulse \u0081 Equality and inequality \u0081 Balance of the pulse \u0081 Rhythm Physical Examination of Urine \u0081 Odour \u0081 Consistency \u0081 Froth Types of Treatment Based on the cause and nature of disease, Unani Medicine deals with the problem through various Other Modes of Diagnosis In addition to the above, other conven tional modes of diagnosis such as have also been used by the Unani physicians. Besides, modern tools and techniques of diagnosis are also used by Unani physicians these days, e.g. X-ray, Ultrasound, ECG, MRI and Pathological investigations. Prophylaxis or Prevention of Disease Critics of Unani Medicine often claim that it does not offer anything by way of prophylaxis but the fact remains that it gives as much importance to prevention as to cure. It recognizes the influence of environment and surrounding on health and lays great emphasis on the maintenance of proper eco balance as well as pure water, food and air. Besides, it prescribes Asb ab Sitta Daruriyya (six essentials) for maintaining good health. \u0081 Ma'kul-o-Mashr ub (Foods (Evacuation and Retention) A good Unani physician is supposed to consider all factors before reaching a diagnosis. Unani Medicine Terminology and Unani Physicians Ancient Unani physicians were fully aware of the importance of Unani Medicine Terminology (UMT) and nomenclature. Buqr at (Hippocrates) [460 BC] lays utmost stress on clear-cut explanations a nd transmission of correct sense of terms, which is clearly evident in his books, particularly Hippocratic Aphorism ( /g8619/glyph1649/glyph307/bqr/glyph296/glyph329/g9169 ). Jalin us (Galen) [131-210 five Physician authors of subsequent periods also compiled xx glossaries and mini-dictionaries on the su bject. Excellent work was carried out on the subject during Islamic period. Khaw arizmi [d. 980 AD] compiled a book titled Mafatih al-'Ulum (/glyph360/g11964 /glyph1649/glyph307/glyph296/glyph352/glyph462/glyph439/glyph470/glyph433/g13605) to explain the terms used in different arts and sciences. Its 3rd chapter is dedicated to Unani medical terms. Terms of anatomy, ailments, drugs, weights and measures have been elucidated in this chapter. Most of the authors dedicated a part of their books to explain Unani Medical Terms, e.g. a famous but rare book of Mu hammad ibn Zakariyy is subject. According to Ibn Ab i Usaybi'a [1203-1270 AD], the book comprises of 12 aqs am (discourses). Nomenclature of drugs, weights and their explanation in Greek, Syrian, Persian, Hindi and Arabic languages bear high si gnificance. Organs and related diseases have also been described. Ab u al-Mansur ibn Nuh al-Qamar i (/glyph369/g12074 /glyph1649/glyph307/glyph296/glyph351/g15194/glyph296/bn/glyph296 /glyph1651/glyph447/glyph1653/glyph428/glyph380/glyph468/glyph440/glyph368/glyph332/glyph1649/glyph307/glyph296/bw/glyph1649/glyph307) [d. Medical terms and relevant words have been described under different chapters. Ab u book Kitab al-Tasrif (/g16420/g11541 /glyph1649/glyph307/glyph296/glyph460/glyph429/g9755) for surgery which comprises surgical terms. Copious matter on this subject is also available in Al-Rawda al-Tibbiyya are also noteworthy. The branch of Lughat Nav isi (writing of Dictionary) grabbed the attention of Indian physician authors. For instance, Rustam Jurj ani [16th Century twentieth chapter consists medicine). Similarly, M ir /g12452 /glyph1649/glyph308/glyph409/glyph1651/glyph447) exclusively on dosage of the drugs. A prominent figure of this field is Mu hammad ibn Yusuf al-Harw i [16th Century AD], whose book Bahr al-Jawahir (/glyph1651/glyph450/glyph463/glyph343/glyph1649/glyph307/g11641/glyph1649/glyph307/glyph296/b published from Ma tba' Mujtab a'i, Delhi in 1321 AH turned the most widely read book in the community of Unani physicians. Some other important books on the Hakim Muhammad Na sir, Qutbiyya xxi Aims and Objectives of the Document As cultures grow and spread to new territories, they merge with native civilizations, adapting to local norms and la nguages. However, in this global era, one of the languages which bind the globe is English. Hence, there is a need for standard terms that may be understood universally. In view of this, WHO is organizing such exercises for all traditio nal systems including Unani Medicine. The responsibility of Standardization of Unan i Medicine Terms has been entrusted to Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM), an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India. In all modesty, the CCRUM has completed the task in a very short period of 10 months. However, the present work is restr icted to just Clinical and Non-clinical terms and does not represent Unani Medicine as a whole, nor is it possible to encompass the works of great scholars spread over centuries in a minuscule. Still, an attempt has been made to include as many terms as possible, and in all the present volume carries 4,028 terms. Nature of Terminology In this document, two categories of technical terms used in Unani Medicine, are mentioned viz., classical and non-classica l. Classical terms are those which were used originally by Unani physicians of medieval period, as well as Indian physicians of early period. Non-classical terms are those which were coined from the middle of the 20 th century AD and are included in the literature of Unani Medicine in order to provide the books of the subjects in Urdu language for the students. Selection of Terms Needless to say that most of the terms used in the classical literature date back to over one to two thousand years and used e ven today in original sense. However, many terms have evolved with the lang uage while many new terms devised. Hence, terms selected from ancient literature have been evaluated in the light of recent advancements and incorporated to co nvey the real sense of Unani Medicine Terms. The terms are taken as they were do cumented in the books referred to in most of the cases but a few have been modifie d in order to maintain the uniformity of the document. xxii Diacritical Marks Since all the technical terms of Unani Medicine have been selected from classical Arabic, Persian and Urdu literature, transliteration of these terms with correct pronunciation in English was extremely challenging. Therefore, diacritical marks have been incorporated as priority to facilitate its understanding and acceptability at the global level. Transliteration table given in the beginning will make consultation easier for readers. Unification and Standardization As English equivalents for a number of Unani Medical Terms, are available often causing confusion, unification and standa rdization of these terms gain immense importance for better understanding of nuances and concepts. Principles of Description in English Accuracy in reflection of original concept of UMT : Possible English equivalents for Unani Medical Terms have been included in this document. These equivalents have been taken from universally recognized English, English-Arabic or vice versa, English-Persian or vice versa dictionaries and glossaries. These equivalents have been given towards the end of description in italics to make them distinct. In exceptional cases, the terms have been d erived from available English words with slight modification. In unavoidable circumstances, no English equivalent has been given. At such places, a simple description has been made to covey the real sense of UMT. It may be noted that though the description of UMT is closely related to the appropriate translation, it is not merely simple translation and may not be treated as such. Methods and approaches The work of Standardization of Unani Medi cine Terminology has been carried out by the researchers of CCRUM and reviewed by external experts, subject experts and peer group respectively. Non-clinical terms have been worked out by Literary Institute of Unani Medicine, New Delhi wh ile Clinical terms have been compiled by Regional Research Institute of Unani Medicine, New Delhi. Consultations were held after the preparatio n of drafts and discussed in detail by subject experts. Changes, wherever necessary, were made according to experts' opinions and the final draft was subm itted to WHO after approval by the Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India. xxiii Contents of Unani Medicine Terminology The technical terms included in this docume nt have been classified into two groups i.e. non-clinical and clinical, comprising of the following subjects prescribed by Central Council of Indian Medicine in its current syllabus for five and a half years duration degree course Bachelor of Unani Medicine & Surgery (BUMS) . 1. Tashrih (Anatomy) 2. Manafi' al-A'da' ( Physiology) 4. Mantiq wa Falsafa wa 'Ilm-i Hay'at (Pharmacology) 6. 'Ilm al-Amr ad wa Saririyyat Bed side Medicine) 7. Tahaffuzi wa Samaji Tibb (Preventive and Social Medicine) 8. Tibb al-Qanun (Medical Jurisprudence) 9. 'Ilm al-Sam um (Toxicology) 10. Mu'alajat (Medicine) 11. Medicine T erminology (UMT) has been presented in tabular form according to the WHO fo rmat, under the following headings: 1. Code 2. Terms in original languages viz. Arabic, Persian and Urdu in 'Alaw i Nasta'liq 3. Transliteration with diacritical marks 4. Description (with possible English equivalents) 'Alawi Nasta'liq will preserve the identity of the Unani Medicine Terminology in the relevant languages in Microsoft Word facilitating net access worldwide while acting as a safeguard for the Arabic, Persian and Urdu language terms. The transliteration with diacritical marks will help in the accurate pronunciation and better identification of the terms described. Bibliography The description has been written carefully going through the classical as well as modern literature and due care has been taken, not to deteriorate the sense and essence of the classical literature. Generally, the oldest editions of the classical books referred to have been mentioned in bibliography to avoid any type of xxiv alteration. Periods of publications and authors have been mentioned according to Christian or Islamic calendar e.g. Ibn S ina [980-1037 AD] or corresponding Hegira as the case may be.

The condition is caused due to the hot or cold impaired temperament of kidneys. Due to the hot derangement, the fat over the kidneys gets dissolved and they become weak and their size decreases. If there is cold derangement, the kidney become weak due to the weakened digestive faculties. Sometimes it may be due to excessive sexual indulgence and intake of diuretics or purgatives. In this condition, urine becomes colourless and its quantity increases. Its possible English equivalent is renal atrophy to this is a disease in which the expulsive faculty of kidneys becomes strong and they expel maximum water. It is a disease in which patient remains thirsty. The water taken by the patient is expelled out from the body without change or metabolism. It is due to the weakness of kidneys in which the calyces become dilated and are unable to hold water i.e. the retaining capacity of the kidneys is reduced. It can also be due to exposure to cold climate or increased intake of cold water. The most common cause is the increase in the innate heat of kidneys either simple, organic which increase the absorption of water from kidneys and thereby its expulsion.
