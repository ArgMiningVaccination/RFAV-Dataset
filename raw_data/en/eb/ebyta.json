Furthermore, the long-term conventional drug use comes with substantial risks to public health, such as the rapid evolution of drug resistance and the emergence of secondary side effects. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new methods for the treatment of virus-related diseases. In this case, the use of nanomaterial-based nanomedicines possesses tremendous advantages over the traditional treatment approach. Nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems have unique features that make them promising candidates in the pursuit of therapeutic benefits. In this review, we present the various biocompatible nanomaterials that show promise as nanomedicines for anti-viral therapy. Also, we include how current developments in nanomedicine are being used to treat and prevent the most common viral illnesses such as the flu, HIV, SARS-CoV-2, "}
