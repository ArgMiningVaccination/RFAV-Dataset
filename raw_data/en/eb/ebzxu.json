Murphy was awarded the nation's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor. His record of service didn't end there. Murphy went on to serve 23 years with VA as a counselor and direc-tor of veteran services in New Mexico. And after retiring from the federal government, he chose to serve veterans an-other eight years as a volunteer at the Albuquerque VA Medi-cal Center. Murphy died in 2007 and insisted on being buried in his VA volunteer's jacket. Com-ing from a Marine Medal of Honor recipient, that says a lot about the fulfillment found in serving others. Murphy was first and last a volunteer. The same kindness\u2014the same shared sense of humanity that drove him up that hill in search of fellow Marines\u2014also moti-vated his many years of service to veterans. With your new degree, there are many things you will be able to do for yourself, but there are also many things you can do for others. My advice and appeal to you is to find purpose for your lives. Find a passion that gets you up each day and makes it difficult to turn in each night. And if it's serving others, ei-ther publicly or privately, this country and the world will be a much better place.Find a Passion That Gives Your Life Meaningful Purpose Eric K. Shinseki Secretary of Veterans Affairs What is most needed are people who are regularly, habitually and deliberately kind\u2014people who make caring for others a personal devotion, a part of their everyday lives. Editor's note: It's graduation season, and Secretary Shinseki sent graduates of the University of Vermont and the University of Maryland University College off into their brave new world with a commencement reminder that the challenge of beginning a career and making a life shouldn't overshadow the obliga-tion and opportunity to serve others; in fact, as his following remarks indicate, service to oth-ers is necessary for a full and complete life. It is said that \"some people succeed because they are destined to, but most people succeed because they are de-termined to.\" Many of you juggled family, work and school to complete your stud-ies. You took the time and money others spent on recre-ation, and you invested it in an education. Now, you have more time again. You own the potential for better jobs at higher pay. You know what it takes to organize yourselves to achieve an incredibly difficult goal like this one. And more important-ly, you now have the luxury of deciding how to share your time and your talents with those less fortunate. Make no mistake about it; one of life's greatest gifts is to have meaningful purpose to what you do every day, beyond getting up and going through the routine of making a living. Fulfilling that purpose is part of your reward. I'm talking about more than just \"random acts of kindness\" here. Random acts of kindness are important, but they are not enough. What is most needed are people who are regularly, habitually and deliberately kind\u2014people who make caring for others a per-sonal devotion, a part of their everyday lives. Someone once wrote that \"volunteers don't get paid\u2014not because they're worthless, but because they're priceless.\" Well, at VA, we do calculate the value of what our 140,000 volunteers provide by serving veterans at our hospitals, vet centers and cemeteries. Con-servatively, they donate $240 million in labor and $83 mil-lion in donations each year. But there are things that they do that cannot be converted into dollar values. What's the price of a thank you? How about an hour of patience? What's the going rate for dignity and respect for combat veterans, who have already given so much? Such values cannot be calculated, yet these are things veterans remember and mention to me whenever we meet. We can no more put a value on kindness than we can put a price on heroism. Kind-ness and heroism are not as far apart as you might think. Let me share a short story. Jerry Murphy grew up in Pueblo, Colo. After finishing high school in 1947, he went straight to college. Graduating four years later, he was sitting where you are now\u2014wonder-ing when his commencement speaker was going to wrap up. Then, as now, the nation was at war, and so right after graduation, Murphy joined the Marines. In a few short months, he was in Korea com-manding a platoon in combat. In February 1953, Mur- phy's platoon was held in re-serve while the rest of his com-pany attacked a heavily forti-fied hill. During the assault, most of the company's officers and noncommissioned officers were killed or wounded. The battered company was leader-less on the hilltop and taking more casualties. From below, Murphy could see that something had gone wrong. He immediately seized the initiative and led his platoon up the hill. Arriv-ing on the objective, Murphy found that the numbers of dead, dying and wounded were significant. Rallying his fellow Ma- rines, Murphy began evacuat-ing the wounded\u2014carrying many of them himself and re-organizing the company to enable a withdrawal under fire. Wounded twice, he refused medical attention until he had accounted for every Marine and led his rescue party to safety. Murphy was the last man to leave that bloody hilltop. For voluntarily risking his life to save his fellow Marines, VAnguard July/August 2010 5OUTLOOKOUTLOOK through Hey VA messages, videoconferences and VAn- guard in the future. A link to additional information about the initiatives is available on the VBA Intranet home page. The department faces a remarkable challenge with the unprecedented volume of disability claims being filed\u2014with more disabilities in each claim, more complex medical issues, new mandates and the fruits of effective outreach and transition services, particu-larly as veterans leave ongo-ing military operations with residual issues ranging from post-traumatic stress disorder to musculoskeletal disabilities. At the same time, we're hon-ored to provide new benefits for some Vietnam veterans and Gulf War veterans based on new policies. As we try radical new strategies to meet the challenge of this rising tide by embracing constructive change, one prin-ciple will stand above all the programs and paperwork and processes. We will faithfully put our veterans first to ensure they are served fully and fairly to obtain the benefits they rightfully earned. Momentum is building as we retool our business models to make us more veteran-centric, accessible and productive\u2014 in short, agile and less bureaucratic.New Claims Campaign Aimed at Addressing Backlog Mike Walcoff Acting Under Secretary for Benefits We've asked VA employees to challenge our core business practices as we aim for a high mark to improve our service to the nation's veterans. I'm confident the Veterans Ben-efits Administration's hard-working front-line staff is up to the challenge of making our 21st-century transformation a reality. Changes have been implemented before, but our re-examination of processing now is driven by our front-line employees and managers who know their jobs and their needs the best, those who want to serve veterans fairly and rapidly. Secretary Shinseki has set the mark to break the back of the backlog in a very specific way: by 2015, there should be no rating claim in VBA's in-ventory taking more than 125 days to complete. Progress in serving veterans more quickly must be matched with out-standing rating accuracy of no less than 98 percent. Our response is serious and our resolve unwavering. We call this response the VBA Claims Campaign. In part, we've taken a radical approach through a simple virtue some may sus-pect is sometimes forgotten in Washington: listening. We asked our claims processing employees, our managers and our administrative personnel for their best ideas on how we can adjust processes and provide the tools needed for excellence. The result: We have dozens of initiatives in prog-ress vigorously testing these changes while measuring and monitoring the impacts. Some early activities are already mov-ing to full implementation, and results will be tangible to our staff and our stakeholders. As you read in the last issue of VAnguard, we started with President Obama's call in August 2009 for an Innova-tion Initiative Competition seeking fresh ideas from em-ployees. We've supplemented the 10 winning ideas with more than two dozen addi-tional strategies from both our field and headquarters person-nel. Momentum is building as we retool our business models to make us more veteran-centric, accessible and produc-tive\u2014in short, agile and less bureaucratic. Starting with 3,200 em- ployee suggestions from the competition and additional synergy of ideas from our enthusiastic regional office and area directors at a March conference, we are moving forward. By May, some ideas were in pilots or small-scale execution, but some also were already being implemented as national policy. We are reaching out to veterans more often by tele-phone to resolve questions and gather evidence. We need thoughtful triage of claims to identify those that can be quickly paid based on initial evidence to get the veteran what we can today while other issues are resolved. For ex-ample, some regional offices are working to serve veterans immediately by encouraging them to come in person with all the evidence needed to leave the office that day with a rating decision. One field team is building a new employee recognition program for our veterans ser-vice representatives and rating veterans service representatives whose work is of the highest quality and who are, at the same time, highly productive. Their skill and expertise can be an inspiration to newer employees as we sustain a workplace where excellence is acknowledged and valued. We are being careful to protect veterans' rights as a highest priority as we expand our pilot program to expedite \"fully developed\" claims to all regional offices nationwide. These \"fully developed\" claims are submitted with certifica-tion that all available evidence is included with the claim, which allows us to deliver a rating decision more rapidly. These are just a few of the Campaign Plan innova-tions, and we hope to provide you more detail and updates Breaking the Back of the Backlog reducing the disability claims backlog is a top priority of secretary shinseki. By 2015, there should be no rating claim in VB a's inventory that takes more than 125 days to complete. and speedier processing must be matched with rating accuracy of no less than 98 percent. 6 VAnguard July/August 2010Twenty-six win- ning employee ideas in the Veterans Health Ad-ministration/Office of Information and Tech- nology Innovation Competition will help the department improve health care quality, ac-cess and transparency. \"At VA, we are con- stantly looking for new ways to improve the care we deliver,\" said Secretary Eric K. Shin-seki. \"The employees who participated in this competition exhibited tre- mendous creativity and out-of-the-box thinking.\" The department will implement a set of health care IT solutions put forth by those who know the challenges best: employees. Inside Information Dr. Ronald Schifman, center, with colleagues Evelyn Harrison and Daniel Luevano, submitted an idea to reduce unnecessary/duplicate lab tests by rules-based algorithms.joHN k. sokolowski VAnguard July/August 2010 7This is the most recent effort un- der the VA Innovation Initiative, a department-wide program that brings the most promising innovations to the department's most important chal-lenges by involving employees and the private sector in the creation of visionary solutions. Launched in February, the VHA/ OIT Innovation Competition solicit-ed health care IT solutions that move VA forward in its transformation to a provider of 21st-century services for the nation's veterans. The 26 winners represent 23 dif- ferent VA medical centers, program offices or regional health care entities from 17 states. The chosen innova-tions will receive funding and support for prototype development and imple- mentation. The VHA/OIT Innovation Com- petition attracted broad participation, yielding more than 6,500 ideas from department employees. After a Web-based community voting method narrowed the submissions to a smaller group of finalists, a panel of federal and private sector health care and IT leaders reviewed the top proposals and selected the winners. The panel consisted of 24 depart- ment employees and other distin- guished participants, including Dr. Harvey Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine; Dr. Robert Kolodner, health IT consultant; Dr. Mehret Mandefro, White House fel-low; Dr. Stephen Ondra, VA's senior policy advisor for health affairs; Peter Levin, VA's chief technology officer; Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist; and Todd Park, chief technology offi- cer for the Department of Health and Human Services. The VHA/OIT Innovation Competition follows the department's Veterans Benefits Administration Innovation Competition, which was launched last August by President Obama in support of his mission to make government more effective, in- novative and open. Both innovation competitions are part of the VA Innovation Initiative. VAi2 identifies, funds, tests and de-ploys new efforts that significantly im-prove the access, quality, performance and cost of VA services. Here's a look at the winning ideas. n Dr. Richard Martinello, of West Haven, Conn., submitted developing and investigating automated elec-tronic methods to capture medical device data from Veterans Informa- tion Systems and Technology Archi-tecture (VistA) in near real time. A robust automated electronic system would allow for accurate measurement of medical device use and intra- and inter-facility comparisons.n Dr. Roger Bedimo, of Dallas, sub- mitted computerized patient record system-based automated queries and reports to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based program to run queries that identify all patients with a specified diagnosis, or receiv-ing a specified therapy, and generate customized electronic reports with de- mographic, laboratory, treatment and observed outcomes data of interest for each patient. n Thomas Stoeber, of Palo Alto, Calif., submitted implementing a dy- namic search tool for all Intranet sites accessible to all clinical and VA staff to quickly access forms and informa- tion they need to complete tasks ef- ficiently.n Dr. Clayton Curtis, of Jamaica Plain, Mass., submitted linking a standards-based decision support framework to CPRS. This would en-able VA's clinical applications to be \"smarter,\" and help patients receive safer care as a result of a more so-phisticated safety net based on their electronic record. It would enhance the existing capability for reminding Dick WallaceDr. Jacob HathawayDr. John Byrne8 VAnguard July/August 2010provider would be able to write the medication order and then choose whether the medication should be sent immediately (current functional-ity) or to wait for the patient to re-quest the medication (parking). n Patricia Landon, of Cincinnati, submitted increasing the visibility of the suicide hotline and improving ac- cessibility for all patients. Providers at patient intake would ask the patient to enter the suicide hotline number in their cell phone. n Dr. Soleyman Rokh- sar, of Los Angeles, submitted developing an application for a touch screen device that in-terfaces with CPRS and allows nurses to triage patients more efficiently in the emergency depart- ment and urgent care. n Terri Ruggerie, of Cincinnati, submitted developing an efficient and user-friendly pro- gram using decision tree-type software to encompass 12 separate statement windows that specify eligibility criteria and \"as needed\" explan- atory information links for front line veteran eligibility staffing. n Nancy Clark, of Cin- cinnati, submitted the creation of a national core collection of online resources available to all clinical and administra-tive staff. n Robert Ellington, of San Antonio, submitted integrating the VistA sur-gery package with CPRS. Nursing personnel would log into one program for all their documentation. n Dr. Jacob Hathaway, of Nashville, submitted developing a prototype of a patient-centered medication list for veterans that more clearly details instructions for daily medication use while automatically generating the clinicians when preventive measures or tasks specific to a disease are due. A patient scorecard application would provide patients an opportunity to become more active in their own care and more aware of the recommenda- tions for appropriate care specific to their individual clinical situation. n Dr. Bryan Volpp, of Martinez, Ca- lif., submitted enhanced care manage-ment software to facilitate case man-agement and chronic disease care by sharing of tasks related to patients; creation and sharing of treatment and care plans; creation and management of and reporting on patient lists for team use, such as all diabetes or heart failure patients in a provider's panel; and communica- tion with patients via letters and secure mes-saging.n Dr. Dave Oslin, of Philadelphia, submitted creating an interface between the Behavioral Health Lab software and CPRS to ensure that mental health assess-ment data would be in- stantly available within the medical record and veterans would not need to be registered separate- ly in the software. This would allow for mental health outcome data across time to be more easily accessible by all treating providers, allow-ing for better collaboration between providers and well-informed treatment planning. n Dan Moriarty, of White River Junc- tion, Vt., submitted the eDischarge pilot program\u2014implementing a pilot program at select VA facilities as modeled successfully from many non- VA acute care facilities. n Dr. Mark Graber, of Northport, N.Y., submitted the idea of showing the patient's picture in CPRS when-ever a new patient is selected. n Gail Wright, of Augusta, Maine, submitted developing a Care Plan tab in CPRS to function as a shortcut to the most current information that relates to the veteran's needs. Provid- ers would place orders and any change would generate a new progress note. The idea is to have quick access to the recommendations for interventions re-lated to the veteran's goals, objectives and evidence-based interventions for all users. The Care Plan tab would also function as a shortcut to the most current information on the veteran's needs and ongoing evidence-based interventions. n Bernadette Dugoni, of Martinez, Calif., submitted developing a method for providers to be able to \"park\" a prescription\u2014placing it in a \"hold until requested by patient\" status. The Jason Barnard's idea involves wireless voice communications with hands free options.alexis DeffNer VAnguard July/August 2010 9Brief RSI is designed to capture in- depth information about resident supervision from resident physicians in training and their clinical supervi-sors as they care for patients. Resident physician supervision is critical for both patient care and education by assuring safe, quality patient care as well as adequate training of future health professionals in preparation for independent practice. This innova-tion provides means to collect data from patient care encounters directly through CPRS using the Brief RSI, a tool that has been studied and found to be a reliable measure of supervision. Data from the Brief RSI will be used to assess the amount of attending phy-sician supervision and resident physi- cians' progress toward independent practice.n Dick Wallace, of Little Rock, Ark., submitted deploying Emergency Medi- cal Response Teams with cell phones, hand held and mobile radios, text pagers and ham radios to en-hance and strengthen the communications signals during times of crisis or disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina, when long-range com- munications devices are disrupted and unreliable. Sophis- ticated communica-tion support units are equipped with video conferencing, laptops, fax machines, printers and telephones, such as satellite phones, but in limited quantities. n Dr. Ronald Schifman, of Tucson, Ariz., submitted reducing unnecessary/duplicate lab tests by rules-based algo- rithms through designing a prototype system to automatically identify and take action on inappropriate labora- tory orders before testing is done. By Gary Hicksillustrated medication schedules from pharmacy data and other databases. The list would use large print, plain language, illustrations and a simple grid to indicate how each medication should be taken, as well as its purpose. n John Derderian, of Albany, N.Y., submitted using the functionality of the Master Patient Index/ Patient Demographics (MPI/PD) VistA soft-ware application to share verified health insurance information between all sites that care for a particular veteran.n Kenneth Siehr, of Leavenworth, Kan., submitted display-ing a link within My HealtheVet for vet- erans to use to access mail package tracking information that is al- ready available from the VA consoli- dated mail outpatient pharmacies.n Rachel Cornett, of Kansas City, Mo., submitted developing a search function in CPRS by identifying ad-ditional components of CPRS that would benefit from a keyword or key term search option. n Laurence Olpin, of Dallas, submit- ted renaming the current Primary Care tab/drop-down list in CPRS to Assigned Providers and expand it to include up-to-date contact informa-tion for all providers assigned to that patient, the assigned clinic number and the case manager. If the patient were an active inpatient, it would also display their assigned intern and resi- dent, if applicable. A new, second tab in CPRS would display a drop-down contact list with up-to-date contact information for all of the On-Call Providers (doctors and services) for the ward the patient was assigned to. These phone numbers would be blank unless the patient were an ac- tive inpatient. A new, third tab in CPRS would display a drop-down list of frequently-needed Other Phone Numbers at the VA facility where the patient is assigned, or where they are admitted.n Dr. Jonathan Medverd, of Seattle, submitted an online radiology pro- tocol tool integrated within CPRS/ VistA to stream- line information for radiologists on one screen, including: exam order; access to all pertinent tex- tual data (aller-gies, medications, provider notes, imaging reports, ionizing radiation exposure history, etc.); access to previous imaging exams (the ac- tual image data); Protocol action command space (to enter pro- tocol decision); and messaging portal to CPRS View Alert or Outlook.n Jason Barnard, of Martinsburg, W.Va., submitted implementing a wireless personal communication system for instant communications to individuals or action teams. n Louis N. Smith, of Orlando, sub- mitted allowing VA eligibility offices and Health Care for Homeless Veter- ans (HCHV) social workers to elec- tronically access data from military records centers to obtain DD-214s. n Dr. John Byrne, of Loma Linda, Calif., submitted implementing the Brief Resident Supervision Index.

They're just a small sample of the myriad VA research conducted around the country by some of the world's best scientists. \"Almost daily, VA research is making news,\" said VA Deputy Sec-retary W. Scott Gould, kicking off National VA Research Week at VA Central Office. \"VA brings scientific discovery from bedside to laboratory and back again to continue to im- prove veterans' health care and their quality of life.\" National VA Research Week, April 26-29, celebrated 85 years of excellence this year, not only tout- ing current progress, but also marking medical breakthroughs made over the years, such as Dr. Andrew Schally's and Dr. Rosalyn Yalow's Nobel Prize in physiology in 1977 for research on hormone production in the brain, the first successful liver transplant, and tuberculosis treatments. VA's researchers have done more than just develop new medical treat-ments; they have developed technolo- gies that are now commonplace in modern medicine, such as the CT scan and the pacemaker. Gould backed up his statement about VA research in the news by discussing a recent project that made headlines when it blasted off to the International Space Station. Scientist-astronaut Dr. Millie Hughes-Fulford, director of the San Francisco VA Medical Center's Laboratory for Cell Growth, is studying bone loss in astro-nauts who spend long periods of time in space. The research could lead to breakthroughs in fighting osteoporosis and other health issues experienced by aging veterans. \"From the development of ef- fective therapies for tuberculosis and implantable cardiac pacemakers, to the first successful liver transplant and the nicotine patch, VA's trailblazing research accomplishments are a source of great pride to our department and the nation,\" said Gould. \"Examples of this dedication and advancement are not limited to history. Today's com-mitted VA researchers are focusing on traumatic brain injury, post-trau- matic stress disorder, post-deployment health, women's health and a host of other issues key to the well-being of our veterans.\" \"As one of the world's largest integrated health care systems, VA is uniquely positioned to not only con- duct and fund research, but to develop solutions and implement them quicker when compared to other health care systems\u2014turning hope into reality for veterans and all Americans,\" said Joel Kupersmith, M.D., VA chief research and development officer. VA's vast network includes medical center staff, their patients, researchers, and partnerships with the country's most prestigious medi-cal colleges and universities. This large and diverse group of experts and VA's ability to track data of millions of medical visits with the electronic medical record gives it an advantage over the others and provides veterans with better and more advanced treat-ment sooner. This year, nearly 3,400 research- ers will work on more than 2,300 projects, funded by nearly $1.9 billion under VA's umbrella. Some of the ar-eas being studied include: n VA's cooperative studies program, which is clinical research infrastruc- ture that coordinates and enables collaboration on multi-center clini- cal trials and epidemiological studies across VA. The cooperative studies program also maintains a DNA Bank and biorepository to conduct genomic medicine research and supports health economic analyses for its studies. Three of the more noteworthy stud-ies include: the approval of a shingles vaccine; a study examining an effec- tive treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder among women veterans; and the largest registry of veterans with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease).n Genetics medicine, which is cus- tomized health care based on a per-son's genetic makeup that could result in early intervention or even preven-tion of genetic diseases. A particular area of the research, pharmacogenom- ics, can identify patients who respond differently to current medicines because of differences in their genes. This research may result both in new treatments and significant cost savings by eliminating treatment with drugs that do not work on the patient. n Traumatic brain injury is estimated to affect some 20 percent of troops injured in Afghanistan or Iraq. Cur-rent studies are evaluating the TBI screen implemented by VA's universal Patient Care Services and the clinical processes of diagnosing TBI. The stud-ies also focus on differentiating TBI from PTSD. n VA researchers are actively par- ticipating in the VHA National De-mentia Steering Committee and have established a relationship with the National Institute on Aging to collab-oratively answer important questions related to the aging research portfolio and priorities. n Spinal cord injury studies focusing on the pathological processes include microglial activation, edema and neuronal death. Research is also sup-ported to focus on novel treatment strategies such as the use of adult stem cells for transplantation in spinal cord lesions, the use of synthetic matrix to promote tissue repairs, and finding ways to strengthen connections in the damaged spinal cord to improve func- tion. n VA supports a broad portfolio of vision-related (sensory loss) research seeking to improve everyday function and quality of life among veterans suf- Opposite top: Veteran Charles Eggleston (holding microphone) tells his story as a VA research participant while fellow veterans (left to right) Stephen Cochran, Daniel Stebbins, Joan Furey and Lilliana Ariza listen; bottom: VA Under Secretary for Health Dr. Robert Petzel speaks to the crowd at VA Central Office as part of Re-search Week kickoff activities April 22.12 VAnguard July/August 2010If great country music is still built on a foundation of real-life stories and soul-deep family tradition, stephen Cochran was born into the breed. Born in rural pikeville, ky., and raised in the creative heart of Nashville's \"Music row\" songwriting and recording community, Cochran watched his dad, steve, work and often struggle as a songwriter and artist back in the '70s. Country greats Bobby Bare and the late Del reeves are just a couple of the characters that drifted in and out of the Cochran home. influenced by his family and environment, Cochran fol- lowed in his father's footsteps and started his own country music career. But 9/11 signaled a call to follow a different path and serve his country in a time of need. He joined the Marines' special operations Capable light armored reconnaissance division as a recon scout, and headed straight to iraq. \"i love the Marine Corps,\" Cochran said. \" everything they did for me structured my life and gave me the drive to accom-plish the things i want to do.\" During his second tour, this time to afghanistan, Cochran was thrown from a tank on security patrol just outside of kan- dahar. He awoke a month later to find himself at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., with his back broken in six places. Cochran was facing living the rest of his life in a wheel- chair as doctors at walter reed and Bethesda made plans to fuse his fragmented spine back together. a nurse had sug- gested using an experimental procedure called kyphoplasty\u2014typically used to treat other, less severe types of spinal injury, but the military doctors would not attempt the procedure. pursuing the suggested option, Cochran's mother con- tacted the Nashville V a Medical Center for a second opinion. Given his low chance of ever walking with traditional care, doctors at the Nashville V aMC, in partnership with Vanderbilt university Medical Center, performed the experimental proce-dure. The procedure was a success and Cochran began walk- ing the road to recovery and rehabilitation at the Nashville VaMC. He also received, and continues to receive, treatment for severe post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain in-jury, chronic pain, and numbness in his lower right extremity. as best as he can surmise, his treatments have been a combi-nation of V a research and clinical care. \"i can say that i am walking Va research and develop- ment,\" said Cochran during a ceremony kicking off National Va research week at V a Central office in april. \" what V a had to do was put together a team, just for me. They realize that every veteran is different. They looked at my situation and made an attack plan for it. and we are still fighting together today. My development and progress has been amazing and i owe it to the great team i have in Nashville.\" Back on his feet, and armed with his Music row pedigree, ans, but Cochran takes it several steps further\u2014seeing himself both as an ordinary V a patient and a veterans advocate willing to fight for his fellow veterans. \"we have to keep the family involved,\" Cochran said di- rectly to V a researchers declaring the importance of family in the recovery process as well as dealing with a loved one suf-fering from pTsD or TB i. \"we need to figure out how to train spouses to deal with pTsD before the member comes home from combat.\" in an industry where an artist's \"story\" is routinely embel- lished by teams of publicists, Cochran's story is real, as is his determination to help his fellow veterans with pTsD. He wants them to know that pTsD is a health issue for which there is treatment and hope for a better life. a Marine's sense of purpose, and a lifetime's worth of stories, Cochran exploded onto the country music scene in 2007 with a critically acclaimed, self-titled debut album that captured the hearts of fans, critics, and a lot of everyday heroes. in october 2009, Va's office of research and Develop- ment contacted Cochran to see if he would be interested in recording a song to help Va in its outreach efforts to veterans of recent conflicts. Cochran accepted, and in february 2010, he and his band, the New Country outlaws, recorded the song \"Hope.\" shortly thereafter, they recorded a video featuring a choir of veterans performing the song at the Nashville V aMC and other locations in and around Nashville. The music video, as a feature on a DVD package con- taining the V a research 85-year anniversary video and V a research advances highlight video, has been distributed to medical centers and veterans service organizations across the country. The music video can also be found on the V a home page, research and Development page, and V a youTube channel.

The QUERI program has provided critical information on what it takes to actually translate the findings of comparative effectiveness research into more effective and more cost-effective care. n VA recognized soon after veterans began returning from the 1991 Gulf War that while there were few visible casualties, many individuals returned from this conflict with unexplained medical symptoms and illnesses. VA supports a research portfo- lio consisting of studies dedicated to understanding chronic multi-symptom illnesses, genetic biomarkers among Gulf War veterans, long-term health effects of potentially hazard-ous substances to which Gulf War veterans may have been exposed dur- ing deployment, and conditions or symptoms that may be occurring with higher prevalence in Gulf War veter- ans. VA provides funding to the Uni- versity of Texas Southwestern in addi-tion to funding its own clinical trials to identify new therapies for ill Gulf War veterans. Finally, a new Request for Applications was issued in June 2009 to provide funding to researchers for even more new clinical trials. n VA is also studying ways to im- prove rural health, assist caregivers, and address various mental illness and substance abuse issues veterans face.

Research extends from practical aspects of wayfinding to the develop-ment of advanced intraocular trans-plants. Several individual research projects and two Centers of Excel- lence focus on the rehabilitation of low-vision and blind veterans. Work is also underway to develop a retinal implant (type of neuroprosthesis) to restore vision to the blind. The retinal implant is currently in the animal testing phase. n Research on improving the man- agement of pain associated with various health conditions including depression, cancer, dementia, post-operative, arthritis, co-occurring psy- chiatric disorders, and burn injuries. Many veterans suffer from various types of pain and chronic pain, so VA research is focused on finding ways to improve their usage. For example, a cooperative studies program study is just beginning the planning of a large multisite trial on low back pain. n Since 2004, VA has significantly expanded its women's health research to better understand the health and care of women veterans. Current research is examining the complex interaction of physical and mental health; unique risks and outcomes of military service, particularly related to sexual and combat trauma and PTSD; barriers to care; and the impact of VA's organization and structures of health care delivery to women vet-erans on access, service availability, utilization, satisfaction and quality of care.n Chronic illness research projects span the gamut of obesity, diabetes and its associated cardiovascular con- ditions. Almost 25 percent of veterans have diabetes and a larger proportion than the general population is obese or overweight. VA researchers study the effects of traditional treatments on patients with these chronic conditions and have incorporated innovative treat-ments and Internet-based interven-tions and delivery systems to improve adherence and outreach. Researchers have also studied the disparities in treatment that result from excess body weight and have looked into preven-tive services for those morbidly obese through bariatric surgery and studied its long-term effects. The focus has been on designing higher quality of care for those unable to access such care through the traditional methods of outpatient visits.n VA has dedicated resources to re- search on disparities for over a decade, with an extensive portfolio of research on disparities, including the Center of Excellence for Health Equity Re- search and Promotion, and a Targeted Research Enhancement Program to understand racial and ethnic varia- tions in health outcomes for chronic diseases. VA's current equity research portfolio focuses on identifying dis- parities in care related to a number of health conditions, understanding possible reasons for disparities in care and, most recently, developing inter- ventions to reduce disparities. n VA continues to be committed to advancing improvements and cost effectiveness in health care by encour-aging the implementation of research findings into clinical practice. Com- parative effectiveness research has an anticipated role in advancing na-tional health care reform efforts. VA is uniquely positioned to lead efforts in comparative effectiveness research given its large, integrated health care system, established research infrastruc- ture, and a demonstrated ability to conduct high-impact comparative ef-fectiveness research that can be trans-lated and implemented into clinical practice. Comparative effectiveness research within the VA research program is driven by three major ele- ments. One is the cooperative studies program, which conducts national, multi-site clinical trials and epide- miological studies comparing different treatments on health outcomes and costs. The Health Services Research 14 VAnguard July/August 2010VA has obligated 88 percent of its stimulus funds.Putting America Back to Work for Veterans \"We had about a month to iden- tify projects and develop a plan,\" said VA's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Finance Ed Murray. \"We were looking for projects that fell into one of three categories: patient safety, patient secu- rity and energy.\" Initially, VA identified 1,337 viable non-recurring maintenance, energy, and monument and memo- rial repair projects. As a result of the department's competitive process for awarding contracts\u2014where more than 98 percent of awards are competitively bid and are often awarded for amounts less than original estimates\u2014and due to other efficiencies, VA has been able to increase its buying power and the number of projects by an addi-tional 10 to 20 percent. Now, 15 months later, VA has obligated a total of $1.6 billion (88 percent) of its ARRA funds and has made outlays totaling $723 million (40 percent) to improve services and benefits to veterans. \"In putting America back to work, we are targeting the programs of greatest interest to veterans, includ-ing the improvement of our health care facilities like those here in Cleveland,\" said VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki while touring the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center recently for a first-hand update on Re-covery Act-funded projects there. ARRA funding provided $15.2 million to design, construct, upgrade and renovate health care services at the VAMC. These projects include: $8.3 million to renovate surgical areas; $2 million to the elevator lobby; $2.1 million for ad- ditional patient care improvements; and more than $500,000 for energy conservation measures. In addition to affording veterans better service and access to health care, it is estimated that ARRA fund-ing has created more than 500 jobs at the medical center\u2014putting Ohioans to work in their community. The It seems like only yesterday that President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 into law. Every media outlet in the country was abuzz with the news and political pundits were taking sides and making predictions, all while senior VA leaders were scrambling to develop a plan to spend, within the next two years, more than $1.8 billion that had been provided to VA under ARRA.

Fuehrer.BarBara BreeN VAnguard July/August 2010 15projects underway in Ohio are just a few of the many taking place at VA facilities across the country. Three significant projects are cur- rently underway at the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System. These projects include a $2.4 million investment in Pittsburgh's intensive care unit that will provide 14 beds, two negative- pressure isolation rooms, a centralized nurse station and an expanded family waiting area. In addition, $7.2 mil-lion is paying for improvements to the facility's emergency power system that will increase capacity and prevent failures. Another $1.5 million will provide a new main plumbing system at the University Drive division. One of the most recent ARRA- funded projects will maximize energy use as a result of the award of eight contracts for VA-wide thermal and flow metering systems. These awards were made by VA's National Energy Business Center to the Veterans In-tegrated Service Networks across the country. The T&F metering system will monitor the usage of building- and campus-level water, steam, chilled water and natural gas. Each meter will send real-time data to a secure Web site monitored by VA personnel. The metered data will be analyzed and used for energy demand-side management purposes and help with reporting on VA's suc-cess in reducing its carbon footprint. VA anticipates all T&F metering system installations will be completed before the end of 2011\u2014four years ahead of a federally mandated require- ment. The National Cemetery Ad- ministration is rapidly closing in on obligating all of its ARRA funding. Currently, NCA has obligated a total of $42.3 million of its $50 million allotted under the Recovery Act to maintain its cemeteries as national shrines in honor of the final resting place of American veterans. NCA maintains more than 2.9 million gravesites at 131 cemeteries in 39 states and Puerto Rico, as well as 33 soldiers' lots and monument sites. NCA has used ARRA funds to: raise, realign and clean headstones and markers; repair sunken graves, roads and buildings; purchase equipment; conserve energy and water through the use of wind, solar and other natu-ral renewable resources; and repair historic monuments and memorials at national cemeteries. Fort McPherson, Nebraska's only national cemetery, has received more than $777,000 in funding to date. Headstones will be re-surveyed and realigned in about half of the cemetery; the other half will undergo both headstone realignment and turf renovations. \"Over the years, gravesites will settle,\" said Cemetery Director Doug Ledbetter. \"Headstones also suffer from years of winter weather by either getting dirty or they start to tilt in one direction.\" In addition to the renovations and improvements, VA leadership found a way to support veterans by becoming a client itself.

None of these proj- ects would have been possible without ARRA.n The Office of Information & Tech- nology has obligated more than $43 million of its $50 million to provide software development, staff and asso-ciated supplies and equipment to sup- port implementation of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Remaining funds will support upgrades to other VBA systems. n VA also received an estimated $700 million for Veteran Economic Recovery Payments\u2014one-time pay- ments of $250 to eligible veterans and survivors to help mitigate the effects of the current economy. VBA made approximately 1.9 million payments, representing more than $465 million, to eligible veterans or their beneficia- ries in June 2009.n The Office of Inspector General is also using its $1 million to audit and investigate applicable VA programs, grants and projects receiving ARRA funds and to perform necessary over- sight. By Gary Hicks been awarded to veteran-owned and other small businesses. In other words, veteran-owned businesses are doing most of the work, resulting in better access and delivery of services to fel-low veterans. \"The majority of the veteran busi- ness owners are craftsmen,\" said the Veterans Health Administration's chief procurement and logistics of- ficer Fred Downs. \"They do quality work and receive good feedback. The ARRA funding is affording them work they might not otherwise have in the current economy. Plus it's an opportunity to build a reputation and earn more work in the future.\" All of the VA Recovery Act dollars will in some way benefit vet- erans\u2014improving patient care areas, access and facilities, providing direct veteran payments, improving infra-structure and systems, and enhancing national cemeteries. VA estimates that ARRA upgrades and improve- ments have impacted more than 8 million veterans and their families. Additionally, recipients of ARRA funding have reported that this fund-ing has resulted in the creation of 2,100 jobs. ARRA is also supporting the following VA activities: n The Veterans Benefits Administra- tion has obligated more than $99.8 million of its $150 million to hire 2,293 temporary claims processors; of those, about 230 are devoted to help- ing with claims submitted for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.n VHA has obligated more than $122 million of its $150 million to provide financial assistance to the states to construct or acquire nursing home, domiciliary or adult day health care facilities. This funding has been obligated for 27 projects in 18 states for the construction and renovation of state homes. The projects include six new nursing homes totaling 660 beds and 21 general renovation and construction projects. North Carolina is building two homes, one in Bun- combe County and one near the city of Kinston; together these projects total more than $24 million. Texas is building a new 100-bed home in the city of Tyler with federal funding totaling more than $17 mil- lion. The design of the Texas home is unique because Texas consulted closely with VA leadership to create a home-like facility for veterans in that state. Some states have multiple proj- ects, like Ohio, where the homes in both Sandusky and Georgetown are receiving four grants, together totaling more than $1 million, to make secu-Field staff at Black Hills National Cem-etery in Sturgis, S.D., with some of the equip-ment they purchased with ARRA funds. sara j. elToN VAnguard July/August 2010 17Veterans in East Central Florida have been fighting for an inpatient VA hospital they can call their own for more than 30 years. Now that dream is well on its way to becoming reality. Work on the 1.2 million square-foot Orlando VA Medical Center has begun. The facility will have 134 inpatient beds, a 120-bed community living center and a 60-bed residential rehabilitation center. The $665 million facility is being built on 65 acres and will be part of the new \"Medical City\" emerging in East Orlando, which will also include the University of Central Florida Medical School, the Sanford-Burnham Institute for Medical Research, the Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Florida Academic and Research Center. The new facility, scheduled to open in late 2012, will increase accessibility to the highest quality health care for ap-proximately 400,000 Central Florida veterans. \"A little over a year ago, we had the groundbreaking for our new medical center, and it has been a great year,\" said Timothy W. Liezert, director of the Orlando VAMC. \"Today, I can see work being done and I am able to visualize this as the dawn of a new era for Central Florida veterans.\" \"During the design phase, several goals guided our team,\" said Laura Fin- frock, construction coordinator. In the forefront of everyone's minds, she said, was honoring veterans, ensuring patient and staff safety, providing maximum flexibility, addressing staffing efficiency, building with \"green\" in mind, having 100 percent single patient rooms, maximizing clinical adjacencies and separat-ing patient and staff flow. Once the designs were complete, progress shifted to advertising bid pack- ages, awarding these packages and starting the work. Five packages have already been awarded. Phase 1a is a $9.2 million contract awarded to RBVetCo to begin the site work, utilities and the main loop road. Phase 1b is a $38.4 mil- lion contract awarded to James A. Cumming Inc. for the central energy plant. Phase 1c is a $29.6 million contract awarded to Brasfield & Gorrie for the foundations and superstructure. Phase 2 is a $39.4 million contract awarded to VA Keeps Health Care Projects Humming with Vietnam-era veterans getting older and thousands of disabled and traumatized veterans from iraq and afghanistan needing care, construc-tion of health facilities for veterans is booming. Two new V a medical centers are under construction in las Vegas and orlando, fla. Moreover, four new replacement hospitals have been approved\u2014in New orleans; the Den- ver area; louisville, ky.; and omaha, Neb.\u2014according to robert Neary, acting director of Va's office of Con- struction and facilities Management. project costs range from $560 million in omaha to $995 million in New or- leans. The new hospitals are being designed with extensive input from veterans. They feature a variety of energy conservation and renewable energy elements. They'll also include improved privacy\u2014such as separate dressing areas in exam rooms\u2014for the growing number of women veter-ans, who now comprise 12 percent of the V a patient population. in addition, Va has a new poly- trauma center under construction in san antonio, and two replacement level 1 trauma centers in design stage for Tampa, fla., and palo alto, Calif. and the agency has just completed or is currently building spinal cord injury centers in New york; Milwaukee; syracuse, N. y.; Dallas; Minneapolis; Chicago; and Brockton, Mass.

Doug parris, an NBBj partner, says limited mobility, vision problems and col-orblindness are major challenges for veterans. Thus, at each entrance there will be an orientation person, wheelchairs and mobility assistance and restrooms. The veterans also wanted to feel honored. so NBB j is planning a detailed art program that pays tribute to the veterans of different service branches, as well as to the culture of New orleans. The New orleans center is the first major project for Turner Construction Company to build the community living center, residential rehab center and chapel. Phase 3 is a $30 million contract awarded to Brasfield & Gorrie to build the parking garages and warehouse. The facility will be the first VA medical center built on a completely new \"greenfield\" site since the West Palm Beach VAMC opened in 1995. The Orlando VAMC will meet the criteria for LEED Certification-silver level. In preparation for the new medical center, the need arose to develop an electronic medical record that would serve the new primary service area for Orlando. For nearly a year, teams worked tirelessly to create an Orlando clini- cal VistA system, separate from the former satellite rela- tionship with the VA medical centers in Tampa, Gaines-ville and Lake City. Phases of the project included building a data center, which Va is using the construction manager at-risk contract- ing model. The Denver-area hospital project also will use that model, Neary says. The construction manager selected for the New orleans center is a partnership between Bethesda-based Clark Con-struction Group and st. louis-based McCarthy Building Com- panies.

VA Medical Center, a rich resource for neurology researchers, and has conducted edu-cational outreach for more than 15 years. ToMMy leoNarDi Neuroscientist Russell J. Buono, Ph.D., grew up in a blue-collar family and worked his way through college and graduate school as a meat cutter. Today, working from his lab at the Coatesville (Pa.) VA Medical Center, he is a top figure in research on the genet-ics of epilepsy. Among local students, though, he is better known for the hands-on brain exhibits he brings to schools and colleges throughout the area. \"It happens all the time,\" says Buono. \"I'll walk into the ice cream parlor with my family and some kid will rec- ognize me. Last time, a girl looked at me and said, 'I know you; you brought a brain to my class when I was in the 7th grade. I never forgot that. I've been so interested in science ever since.'\" Buono also used to do educational outreach in Ohio, where he worked before arriving in Coatesville in 2006. It was there that a 6th-grader dubbed him \"Dr. Brain Dude\"\u2014the title he's most proud of, he says. In 2000, Buono co-founded Brain Awareness Week at the Franklin Institute. Hosted each spring by the Phila- delphia Society for Neuroscience, the event features a \"human brain bar\" where kids touch and hold preserved brains. To learn about protecting their skulls, they get to put a raw egg in a plastic bag and crash it on the floor. \"They like that, as you might imagine,\" says Buono. Volunteers then fit the eggs with miniature bicycle helmets. \"We let them throw it on the floor, smash it against the wall, kick it, and they can't break the egg.\" To complement the activity, the Brain Injury Associa- tion of Pennsylvania gives away hundreds of free bicycle helmets. As a more serious follow-up, Buono shows a video of a boy who sustained a traumatic brain injury after a bicycle accident. \"We illustrate the point with kids that they really should be protecting their heads,\" says the re- searcher. VA Research Currents spoke with Buono to learn more about his educational outreach and the brain collection at the Coatesville VA. 20 VAnguard July/August 2010 Dr. Heather Basehore, a brain researcher at the Coatesville VA Medical Center and colleague of Dr. Buono, shows a preserved human brain to student Maliya Majors. The exhibit was part of a recent \"Take Your Child to Work Day\" at the center.ToMMy leoNarDiQ Today there's so much science-education material on TV and the Web. Are in- person, hands-on science exhibits as valuable as they once were?It's the same argument you'd make concerning medical education for doctors. Do you want people to learn about anatomy virtually\u2014totally through a computer\u2014or is it benefi- cial to have your future physicians actually touch the real material? See-ing images is great. It can teach you a lot. But it's very different to hold the actual material and to have someone right there to answer your questions. Q How do kids react to seeing and touching a real human brain? When we're in an environment where it's school kids and their chaperones, the kids are much more willing to look at the photo [of a fresh, raw brain] for what it is and then put on some gloves and hold the preserved material. The older we get, the more we face our own mortality. When you're a kid, you don't think in those terms. Q What types of questions do you get from kids? A lot of them ask whether it's real, because our preservation tech- nique makes the brain look a bit clay-like and stiff. Sometimes they'll ask where we get the brains. The real an- swer is, from folks who have donated their body for medical science. But when the kids are kind of unruly, I tell them we get the brains from really bad 14-year-olds. Q What are some basic facts people learn from the exhib- its? The first thing that strikes most people is the scale. They think their brain and spinal cord are a lot bigger than they really are. When they see actual specimens, they can't believe it. They also come away knowing what their spinal cord looks like. Every-body thinks that row of bones going down their back helps them stand up straight. They walk away understand- ing that those bones are really there to protect that cable, the spinal cord. They see the cable itself, how small it is, and that impresses them. Q Do you talk about diseases of the brain? Part of our brain collection deals with pathology. We have brains that were affected by Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, Hun-tington's, brain tumor or stroke. Most people who walk by the table know someone who suffered one of these things. We also have the brain of someone who died from a subdural he-matoma after a fall. I have the blood clot in a jar, which is quite graphic. You can see how the blood clot de- formed the brain to the point where it caused death. Q Tell us about the brain collec-tion at the Coatesville VA. Dr. Greg Golden [of the Coatesville VA] was a good friend and collaborator. He initially started do-ing autopsy work in the 1980s and did about 350 brain autopsies. We have almost all those brains represented here in material that is fixed in form- aldehyde and stored in a detergent so-lution to keep it from getting moldy or infected. From about half the brains, we have material that was never fixed, stored in minus-80 degrees Celsius freezers. That tissue is very valuable. Greg passed away in 2005, and I was recruited to oversee the brain bank in his place. We named it the Golden Brain Bank in honor of my old friend. Q What makes the brain tissue in the bank so valuable for research? VA has always been ahead of the curve in terms of electronic medical records. So we've got brain tissue from folks 15 years ago and we have their complete medical histories\u2014whether they smoked, what diseases they had, what medications they took. That in- formation is very useful to researchers. In addition to VA groups, we have investigators at several universities who withdraw the tissues for their studies on schizophrenia, substance abuse, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and other conditions. And so from a central location, from the donations our veterans made years ago, many scientific publications on different as-pects of brain disease will start to flow. I know my old friend Greg would be proud for sure. VAnguard July/August 2010 21As an intelligence officer in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, Alice Hol- stein broke barriers. Stationed at various military posts, including Guam and Okinawa, she was the first woman to be sent overseas with B-52s. She was also the first woman to brief satellite photography and the first woman to be sent to a bomb wing level, where she managed a combat wing intelligence shop. She quickly realized that being the first woman wasn't always a good thing. She was living in a fishbowl and she didn't like it. \"It wasn't my goal to be the first,\" said Hol-stein. \"It was really happenstance. To be a woman and be watched all the time\u2014they expected you to fail. There was a lot of pressure. But the military taught me how to dig down in the face of challenges and find out who you really are.

With her as liaison, the nine veterans on the council help improve the services of the River Val-ley center and brainstorm possible projects to make the clinic a more welcoming place. Holstein, who holds bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees, also co-facilitates a weekly discussion group called Journey of Recovery. During the hour-long meeting, she, co-facilitator Bob Olson, R.N., and veterans talk about their recovery from mental illness. Focusing on being a \"whole\" person, physically, mentally and spiritually, the participants dis-cuss meditation techniques and other methods that have helped them enjoy life again. Looking back on her life, Hol- stein wouldn't change much. \"Now I have an expanded sense of purpose,\" she said. \"I've taken a profound spiritual path, filled with humility, compassion, empathy and meaning. I've exposed myself to the world. My strengths have helped me overcome the stigma and be more open. I have a message that can help shift viewpoints for people with a mental illness. I feel it hasn't all been in vain.\" On May 12, Holstein received the 2010 Shooting Star award from the Mental Health Coalition of the Greater La Crosse area. Getting the award, which is given to those with a mental illness who have made contri-butions to the mental health field, was a proud but humbling experience for Holstein. \"I want people to know we are not 'damaged goods,'\" she said. \"Ev- eryone has hardships, but ultimately, you have to reframe those experienc-es. Spiritual paths come from hardship and suffering. I see things in a new light now. It took courage for me to speak about my illness. But if it brings hope and inspiration to others, it was worth it.\" By Amanda Hester\"I realized that getting well was more than just a medication approach. It involves all levels: physical, men- tal, emotional, social and spiritual. You also have to exercise, get enough sleep, eat healthy and stress less\u2014 things everyone should do.\" Today, Holstein works at the VA River Valley Integrated Health Center, part of the community-based outpatient clinic associated with the Tomah (Wis.) VA Medical Center. As a peer support specialist, Holstein works as the link between the com- munity and the veterans being served at the clinic. Part of her job is to identify community resources, such as a local food bank or family and children's services, and help veterans get to those resources. She also works one-on-one with veterans on recovery and other issues. Serving veterans has made all the difference in her life. \"I've had a sec-ond chance,\" Holstein said. \"I've had to rebuild my life, one step at a time, over the last four years. Now I have meaning in my life and I'm living a life of service again.\" Holstein not only represents the clinic, she also speaks out on various veterans' issues. She has served on several steering committees, including the Veterans Treatment Court initia-tive and the newly established Mental Health Crisis and Detox Center. The center is a 24/7 facility, offering short-term treatment for those suffer-ing from alcoholism or drug abuse, or those recently released from a mental hospital psychology ward. Last year, Holstein facilitated the Holstein knows all about over- coming challenges. Suffering from manic depression, she saw her life turn upside down from the effects of mental illness. \"I was diagnosed at age 51 or 52, relatively late in life com- pared to other people,\" she said. \"For 12 years, I suffered with mental ill-ness. But I can look back now and see symptoms 10 years before I was actu- ally diagnosed. I suffered 15 different manic episodes. I had 13 or 14 hospi-talizations. I went on costly spending sprees. I was argumentative, paranoid and disruptive\u2014all were symptoms of manic depression. \"For a total of six to eight months, intermittently, I lived on the streets,\" Holstein recounted. \"Not be- cause I didn't have assets, but because of other issues related to my mental illness. Sometimes it was because I was separated from my assets; other times, fear would drive me out of my home. I traveled to eight different states. I slept in homeless shelters, battered women's shelters, open fields, cardboard boxes, even the floor of a soup kitchen. I traveled on foot or sometimes in my car. Most of the time, I didn't realize these things were going on because I was delusional. \"During my manic episodes, which varied but usually lasted six weeks minimum, my friends would try to help me,\" she continued. \"They were very concerned. They tried to get me committed, but there were limitations on what they could do. I lost many of my friends and colleagues because of my illness.\" Four years ago, Holstein, under the care of doctors and using alter- native therapy approaches, finally reached a stabilization point. \"Some years earlier, I got mad at my doctors, who were giving me a bleak progno-sis,\" said Holstein. \"I was determined I was going to be well. So I turned over every rock and explored treatment options. I looked into self-help, alter- native therapies. I had no real design for it; I just pursued everything to get well. \"I have a message that can help shift viewpoints for people with a mental illness. I want people to know we are not 'damaged goods.'\" VAnguard July/August 2010 23Editor's note: Mackenzie Schroeder is a registered nurse at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center who was twice deployed to Iraq. This is her story. What's it like over there? Is it bad? Why do you do it? Is it hard to be gone for so long? What happens to your job? These are all questions that I\u2014and others who have been deployed\u2014have been asked. I can only give you the story of my two deployments to answer these questions. In January 2007, I went on my first deployment to Balad, Iraq. The deployment does not start the day you deploy, but rather, many months prior. I am a reservist in the Air Force. I drill one weekend a month at the 934th Air Lift Wing in Minneapolis. One drill week- end, a sign-up went around to find out who wanted to deploy. It is different on the reserve side. We have a choice to de- ploy or not. It is very difficult to explain this to family and loved ones, so most people just don't. My parents and very close friends know the choice is there, but that I enlisted to deploy, not to spend my entire military career stateside while a war is going on. I enlisted in a time of war and expected nothing less. I still remember the minute I signed my name to the paper and called my mom to tell her that I would be deploy- ing to Iraq; I felt like throwing up. I knew it was the right thing to do, but I still was nervous to go. Fear of the unknown. My second deployment was in July 2009. I felt much more prepared for this deployment because I was going to the same location and my friends and family had already gone through the process with me and were very supportive. The support of family and friends is key. Military personnel could not do it without that support. In a deployed setting, my job is medical technician, which is always a bit difficult to get used to since I work as a registered nurse in the civil- ian sector. The training I receive is to work in a CASF (contingency aero-medical staging facility). The CASF is a place where American patients are placed while awaiting medical flights to Germany or the United States. It is staffed by flight doctors, nurses and medical technicians. Our job is to provide medical care, dressing changes, pain medica- tion, pin care, burn care and anti- biotic therapy. And then when the flight is ready, we provide manpower to load the bus, transportation to the flight line, and manpower to load the aircraft. It is very fulfilling to see the patient through the whole process and end with a flight out of the desert. The thank yous received from the sol- diers are never forgotten. This deployment, I was placed in the hospital on the ward instead of the CASF. It was great to work with a new group of people in a new setting. The hospital takes care of military personnel, civilians, Iraqi police, de-tainees, Iraqi civilians, and many chil-dren. I also had the pleasure of caring for Iranians from Camp Ashraf. It was interesting to learn about the culture and practices of the local population. It got a little difficult to take care of the prisoners, but I had to remind myself that they are people too, and it is not my job to convict them, but to provide the best care that I can. The children were mostly burn victims. Some intention-al\u2014and that was always hard\u2014and some accidental. We had babies from 6 months old to adolescents ages 16-18. The language barrier was always a little hard, but we had interpreters on the floor and available 24 hours a day. They were invaluable. The interpret- ers were all born in Iraq; some have become American citi-zens, some are in the military, and some are locals. We would not have been able to perform our mission without their as-sistance. I was able to learn a small amount of Arabic to help with assessing pain and answer- ing the questions that were frequently asked. Homecoming after this deploy- ment was nice and easy. Coming back to work at VA was an easy transition thanks to the help from my nurse manager. She was in contact with me the whole time I was home and we worked on my schedule over e-mail and meetings. There is so much more I could say and many stories that I have about my two deployments, but that would fill a whole book. I thank all my co-workers for their support.

Maj. jeroMe Hall/usaf24 VAnguard July/August 2010Beach, Kreitenberg took care of many World War II veterans, including some who helped liberate concentra- tion camps. \"Growing up, I always felt a certain 'shadow' over my house,\" he explained. \"As I started learning and looking at history, I found that there was a dark period in time that haunt- ed both my parents. I discovered they were both Holocaust survivors. \"Being a child of these survivors, I wanted to know about their experi-ences during the war. All throughout my childhood, I accepted what my mother told me: that she had simply been in a 'coma' during that period. Later, in medical school, I learned that people who end up in a pro-longed coma have a minimal chance of survival. \"That's when I started putting the bigger picture together. My mother never spoke of her Holocaust experi-ence because she had been immensely traumatized. She had blocked out those years of her life.\" Kreitenberg doesn't think his family's debt to the American GI is unique. \"If you show me a family that doesn't feel a debt of gratitude to our men and women in uniform,\" he said, \"either they don't understand their family history or they don't under- stand this nation's history. I think every family in this country has a debt of gratitude to the American GI. \"I consider it an honor and a privilege to work at VA Long Beach,\" Kreitenberg concluded. \"I only hope I've given as much as I've received.\" By Alyssa Eddolls All VA employees have their own reasons for joining the depart- ment. For some, it's a calling that reaches even deeper than the noble cause of caring for others. Dr. Arthur Kreitenberg, an ortho- pedic surgeon at the VA Long Beach (Calif.) Healthcare System, was re-cently awarded his 25-year pin, recog- nizing his many years of dedication to veterans. It was then that he chose to share how his calling to work for VA came about. \"Each time I enter the VA,\" he said, \"I think of a European girl who, in 1941, was ripped from her fam- ily and thrown into a concentration camp, where she nearly starved to death. During her four years there, she experienced such horror that she never spoke of it again. I think of that girl rescued and liberated by Ameri- can troops, who were themselves so traumatized by what they saw that many of them became ill. \"I think of those brave American soldiers,\" he continued, \"so many injured and so many killed in that conflict, as well as other conflicts in our history. The girl they rescued from that concentration camp in 1945 was my mother. She was 15 then. Now my own daughter is 15. She is healthy, strong and free\u2014and proudly, very American. \"The veterans I serve today repre- sent those same GIs who rescued my mother and countless others like her. My family can never repay our debt of gratitude to those soldiers. But I can think of no better way to try than my continued service here at VA.\" During his residency at VA Long Re-Paying a Debt of Gratitude to the American GI For one physician, serving veterans is a very personal calling.

Each year, the President recognizes and celebrates a small group of ca-reer senior executives with the award. Recipients are strong leaders who achieve results and consistently demonstrate strength, integrity, industry and a relentless commitment to excellence in public service. \"The senior executive staff provides the continuity and in-depth expertise and insight to keep our government, and therefore our country, running smoothly,\" said Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who delivered the keynote ad-dress during the May 6 awards banquet held at the State Department in Washington, D.C. \"I wish every federal employee could be recognized and thanked for his or her ef-forts ... tonight we have the special opportunity to thank those of you who have made exceptional contributions.\" The Presidential Rank Awards have two categories: Distinguished and Meritori-ous. No more than 1 percent of the career Senior Executive Service corps can receive the Distinguished Executive Rank Award, and only 5 percent re-ceive the Meritorious award. VA's winners in the Dis- tinguished category are: Eliza-beth J. Freeman, director, VA Palo Alto (Calif.) Health Care System; Glen W. Grippen, director, Rocky Mountain Network (VISN 19); Alan S. Perry, director, VA Central California Health Care Sys-tem; and James M. Sullivan, director, Asset Enterprise Management. Winners in the Meritori- ous category are: James P. Cody, director, Syracuse VA Medical Center; Sandra D. Flint, director, Phoenix VA Regional Office; James R. Floyd, VA Heartland Network (VISN 15); Willie L. Hens-ley, principal deputy assistant secretary, Office of Human Resources and Administration; Richard J. Hipolit, assistant general counsel; Stephen L.

Wallace (retired), asso-ciate deputy assistant secretary, Privacy and Records Manage-ment, Office of Information and Technology; Suzanne C. Will, regional counsel, San Francisco; and Antonette Zeiss, deputy chief consultant, Mental Health Services. During her speech, Sec- retary Clinton highlighted several key areas of success achieved by the 2009 winners, including Grippen's leadership in saving VA $10.9 million in the pharmacy benefits program and through contracting and purchasing changes. The fes-tivities were sponsored by the Senior Executives Association and held in conjunction with the group's 25th annual black-tie Distinguished Rank Awards Banquet. Distinguished Rank Award recipients receive a pay-ment of 35 percent of their annual salary and Meritorious Rank Award recipients receive 20 percent of pay as part of the award.Elizabeth J. Freeman Glen W. Grippen Alan S. Perry James M. Sullivan The Korean War left the Korean Peninsula split into two nations\u2014one free and prosperous, the other enslaved and starving. The Republic of Korea to the south owes its freedom and prosperity to the armed forces of the United States and 21 other nations who took on North Korean and later Chinese Communist forces as they attacked the south on June 27, 1950, 60 years ago. The Republic of Korea will express its thanks to the nations who defended it and particularly to the military veterans who fought in defense of freedom during the Korean War this 60th an-niversary year. The centerpiece of this recognition is a letter to each U.S. Korean War veteran from the President of the Republic of Korea. That government has asked VA to let Korean War veterans know that the letter is available to them upon request. Those wanting to receive their letter need only to submit an online application form by visiting eng.koreanwar60.go.kr/apply.asp or download the application and mail it to: US Branch ROK 60th AKW Commemoration Committee, 2450 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20008.

The most significant enhancement allows veterans to save their application to their local desktop and return to the application at any time without having to start over. Previously, veterans had to complete the form in a single session. The new version also allows veterans to save a copy of the completed form for their records. The updated online form, along with the revised VA Form 10-10EZ, eliminates some questions asked on the old form. Minor changes were also made to simplify the wording of questions and improve clarity in the instructions. More enhancements to the on-line application are coming later this year. Veterans can complete or download the 10-10EZ form at the VA health eligibility Web site at https://www.1010ez.med.va.gov/ sec/vha/1010ez. Veterans may also contact VA at 1-877-222-8387 (VETS) or visit the VA health eligibility Web site at www.va.gov/ healtheligibility. At the request of Army Secretary John McHugh, VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki detailed Patrick K. Hallinan, a 31-year employee of the National Cemetery Administration, to the Army in June to assist in the management of Arlington National Cemetery. \"VA and the Army share a common goal of honoring all who have served and sacrificed for their country,\" Shinseki said. \"We look forward to assisting the Army in serving all members of the active and reserve components, eligible veterans and their families with the utmost dignity, respect and compassion.\" On June 10, Army Secretary McHugh announced a series of management and oversight changes in the Army National Cemeteries Program, which includes both Arlington and the Sol-diers' and Airmens' Home National Cemetery in Washington, D.C. On the retirement of current Arlington Superintendent Jack Metzler, VA's Hallinan will serve temporarily as superintendent while the Army conducts a nationwide search for a permanent replacement. Hallinan currently serves as director of NCA's Office of Field Programs, responsible for the oversight of VA's 131 national cemeteries and five Memorial Service Network offices. Hallinan has a wide breadth of experience in every facet of cemetery operations\u2014beginning as a basic laborer at Long Island National Cemetery through his appointment as director of Calverton (N.Y.) National Cemetery, to his current duties at VA headquarters. Marine Gunnery Sgt. John D. Fry, 28, had only a week left in Iraq when he injured his hand. He could have gone home with a Bronze Star. Instead, he volunteered for one last run to defuse bombs. After working seven hours, the Texas native was killed March 8, 2006, by an improvised explosive device. Now, a new scholarship program named after Fry will allow his three small children and those of other service members who died on duty in Afghanistan and Iraq to apply for benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Beginning May 1, children of service members who died in the line of duty after Sept. 10, 2001, can apply for education ben-efits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship amends the Post-9/11 GI Bill to include children of service members. Eligible children attending institutions of higher learning may receive payments to cover their tuition and fees up to the highest amounts charged by a public, in-state undergraduate institution. A monthly living allowance and books and supplies stipend are also paid under this program. VA will begin paying benefits under the Fry scholarship program on Aug. 1, 2010. Eligible participants may elect to receive benefits retroactively to Aug. 1, 2009, the day the Post-9/11 GI Bill took effect. A dependent may be married or over 23 and still be eligible. Eligible children are entitled to 36 months of benefits at the 100 percent level. They have 15 years to use the benefit beginning on their 18th birthday, and may use the benefit until their 33rd birthday. Fry's wife Malia said that when people asked him why he was in Iraq, Fry told them, \"to help the chil- dren.\" VA estimates nearly 1,500 children will receive benefits under this scholarship program in 2010.

The new forms, which are being made available on VA's Web site at www.va.gov/ vaforms, include:n A shortened VA Form 21- 526 for veterans applying for disability compensation or pension benefits for the first time. This form has been cut from 23 pages to 10. It is im-mediately available to veterans via Web download, and will be available through VA's on-line claim-filing process later this summer at vabenefits.vba. va.gov/vonapp/main.asp. time. If VA receives all of the available evidence when the claim is submitted, the re-maining steps in the claims de-cision process can be expedited without compromising quality. To participate in the FDC program, veterans should complete and submit an FDC Certification and VA Form 21-526EZ, \"Fully Developed Claim (Compen-sation),\" for a compensation claim, or a VA Form 21-527EZ, \"Fully Developed Claim (Pension),\" for a pen-sion claim. The forms were designed specifically for the FDC pro-gram. These six-page applica-n VA Form 21-526b for veterans seeking increased benefits for conditions already determined by VA to be service-connected. This new form more clearly describes the information needed to support claims for increased benefits. VA has also introduced two new forms for veterans participating in the depart-ment's new fully developed claim program, which is one of the fastest means to receive a claims decision. Gathering the informa- tion and evidence needed to support a veteran's disability claim often consumes the larg-est portion of the processing tion forms include notification to applicants of all information and evidence necessary to \"ful-ly develop\" and substantiate their claims. With this notifi-cation, veterans and their rep-resentatives can \"fully develop\" their claims before submission to VA for processing. Along with the applica- tion and certification, veterans must also submit all relevant and pertinent evidence to \"fully develop\" their claims. A claim submitted as \"fully developed\" may still require some additional evidence to be obtained by VA, including cer-tain federal records and a VA medical examination. VA Secretary Eric K.

The new item can be furnished instead of a traditional government headstone or marker for veterans whose death occurred on or after Nov. 1, 1990, and whose grave in a private cemetery is marked with a privately purchased headstone or marker. Under federal law, eligible veterans buried in a private cemetery are entitled to either a govern-ment-furnished grave marker or the new medal-lion, but not both. Veterans buried in a national or state veterans cemetery will receive a government headstone or marker of the standard design authorized at that cemetery.

Some of the events provided the opportu-nity for survivors to break their silence about their experiences. MST survivors in treat- ment at the Little Rock (Ark.) VA Medical Center hosted a conference for other survivors that focused on how treatment has helped improve their lives. MST Coordinator Diddy Vance noted how powerful it was for the attendees to hear this message from other veter-ans, not just professionals. Julia Sewell, MST co- ordinator at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System, arranged to display a large, colorful Afghan blanket, each square of which had been made by a survivor. In this same vein, many facilities hosted \"Clothesline Projects\" in which veterans decorated T-shirts in ways that reflected their experiences of sexual trauma and recovery. Shirts were then hung side-by-side to bear witness to how their lives have been affected by MST.

As energy manager for VA North Texas, Hart has led the energy management team in reducing energy costs, energy intensity and environ-mental impact while increasing sustainability and system pro-cess security. His position as a leader in energy management within the federal government was recognized recently by the Department of Energy federal energy management program . Dallas was among 22 VA medical centers cited by the Green Building Initiative for their efforts to achieve sustain-ability. The Dallas VAMC was awarded three out of a possible four \"green globes\" based on criteria such as building energy efficiency, low greenhouse gas emissions, conservation of re-sources and protection of wa-ter, and other environmental assessments. Before coming to VA, Hart was an electrical contrac-tor whose company imple-mented early energy manage-ment strategies in commercial, industrial and residential buildings after the first energy crisis. \"In those days, freezing in the dark was the most com-mon approach to managing energy, with mixed results from building occupants,\" Hart said. A health care facility is a particularly challenging setting in which to manage energy. Conditioned air is routinely exhausted for infection con-trol, lights are on 24/7, com-fort of the patient is the prime focus, and individual patients can be too hot or too cold si-multaneously. Hart recognizes that his role in health care is not direct patient care but pro-viding an environment condu-cive to healing for the veteran and the caregiver. Measures to increase production and performance and reduce waste, while re-ducing overall energy use, are difficult to implement across a complex, 84-acre, 2.6 mil-lion square-foot and grow-ing campus like the Dallas VAMC. The first building began operation in 1940, and new construction is underway that requires old systems to be actively managed with those that are more technologically advanced. The federal requirement that each agency reduce en-ergy 30 percent by 2015 is a challenge common to all VA energy managers. It requires a global view of how to save ev-ery BTU possible\u2014from sys-tems that serve the entire cam-pus to an individual employee. Staff education to improve energy awareness is the key to overall success. One employee practicing effective energy use may not be significant, but a combined effort of more than 4,000 employees can make a huge impact. The VA North Texas Health Care System is ex-ploring all aspects of energy reduction, including renew-able energy generation, and continues to push the envelope on energy, water and environ-mental conservation initiatives. The Dallas VAMC opened an alternative fuel station this year that provides E-85 to flex-fuel cars and in 2009 commis-sioned a 337-kilowatt photo-voltaic solar panel system on the roof of its clinical addition. A solar hot water system has been operational since 1990. \"The Dallas VAMC is well on its way to synchroniz-ing more systems and services into one sustainable model to focus on automation, power quality and system efficiency and reliability,\" Hart said. His proudest moment was when VA North Texas Health Care System received the national 2009 Association of Energy Engineers award for a corpo-rate energy management pro-gram in Washington, D.C. Rick Hart is a federal government leader in energy management.BruCe Morris up about issues related to MST, Mary Mitchell, of the Iowa City VA Medical Center, created a \"Ribbons of Sup-port\" campaign at her facility. Staff, veterans and members of the community were given the opportunity to send a message of support or encouragement to survivors, with messages displayed publicly at the end of the month. \"These sorts of events help let survivors know they are not alone and can assist them in making connections to new sources of support,\" said McCutcheon. \"They also give VA staff an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to this issue and help connect survivors with effective treat-ment. The events that MST coordinators host each year are really creative, and it's exciting to see the wonderful responses they draw from veterans, staff and others who participate.\" VA provides free care for all mental and physical health Military sexual trauma recovery cont.

His story and that of his unit is told in the recently produced documentary, \"Honor in the Valley of Tears.\" But this spring, McNerney was fighting a different kind of battle\u2014a struggle to keep his leg. \"The Michael E.

There are an estimated 1.7 million people living with limb loss in the United States alone. Reasons for limb loss range from trauma to infection, diabetes to can-cer, and vascular disease to various other diseases. At the DeBakey VA, Kougias is leading a multidis- ciplinary, collaborative effort involving vascular surgery, plastics, orthopedics, interventional radiology, internal medicine, cardiology, infectious disease, podiatry and pa-tient education to prevent amputations. The program fo-cuses on patients who suffer from critical limb ischemia, a severe obstruction to the arteries that decreases blood supply to the extremities. CLI is a symptom of peripheral arterial disease. The only solution for limb salvage in patients with CLI is revascularization. This can be achieved with VA Space Experiment Among Last to Fly on Discovery ShuttleShe calls them her \"astromice.\" Former astronaut Millie Hughes-Fulford, Ph.D., a cell biologist with VA and the University of California, San Francisco, sent 16 mice into space aboard the shuttle Discov-ery on its April mission to the International Space Station. The shuttle, first flown in 1984, and two others are being retired later this year. Hughes-Fulford and her team at the Laboratory of Cell Growth are studying the mechanisms behind the effects of space on the immune system. NASA first learned about the effects of space- flight on T cells\u2014key in fighting infections\u2014back in the 1970s. \"Basically, what happens is the T cell does not activate\u2014it doesn't respond to an antigen presentation,\" says Hughes-Fulford. \"When the as-tronauts come back to Earth, it doesn't go back to normal for about seven days.\" Unlike the effects on bone mass, the changes to astronauts' immune systems gradually reverse\u2014even after long space flights. But learning why the changes occur in the first place could lead to new treatments for earthbound humans with immune disorders and new therapies to fight pathogens, says Hughes-Fulford, who flew a Spacelab mission in 1991. After the space mice returned from their two-week, 6 million-mile trip on April 20, the researchers compared them with a con- trol group, challenging the animals' immune systems with a protein from egg whites and then running comparative gene scans to see which genes might be activated in one group but not the other. The analysis will take weeks to complete. - VA Research Currents Dr. Millie Hughes-Fulford and her team at the Laboratory of Cell Growth are studying the mecha-nisms behind the effects of space on the immune system. HuGHes-fulforD laBoraTory Medal of Honor recipient David McNerney exercises his legs with his De- Bakey VA surgeons, Panagiotis Kougias, ADVANCES Neurologist Consults on Resdesign of Iconic Reflex Hammer Because of his expertise on the history of neurologic technologies, and on reflex hammers in particular, Dr. Douglas Lanska of the VA medical center in Tomah, Wis., was consulted by the American Academy of Neurology to redesign the Taylor reflex hammer. The Taylor reflex hammer was originally designed by American neurologist J. Madison Taylor in 1888 and was the first tool specifically developed to elicit reflexes. It had a distinctly American design compared to earlier European chest percussion hammers. The Taylor hammer was subsequently praised and popularized by many of the founding fathers of American neurology, including S. Weir Mitchell, who used it in his neurological assess-ments of Civil War veterans, and Charles Mills, who considered it \"the best hammer for tapping the much-abused patellar ligament.\" It was later incorporated into the original logo of the Ameri-can Academy of Neurology\u2014more than a half-century ago. According to Lanska, most currently available reflex hammers are underweighted and too short to be effective at eliciting the full range of reflex responses, particularly depressed reflexes. \"Most hammers are cheaply made models of-ten distributed by pharmaceutical companies as promotional items,\" Lanska said. \"These appeal to medical students because of their low cost and the ease with which they can be carried in a pocket. Experienced neurologists, however, tend to favor heavier and better-made models of German or British hammers designed nearly a century ago.\" Lanska was determined to create a new, high-quality version of the Taylor hammer that would be useful to modern neurologi-cally oriented clinicians. The general shapes of the head and handle have been preserved. The hammer has been reweighted with a much heavier head, and equipped with soft rubber striking surfaces and a longer, high-quality metal shaft. The new hammer weighs approximately 180 grams, comparable to a high-quality modern Tr\u00f6mner hammer, rath-er than the 55- to 60-gram weight of typical commercial models. \"We went through at least a half-dozen iterations between the engineers, the machinists and myself, with about a dozen prototypes,\" said Lanska. All of the prototypes were tested at the bedside and compared for overall feel and appearance, convenience, ease of use, and effectiveness in eliciting reflexes. Interestingly, this process was very much like the one Taylor used in the 1880s when he worked with a medical instrument manufac-turer in Philadelphia. Lanska noted that the Taylor hammer is held and swung differently from other reflex ham- mers. In use, the Taylor hammer should be held between the thumb and index finger at an en-larged and scalloped portion of the shaft opposite the head, so that the hammer swings or pivots at this point prior to (and after) striking a tendon. This whip-like technique effectively increases the force on the tendon, and decreases the time of contact, so that when properly used the hammer functions like a hammer with an even longer shaft or heavier head. This is the only reflex hammer available with this design, the rest being held in a fisted hand like a conventional hammer. Still, the Taylor hammer has only a moderate weight, and easily fits in the pocket of a lab coat, unlike the unwieldy Queen Square hammer. Lanska's new reflex hammer has been named the \"Taylor hammer-Lanska edition\" by the American Academy of Neurology in his honor, and was highlighted in their 2010 catalog, in the \"AAN News\" last December, and at their annual meeting in Toronto in April. \"I hope neurologists and other neurologically oriented clinicians will find this new model of the Taylor hammer to be both convenient and useful in performing the neurologic examination,\" said Lanska. \"It carries special significance as an updated version of the original reflex hammer and the iconic hammer of the American Academy of Neurology.\" Dr. Douglas Lanska holds the re-designed Taylor Reflex Ham- mer in his right hand.jaMes THereseither open surgical bypass procedures, or endovascular interventions such as balloon angioplasty and stenting. More complex forms of arterial obstruction require \"hybrid\" operations. These combine the open and endovascular ap-proaches, and are performed by surgeons highly skilled in both. Appropriate facility infrastructure with technically advanced imaging equipment and a broad range of endo-vascular surgical supplies is essential. Hybrid operations are routinely performed at the DeBakey VA as part of limb salvage procedures. \"I really wanted this pro- cedure and have the greatest confidence in the doctors and nurses at the DeBakey VA,\" said McNerney the day after his surgery. \"Already, I can feel such an improvement in my leg, foot and toes. I can't wait to get up and walk with-out numbness and pain I felt before.\" \"All too often, the first steps to an amputation oc-cur with a small wound that doesn't heal. Then the se-quence is gangrene, loss of a digit, and then loss of a limb. When someone loses a limb, they oftentimes end up losing their life,\" said Carlos Bechara, M.D., staff vascular surgeon and an assistant professor of vascular surgery at Baylor Col-lege of Medicine. Veterans exhibiting leg pain or symptoms not easily explained by arthritis should see their doctor. Diabetics should see their health care provider regularly to prevent circulation problems before they start. \"We want to give veterans every chance to keep their limbs and live a full life,\" said David H. Berger, M.D., op-erative care line executive and professor of surgery at Baylor College of Medicine.

Sponsored by the EEO office and the Hispanic Heritage Com- mittee, the event's theme was \"Dedication to Service\" and featured guest speaker Dolores Huerta, one of the nation's most recognized labor leaders. Huerta is president of the Dolores Huerta Foun-dation and the co-founder/first vice president emeritus of the United Farm Workers of America, AFL-CIO. Huerta shared her experiences as an organizer and a voice for those who could not speak for themselves. She and Chavez worked side-by-side to develop the National Farm Workers Association, which later became the United Farm Work-ers. Chavez left a legacy in this country; his birthday is a state holiday in 11 states. Many schools, parks, cultural centers, libraries and streets have been named in his honor. And his catch phrase, \"Si Se Puede (Yes We Can),\" has been adopted by activists and politi-cians worldwide. Mini-Residency Program Addresses Women's Health Issues The VA Mid-Atlantic Health Care Network (VISN 6) hosted a mini-resi-dency education program on women's health in Roanoke, Va., April 21-23. The program brought VA primary care providers from North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia together to discuss the provision of women's health care in VA facilities, environments traditionally dedicated to male patient populations. Presenters addressed a va-riety of topics, including heart disease, osteoporosis, depression, reproductive health, and health concerns common among women veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq. \"We're very committed to ensuring women veterans get the best possible care and feel comfortable as they're receiving it,\" said program organizer Shenekia Williams-Johnson, the lead women's health program manager in the region. In addition to the educa- tional presentations, the group also conducted hand-on procedural exercises.

Walk Your Spiritual Journey in Oregon Formally dedicated on June 18, a new labyrinth on the grounds of the VA Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center and Clinics (SORCC) is meant to inspire, heal and promote awareness of life's twists and turns. Unlike a maze, a labyrinth contains only one path, representing life's journey. The labyrinth has long been used in meditation; this one was inspired by occupational therapist Carol Berger's trip to a similar one in Ashland, Ore. After witnessing the profound ef-fects the labyrinth had on veterans, Berger set about bringing one to the SORCC. The SORCC's labyrinth was created with generous donations from several local organizations and com-munity groups. And it seems to be working. \"As I walked and talked on this neat brick maze, I could relate to my own life with the straight long path, then a few turns to navigate through, then more straight paths,\" says veteran Tony DeLuca. Peer Groups Give Veterans Hope in HoustonVeterans talking to veterans about their emotional and mental problems is good medicine. That's the idea behind the Vet-to-Vet education and support group at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston. The mental health and recovery-oriented program, with the goal of veterans helping other veterans, is open to all veterans, regardless of whether they are enrolled in the VA system. The group, founded three years ago, meets three times a week and focuses on learning to live with problems posed by mental illness and addiction. \"Each veteran who attends has both something to teach and share with others as well as something to learn from other veter-ans as a means of recovery,\" said Ray Wodynksi, a Marine Corps veteran and one of the founders of the Houston peer-support group. \"We learn from each other.
