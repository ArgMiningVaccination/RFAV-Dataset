The \u00b71 starting point must berecognition thatmuchisamissin the house oft science, and, in the manner of deviant behavior, there's surely more ' gone wrong that we never learn about. Duringmany years of reporting the politics of science, I came to sense that repetitive reports about complex matters of public affairs warrantanotherlook. Inparticular, I observed thatmany of the ex\u00ad pressed concerns aboutthe ethical decline ofsciencerecycledthe same atrocitystories, all verified, shocking, and inexcusable, but relatively few in number, increasingly distant from the time of occurrence, and ofuncertain representativeness in the big world of American science. I realized this after touching on the issues of science forsale in anearlier bookthatwaspredominately concerned with relations between science andWashington, Science, Money, and Politics:Political Triumph and EthicalErosion(University 2001).Thoughseveral often-cited surveyshavefound ahigh percentage ofuniversity research\u00ad ers, particularly in the life sciences, reporting linkages to industry, uponexamination thenatureofthose links rangefrom intense to slight to nearnonexistent. Sometimes they involve a great deal of work on industrial products and sometimes no more than an annuallecture to industrial scientists or an arrangement to consultby telephone oc\u00ad casionally.

To maintain the fiction of a government-university financial partnership inresearch, theuniversity as its share of the tab. Nevertheless, for each of the big research universities, with receipts of hundreds of millions of dollars a year in federal research funds,reimbursement forindirectcosts provides additional scores of millions of dollars. The computation of these costs has developed into an arcane accounting specialty, but theoutcome isa large helping of federal money atop the money specificallydestined for the laboratory. Theamounts awarded for indirectcosts ostensibly range from about 30to90percent or more of directcosts, depending on the type of research and the characteristics of theinstitution. Butwitha variety ofexceptions andcapswritteninto the rules, the take invariably runs belowthe stated rate, averaging out to about30 percent of direct costs. Evenso, more research means more moneycorning in for indirectcosts, a linkthatadds allure to acquiring federalgrants.For the federal agen\u00ad cies that are the financial mainstays ofacademic research, the slice of their budget takenbyindirectcostsannually totalsbillions of dollars. In2005,when the NIHbudgettotaled$28billion,$5.9billion of that sum was expended onindirectcosts,that is, costs incurred outsidethe laboratories but on the campuses of the NIH'sacademic beneficiaries. Inthatyear the budget of the National ScienceFoundation stood at $5.4billion, of which $980million went to indirectcosts.'Underlying thisacademic-government partnership insciencearestrongpolitical andcultural convictions that science is beneficial for the country, and that universities are a goodplacetodoscience because they train new generations ofscientists and are, or shouldbe,bastions ofindependent expertise for dealing withpublic problems. While the in the hardscrabble world of university finance, they accept what they can get. Private foundations recognize thatindirectcostsalsoarise from their philanthropy, but theygenerallyhold the leveldown to 15to 20percent. Even at theselowrates,they donotlackacademic takers.

Theyamount toonly60percentof the money thatuniversities spend on science, with the balance mainly coming from tuition,gifts,in\u00ad come from endowment, licensing fees for patents, and wherever other money can be scraped Up.1OIndustry and state governments also help fi\u00ad nance academic science, butas we willcloselyexamine later,thesetwo sources pay a surprisingly small share of the costs. Despite, or because of, themammoth amounts required for running amajor university, money is a repeatedly declared universal dearth,as anyreadingof the journalism of higher education will confirm, with its constant reports ofmultiyear fund-raising campaigns in the billions of dollars,tuition increases, and recurring budget crises. An after-dinner speechquip jokes that \"auniversity president is someone who lives in a big house and begs for money.\" Academic cup-rattling endeavors are typically sophisticated in style and segmented according tothepotential for the yield, asindicated in a recent help-wanted advertisement byPrinceton University. Announcing two openings in its Officeof Leadership Gifts, Princeton stated,\"Thesuccessful candidates will be responsible for gifts at the six-to-seven figure level by identifying, cultivating, solicit\u00ad ing, and managing aportfolio of approximately 200alumni, parents and friends of Princeton University in the Northeast.\" 11 PayScales:The LowandtheLofty Thepopular image of the jet-setting scientist is realistic.

Scientists, in mostcircumstances,depend heavily on periodic, butneverguaranteed, grantsofgovernment moneyforresearch.

However, whiletheoccurrence of deaths in clinical.trials appears to be reliably reported, there seems tobe limited interest in determining thecause.Astudyofnearly900paperspublished inleadingmedical journals in1994founddeathsreported in223ofthepapers,butautop\u00ad sies were resources on other matters.: The frequency of fatalities is in dispute, with some critics contending that the deaths and injuries in experimental settings are grossly underreported-to news judgment, such events, like the occasional beached whale or runaway bride, are newsworthy, because they are infrequent and,in awell-ordered world,arenotsupposed to happen. In contrast; sparse media attention is given to the horrendous forthe sciences, particularly medical science, which is regarded as a beneficent enterprise, despite the undertones of concern about ethical shortcomings. Deaths in hospitals are fre\u00ad quent and familiar, from avoidable as well as unavoidable causes, andarerarelyreported outsideoftheobituary columns. Thenews media's and the public's concerned attention to deaths in experimen\u00ad talsettings reflects acceptance of science's own avowals of steadilyconfirmthatsciencestandshighinthepublicesteem,with,for 86perceutofrespondents in onesurveytypically agreeingA ,NEW REGIME 153 salutary effects.Amongresearchers, the targeted universities became worrisome symbols of institutional reputations damaged by inatten .. tion to the basic medical and bureaucratic requirements of ethically conducted research onhumans. \"Itput us on guard to say, were we looking atourselves wellenough, do we have oursystems ingood enoughshape?\" done very well. 13 Meanwhile, in thewakeofthePennandDukedisasters, thetwo representing academic science, theAssociation ofAmerican Medical Colleges andtheAssociation of American Universities, were aroused from theirchroniclanguor by the wave offederalcrackdowns onfaultyethicalperformance. Thedirect stimulant fortheirawakening was fearthatbiomedical misdeeds academic circles, which allowsnew programs to be launched in the universities. In customary fashion, theconcerns withinthe two university associations led to the creation of committees toconductstill.further inquiries into the already well-masticated ethicalissues arising from research and to recommend improvements. TheAAMC, withits 125medical-school members, and the.AAU, comprising sixtyAmerican research universities and twoin Canada, undertook separate studies of conflicts ofinterestandprotec\u00ad tionofhuman subjects in academic research. The announcement of thestudies,whichwouldbe long in progress, provided arationale for opposing immediate tightening offederalregulations.

On the otherhand,the removal of Ellis, his replace\u00ad high ethicalstandards, and filling demanded by government might be realistic goal.

The urgency and amorphous boundaries of the topic were evident from the disparate castnowheavily involvedANEW REGIME 157 the board. Firstof all, it is quite clear [fromdiscussions at the conference] that conflicts .ofinterest are very real. They are veryserious andthey are a.threatto ourentireendeavor.These conflicts have certainly intensified over the last two decades and certainly during the last five years, the system may have gotten entirelyout of control. There is a need to very immedi\u00ad ately, at least to begin, to get the system back into some kind of control. Koskialsointerjected caustic remarks about the recent conflict-of\u00ad interestdebatesathisowninstitution; Harvard: IfIcoulddigressfor onemoment, 1simply have to say that as the faculty and administrators at Harvard Medical School considered the possibility of revising their conflict-of-interest policies...Ireadaccounts that indicated that one of the con\u00ad cerns was that stringent policies on conflict of interest would make it difficult to retain and recruit faculty. Itis almost hard for me to say that, but I think that it is a sad commentary on the status of science and academics to say that stringent poli\u00ad ciesonconflicts of interest to protect the integrity of science and the well-being of research subjects would be an impedi\u00ad ment.torecruiting and retaining faculty.\" The views expressed by Koski would once have offended the bio\u00ad medicalestablishment and provoked itinto self-righteous, indignant re\u00ad joinder. But withinthe leadership, fears were growing of apolitical and financial backlash from reportsof misdeeds in medical research. The peril was soon candidly addressed byAAMC president JordanCohen, head ofthe medical schoollobby, whowarnedhisbiomedical-research constituents thattheappearance of greed and indifference to patient safety could have costly consequences. In October 2000,shortlyafter Koskitook office,Cohen gavean address, \"TrustUsto Make a Differ\u00ad ence,\" in which he departed from soporific association talkand bluntly warned that failures of patient protection, real or merely perceived, mightundermine the doubling plan for the NIHbudget: Are we supposed to wait,forirrefutable evidence that some patientdied'because an investigator with a financial conflict of interest was so blinded by greed that he or she failed todo all that could bedone Congress ignoredShalala's as did her Republican successor asHHSsecretary, formergovernor TommyThompson ofWisconsin. vestigators' financial relationships, andseveral of the universi\u00ad told us they weredeveloping mechanisms to do so....One university...mistakenly assumed it needed on disclose financial interests on the consentform....OfIIIinvestigators at four of the universi\u00ad ties we visited who had significant financial relationships with industry in2000,only 3voluntarily divested theirinterests;ANEW REGIME 161 werenot disclosed.

Uncertainty the issues of who was responsible for lookingout fortroublein these deals and who held authority to blocktawdrysituations. Koski's docu\u00ad ment openly addressed thegrowthandpotential family, these were mattersbestkeptfrom outsiders.

Millerthenflaunted his skill at political navigation, explaining that 167 TheNIHandotherfederal agencies thatfinanced clinical research laid downvariousguidelines, but did not undertake rigorous surveillance andtookdrastic punitive steps only ininstances of gross violations that could not be ignored. Nonetheless, even as Koski was completing his tour of service in Washington and preparing to return to Harvard, the cause of righteousness inresearchwas nudged forward-not dra\u00ad matically forward, but significantly so, in comparison to the long run of indifference and dodging thatusually prevailed among researchers, administrators, and the organizations that represented academic sci\u00ad ence inWashington. Raisingthe American Medi\u00ad calColleges issued the first, and more important, of two reports that were conceived in the aftermath of the Penn and Duke episodes. The death at Hopkins occurred whilethe report was in preparation, raising the pressure to producesomething useful. Titled Protecting Subjects, Preserving Trust,Promoting Progress, this was a blue-ribbon docu\u00ad ment,produced by a carefully selected twenty-eight-member Task Force on Financial Conflicts of Interest in Clinical Research. Manda\u00ad rinsofmedical research and education wereplentiful in the member\u00ad ship, including, as chairman, WilliamDanforth, chancellor emeritus ofWashington University, Saint Louis; and Joseph P. Martin,dean of the medical faculty at Harvard. Reflecting the AAMC's recognition of theimportance of public relations, the group included several figures connected tothenewsindustry: SusanDentzer, of thePBSNewsHour; HedrickSmith, aTV producer formerlywiththeNewYork Times; and MarvinKalb, a former TV correspondent and head of the Washington office ofHarvard's JoanShorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and PublicPolicy.Alsoon the task force,were three senior officialsofmajor biotechnology firms, several attorneys, an ethicist, and the head of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, oneofthe most effectiveofthe many patientorganizations working CapitolHillfor research money.

The AAMCevengingerlysuggested application of therebuttable presump\u00ad tionconcept inconflicted institutional situations. But it backed away from a direct confrontation withtheinstitutional issue, stating that \"ultimately ...eachinstitution must determine howbest to segregate human subjects research andinvestment management functions fully and,reliablywithinthecontextof itsownorganization and governance structure.\" \"Hysterical andOverstated?\" Several years after the production of theseexpressions of piety, an un\u00ad guarded insightintotheiroriginwasprovided by the key figure in research interactions between academic researchers and-industry limitcreative andeconomic opportunities and are a fargreater violation of academic freedom thananydocumented interference incorrect bytherecurring negative officialreportsANEWREGIME Overreaction?173 Then Korn made an admission rarely, if ever, heard in public .from.a leader ofthe medical establishment: \"Was it hysterical and overstated?

So[ordyCohen, my president [oftheAAMCj, announced in hispresidential speech in the fall of 2000at theannual meeting that we weregoing to launch a task force on financial conflicts ofinterestthatI had the pleasureof being responsible for. \"We don't endorse the hysteria,\" Korn continued, \"and there is a hugeamountof hysteria.

There are others who clearly write a letter that allows us to follow up. Ifit's a university setting, we get back to the university and tell them that we've had this complaint and we want to know, if in fact you areaware of it, is it real, haveyou donesomething to solvethis problem, and ifnot, areyou going to do something? Quite often they will say, yes, we're aware of this, and here'swhat we've done to solve the problem so it wouldn't happen again. Inwhich case, we say, that's fine, and there'sno furtherconcern on ourpart. Schwetz also expressed concern that some universities areovercautious and aretakingon needless administrative costs and burdens in follow\u00ad ing federal regulations, fearingthat\"whenOHRPstandsready toshut down the university,what do you expectusto do but beconservative?\" Asa result, he said, they \"have put more into place thanwasabsolutely necessary.\" 40 In2004adescendant of theill-fated \"DraftInterimGuidance\" thatKoski issued four years earlieremerged in final form from the Department ofHealthandHumanServices. Holding thestatusofof\u00ad ficial policy, it advised research institutions toidentifyindividual and institutional conflicts of interest, evaluate their potential foraffecting clinicaltrials,anddetermine the need for remedial steps.Thenew and final version was deferential to institutional autonomy. Absent was Koski'shard-edged language concerning the risks to patientsafety and scientific integrity posed by institutions with a financial stake in clini\u00ad caltrials.The final version stated:\"Thisdocument isnon-binding and does not change any existingregulations orrequirements, anddoes not impose any new requirements.\" 41 Havinglookedat thesettingand the system ofsciencefor sale in partI, I will now examine personal experiences at the interface of academic science and commerce. Part 2has lengthy conversations that I con\u00ad ductedwithparticipants deeply involved in academic-industrial rela\u00ad tions. Their interactions, or collisions, withcommercialization are personally unique in some respects but also familiarin thecontempo\u00ad rary scientific enterprise.

Butconcern about scientific honestyis abundant because misdeeds are widelyregarded, byscientists and the public, as intolerable, dangerous, are almostalways deplored andpunished. Therecord provides reasonfor for the relationship between science and moneymaking. Thisexpectation on mypartborrows from the considerable prog\u00ad ress in recent years in strengthening a major requirement of ethical behavior in science-the honest conduct and reporting of laboratory research. There's some overlap here with science in pursuit of com\u00ad mercial gain. But in the categories of scientific deviance, faked experi\u00ad ments and doctored reports are in a separate domain, usually inspired bythe pursuit of professional recognition, tenure, orglory, ratherthen money. The perpetrators workalone, or at most witha colleague or two,andthoughtheir mentors and institutions may smile on their fakedaccomplishments priortoexposure, once revealed they faceWHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG 261 credit, thus ensuring scrutiny, attempts at replication by other scien\u00ad tists, and, sooner orlater, exposure offakery.Deterrence proceeded, itwasattributable to a fewslippery sociopaths in white coats, bogus members of the profession, destined to becaught,expelled, andtheirtaintedreportsexpunged fromthe scientific whoin1981chairedthe firstcongressional hear\u00ad ings on scientific misconduct. Based on several cases that had come topublicattention, including theinfamous fakeryofsuccessful tissue transplants at theSloan-Kettering InstituteforCancerResearch (see p. 36),thehearings brought scientific misconduct topublicattention. But.theproblem was still depicted bythescientific establishment as small, under control, andinconsequential totheprogress of science. Between 1974 and 1981, merelytwelve cases ofscientific misconduct weredisclosed in the United States, according to a historical review by ORI.2During those years American scientists, in all fields of research, rampant scandal, the buck was passed for responsibility for keeping science honest.Universities contended that research journals the 1970s,erosion of trust becameaprominent factorinrelations between science and society. TheTuskegee scandal led to the passage in'974of theNational Research Act,whichre\u00ad quired universities to establish review boards to monitor the safety of volunteers inclinicalresearch.Therewas nocounterpart legislation fo\u00ad cused on fraud in the laboratory, but that issue, too, attracted scrutiny and.publicattention. Allegations of scientific misconduct as a stain on modern science gainedcredibility withthe1982publication of abookproviding recipients money.to establishWHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG 263 lishedinI989withintheNIH.AttheNational ScienceFoundation, thepolicingtole was assigned to the Office of Under federalregulations andprodding over thepastfifteen years atso,rules andprocedures have evolved for promptly investigating allegations of such scientific misdeeds. At everyuniversity receiving federal research funds, procedures are inplace-or aresupposed tobe-toinvestigate allegations offabrica\u00ad tion,falsification, andplagiarism, for securing laboratory recordswhenalle\u00ad gations of misconduct aremade-an important step, often inethicalscientific behavior for allresearch staffsupported byfederalmoney.Mindful reputations, universities usuallynowrespond to allegations of misconduct quicklyandopenly.Whenflaws are detected inpublished papers, authors often hastentoexplainorwithdraw them. The system hasitsfailings. Some researchers may succeed withan episode or two of sleazy behavior, andnowandthenyouhearaboutsomeone whohas managed a fullcareer'sworth. Nonetheless, the overarching reality isthat the research community nowrecognizes thatasubstantiated allegation ofmisconduct islethal to a scientific career and harmful to an institution's reputation. In the consequences haveensued. 2006,forthe firsttime according to federal prosecutors, afinding ofscientific misconduct re\u00ad sulted in a criminal prosecution and imprisonment for making false statements on grant applications. In this instance, a one-year prison sentence was imposed on a prizewinning medical researcher, Profes\u00ad sor Eric Poehlman, formetly at theUniversity ofVermont College of Medicine, who also repaid $r80,00o to the government and retracted tenpublished papers.' But just as centuries ofhanging havenotabol\u00ad ishedmurder, will never offense,its incidence defies exactitude. How\u00ad ever, there'sno evidence of a flood of thereis arelatively ofscientific misconduct. For the years I992-20OI, theOffice of Research Integrity reported that248institutions reported 833allegations ofmisconduct, resultingWHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG 26S Thetaskahead is to minimize the negative effectsof science for saleinactivities so far resistant to or only slowlyadopting ethicalsafe\u00ad guards.Thesearemainlyinclinicalresearch, areas in whichcommer\u00ad cialmoneyand academic interest and needs intersect, andindependent scrutiny is resisted or refused. We can take heartfromsuccessagainst theevil.trio under ORI's surveillance: fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism. They have not been abolished but have been drastically minimized by strict regulation, ostracism of offenders, and, recently, imprisonment. Focused on three categories of clearly defined behavior thathave long been abhorred, thecrackdown on scientific misconduct was rela\u00ad tively easy tomusterand enforce. The sins arising from scientific com\u00ad mercialism pose afarmore challenging problem:keeping science honest whilepotentforces hardto make money. A Troubled butDurableRelationship Theproductivity ofcontemporary science is evident in the prolifera\u00ad tion of healing drugs, devices, and methods derived from both incre\u00ad mental and revolutionary growth inbiological understanding. Yes, academic-industrial collaboration should be more closely focused on societal needs and benefits, and less on profit-seeking. The billions spent by Big Pharmaon developing and mar etm co sof competitors' rugs are a testimonial tomr,Qorate irresponsibility. In addition, thepharmaceutical industry's unwavering pursuit of extrava\u00ad gant profits and its crafty, sometimes dangerous, marketing strategies radiatea baleful influence on the life sciences, the medical ofession, andpub-!ic confidence. In a rare a mission, a eading industry official acknowledged the negative publicity arisingfrom corporate misdeeds. \"I've been asked, 'Howcan we stop bad stories?'\" Billy Tauzin, the former.congressman who heads Big Pharma,\u00b7remarked at an industry forum in 2005.Tauzin's answer: \"Let'sstop doing bad things.\" The industry has done so many bad things thatmedicaljournals are in\u00ad creasingly wary of any submission directly or indirectly touched byits moneyorpeople,and an increasing number of medical schoolsrestrict orprohibitpharmaceutical representatives from on-campus contacts with their students. But even withmisguided priorifsand reprehensible behavior, the.academic-m ustnaresearch system produces beneficial results. Equallyimportant, the two sectors bypolitics. ReformersWHAT'S RIGHT accept to transparency, an indispensable, but notalwayssufficient, requirement for ensuring integrity in academic\u00ad the most influential medicaljournals now require early registration. of clinical trials in a public database as a prerequisite forconsideration forpublication.

After a succession ofappalling episodes, manyifnot most contracts between universities and corporate research sponsors guarantee scientists an unrestricted right to publish, with the excep\u00ad tionof agraceperiodforthecompany toreviewthemanuscript and retain proprietary information. Assignment of graduate students to theirprofessors' commercial research isgenerally forbidden. Earlyin their training, most scientists now receive some formal instruction or mentoring in scientific ethics and responsible scientific behavior.

Butdenialofrealityalsoafflictsanyonewhodoubtsthatsci\u00ad ence has go in shedding questionable tacticsandvalues, inprotecting againstbacksliding, and in practicing transparency asan indispensable requirement for assuring scientificintegrity, In support areeducable in the cause of goodbehavior, I sadlyconcede that,yes, it does in thisinstance. Overall, remainhopeful. Whileconducting this one between PennWHAT'S RIGEiT AND WRONG 271 of research. I was particularly interested inwhether pharmaceutical firms paid any partof thesalariesof Penn researchers conducting hu\u00ad manclinicaltrials of their experimental drugs, and whether Penn re\u00ad searchers were allowed to conductclinical trials of drugs in which they held apersonal financial stake. A staffmember in Penn's news office responded on January 10,2006,that the salary information provided by Pfizer concerning the veterinary.trials was correct and added, \"As far as I am aware the arrangement is unique at Penn\" -meaning, ap\u00ad parently, that it was confined to the veterinary school.Nootherin\u00ad formation was provided in that response. The nextday, however, a higher-level official at me bye-mail totelephone to discuss my inquiry. I repeated my questions aboutfinancing of clinical research. Explaining thathe was relatively new on the job, McMurtry said he would seek an answer from otherPenn with severalotherpeople I regretIdon'thave any information of the kind you areseeking.v'? Penn, like scores of other universities, annually receives hundreds ofmillions of dollarsofpublic money for research and otherpurposes. Almostunavoidably, any research activity on its campus benefits from or entails the use of publicly financed facilities. Nonetheless, the uni\u00ad versity-along withmanyothers-conceals the terms of at least some of its deals withprofit-seeking firms, even as it appeals for public trust andsupport.Is Pennembarrassed by the terms of its dealings withthe corporate partners? Idon'tknow, but examples are nothardto find. In an interview at Stanford, Arthur Bienenstock, the university's vice provostand dean of research andgraduate policy, declined to reveal the terms of a memorandum ofunderstanding between Stanford and IB1V!forcollaboration at a joint center for spintronics research. \"Is theMOD[memo of understanding] made available to the university community?\" I asked, reminding Bienenstock, anacquaintance from his service in the WhiteHouse science office, that\"thisis the era of transparency, Bienenstock replied. \"Buteach side made con\u00ad cessions that it might not generally make because of each side's trust of theotherto behave responsibly in difficultcircumstances.

Resistant to lay interferencein its internal affairs, but protective of its virtuous image,the scientific establishment has long been involved in atwo-step processof sinspainfully exposed andreformsgrudgingly adopted thoughsometimes thereforms. Professor Thomas Stosselpub\u00ad lishedhis screed againstconflict-of-interest regulations (see page 171) in theNewEnglandJournalofMedicine, long aleadingsite fordeplor\u00ad ing commercial excesses and ethical failures in research and medical practice.

In December 2006,after reportedly spending nearly $1billionindevelopment costs,Pfizer abruptly abandoned a highly promising drug for heartdisease,torcetrapib, when fatalities among those takingthe drugin a clinicaltrial significantly exceeded those in a placebo controlgroup. The drug was longtoutedas a blockbuster forreplacing highly profitable Pfizer drugs nearing patent expiration. Un\u00ad like Merck and its efforts to concealthe dangers of Vioxx,Pfizer promptly announced the trialfindings and dropped the drug. Thenextday Pfizer,stock fell 10percent.WHAT'S RIGItT AND WRONG 279 and programs that bring luster to thebig research universities. Little attention is given to the fact thatthenationwide expansion oflabora\u00ad toryfacilities for biotechnology, as well as other fields, is unmatched by increases in funds to supportstaffand research in the gleaming new buildir:gs.The NIH,overwhelmingly the main supportfor the life sciences, is budget-becalmed by the Bush administration's fiscal wan\u00ad tonness,notwithstanding thepresident's promises of increased spend\u00ad ing on research. The pharmaceutical industry has been cuttingitsown research budgets but even in affluent periods has never been a major source of moneyfor university research. The exception was inclinical research, but,increasingly, drug trials are conducted abroad, where costs are lower and regulatory compliance is less easily monitored. Public universities have experienced a long decline in the proportion oftheirbudgetsprovided by stategovernments. Is a financial famine about to descendon the scientific landscape? Possibly, given the strains in the public support of research.-Ifitcomes,scientific integrity will be threatened as never before by temptations to cutethicalcorners to meet the needs of commercial patrons. In these circumstances, pru\u00ad dence calls for a moderation of thescientific-growth obsession that flourishes throughout academe. But that won't happen until financial scarcity leaves empty or unfinished laboratories on a few campuses, as alessonin economy, politics, and reckless ambition for university trustees, managers, faculty, and boosters. Don'tBlameBayh-Dole Criticsof science.for.sale _trace major failings of pressuregenerated bythe Bayh-Dole Act's requirement for; universities to disclose and pursue thecommercial potential of their: government-supported research. But even if the act were repealed or substantially amended, neither ofwhich appearslikely,universities will continue to seek patents and commercial customers for their research, as many did priorto passage of the r980law. The difference now is thatvirtually all American universities of significant scale are either habituated to seeking commercial deals for their research or are trying to learn how. Around the world, withorwithout theirownversions of Bayh-Dole, industrialized nationsseek to emulate the academic\u00ad industrial linkages thathave succeeded in the United States over the past twenty-five years.

Back at U Av, following aseries of interviews, the trustees were particularly impressed bythestrongprofessional credentials andde\u00ad meanor of one candidate.

Illuminate theMarketplace Business dealings between universities and industrial firmsshouldbe broughtout ofthe darkthronghInternetpostingofcontracts andother agreements on publicly accessible databases. Refusal to do so usually rests on the flimsy contention that legitimate proprietary information would be compromised. Ifthat's the case, the proprietary information could beexcluded from public disclosure, subject to confirmation byan independent review. Apart from legitimately secretmatters, the details ofcommercial deals should be available to the campus community. Whether,public or private, universities arepublicinstitutions, benefit\u00ad ing from tax-exempt, nonprofit status, large amounts of government research money, and many privileges because of the common assump\u00ad tionthatthey arededicated to the public well-being. Private deals with a university unavoidably piggyback on the money and trustprovided by the public. No rationale exists for concealing the details of these deals, except that it suits the preferencesof business organizations and makesthem more willingto provide money, which inclines universities to accept their terms. Butthat's no excuse. Academe's involvement with commercial enterprise is bound to continue. The task, then, is to maximize the benefits of collaboration andminimize the risks and liabilities. Transparency is the first step towardthis goal. Scientists and otherfaculty members shouldinsist upon it, demanding open access to details of allcommercial deals on campus, institutional as well as individual. Theirprofessional societies should back them withcodes of behavior anddeclarations ofsupport whenindustrial sponsors seek to violate ethical norms. Trustees and university administrators should reconsider the pitfalls of unrestrained growth.And the press should do its partby sniffing out wrongdoing and activating the powers of the embarrassment factor.

The efforts at reform werestymied because these conflicts arose from commercial relation\u00ad ships and deals thatacademic administrators foundeitherprofitable or promising for their institutions, regardless of the appearance orreality ofethicalcornercutting.The AAU reportoninstitutional conflicts of interest,issuedin October 200I,explained that universities were expe\u00ad rienced in dealing with individual conflicts, but with the institutional type \"the focus is on developing policiesand principals, since no regu\u00ad lationsguide this area ....Given the dearthof previous policy making ininstitutional conflictof interest; the Task Force is cognizant that its efforts arebutafirststep in developing and institutionalizing processes in this field.\" 33Sixyears later,no further steps were evident.

Butwary of reform coming from government, Korn advocated reform from within.After the disasters heprophetically feared had actually occurred, he successfully politicked withintheAAMCfor a strong response. The taskforceand its report were the result. The AAMC reportwas amoraldeclaration of the need for cur\u00ad tailingtheethicalfailings of science for sale and an endorsement of safeguards toattainthatgoal.Compliance wouldhaveto be voluntary, as was the case withotherpolicyprescriptions ofthemedical-school association and its academic counterparts. Theseorganizations have nodisciplinary power. But the good name of medical research was nowstainedbydeathsandnumerous reportsofmercenary dealings by professors with one footin academe, theotherin commerce, to the detriment of patients, the publicinterest, and the reputation of medical science. The press, the public, and federal enforcers, stirredby con\u00ad cerned scientists and .journal editorswithinthebiomedical-research enterprise, nowaccepted that some things were seriously amiss in the conductof medical research. The go-go spirit on the commercial fron\u00ad tiers ofbiotechnology hadproduced enough misdeeds to sway percep\u00ad tions.

So itmightseem,but it isn't so. Nonetheless, the leaders of science believe it is so and react tothatbelief-to the benefit ofupgrading ethicalperformance intheir profession, or atleastearnestly talkingaboutit.Through and1990S,though many cases of scientific fraud and other wrong\u00ad doings in research came to public attention, government support for scienceacrossvirtually alldisciplines nonetheless rose briskly. The medical sciences did especially well,risingfrom$3.7billioninr980 tonearly$r8billionin2000.\"Atworkduringthosedecadeswere the stablemotivations forgovernment spending onresearch: initially, Cold Waranxieties, which were then succeeded by the ever-present hopes for medical cures and economic growth. Wemustconclude thatnotightcorrelation existsbetween misdeeds in science and congressional appropriations for science ..The scientists' fear of a backlash fromwrongdoing inresearch isattributable toanxi\u00ad etyratherthantheworkings of thepolitical system.Politicians have never yet cut budgets for research in retaliation for scientific delin\u00ad qnency. In fact,theshortstretchof years in whichCongress doubled theNIHbudget,r998-2003, included some of themostdisturbing failures in protection of volunteers inmedical experiments. Still, the budgetjuggernaut rolledon. Butdependent as they are on theNIH's money, the managers of academic medical research easily cornedown withfiscaljitters.Theircalls forreformmay have been last getting the attention ofbiomedical researchers and theiradministrators.

In a visit toDukeseveralmonthsbefore IRBmembership included Duke'sdirectorof grantsandcontracts. Inthatjob,thiscampusofficialwas responsible for bringing money into the university and thus, perhaps, was not acutely sensitive to patient-protection violations thatmight keep it out. Was thisaconflictofinterest? Nowhere was itwrittenthatsuch an official was ineligible for IRB membership. But the newly militantOPRRwas suspicious; Its investigators alsoraised concerns about record keeping quorum waspresentfor IRBdeliberations and decisions. 5These were congenital, enduring deficiencies in the IRB system, as statedincriticalreportsby theGeneralAccounting Office andothers.In thepastOPRReitherignoredsuch failings or departed uponreceiving thattheywould becorrected. withaburstofmea culpa correctives, first;by establishing a task force to review its procedures forprotecting patientsinexperiments.

Thetechnological flowwas not,ascommonly as\u00ad sumed, from campus to corporation, according to Christophe Lecuyer, a research historian at the Beckman Center for the Historyof Chemis\u00ad try. Rather, he writes, the rise of the solid state electronics programme at Stanford was made possible bymassive transfersof technology from in\u00ad dustry. Stanford owed much of its competence in solid state circuit and system design to Bell Telephone Laboratories. Its processing expertise came from two companies, Shockley Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor ....These flows of ideas, knowledge, and techniques revolutionized theelectri\u00ad cal engineering curriculum atStanford.

UCLA, UC San Diego, whatdo they bring in? Nothing. Pennsylvania too.\" 40Varmus's off-the-cuff assessment is not altogether accurate, but, ingeneral, he'scorrect. Many universities with big R&D budgetsreap little from patenting. The movement of research fromacademic and government labora\u00ad tories to industry is an intricate enterprise, affected by differing mo\u00ad tives and varying degrees of interest, enthusiasm, negotiating skill, marketplace opportunity, luck, and a generally low success rate. Bayh-Dole'sSkeptics Doubtsabouttheeconomic impactof Bayh-Dole and allegations of the legislation's deleterious effects on scientific progress have festered ineconomic and scientific circles for many years. But even with rising concerns about science losing its soul and perhaps some momentum to commerce, technology transferdraws little public or political atten\u00ad tion.Thepatenting and commercial exploitation of discoveries that are useful for conducting research rather than for producing goods for the general marketplace isincreasingly anirritantamong scien\u00ad but when entangled inpatentrightsandpriced to raise revenue, can delayor block scientific investigations.

So, they contact the company and say, 'Here's some infor\u00ad mationon this faculty member andwouldyou like us to set up a meet\u00ad ing with him?'\" 10 But at many universities, including some with extremely large amounts of federally supported research, Bayh-Dole has had minimal effects. The venerable JohnsHopkins University, withover $r billion annually in federal grants,is alaggardin the academic tech-transfer boom,collecting in each of recent years just a few milliondollarsin commercialization income. In 1999, inproud defense ofhis university's commercial backwardness, Hopkins president WilliamBrodyasserted that \"ourscientists arebynature explorers ....Asking them to become managers, marketers, and accountants is unrealistic and ultimately in\u00ad imical to the research enterprise.

However, in thepolicycirclesthat encompassed government research officials and university administra\u00ad tors, a victory was hailed. Swept away was the scattered collection of regulations governing the ownership and sale of government-financed research inuniversities. Taking its place was a federallawthat not only gave universities clear title to the patents, but also imposed on them and their scientists aduty to pursuelicensing to industry asacondition of accepting government moneyfor research. Forthe nation's research universities, going to market was no longer optional or voluntary. It wastheirlegalobligation. Theycouldescapethatobligation onlyby engaging in theunthinkable: declining government research provided thegovernment witharoyalty-free license to thepatents, whichhasturnedoutto be exercised option. Among other provisions, the bill di\u00ad rected universities to conduct their patent dealings with small busi\u00ad ness firms, a dualsop topopulist sentiments andthepresence ofsmall businesses in every congressional district. Three years later,the small\u00ad business preference was removed from the act, in recognition of the factthatconventional small businesses lack the talent and resources to transform scientific knowledge into a saleable product. However, involvement for small business laterdeveloped on its own withthepro\u00ad liferation ofbiotechspin-offs fromacademic research. discoveries by their government-financed scientists. Butthe same scientists could establish spin-off companies, often in nearby university-owned research parks, license the patents, and gain riches by turning their discoveries into tangible goods;or,morelikely, sell theirfledgling firm to one of the manybigcompanies thatpreferred vate firms, and publicagencies nourished the new spin-off economy. In many regions, assistance becameplentiful for the entrepreneurial academic.CHAPTER THREE 52 resultedfromexpanding government spending forresearchandtraining of more researchers. But a serious traffic problem was reported on the roadfromgovernment-financed university researchto themarketplace. From many quarters came the contention that valuable patents based ongovernment-financed scientific discoveries in universities remained outsidetheeconomic mainstream because, bylaw, they belonged to the federalgovernment or theownership criteria were ambiguous. Law, or the lack of it, was thusseen asblocking theadvanceof an.mportant economic process, technology transfer, from campus to corporation. Priorto 1980,the federal government ownedthirtythousand patents, ofwhichonlyabout5percentwere licensed to industry, according to one of the patriarchs of academic tech transfer, Howard Bremer, for\u00ad merpatentcounselat theWisconsin AlumniResearch Foundation.\" Amongtheresearch universities, industrial customers for the discoveries-of theirscientists. Some universities had long before lost inhibitions about profiting from science. For universities that desired patent protection fortheirresearch butpreferred toremaindistantfromcommercial dealings, assistance was available from the Research Corporation, a university-oriented, nonprofit patentservicefounded in1912.Tech transfer is distinctfrom scientific research and has never been an easy process. Matching academic science and industry is specialized work, requiring knowledge of the needs andinterests ofindustrial firms, evolving markets, and the commercial potential in patented concepts thatare fardistantfrom saleable products. Aprecursor of the tech\u00ad transferofficesnowfound in every research university, the Research Corporation locatedindustrial customers for academic patents,negoti\u00ad ated deals that produced revenues for inventors and their universities, andputitsshareofprofitsbackintoacademic research. Manyuniversities, however, remained queasy about sellingtheir science and shunned opportunities for patents. But pressures for tech transferwereincreasing. In r968 the U.S. Department ofHealth,Edu\u00ad cation,and Welfare (HEW),parentagency of the National Institutes of Health,set up a system of Institutional PatentAgreements thatenabled universities to take title to their HEW-financed inventions if they were staffedtonegotiate theirtransferfromcampustoindnstry.
