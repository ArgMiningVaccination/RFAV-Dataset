I received reiki from Jess twice and each time it was paired with journaling, essential oils, crystals and a wonderful sound bath. After both sessions, I felt like my stagnant energy had been flushed and I had more clarity moving forward in my life. She is extremely intuitive and supportive through the entire process. I highly recommend her reiki sessions, sound baths, yoga and her overall guidance. Every time I step into her home, I feel at ease and comforted in her space. I am grateful to experience her gifts of healing! She is truly such a beautiful being making a positive impact on humanity Business owner information Jessica E. 2/3/2020 Hailey, you're a gem! So glad you feel at ease and comfortable in our sessions. - 1/29/2020 Before meeting Jessica, I had never experienced Reiki or a private sound healing. Since meeting her, I have became more open for love and change within myself through her healing. My experiences with her have Been extremely relaxing, and every time I've experienced a different kind of magic. Jessica has a beautiful way of being calm, nurturing, authentic, and compassionate. I've felt extremely safe and comfortable with her during my sessions. She definitely has a way to make you feel calm and comfortable, from start to finish, she has it all. We shared heart opening conversations, sound healing, and reiki session. She is compassionate when talking with her about life or whatever you have going on. The sound healing is NEXT LEVEL! The most incredible sound healing I've experienced. She is so powerful and so connected that her performance is always on point. She has so many different instruments that trigger different points of your body. It's truly so healing and an out of body experiences. I walk out feeling so relax and open. My mind feels so clear every time, like nothing can get in my way of my vision. Throughout Jessica's reiki sessions, I learned to just surrender. I've had a very profound experience with her. I'd never felt anything like this, nor ever believed that this could happen. I could literally feel her energy going over and through my body. It was like this strong force of energy that I felt take over my entire body. At the time, I was feeling sick and unable to relax with a rapid heart rate, and once she was finished, my heart rate went down and I was able to relax. In that moment, I felt so healed and it was big lesson to me to surrender more in my life and to trust. Jessica is also an amazing yoga instructor! I've done many private session with her and I also leave feeling relaxed and healed. She is you're go to healer, she's truly wonderful and has changed my life so much. Through her healing, I am able to share and help heal other people through my business. If I were to best to describe her personality it would be: her goal in life is to spread as much love as possible, she is caring, kind and compassionate, and she always wants the best for people so they can shine as bright as possible. I highly recommend using her services if you want to take a deep dive on yourself and get some healing! Business owner information Jessica E. 2/4/2020 Wow! Thank you so so much Lauren. Your faith in me and glowing review is why I love doing what I do. Supporting people in their healing and getting everything they want out of life is the best feeling. And I love watching your progress over the last few months. - 1/31/2020 Jessica is an amazing soul and a true healer. I have done several sessions with her (Reiki, Soundbath healing, Cacao ceremony, yoga) and each time, Jessica brings a sense of calm and peace to her practice which is very tangible. It's as if she has been doing these practices for generations. I look forward to many more amazing experiences with this special soul. Highly highly recommend! Business owner information Jessica E. 2/3/2020 Thank you So much Dan! I'm grateful to work with you and look forward to more as well! - 2/3/2020 I started seeing Jessica a few months ago when she first started hosting sounds baths. The peacefulness and clarity I gained after each session was absolutely incredible. I fall asleep every time and felt the beautiful energy and vibrations through every part of my body. When she mentioned to me that she also performs reiki I was a little nervous. I'd never had a reiki session before and didn't know what to expect. But Jessica has such a way of bringing you to this calm, positive state of being that I knew I was in the right hands. I'd never felt so in tuned with my body like I did after our first session. I highly recommend you check her out and see for yourself. Business owner information Jessica E. 2/3/2020 Thank you Alexys! I appreciate your warm review and look forward to working with you again soon! - 1/29/2020 I have been wanting to do a Reiki and sound healing session for my first time for quite a while. I went to Jessica the other day for my first ever sound healing followed by Reiki. I'm not someone who has done a lot of alternative medicine like this and she made me feel very comfortable. The ssound healing was amazing as it felt like the bowls frequencies and binaural beats filled my head and body completely. Really amazing. Also, Jessica has a beautiful voice that she uses at times. The Reiki was extremely relaxing and I lost awareness of myself and thoughts as the sea soon flew by. After the whole session I felt more mentally and emotionally balanced. It's a bit hard to explain, but it felt like my perspective on the world shifted and it felt more even for lack of a better word. I will be you in back! If your a first timer like me or a consistent receiver of this type of modality I would highly encourage and recommend you see Jessica. Thank you Jessica. You are amazing! Business owner information Jessica E. 2/4/2020 Thank you so much JB! Your amazing for trusting yourself and trying out this new modality and seeing how it can support you in your every day life. - 12/27/2019First to Review Real tranquil space where I had a yoga class and received Reiki afterwards. Jessica is very centered and committed to a high standard with her Services. Will make this a regular self love gift. Highly recommend any service she might offer. Business owner information Jessica E. 2/4/2020 Thank you Ronnie! You're the best! I'll see you when you're back from your travels!
