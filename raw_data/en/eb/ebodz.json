It acts to relieve muscle spasms, tension, and stress. - Valerian Root (Valeriana officinalis) - used for centuries to calm upset nerves and for treating mood problems, pain and headache. Today homeopaths and herbalists use Valerian root for its antispasmodic, calmative, tranquilizing, carminative (good for upset stomach and digestion) and pain relieving effects. - Passion Flower (Passiflora incarnata) - discovered in 1569 it is primarily used as a sedative or nervine to combat excess nervousness and anxiety, to tranquilize, and to promote sleep; as an anodyne, anti-spasmodic and anti-convulsant to treat dysmenorrhea, muscle cramps, and so forth. - Magnesium - is one of the most important essential minerals to promote proper nerve function.

Passiflora seems to reduce perception of pain, and has been used for neuralgia, shingles, and general nerve pain. It is very helpful during the menopause, when falling hormone levels can make women prone to anxiety and depression. it also has antispasmodic properties, it can reduce the muscle spasms and gastric spasms hat often accompany stress.
