This must be our real contribution to the present and future development of humanity in the 21st century: to create a self-intensifying living stream between an older generation, that embodies spiritual science as a whole human creative force, which means becoming younger again, and a physically younger generation, that can experience the older as truthfully young. And if this living mutual exchange between the two kinds of young souls will begin, we can create the foundation of a living intensification of anthroposophy through time, from one generation to the next, from one decade to the coming one. Being Human 2018 Cognitive Yoga: Making Yourself a New Etheric Body and Individuality, by Yeshayahu (Jesaiah) Ben-Aharon (Forest Row: Temple Lodge, 2016) 213 pp. Review by David Adams This is a most extraordinary book\u2014probably the most extraordinary book that has been written within anthroposophy since the original work of Rudolf Steiner. Yet it is unusually challenging to write a concise review of it that does justice to its diverse, groundbreaking, and intimately experiential treasures. Aside from the sheer volume of significant spiritual content, this is because it is so densely written, with a nearly unrelenting content of descriptions and char- acterizations of mostly unfamiliar spiritual experiences, exercises, processes, and meetings. To be properly grasped, it should really be worked with meditatively\u2014 and probably read in shorter segments rather than all at once. Yet there is also a grand, metamorphosing flow and building culmination to the book as a whole. A free human being is a conscious human being, whose actions stream from an artistic understanding and artistic experience of life. To set the human being on his individual path to freedom, Waldorf education aims at providing the environment that enables the student to grasp his own freedom, by harmonizing his thought life and his actions. This harmonization is the ultimate and archetypal artistic experience, the experience of imparting meaning to one's life. Eurythmy is a complete embodiment by the human being of moving, living freedom. As the artist mediates his art from a source outside of himself, through his soul, back out into the world, eurythmy transforms the etheric laws of life which enables conscious thinking, through the heart-space, by movements of the will-imbued limbs of the human body. If the human being is fully human, that is to say, free, when he transforms an outer given, through his soul faculties, back out into a social, meaning-filled action, eurythmy is the most conscious artistic rendition of this process. As the consciousness enabling power of thought begins to develop itself in each human being after puberty, what role does eurythmy play in the freedom-orientated Waldorf High School education? M.A. Thesis 1988 CREATIVITY, A SOMATIC AND MYSTICAL PERSPECTIVE This thesis is an exploration of the concept of Mandala Theatre, as a tool for integration of the many aspects of personality and the Being on the path to wholeness. Embodiment of spirit is a major theme, emphasizing spirit as immanent (as well as transcendent), incarnate as body and feelings. The author journeys through her own psyche and experiences and delineates the creative process, phenomenologically and artistically, developing a model of transformation that can be explored by others as well as herself. Integral to this study, is the investigation of (1) the internal experiential use of energy as it relates to change and creation, (2) ritual, as a technology of the sacred, and (3) empowerment and embodiment through the creative use of body/feeling related expressive therapies. The author has related this study to many diverse fields, such as theater arts, psychology, modern psychics, mystical theology and philosophy. She is also an artist whose creative avenues include performance art, pottery, poetry and painting. A major tenant in her theory of creativity is a Jungian concept called \"holding the tension of opposites.\" She draws heavily from the archetypal psychology of Carl Jung, as well as James Hillman, and Marion Woodman. Focusing, a technique discovered by Eugene Gendlin from the University of Chicago, is examined as a primary tool for growth and spiritual insight. Her perspective is in close alignment with the creation centered spirituality of theologian and educator, Mathew Fox. Ultimately she purports a kind of sensual mysticism and a model of the creative process that she shows is a necessary paradigm shift for the healing of ourselves and the planet. She takes the reader on a journey, which if truly felt, would certainly aid in the restoration of compassion and justice, so needed in our world today. The academic study of anthroposophy is a nascent field of research. This article presents an overview of the core features of Rudolf Steiner's conception of meditation and spirituality based on an analysis of Steiner's work. The main aim of this form of meditation is to connect divinity and nature through the human being. This aim is realized through a three-step process of freedom, surrender, and unification. First the human being liberates itself from its dependence on material conditions, then it surrenders and connects with a greater reality beyond it, and finally it brings back the knowledge and capacities gained through the meditative practice to help inform scientific inquiry and to reshape the world. The emphasis on thought, nature, strengthening the self, and sociocultural renewal sets Steiner's conception of meditation apart from other contemplative traditions and current conceptions of meditation, which tend to have a different and even opposite focus. Hence the study of Steiner's conception of meditation provides a novel perspective on the significance of meditation and spiritual practice that challenges how meditation is conceived both traditionally and in contemporary culture and research. Starlight: Journal of the Sophia Foundation, Vol. 15 No. 1 2015 This third article in the series Towards Building a Community of Grail Knights, which will be supplemented by two more articles on the subject of the Ancient Priestly Wisdom, will focus further, from a different perspective, on balancing the Male and Female wisdom we have addressed in the first two articles in this series. In the present article we will begin to examine the origin of our present culture's orientation toward masculine forms of government in what has been called the Ancient Priestly Wisdom. We identify independence, hierarchy and secrecy as the operative principles of that wisdom, which principles continue into our time. Taking up, in this paper, an examination of the first principle: independence, we seek for a remedy in collaboration, employing the esoteric implements of the Grail Cup and the Spear of Destiny in the manner of the New Grail Mysteries. A historical consideration of Rudolf Steiner's statements ca. 1905 about the \"Wirbelbewegung\" - the vortex as movement and fundamental motif of the Cosmos. The New Experience of the Supersensible 2008 Since my Christ experience, I looked up with outmost devotion and veneration to St Paul, the Saint Patron and (through Rudolf Steiner's supersensible stream of life) presently irreplaceable source of spiritual inspiration in all matters related to the modern Etheric Christ Experience. I therefore demonstrated, albeit in a strongly condensed manner, how I used this inspiration in my spiritual research, in the 2nd chapter of my basic book, The New Experience of the Supersensible, to which I gave the title: St Paul at the Gates of Damascus Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
