Interchangeability oCOVID -19 vaccines are not interchangeable. oThe same mRNA vaccine product should be used for all doses of the primary series. oIn exceptional situations in which the mRNA vaccine product administered for a previous dose(s) of the primary series cannot be determined or is not available, either age -appropriate available mRNA COVID -19 vaccine product may be administered at a minimum interval of 28 days between doses to complete the mRNA COVID -19 primary vaccination series.Children W ho Turn from Age 4 to 5 Years Between Any Dose in the Pfizer Primary Series 29 ACIP Meeting 6/18/22 -Dr. Hall presentation Co-administration 30COVID -19 vaccines may be co -administered with other vaccines on the same day. Important to catch -up on routine immunizations. Always check if a patient is up -to-date and, if not, offer catch -up vaccines. Integrating COVID -19 vaccination with routine vaccination: Follow best practices to avoid administration errors. See linked resources below. Use the 15 -minute observation after COVID -19 vaccination (30 minutes, if at higher risk for anaphylaxis) to encourage families to participate in V-safe, and complete health screening questionnaires and counseling.

It's coming! We don't know when we can order it, likely sometime after the ACIP meeting this week. They are repurposing the Moderna \"booster -only\" vials for this age group because the concentration is the same as a booster dose. This means the vials will initially arrive mislabeled because they were already manufactured! These vials will have a blue cap and purple border. The appropriately labeled vials will have a blue cap and teal border -but we don't know when/if these are coming! What about Moderna 12-to-17? Moderna 12-to-17will use the same vials that have in inventory . 36Moderna 6-to-11Vial Presentation Blue capand purple border Mislabeled -says booster dose only 5 doses per vial 0.5mL injection volume Same storage conditions as the other Moderna products -50C to -15C for long -term storage 2C to 8C for up to 30 days in the fridge Letter explaining the mislabeling 37 Links to EUA Fact Sheets and Healthcare Provider Letter Moderna Infant/Toddler 6 months -5 years Provider fact sheet Recipient/caregiver factsheet Pfizer Infant/Toddler 6 months -4 years Provider fact sheet Recipient/caregiver fact sheet Letter to explain mislabeling Moderna 6 years -11 years Provider fact sheet Recipient/caregiver fact sheet Letter to explain mislabeling 38Vaccine Management Daniel Conway, CDPH 39Help Desk Chat Virtual Assistant -Launched June 17th! 40The Help Desk Chat launched a Virtual Assistant for My Turn Clinic and Public as well as myCAvax on June 17th.
