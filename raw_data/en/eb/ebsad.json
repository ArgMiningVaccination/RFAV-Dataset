Self-evolution is a life-long journey that takes courage, bravery, commitment, and intentionality in order to bring more vitality, abundance, and joy to life. Emily enjoys providing space in which to explore ways we can come back to our TRUE essence and nature, therefore undoing much of our lifelong conditioning. Emily's approach has been described as direct and upfront while balanced with compassion and empathy for her clients. She utilizes a holistic approach to therapy (teaching how mind, body, and spirit are all connected) that also considers the impact of the systems in which an individual has developed and continues to function in. Emily focuses greatly on mind-body connection with the conviction that much of our healing is accessed in and through the body. Emily has been working professionally in mental health since 2010. She has a wide range of experience in working with children, adolescents, groups, adults, and families. Emily's modalities and training include person-centered therapy, gestalt therapy, attachment therapy, CBT+, Trauma focused-CBT, Child-Parent Psychotherapy, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Energy Psychology, and Integrative health. She is looking forward to partnering with you on your healing journey.
