Although the scale was designed for completionafter an unstructured clinical interview, there are nowsemi-structured interview guides available. The HDRSwas originally developed for hospital inpatients, thus theemphasis on melancholic and physical symptoms ofdepression. A later 21-item version (HDRS 21) included 4 items intended to subtype the depression, but which aresometimes, incorrectly, used to rate severity. A limitationof the HDRS is that atypical symptoms of depression(e.g., hypersomnia, hyperphagia) are not assessed (seeSIGH-SAD, page 55). Scoring Method for scoring varies by version. For the HDRS17, a score of 0-7 is generally accepted to be within the normalrange (or in clinical remission), while a score of 20 or higher (indicating at least moderate severity) is usuallyrequired for entry into a clinical trial. Versions The scale has been translated into a number of languagesincluding French, German, Italian, Thai, and Turkish. Aswell, there is an Interactive Voice Response version (IVR),a Seasonal Affective Disorder version (SIGH-SAD, seepage 55), and a Structured Interview Version (HDS-SIV).Numerous versions with varying lengths include theHDRS17, HDRS21, HDRS29, HDRS8, HDRS6,HDRS24, and HDRS7 (see page 30).
