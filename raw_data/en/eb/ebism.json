The steady rise in demand for these drugs serves as evidence of this.This is demonstrated by the steadily increasing traffic in these medications. Frustrating side effects and modern treatments' lack of therapeutic value are two common causes of this tilt.In contrast to a modern medical system, earlier systems heavily rely on herbal remedies (allopathic). The current study evaluates the general public's familiarity and knowledge of conventional (Ayurvedic, Allopathic, Homeopathic, and natural medicines), as well as their overall preference for the system and their choice for the system in the event of a medical emergency or common sickness.Their perspectives of the pharmacist's roles in encouraging the usage of these drugs are also evaluated by the study. The survey form's 100 responses are shown by bars. local residents. Semistructured face -to-face administered surveys were used to acquire the data. 100 people in all were questioned. Depending on the type of response, the responses ( 100 total) on the questionnaire page have been displayed as bar charts, pie charts, etc. I. INTRODUCTION: There is a global \"herbal renaissance\" taking place as herbs make a comeback. In contrast to synthetics, which are viewed as being hazardous to both humans and the environment, herbal products today stand for safety (1-3). Although herbs have been valued for their therapeutic, flavouring, and aromatic properties for millennia, the modern era's synthetic products temporarily overshadowed their significance. The mindless reliance on synthetics has ended, though, and people are going back to natural products in the hopes of finding safety and security(4 -5). For their health, more than 75 percent of the world's population mostly uses plants and plant extracts. The global market for pharmaceuticals made from plants is thought to be worth roughly Rs. 2,000 billion(6) . Indian contributions currently total less than 2000 crores of rupees. Raw drug exports from India increased by 26% to Rs. 165 crores in 1994 - 95 from Rs. 130 crores in 1991 -92(7-9). The annual production of raw materials from aromatic and medicinal plants is estimated to be worth 200 crores of rupees(10) . This is anticipated to reach $1150 USD by the year 2000 and $5 trillion USD by the year 2050 (11). Almos t 80,000 of the 2, 50,000 higher plant species that exist on Earth are used medicinally (12). India, home to more than 45000 different plant species, is one of the world's 12 biodiversity hotspots(13 ). With 16 different agro-climatic zones, 10 different veg etation zones, 25 biotic provinces, and 426 different biomes, India has an unrivalled diversity (habitats of specific species). Between 15 000 - 20 000 of these plants have considerable therapeutic value. Yet, traditional communities only use 7000 -7500 speci es for their therapeutic benefits. Herbal remedies have long been a part of traditional medical practises in India, including Unani and Ayurveda. Over 700 species are used in the Ayurvedic system of medicine, along with 700 in Unani, 600 in Siddha, 600 in Amchi, and 30 in modern medicine(14 -15). In Ayurveda, some 8,000 herbal treatments have been standardised. The Atharvaveda (4500 -2500 BC) recorded 290 species, the Charak Samhita (700 BC), and the Sushrut Samhita (200 BC) described properties and uses of 11 00 and 1270 species, respectively, in compounding drugs. These are still used in the traditional formulations in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. The Rigveda (5000 BC) recorded 67 medicinal plants(16) . Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy, and Naturo pathy are some of the legally acknowledged alternative medical systems that have been International Journal of Pharmaceutical Research and Applications Volume 8, Issue 2 Mar ISO 9001: 2008 Certified Journal Page 1052 practised in India for a very long time in a safe and continuous manner. These practises have legitimately coexisted with allopathy, and thus do not belong in the \"world of obscurity,\" as Venkat Subramanian claimed (17). The almost 500,000 non - allopathic practitioners are certified by the official councils that oversee professionalism and received their training at one of the medical colleges in their respective systems of m edicine (>400). These Systems Are Neither Folklore Or Classical Herbal Practices, thus. These systems' fundamental tenets provide a logical and systematic framework for pathogenesis and diagnosis that also determines therapeutic approach(18). Information of ayurvedic medicine : Ayurvedic Ayurveda, which translates to \"the science of life,\" originated on the Indian subcontinent in the 12th century BC. Ayurveda is a way of life rather than just a medical system. Its goal is to achieve physical, mental, social , and spiritual well - being through the use of preventative and promotional measures as well as holistic disease treatment(19). Form of ayurvedic medicine O Kadha O Avaleha Diagram of Ayurvedic medicine Allopathic Medicine: In contrast to the use of alternative medical or non -conventional therapies, some medical dictionaries define the term allopathy or allopathic medicine as the treatment of disease using traditional, evidence -based medical therapy (20,21). The term's origins in a contentious 19th-century discussion between homoeopathic practitioners and those they mockingly referred to as \"allopaths\" can be traced to its current connotation and controversy(22). Benefits of allopathic care include: Accessing the most effective medical care and receiving treatment from highly qualified and accredited specialists using highly developed diagnostic tools and treatments that have been extensively examined and tested access to clinics and treatment facilities in mo st towns and cities large -scale funding for novel medications and therapies. Fig 1. 2 - Diagram of Allopathic medicine Homeopathic medicine: Homeopathy is the most well -established complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to have emerged in Europe, although being much less ancient than Chinese or Indian medicine(23). . Hahnemann had no interest in conventional diagnosis or treatment, nor did he show any interest in detailed pathology. He solely cared about the homoeopathic principles, which he applied to naming the condition(24). Home remedies Home remedies are used to treat common problems with natural items found around the house. It is customary to employ foods from the kitchen, such as spices, fruits, and vegetables, as the active ingredients. Many of the treatments have been around for year s and years of history, which may have evolved through a procedure of trial and error.
