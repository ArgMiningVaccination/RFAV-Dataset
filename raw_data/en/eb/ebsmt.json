However, the sheer size and complexity of the system, as well as the pressures it faces from an ageing population and nite resources, mean that making improvements to health and care can be a signicant challenge. Successful transformation must take into account the needs of all patients, carers, healthcare professionals and other sta. It requires consistent consideration of every element of the system, the way each element interacts, and the implications of these interactions for the system as a whole - that is, it requires a 'systems' approach. Clinical leaders are increasingly exploring and recognising successes by using a range of evidence based approaches to work on design and improvement, including systems techniques. This work is leading to improved pathways, processes and patient experience. However, such approaches are not yet consistently dened or applied throughout health and care design and improvement. Engineering is a sector where systems thinking is routinely applied to understand, design, deliver, and sustain systems ranging from the development of worldwide telecommunications networks to the latest Boeing 787 Dreamliner. As a pioneer of minimally invasive surgery, I personally have always been an advocate of an interdisciplinary approach between engineering and healthcare sectors and this project has provided an excellent opportunity for mutual learning. It has led to the development of a rigorous yet workable framework for the application of systems thinking in the unique context of health and care. I fully endorse the recommendation that healthcare leaders and transformation teams consider the questions and tools laid out here to support a more consistent application of a systems approach to health and care design and improvement. With this work we hope to deliver benets for patients, carers, and sta, and showcase the value in cross-sectoral working. Rt Hon Professor Lord Darzi of Denham OM PC KBE HonFREng FRS FMedSci August 2017 8 Royal Academy of Engineering Executive summary The challenges facing the health and social care system are considerable - with competing pressures from an ageing population, increasing numbers of patients with multiple morbidities, new technologies, and the need for increasing eciencies. The complexity of the system, along with the multiple pressures it faces, mean that eorts to improve it often achieve only limited benets and can have unforeseen consequences. Over the past two decades, there have been numerous calls to implement a more holistic systems approach to transform health and care to address the needs of a changing patient population. However, there has been no clear denition of what this might mean in practice. Engineers routinely use a systems approach to address challenging problems in complex projects. This allows them to work through the implications of each change or decision they make for the project as a whole. They consider the layout of the system, dening all the elements and interconnections, to ensure that the whole system performs as required. One example is the successful delivery of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Physical infrastructure and practical organisation were brought together, with innovative physical engineering, modelling and simulation of people flows, early testing of venues, and extensive risk management. A systems approach, combined with tried and tested engineering methods and tools, delivered real success on a massive scale. \"Systems that work do not just happen \u2014 they have to be planned, designed and built\" 1 This report was co-produced with engineers, clinicians, and healthcare leaders, to explore how an engineering approach could be applied in health and social care to develop systems that meet the needs of patients, carers and NHS sta. It presents a new framework to support ongoing work in service design and improvement in health and care. All health and care improvement initiatives involve people, processes, technologies, the physical environment and systems that, in turn, are part of other systems. For example, the care pathway of an elderly frail patient must meet the needs of the patient, their immediate carer and wider family. Care must also coordinate across community support, a GP practice and hospital teams, and manage the patient's medication, their physical journey to and around healthcare facilities, home care technologies and associated health and care data. Such complexity means that health and care will benet from using an approach that considers each relevant element of the system and, critically, the nature and performance of the interfaces between them. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 9Executive summary Comparing current health and care improvement processes with engineering systems approaches, we found that: There is the potential for health and care improvement to benet from the rigour of the engineering approach to systems, particularly with respect to: -systems being centred on people - an eective systems approach is centred on people, their needs, their capabilities and ultimately their role in understanding, designing, delivering and maintaining success -iteration before implementation - the behaviour of complex systems is not easily understood and improvement is most often the result of successive iterations targeted at maximising the chance of success prior to implementation -design as an exploratory process - improvement results from a creative process that seeks not only to explore the real need, but also to evaluate a range of possible solutions in order to select the best option -risk management as a proactive process - the identication of possible opportunities for and threats to a system before they arise is more likely to lead to the delivery of robust and adaptable systems. While islands of excellence exist in the use of a systems approach in healthcare, the common sense thinking presented here is still far from being common in practice. A systems approach can be dened and applied in a health and care context as a series of questions that integrate people, systems, design and risk perspectives in an ordered and well executed manner. It is only when all four are robustly understood and considered that a systems approach will have the greatest success. These ndings from this collaborative project have been integrated into a framework that can support the work of transformation teams and individuals. These tools can help facilitate the methodical application of a systems approach to improvement, dealing with complexity and improving performance. This approach can be applied to systems across all scales in the healthcare system, from service level improvement, through to organisational, cross-organisational, or cross-sector level change. In summary, we found that more widespread application of a rigorous systems approach to health and care improvement, has the potential to have a transformative eect on health and care, with benets for patients, service users, and providers. We encourage transformation teams to test out the framework, and invite more partners to join us in the next phase, trialling and implementing this approach and augmenting what we have proposed. 1 Creating systems that work: Principles of engineering systems for the 21st century , Royal Academy of Engineering, 2007. 10 Royal Academy of Engineering Introduction The challenges and pressures facing the health and social care system are considerable and the complexity of the system makes improvement challenging. In recent years there have been numerous calls for the use of a 'systems' approach in eorts to transform health and care. 2,3,4 However, there has been a lack of a clear denition of what this might mean in a health context. The work undertaken through this project aimed to dene and describe the engineering systems approach and explore, in partnership with healthcare leaders, whether such an approach could be applied in health and care. While healthcare professionals know intuitively that there is a need to involve stakeholders in decisions and think across pathways, and many people working to improve health and care are aware of and use systems techniques, lessons could be learned from the dierent perspectives of the engineering sector and the analysis and rigour applied in engineering systems. Our project ndings are based on an extended conversation within a unique forum of experts, led by the Royal Academy of Engineering, in collaboration with the Royal College of Physicians and the Academy of Medical Sciences. We brought together systems engineers, health and care professionals, quality improvement experts, and patient representatives (see About the project , page 87 for details) to dene a systems approach for health and care, and develop a new and integrated approach to service design and improvement. This preliminary report outlines the ndings from this work, providing a clear denition of a systems approach, setting out a framework and tools for its implementation in health and care, and presenting case studies exemplifying the importance of such an approach for health and care improvement. It is aimed at Engineers use a systems approach to address challenging problems in complex projects such as the Channel Tunnel Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 11 Introduction stimulating conversations with funders, healthcare provider leaders, teams and individuals delivering quality improvement and service design. Its ideas and tools can be used for improvement by everyone in health and care roles in all professions, clinical and non-clinical, from the smallest local teams to the largest national organisations. This way of thinking is particularly powerful when dealing with complex changes across multiple organisations. Table 1 signposts sections of the report that may be particularly helpful for dierent readers. Following our initial exploration, we invite more partners to join us in the next phase to test the contents of this report in the eld and to build evidence for and augment what we have proposed. We are continuing discussions with project partners, workshop participants, funders and government on how to best test, and subsequently embed, our ideas into current drives to improve quality and transform health and care. We will seek to publish case studies of this work as it is tested and developed. 2 Building a better delivery system: A new engineering/health care partnership , National Academy of Engineering and Institute of Medicine, 2005. 3 Learning from Bristol, The Bristol Royal Inrmary Inquiry , Report of the Public Inquiry, 2001. 4 Design for patient safety, A system-wide design-led approach to tackling patient safety in the NHS , Department of Health and Design Council, 2003.

This is because of inadequate planning, a lack of system-wide design and poor implementation, resulting in a disjointed service. The alternative, the result of taking a systems approach founded on an understanding of people, systems, design and risk, could be so dierent: After a fall Mrs G, a frail 80-year-old who lives alone, calls an ambulance and paramedics transfer her to hospital. She tells them she has diabetes, pulmonary disease, heart failure and kidney problems. The A&E sta are not suciently condent to send her home because they cannot establish the cause of her falls, access her GP record of treatment or enable extra support or assessment in her home for the next morning. Mrs G is therefore admitted and it takes days for the hospital to investigate the reasons for her fall. After lying in bed for this time she loses all condence to move unaided. Transfer to an intermediate care facility is advised and four days later she is moved, still not condent to get out of bed alone. Mrs G is worried she will end up in a nursing home and so are her family who live far away. All improvement initiatives involve people, processes, technologies and systems that, in turn, are part of other systems. This complexity means that all parts of the health and care system stand to benet from using an approach which considers each relevant element of the overall system and joins them up eciently. As an example, consider the case of Mrs G: What does Esther need? The Esther model is guided by questions such as 'What does Esther need?' and 'What is important to her when she is not well?' to drive continuous improvement See case study 1, page 52, and Annex 1: Applications of the approach Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 15 Healthcare as a 'system of systems' In the revised scenario, Mrs G lives in an area where frailty has been identied as a priority issue. Putting system-wide strategies and partnerships in place to improve the quality of care, based on the known needs of local people and using available teams, means Mrs G's care works smoothly across the interfaces between dierent systems of care. Healthcare is indeed a system of systems and optimising how it works saves money. In this scenario ambulance waiting times are reduced, hospital costs are avoided and patient flow improves because more people have the expertise and authority to contribute to Mrs G's care. She is safer because her care plan is seen by more health and care professionals and she has a better patient experience. The participants of the programme leading to this report recommend that the situation described in the revised scenario would most eectively be achieved using a systems approach to design and improvement. After a fall Mrs G, a frail 80-year-old who lives alone, calls a number given to her by her community support group. A community nurse attends, checks Mrs G's blood sugar level as she seems confused, and makes her something to eat. The nurse checks the care plan with the community-based team and rings Mrs G's daughter to update her on the situation. Next day a speciality frailty nurse calls at Mrs G's home to reassess her abilities, as this was her second fall in two weeks. The nurse arranges extra short term care and discusses with Mrs G the possibility of moving into assisted living. The nurse arranges for her to visit a nearby facility with her daughter, updates her care plan and shares it with the GP and multi-professional team at the hospital. Mrs G is happy with the outcome and her family are reassured that plans are in place to deal with any future problems. Improving safety A solution was co-designed with patients, GPs, pharmacies the pharmaceutical industry and engineers to reduce the risk of death from methotrexate overdose See case study 2, page 53, and Annex 1: Applications of the approach 16 Royal Academy of Engineering Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 17 Approaches to improvement Section 2 Approaches to improvement 18 Royal Academy of Engineering Improvement teams in health and care already have a range of theories of change and improvement approaches available: the NHS change model, IHI model for improvement, leading large scale change, human factors in healthcare, lean in healthcare, experience-based co-design, root cause analysis, to name a few. While a number of these approaches already include tools, such as Failure Modes and Eect Analysis (FMEA) and mapping techniques, that may be found in engineering methods the systems approach proposed in this report has the potential to add further value to the improvement agenda in two distinct forms. The provision of new tools and ways of thinking can supplement existing approaches; and the adoption of a systems approach as a method in its own right can guide a design from a set of complex needs through to validated, eective operational systems (Figure 1). Figure 1: A systems approach to health and care improvement Improvement tools, such as the IHI model for improvement, the NHS house of quality and driver diagrams can complement the activities of a systems approach that in turn can add new tools and ways of thinking to existing improvement approaches. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 19 Approaches to improvement New ways of thinking include designing for ease of access. As we live longer, we are more commonly living with cognitive and/or physical conditions that restrict our access to services. Consider the arthritis suerer struggling with a child-proof cap, or the dementia suerer regarded as a 'Did Not Attend' because she forgot her appointment. Inclusive design , the design of mainstream products and/or services that are accessible to and usable by people with the widest range of abilities within the widest range of situations, is embedded within the systems approach. It uses a suite of tools to help answer two important questions: what proportion of our service users can easily access the service we oer; and how do we systematically design for maximum user accessibility? While other approaches proceed with the user in mind - for example, human-centered design immerses the patient or service user in the design process - none systematically ensure that we design with the whole population in mind, both as patients and providers. There are other key areas in which new ways of thinking, derived from a systems approach, can supplement existing methods. This includes, measuring and designing system interfaces to alleviate service integration issues and using systems safety assessment to proactively design risk out of systems and avoid incidents rather than merely reactively preventing a recurrence. In such cases, existing improvement approaches may be enhanced by using techniques from a systems approach. The systems approach is also a method in its own right that applies tools to answer a series of questions (Section 5: A framework for action , page 33) in an iterative and systematic way in order to guide a design from a set of complex needs through to validated, eective operational systems. During this process, experienced improvers can use their own tools, frameworks and experiences of change to supplement those drawn from the systems community. Whether it is in enhancing existing approaches through additional tools and techniques, or encouraging improvements to be guided by a series of critical questions, a systems approach can greatly enhance the capability and potency of professionals delivering change. There are a number of approaches from the health and care improvement and engineering communities that have the potential to help teams understand people , deliver systems , facilitate design and manage risk (Annex 4: Compilation of approaches , page 79). Most excel with one of these perspectives while some attempt to support a more holistic integrated systems approach. Table 2 maps their strengths in delivering a systems approach. The approaches range from health and care improvement methods and tools to design-led safety management and human factors methods. It is evident from Table 2 that engineering approaches provide more complete coverage of a systems approach, particularly in terms of design and risk , than current healthcare approaches. Further details of all the methods and tools are given in Annex 4: Compilation of approaches , page 79. The interplay between a systems approach and current improvement approaches is explored in more detail in Section 5: A framework for action , page 33.

Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 21 Approaches to improvement To a certain extent, this report describes what might be thought as common sense. However, common sense is not always as common as might be imagined. What is new is the development of a framework and language suited to health and care processes. We explored the elements that make up a systems approach and asked health and care professionals who are active in delivering change to identify which of these elements are missing or not strong enough in current health and care practice. We can summarise our shared learning as: 1 Systems are centred on people -an eective systems approach is centred on people, their needs, their capabilities and ultimately their role in understanding, designing, delivering and maintaining success. 2 Iteration before implementation - the behaviour of complex systems is not easily understood and improvement is most often the result of successive iterations targeted at maximising the chance of success prior to implementation. 3 Design is an exploratory process - improvement results from a creative process that seeks not only to explore the real need, but also to evaluate a range of possible solutions in order to select the best option. 4 Risk management is a proactive process - the identication of possible opportunities for and threats to a system before they arise is more likely to lead to the delivery of robust and adaptable systems. 5 Thinking changes practice, process helps - individual perspectives give rise to changes in thinking that can immediately permeate current practice; a new process is an opportunity to deploy new thinking. 6 Common sense is not common - there is an increasing number of islands of excellence when it comes to using a systems approach; however, the common sense thinking presented here is still far from being common in practice. Predicting outcomes Modelling and simulation informed the required patient- flows and resourcing levels in a London trauma centre, reducing waiting times and improving care See case study 8, page 59 22 Royal Academy of Engineering Section 3 Dening a systems approach Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 23 Dening a systems approach 24 Royal Academy of Engineering A true systems approach is one that consistently delivers a high-quality service and is most likely to be the result of a team successfully integrating people, systems, design and risk perspectives in an ordered and well executed manner. A system (or system of systems) is a set of elements: people, processes, information, organisations and services, as well as software, hardware and other systems that, when combined, have qualities that are not present in any of the elements themselves. A system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose, and expressed in its functioning. In other words, the whole is very likely to be greater than the sum of the parts. For example, the human body is a system of systems where each has its own purpose and function. When combined, the systems produce for the body qualities not present in any of the individual elements. Conversely, if any individual system is compromised or a part of the body is damaged, the overall function may be signicantly or terminally impaired (Figure 2). A systems approach uses a range of techniques to determine requirements for the system, organise its structure, create and evaluate alternative designs, produce quantitative analyses and predictions where appropriate, assess possible threats to and opportunities for people and other systems, integrate all the individual elements and deliver a system that is shown to be t for its intended purpose. A true systems approach does not deliver solely technical solutions; rather it ensures the appropriate alignment of technology, processes, interactions and policy to deliver innovative responses to today's most complex and pressing challenges. A systems approach can be applied to the design and improvement of systems across many areas of health and care. This is illustrated by the inclusion of references to case-studies throughout the report. circulatory system digestive system nervous system integumetary system muscular system skeletal system respiratory system Figure 2: A system of systems \u2014 dierent perspectives on the human body The human body is a system of systems, comprising amongst others the circulatory, digestive, nervous, integumentary, muscular, skeletal and respiratory systems. Each has its own purpose and function and yet when combined, they produce for the body qualities not present in any of the individual elements. Empowering patients Clinical support services in imaging, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics and speech and language therapy are coordinated through inpatient schedules See case study 11, page 62 Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 25 Dening a systems approach A systems approach can be applied to the design and improvement of systems at all extremes of scale, with service level improvement taking place within a wider context that may subsequently require changes at the organisation level and cross-organisational level. Within the delivery of health and care, many systems are distinct and can be operated independently, yet are also connected to or integrated with other systems, either in layers or as part of a network. The strength of a systems approach is its ability to overcome the complexity associated with such systems of systems and deliver solutions at all levels of scale regardless of the form of the system. Its value has been recognised in health and care and increasingly referred to in national policies and used in improvement methods. A systems approach aims to determine the system design and implementation that delivers the best service. It has the potential to drive greater eciency and a better understanding of threats and opportunities present when shaping the delivery of health and care services. A systems approach brings together four key and complementary perspectives (Figure 3): People: understanding of interactions among people, at the personal, group and organisational levels, and other elements of a system in order to improve overall system performance (identify, locate, situate) Systems:addressing complex and uncertain real world problems, involving highly interconnected technical and social elements that typically produce emergent properties and behaviour (understand, organise, integrate) Design: focusing on improvement by identifying the right problem to solve, creating a range of possible solutions and rening the best of these to deliver appropriate outcomes (explore, create, evaluate) Risk:managing risk, based on the timely identication of threats and opportunities in the system, assessment of their associated risks and management of necessary change (examine, assess, improve). Figure 3: Perspectives of a systems approach A systems approach as the sum of people, systems, design and risk perspectives. A holistic approach Seeing a visit to the Emirates stadium as one part of a wider 'system of systems' helps create a successful match day experience for Arsenal fans See case study 6, page 57 26 Royal Academy of Engineering All these perspectives are inextricably linked and uniquely contribute to a systems approach. It is only when all four are robustly understood (Annex 3: Elements of a systems approach , page 65). that a systems approach will have the greatest success. Their scope, purpose and operation can be summarised through the answers to a number of high-level questions (Table 3) that were developed and agreed during the project workshops ( About the project , page 87). These are listed according to their particular perspective and with reference to a number of case studies (Annex 2: Case studies , page 51) that highlight their application in practice. The challenge is to convert these questions into a useful, versatile and systematic process that repeatedly delivers results. Each of the four perspectives of people, systems, design and risk can be seen as individual components within an improvement process and there is merit in emphasising their particular individual characteristics when striving for improvement. Strategies for implementing a systems approach range from the adoption of individual people, systems, design and risk perspectives within existing improvement processes, to the design of new processes that provide an appropriate framework for combining all the perspectives. People: Who will use the system? \u2014 leads to an understanding of the diversity of people involved and their needs and capabilities (identify). Where is the system? \u2014 leads to an understanding of the physical, organisational and cultural context of the system (locate). What aects the system? \u2014 leads to an understanding of the political and policy landscape within which the system is situated (situate). Systems: Who are the stakeholders? \u2014 leads to a common view of the stakeholders and their individual interests, needs, values and perspectives (understand). What are the elements? \u2014 leads to an agreed system boundary, architecture and details of the interfaces between all the system elements (organise). How does the system perform? \u2014 leads to a complete, operational system that is proven to meet the stakeholder requirements (integrate). Table 3: Key questions that summarise an eective systems approach Design: What are the needs? \u2014 leads to a common understanding of the needs for a system, taking account of the full range of stakeholders (explore). How can the needs be met? \u2014 leads to a range of possible solutions that would help meet the needs identied by the explore phase (create). How well are the needs met? \u2014 leads to an evaluation of possible concepts that could meet the needs identied by the explore phase (evaluate). Risk: What is going on? \u2014 leads to an understanding of the system architecture and details of the interfaces between the elements (examine). What could go wrong? \u2014 leads to a systematic assessment of the likelihood and potential impact of threats and opportunities in the system (assess). How can we make it better? \u2014 leads to a range of possible solutions that would help mitigate the threats or exploit the opportunities (improve). Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 27 Dening a systems approach Improvement initiatives involve people and systems that, in turn, are inevitably part of other systems. Consequently, they would all stand to benet from using a systems approach that delivers coordinated improvement to all the systems. All improvement initiatives should start with the question: why are we doing this? \u2014 leads to a documented rationale for improving an existing system or developing a new one (trigger). The trigger The trigger denes the entry point for any subsequent improvement process and may be the result of: strategic development: where risk reduction and improvement is part of an ongoing strategic initiative an incident: where an event has resulted in actual or potential harm to patients or clinicians local concerns: where the potential for incidents has been identied through general observation or evidenced by data trends routine service review: where a team or individual wishes to check the integrity of their service service improvement: where national, regional or local changes are planned to an existing service or system new service: where a new service is to be introduced into practice or an existing one decommissioned technology introduction: where new equipment or technology is to be introduced to an existing service building or estate changes: where estates or buildings are being built, refurbished or maintained sta changes: where new sta are to be introduced to an existing service or exiting sta levels are changed external directive: where specic strategic changes or checks are requested national initiatives: where teams are encouraged to propose and deliver service improvements . A clear understanding of the trigger helps to identify the initial scope of the improvement and ensures that an appropriate team is assembled to initiate any subsequent improvement process. Whether the trigger relates to people, systems, design or risk, a systems approach will consider all of these perspectives in a seamless and integrated way. This leads onto a nal ongoing challenge: what should we do next? \u2014 leads to the ongoing development and execution of a plan of action to deliver the system in a timely manner (plan). System failure How limited understanding of whole system performance and emergent behaviours led to the collapse of a computerised command and control system See case study 5, page 56 28 Royal Academy of Engineering Section 4 A framework for thinking Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 29 A framework for thinking 30 Royal Academy of Engineering situateidentify locateintegrateunderstand organise evaluateexplore create improveexamine assessA true systems approach is one that consistently delivers a high-quality service and this is most likely to be the result from a team successfully integrating people, systems, design and risk in an ordered and well-executed manner. As with a juggler (Figure 4), dropping any particular ball would compromise the integrity of their performance, in the same way that ignoring any particular perspective might compromise the performance of a system. Adopting one or more of the four perspectives (Annex 3: Elements of a systems approach , page 65) into current practice can be done by simply asking ourselves the appropriate guiding questions (Figure 5). There should be an emphasis on integrating people, systems, design and risk thinking within current improvement processes, assisted by a number of existing tools (Section 2: Approaches to improvement , page 17). Figure 4: A combined approach \u2014 keeping all the perspectives in play When juggling, the performance is only complete if all the balls remain in the air. Similarly, a systems approach is only complete if all the perspectives are kept in mind during the design or improvement of the system. Right rst time Patient and sta personas were created to increase the team's understanding of people's potential behaviour in the yet- to-be-built St. Aubyn centre See case study 4, page 55 Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 31 A framework for thinking Figure 5: An integrated approach \u2014 a framework for thinking A systems approach can be thought of as a set of activities targeted to answer questions relating to people , systems , design and risk , along with questions focused on the general process of improvement. 32 Royal Academy of Engineering Section 5 A framework for action Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 33 A framework for action 34 Royal Academy of Engineering The systems approach can also be considered as a method in its own right that applies tools to answer the key questions in an iterative and systematic way to guide a design from a set of complex needs through to validated and eective operational systems. In this context, the questions have been rationalised where the four perspectives overlap and improvement programme questions, relating to the problem, team and success , have been added: What is the problem? \u2014 leads to a common and clearly articulated view of a better system based on an understanding of the current system (problem). Who should be involved? \u2014 leads to a common and clearly articulated understanding of who should deliver the improved system (team). What does 'good' look like? \u2014 leads to a common and clearly articulated understanding of success and how it would be measured (success). Reordering then provides a natural sequence for all the questions (Figure 6): Figure 6: A systems approach as an ordered series of questions A systems approach can be thought of as an ordered and iterative set of activities targeted to answer questions relating to people, systems, design and risk , and the general process of improvement.Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 35 A framework for action The spiral model shows the natural order of the steps. It also highlights that a systems approach is not a simple linear process, but an iterative process of continuous improvement. It suggests that the rst question to be asked concerns the problem to be addressed by the system. This would be followed by questions based on people to understand the background and context to the new system. The questions on systems, design and risk are then interwoven to provide an opportunity to specify, design and evaluate the system and its constituent elements, with a question on what a good outcome would look like early in this sequence. The idea would be that in the rst 'pass' of the questions, preliminary answers would be provided. Further 'passes' would oer an opportunity to provide more detailed answers or again to 'skip' and use the previous answer for that iteration. This process aords the opportunity to progressively increase knowledge of the problem, reduce uncertainty regarding the solution, and manage the implementation risk to an acceptable level. Ultimately, the answers would form a description of the improved system. It is expected that the methods used to answer the questions would increase in complexity as each question is revisited, until further eort brings limited benet to other questions in the cycle. For example, initial answers might be based on estimates or knowledge of previous solutions, while later answers could be determined by extensive investigation, advanced modelling and simulation, or evaluation of prototypes. The spiral model allows the questions to be overlaid on an existing improvement process, at sucient intervals and to the level of precision required, while ensuring that they are asked in an appropriate order. A number of existing approaches already exist that may assist in answering the questions (Section 2: Approaches to improvement , page 17 and Annex 4: Compilation of approaches , page 79). The spiral model is also adaptable to all levels of scale, from the service level, through the organisation level to the cross-organisational level, and is suciently versatile to apply across all areas of health and care. This approach is common to all improvement processes where the focus on moving a system from its current performance to a future, measurably better state. Such processes typically include a number of key phases to ensure success (Figure 7): Understand \u2014 leading to a description of the current system (now), a common understanding of the problem, a consensus view of what the future system might look like (better) and a clearly articulated case for changing the system. Design \u2014 leading to a clear description of the future system, based on the iterative design of the system architecture with its elements and interfaces, the evaluation through successive prototyping of its likely behaviour, and a plan for its delivery. Deliver \u2014 leading to the successful deployment of the new system with the levels of measurement necessary to evidence its success, and acceptance that it achieves appropriate value for its stakeholders. Sustain \u2014 leading to the continued operational success of the new system along with consideration of further improvement potential or wider deployment. End of life care Services needed by terminally ill patients and their carers are coordinated across Airedale General Hospital by a 24/7 telehealth and phone line service See case study 10, page 61 36 Royal Academy of Engineering The purpose of the phased approach is to progressively increase the clarity of denition of the revised system while reducing the operational risk. Each of these phases can be inspired by the adoption of the individual people, systems, design and risk perspectives. Alternatively, the spiral model, which may be thought of as progressing through time and spanning all phases, can be adopted and adapted to complement the generic improvement approach (Figure 8). The early iterations of the spiral would focus on increasing understanding of the problem and, if a case for change is agreed, later iterations would provide more focus on the design and delivery of the system and its sustainability. The model also lends itself to the development of systems of systems, where early iterations of the spiral would focus on architecting the overall system, leading to parallel iterations to develop and deliver individual systems, and further iterations to ensure their integration and subsequent evaluation of the overall system. The ultimate success of the systems approach would depend on keeping all of the relevant questions in mind on each iteration. In practice, a degree of concurrency across the phases is required. The understand phase requires adequate consideration of the design, delivery and sustain phases to create a clear view of the future system, while the sustain phase depends on consideration of sustainability issues throughout the previous phases. Such concurrency, or involvement of key stakeholders throughout the improvement process, is essential if new performance targets are to be realised in a safe, timely and cost-eective manner. The sequence of questions in the spiral model not only provides an excellent starting point for delivering a successful improvement process, but also assists in addressing a number of other factors that should be considered when designing systems: Behaviour \u2014 when integrating people, processes, technology and the built environment, it is hard to predict all the behaviours that will subsequently emerge. It is important to design for intended behaviours and outcomes, observe the resultant system behaviours, identify unintended consequences and predict possible variations over time ( problem, identify, locate, organise, evaluate, assess, integrate ). Measurement \u2014 systems behave in a variety of predictable and less predictable ways in response to internal and external data and events. It is important to understand the need for measurement of a system's performance, implement the means to facilitate such measurement and determine the way in which the resulting data will be used ( success, organise, explore, create, evaluate, integrate ). Communication \u2014 dysfunctional teams are unlikely to deliver good systems; functional teams are more likely to do so. It is important that the team talks to one another, develops clear plans and instructions, ensures there is a common understanding of the system and engages with all the stakeholders, particularly the users, in the delivery of the system ( identify, locate, understand, organise, integrate, plan, team ). Learning \u2014 the ability of individuals and organisations to learn enhances their chances of delivering and sustaining eective systems. It is important to develop a culture of continued learning for all stakeholders, build capacity within organisations to deliver eective systems and share stories of success to inspire future systems-based change ( identify, locate, situate, team ). Interfaces \u2014 systems are only as good as their interfaces. Between every element of a system there are interfaces to other elements or systems. It is important to organise the elements of a system, dene and maintain the necessary interfaces between them, and dene and manage the interfaces between the system and its environment ( problem, identify, locate, organise, success, integrate ).

The adoption of a systems approach to design and improvement will transform health and care. Transformation teams and individuals charged with improving care are encouraged to ask the questions posed in this preliminary report as a rst step towards changing the way they think and act.

Safer care for patients using oral methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis \u2014 local and national stakeholders, led by the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), were engaged in making the design of methotrexate tablets and their prescription, delivery and monitoring safer for patients (see also Case study 2: Oral methotrexate ). 40 Royal Academy of Engineering Why are we doing this? Esther lived alone and one morning developed breathing diculties. After contacting her daughter, who did not know what to do, Esther sought medical advice. She saw a total of 36 dierent people and had to retell her story at every point, while having problems breathing. A doctor nally admitted her to a hospital ward. This case inspired the head of the medical department of H\u00f6glandet Hospital in N\u00e4ssj\u00f6 to initiate an extensive series of interviews and workshops to identify redundancies and gaps in the medical and community care systems. 5The Esther Model, health and care integration in J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden The answers that follow represent those that may have been formulated by the end of the programme, accepting that there was some iteration between the people, systems and design elements of the work. They are nonetheless representative of the systems approach originally applied to the challenge of improving the care for elderly persons. What is the problem? Elderly patients with complex care needs may receive services from multiple specialists, as well as primary care physicians. In addition, they may visit emergency departments, have frequent hospitalisations and post-hospital rehabilitations, and receive long-term care services at their home or in nursing facilities. 6The central idea was that care should be guided by the following questions: What does Esther need? What does she want? What is important to her when she is not well? What does she need when she leaves the hospital? Which providers must cooperate to meet Esther's needs? Who will use the system? Elderly persons who have complex care needs that involve a variety of providers, along with carers and a number of health and care professionals. Where is the system? The H\u00f6glandet (Highland) region (population: 110,000) in J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping County, in the south of Sweden, where the county has 34 primary care centres and three acute hospitals, with a total health workforce of 9,500, serving a local population of 350,000 across 11 municipalities. What aects the system? Care coordination in Sweden is complicated by a legal structure that gives the country's 21 counties responsibility for funding and providing hospital and physician services while the 290 municipalities are responsible for funding and providing community care. Home health care (nursing services for sick patients) and home care (assistance with activities of daily living) are also provided by dierent professionals. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 41 Applications of the approach Who should be involved? Patients and carers, and people involved in the supply, management and control of care for elderly people, such as physicians, nurses, social workers, other providers representing the H\u00f6glandet Hospital and physician practices in each of the six municipalities. Who are the stakeholders? Stakeholders are those that have an interest in the successful performance of the system and can be described by their role title, need(s) and purpose: As a patient I need care in or close to my home so that I can stay at home. I need to experience care from multiple providers as if it were from the same provider so that they all know my medical history. I need to have care uniformly available throughout the region so that I feel free to travel, and I need to know who to turn to when problems arise so that I feel safe. As a carer I need to understand Esther's needs so that I can help care for her, and I need to know who to call if Esther needs help so that I can be sure of talking to someone who knows her. As a neighbour I need to have a contact number for emergencies so that I can quickly summon medical assistance. As a primary care physici an I need to provide the best care possible for Esther in the community so that her medical needs are met locally as far as is possible. I need access to Esther's full medical history so that I know what treatment may have been provided by the hospital and what level of social care is being provided. As a pharmacist I need access to Esther's medical history so that I can check that her medications are safe to be taken together. As a hospital physician I need access to Esther's medical history so that I can prescribe the most appropriate treatment, and I need to be sure that appropriate care is available so that I can safely discharge Esther from hospital. As a specialist I need access to Esther's medical history so that I can provide appropriate specialist treatment as required. As a nurse I need access to Esther's medical history so that I can care for her, and I need to know Esther so that I can do what is best for her. As a home healthcare worker I need access to Esther's medical history so that I understand her care needs, and I need to know Esther so that I can do what is best for her. As a home care worker I need to have a contact number for emergencies so that I can be sure of talking to someone who knows her, and I need to know Esther so that I can do what is best for her. As a hospital manager I need to understand Esther's care needs so that I can ensure she receives the care she needs and coordinate her discharge from hospital. I need to ensure she remains in hospital only as long as is medically required so that I can manage my budget wisely. 42 Royal Academy of Engineering As a community care manager I need to understand Esther's care needs so that I can coordinate her care, and I need to be consulted if she is to be discharged from hospital so that her immediate care needs can be met. As a service provider I need to ensure that I meet Esther's care needs so that I can do what is best for her, and I need to know how well I am meeting her needs so that I can continuously improve the care I am able to provide. As a funder I need to be condent that the money I provide for the care of elderly persons is spent wisely so that the benet of good care is provided for all. As an administrator I need to ensure good communication between care providers so that they understand Esther's medical and care needs and provide coordinated care for her. What does good look like? Success will be measured by Esther getting care in or close to home, experiencing care from multiple providers as if it were from the same provider, having care uniformly available throughout the region and knowing who to turn to when problems arise. 7 What are the elements? The elements of the system can be considered to be Esther and her family and neighbours, the people who provide all aspects of medical and home care to her, the geographical and transport systems around her home and points of care, the organisations that facilitate her care, and the bodies that fund her care. What are the needs? The analysis of interviews with over 60 patients and providers throughout the system identied six key needs for action :8 The development of a flexible organisation with patient value in focus. The design of more ecient and improved prescription and medication routines. The creation of approaches to documentation and communication of information that can be adapted to the next link of the care chain. The provision of ecient IT-support through the whole care chain. The provision of a diagnosis system for community care. The development of a virtual competence centre for better transfer and improvement of competence through the care chain. How can the needs be met? Many of the problems experienced by Esther involved more than one organisation. It was important to bring together people from dierent levels in these organisations to develop and deliver solutions to support the needs identied. These included: A steering committee of the community care chiefs from municipalities, hospitals and primary care centres to address challenges across organisations. Four 'Esther caf\u00e9s' in municipalities each year, which were cross-organisational, multiprofessional meetings for sharing and learning from the experiences of Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 43 Applications of the approach specic patients who were hospitalised in the past year and have continued on to home care or other services. Interorganisational training workshops on palliative care, nutrition and fall prevention, among other topics. An annual 'strategy day' for nurses and other sta, physicians, managers, as well as 'Esthers' themselves to come together to team build and generate priorities and ideas for addressing problems in care. In 2006 coaches were introduced to the model to promote the Esther Network vision and values and to support ongoing improvement. 9The aim was to develop internal coaches to facilitate improvement across organisational boundaries, providing: customer focus, modelled by involvement of senior citizens in the training programme; a shared set of values; networking skills with a solution- focused approach; and systems thinking. How well are the needs met? The Esther model calls for continuous and coordinated improvement with a focus on providing what is best for Esther. The evidence points to a cultural shift in the way leaders and workers in the J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping County health and care systems now provide for Esther, facilitated by the solutions introduced in response to her needs \u2014 \"the focus is on her now.\" 10 It is also evident that the changes have not only been sustained and further developed, but also have provided the inspiration for change in other health and care systems around the world. What could go wrong? Proactive risk assessment was not employed within this programme. However, the impact of the changes introduced were continuously monitored. How does the system perform? This innovation programme was not designed as a research project and involved many organisational and process changes that were introduced in dierent components of the model at dierent times. Therefore, it is important to be cautious in assessing the impact of the Esther model. 11 Positive changes are noted, but it is dicult to attribute them to the model in the absence of comparative information. With this in mind, program leaders cite the following outcomes: Admissions to the medical department of H\u00f6glandet Hospital declined from 9,300 in 1998 to 6,500 in 2013. Hospital readmissions within 30 days for patients age 65 and older dropped from 17.4% in 2012 to 15.9% in 2014. Hospital lengths of stay decreased between 2009 and 2014 for surgery (from 3.6 to 3.0 days) and rehabilitation (from 19.2 to 9.2 days). Surveys conducted in J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping in 2008 and 2011 showed that Esthers felt safe and were appreciative of the personal contacts. 44 Royal Academy of Engineering What should we do next? \"Taking a system approach to meeting the needs of the frail elderly is unusual, dicult, and necessary.\" The Esther model depends on \"the power of patients' stories\", which were elicited and collected as part of the model to show how patients' lives are aected by their health challenges and their experiences in getting care. 12 The model creates mechanisms, including an annual retreat and development of action plans for each forthcoming year, to help members of dierent professions to continue to think together to solve problems and help to motivate the coaches. \"The secret of Esther is the change in state of mind \u2014 stop thinking what is best for my organisation, but instead think what is best for Esther.\" 13 5 Sweden's Esther Model: Improving Care for Elderly Patients with Complex Needs, The Commonwealth Fund, New Y ork, 2016. www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/case-studies/2016/sep/sweden- esther-case-study 6 Is Sweden's model of integrated care a beacon of light for the NHS?

In 2000, a Cambridgeshire patient died as a direct result of failures in their care and treatment. The inquiry into their death highlighted the need to review the use of oral methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the UK. 14 In this particular case, the patient had been taking a weekly dose of methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. The strength of methotrexate had been altered in error by her GP to a daily dose of 10 mg from the previous weekly dose of 17.5 mg. This was dispensed by a community pharmacy. The patient inadvertently overdosed on methotrexate and their immune system became severely compromised. The patient was later admitted to hospital with symptoms of a severe sore throat, where they continued to receive treatment at this high daily dose until the mistake was identied on the fourth day following admission. What is the problem? Of the 13,000 medicines licensed for use in the UK at that time, oral methotrexate was one of only six that should have been taken weekly. Previously, 25 deaths and 26 cases of serious harm had been attributed to the incorrect use of methotrexate. 15 More than half of the 167 adverse events associated with patients taking methotrexate between 1993 and 2002 were the result of the drug being prescribed on a daily basis. Some cases were due to errors occurring during the transfer of information from hospitals to GPs, others were due to problems with information technology systems that failed to give clear information on the frequency of dosing. Who will use the system? People who are actively 'using' the system are those within the Shared Care Arrangement (Figure 9), such as patients with rheumatoid arthritis, their carers, GPs, pharmacists, phlebotomists and hospital doctors. Where is the system? The system is in the UK and spans from the home to general practice to the community pharmacy to the hospital, working under a shared care arrangement (Figure 9). What aects the system? There are three suppliers of methotrexate for the UK market. They provide 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets that are similar in colour and size in 100 tablet bottles and 2.5 mg tablets in blister packs of 28 tablets. Oral methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis The answers that follow represent those that may have been formulated by the end of the programme, accepting that there was some iteration between the systems, design and risk elements of the work. They are nonetheless representative of the systems approach originally applied to the challenge of improving the safety of patients using oral methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. 46 Royal Academy of Engineering Who are the stakeholders? Stakeholders are those that have an interest in the successful performance of the system and can be described by their role title, need(s) and purpose: As a patient I need sucient methotrexate so that I have relief from the pain resulting from my rheumatoid arthritis, I need methotrexate in an easy-to-open pack so that I am able to open the pack and easily retrieve the correct dose and I need to be condent that I am taking the correct dose of methotrexate so that I do not suer adverse eects from the drug. As a general practitioner I need to ensure that the patient knows how to administer methotrexate so that there is no chance of the patient taking the wrong dose. I need to be sure that I prescribe the correct dose of methotrexate so that there is no chance of the patient taking the wrong dose, and I need to ensure that the patient's bloods are monitored so that the dose can be controlled. As a hospital doctor I need to understand the particular challenges of oral methotrexate use so that I am able to recognise the needs and potential problems experienced by these patients. As an arthritis specialist I need to identify patients who might benet from the use of oral methotrexate so that their quality of life can be improved, and I need to determine the most appropriate dose of oral methotrexate for the patient so that their condition may be improved. As a drug manufacturer I need to supply oral methotrexate in a form so that pharmacies can adjust the quality dispensed to meet individual patient needs, and I need to sell sucient quantity of oral methotrexate so that the product line is commercially viable. As a pharmacist I need to dispense methotrexate in a timely way so that the patient always has the medication they need, and I need to ensure that the patient understands the particular restrictions on the use of oral methotrexate so that they are kept safe. As a carer I need to know that the patient understands the importance of taking the correct dose of methotrexate so that they remain safe, and I need to be sure that methotrexate is not confused with other medications so that they remain safe. As a phlebotomist I need to collect blood samples from the patient so that methotrexate toxicity tests can be carried out in the hospital. I need to ensure that any change to the methotrexate dose is communicated to the patient and GP so that they are both informed of the new dose. As a pathologist I need good blood samples so that I can test methotrexate levels in the patient's blood. Who should be involved? People should be involved in the improvement programme if they are involved in the supply, management and control of methotrexate in the UK, such as: patients and carers community pharmacies GPs and hospital doctors drug manufacturers drug prescription and dispensing software vendors information providers and packaging designers. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 47 Applications of the approach What does good look like? Success will be measured by a signicant reduction of deaths and serious injury to patients being treated with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis while maintaining the benets of disease and symptom control. What are the elements? The management of patients taking methotrexate is organised using a Shared Care Arrangement, sharing responsibility for safe care between the general practice, the community pharmacy and the hospital. This forms the core of the system. In addition, computer software enabling the prescribing and dispensing of methotrexate is used, drug information leaflets and record books are provided, and the drug and packaging are required (Figure 9). Figure 9: The methotrexate system Methotrexate used for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis is administered and controlled in the UK using a shared care arrangement, involving GPs, community pharmacies and hospitals. Other organisations supply the drug, packaging and labelling, prescribing and dispensing software, and drug information. As a software supplier I need to deliver competitive prescribing and dispensing systems so that GPs/pharmacists use my software, and I need to ensure that my products enhance GP/pharmacist practices so that errors are reduced. As an information supplier I need to ensure that information is trustworthy and accessible so that GPs/pharmacists use my services, and I need to ensure that my services enhance GP/pharmacist practices so that errors are reduced. As a packaging/labelling supplier I need to provide clear identication so that the pharmacist and patient can unambiguously select the correct medication. As a practice receptionist I need to ensure that repeat prescription forms are authorised so that patients receive their prescriptions in a timely manner. As a practice manager I need to ensure that everyone is aware of our policies and practice relating to methotrexate so that patients receive safe care. 48 Royal Academy of Engineering How well are the needs met? A new information leaflet for patients, emphasising the weekly dose for methotrexate, was drafted and trialled. This led to the provision of a methotrexate treatment guide incorporating a pre-treatment leaflet, designed to provide patients with guidance on low dose methotrexate, and a blood monitoring and dosage record booklet. 18 The changes proposed for the shape of the methotrexate tablets were delivered, but this did not address potential confusion with other medications and, in particular, folic acid which is often prescribed along with methotrexate. Software vendors provided enhancements to their existing GP prescribing software to ensure methotrexate was clearly labelled as 'High Alert', 'Alert' or 'Toxic' in the drug list, to generate an additional alert message when selecting methotrexate highlighting the need for weekly doses and to provide dosing options that clearly articulated the number of tablets to be taken. 19 Novel packaging designs were not pursued at this stage. However, manufacturers began to provide tablets in 16 and 24 packs with improved design (for patients with reduced manual dexterity), labelling and safety information. The use of existing pharmacy labels continued. How can the needs be met? In response to the patient needs, a number of potential solutions were identied, each of which would prevent some opportunity for harm and collectively would prevent or reduce all harm based upon the causal and contributory data available at the time: 16,17 1. Better information for the patient prior to treatment and use of patient-held records to include monitoring schedules and results. 2. Clear branding of methotrexate as a weekly medication with clear instructions to take methotrexate on Mondays. 3. Improved warnings and flags for GP prescribing and pharmacy dispensing software systems which were not easily over-ridden. 4. Reshaped tablets from manufacturers to ensure that 2.5 mg round tablets are easily distinguishable from 'new' 10 mg torpedo shaped tablets. 5. Repackaged tablets using novel designs and in reduced quantities so that the patient receives the original manufacturers pack. What are the needs? The needs for redesign of the system are dominated by the needs of the patient, where the priority is for an easy-to-follow medication management process, easy- to-understand information about methotrexate, easy-to-identify medication and easy-to-open packs. Other needs, derived from the stakeholders list, should also be considered in the context of meeting the fundamental patient needs. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 49 Applications of the approach How does the system perform? Limited data was collected to enable direct comparison with previous error rates and subsequent patient harm resulting from use of oral methotrexate. Communications from the NPSA suggested that early compliance with new guidanc e20 remained poor, likely contributing to ongoing errors in the use of methotrexate, resulting in patient harm. 21 Eighteen months after the shape of the 10 mg methotrexate tablet was changed the Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a Class 3 Medicines Recall. 22 Original round 10 mg tablets that had remained in circulation alongside the new torpedo shaped 10 mg tablets were recalled as their continued presence had given rise to confusion where patients had been told all round tablets were 2.5 mg. What could go wrong? A review of the risks associated with the original oral methotrexate system was undertaken prior to determining the design interventions described above. This identied the following high-risk scenarios: i. Failure to identify changed prescription request arising from blood test results. ii. GP prescribes methotrexate \"as directed\". iii. Patient receives wrong dose due to confusion between dierent strengths of methotrexate tablets. iv. Patient receives wrong dose due to confusion between folic acid and methotrexate tablets. v. Patient experiences diculties reading print on blister pack. vi. Incorrect prescription of methotrexate is dispensed to the patient because of poor design of prescribing/dispensing software. vii. Pharmacy picking error results in wrong medications being dispensed. viii. Pharmacist only writes total dose of methotrexate, not number of tablets. ix. Poor hospital drug chart review by hospital pharmacy. x. Poor education of healthcare professionals regarding use of methotrexate. Many of these issues were addressed by the design changes proposed and other patient safety initiatives. However, a number remained, including the potential for patients to be confused by the two strengths of methotrexate tablets and this led directly to the policy in many regions to prescribe only 2.5 mg tablets. There was also a danger that patients might be confused by the variation in dose that was the direct result of the review of regular blood tests designed to determine the optimal dose for each individual. It was important that changes in dose were communicated clearly to the patient and others in the shared care arrangement to ensure that all patient records were up to date. 50 Royal Academy of Engineering What should we do next? The use of oral methotrexate as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis relies on a number of systems working with the patient to ensure their safety. Further improvements in the use of this drug will need to follow a systems approach to ensure that key stakeholders work together to identify and implement changes that would minimise future loss of life. 14 An inquiry into the death of a Cambridgeshire Patient in April 2000 .

Despite all the best eorts of the improvement team, methotrexate remains a potentially harmful drug that is ultimately administered by the patient. Deaths and serious harm continued at a lower level and in 2011 a patient, prescribed an increasing dose of methotrexate in order to identify the required level of medication, continued to increase the weekly dose beyond the mandated maximum and died. This was not an error that had been predicted and shows the importance of shared care arrangement team taking full responsibility for all aspects of the prescribing, dispensing and monitoring cycle when working with patients receiving oral methotrexate. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 51 Case studies Annex 2 Case studies The following case studies of change or transformation projects aim to put the guiding questions and perspectives described in Section 3: Dening a systems approach into context. Whilst not all the projects described will have explicitly used a systems approach, the case studies highlight how they have taken into account the people, systems, design and risk perspectives in their work. The spread of examples from the healthcare and engineering sector were deliberately chosen, as were the mix of successes and failures. The range of case studies demonstrate that a systems approach is adaptable to all levels of scale, from service level through organisation to cross-organisation, and suciently versatile to apply across all areas of health and care. The case studies are representative of systems that are simple, complicated and complex and found at service, organisation and cross-organisation levels (Figure 10).

After contacting her daughter, who did not know what to do, Esther sought medical advice. She was seen by a district nurse and told to visit her general practitioner, who said that she needed to go to hospital and called an ambulance. After being admitted to emergency care she retold her story to a variety of clinicians at the hospital during a ve-and-a-half- hour wait. Esther saw a total of 36 dierent people and had to retell her story at every point, while having problems breathing. A doctor nally admitted her to a hospital ward .23 In the late 1990s, with Esther's experience in mind, the then head of the medical department of H\u00f6glandet Hospital in N\u00e4ssj\u00f6, initiated an extensive series of interviews and workshops to identify redundancies and gaps in the medical and community care systems and develop an action plan for improvement. 'Esther' came to represent elderly persons who have complex care needs that involve a variety of providers. The idea was that care should be guided by the following questions: What does Esther need? What does she want? What is important to her when she is not well? What does she need when she leaves the hospital? Which providers must cooperate to meet Esther's needs? The now widely adopted Esther model uses continuous quality improvement, cross-organisational communication, problem-solving, and sta training to provide the best care for elderly patients with complex care needs. 24 Further details of the application of a systems approach to this case study can be found in Annex 1: Applications of the approach.

Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist and is classied as an antimetabolite cytotoxic immunosuppressant agent. As well as being a therapy for cancers, it is widely used as a disease modifying drug for rheumatoid arthritis. Because of its toxicity, it is only given weekly and its use is carefully monitored through regular blood tests, often leading to changes in the weekly dose prescribed. Following the inquiry, the National Patient Safety Agency took a systems approach, working with health professionals, patient groups, the pharmaceutical industry, and medical and pharmaceutical software suppliers, to identify risks associated with the delivery of methotrexate and to co-design safer solutions. 19 Subsequent changes included better information for patients and patient- held records, improved warnings for GP prescribing and pharmacy dispensing, and the repackaging of the tablets to ensure that the two doses available were more easily distinguishable. The changes made to the methotrexate supply system, requiring the cooperation of a variety of stakeholders, led directly to a measurable reduction in patient harm and an approach that focuses on enabling the patient to take the right dose at the right time. Further details of the application of a systems approach to this case study can be found in Annex 1: Applications of the approach.

In 2003, all Michigan hospitals with an intensive care unit (ICU) were invited to join the Keystone ICU project to evaluate the eect of a number of patient-safety interventions targeted at reducing the number of central venous catheter blood stream infections. 27 One physician and one nurse were selected by each ICU as team leaders and underwent extensive training in the science of safety and in interventions that they introduced to their teams. A checklist was used to encourage compliance with observation of appropriate hand hygiene, removal of unnecessary catheters and use of full-barrier precautions during catheter insertion, chlorhexidine for skin preparation and subclavian vein placement as the preferred site. A central-line cart was also created. Open reporting of infection rates was introduced. When the project began, the median rate of infections for the Michigan intensive care unit project Changing practice on a large distributed scale Case study 3 participant ICUs was 2.7 per 1,000 catheter-days. This decreased to zero after three months, a rate sustained throughout the 15 month project. A subsequent project sought to understand how and why the interventions had worked and identied a number of social, technical and socio-technical approaches that together led to sustained change. 28 Many of these factors translate directly to a systems approach, reflecting elements of cultural change, a focus on local teams and regional systems, deployment of eective data and measurement systems and risk control through the use of checklists and design of elements, such as carts, supportive of good practice. 27 An Intervention to Decrease Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections in the ICU , Pronovost et al., N Engl J Med, 355(26):2725-2732, 2006. www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa061115#t=article 28 Explaining Michigan: Developing an Ex Post Theory of a Quality Improvement Program , Dixon- Woods et al., Milbank Q, 89(2):167-205, 2011. onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0009.2011.00625.x/abstract reframing the problem as one where human action and behaviour could succeed creating a networked community to facilitate and encourage knowledge sharing Success factors The success of the Michigan project may be attributed to: developing a consistent approach to data collection and feedback of information changing practice and culture by reframing risk across interrelated domains. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 55 The St. Aubyn Centre, 29 opened in October 2012, is the only NHS Adolescent Acute and Intensive Care unit in the south of England. It provides care for young people between the ages of 13 and 18 who are experiencing acute, complex and/or severe mental health, emotional and psychological problems. During the design of the new centre, the management of the previous facility worked with the architects to co-develop ideas for the new physical and social environment. While still at the planning stage, risk assessments were undertaken to investigate a range of operational procedures that would take place in the centre, leading directly to a number of signicant changes to the detail design. A new no-smoking policy was also proposed for the facility in contrast to previous practice. This led to the creation of a number of patient and sta personas to assist the team with a further risk assessment, focused on St. Aubyn Centre Fixing problems before they happen Case study 4 the potential success of the new policy. The study not only increased the team's understanding of the likely behaviour of 'desperate' smokers, but also led to a plan to impose a sta smoking ban some months before the move and introduction of the new no-smoking policy for patients. The new policy proved very successful, with the prior risk assessment giving the sta condence to proceed with such a change. This proactive approach to safety assessmen t30,31 has proved increasingly useful in delivering safe and eective healthcare services. 29 St Aubyn Centre , North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, 2016. www.nepstaubyncentre.nhs.uk/ 30 System Safety Assessment toolkit , University of Cambridge, 2016. www.ssatoolkit.com/toolkit/index.html 31 Safer Clinical Systems: A new proactive approach to building safe healthcare systems , University of Warwick, 2014. patientsafety.health.org.uk/sites/default/les/resources/hf_safer_clinical_systems_reference_guide _nal_1.pdf understanding of possible patient and sta behaviours within a new environment seeing the centre as a facility set in the context of wider care services Success factors The successful delivery of the St. Aubyn Centre may be attributed to: consideration of the impact of the physical layout of the new centre systematic risk assessment of the potential impact of the new policy Case studies 56 Royal Academy of Engineering The London Ambulance Service rst considered introducing a computerised command and control system in the early 1980s. This was in line not only with many other ambulance services, but also with police and re services. In the autumn of 1990, following the abandonment of the previous attempt to computerise the system, work began on the drafting of requirements for a new state-of-the-art system. The concept behind the design was to create, as far as possible, a totally automated system whereby the majority of calls to the service would result in an automatic allocation of the most suitable ambulance. Only in the most complex cases would a human 'allocator' need to identify and allocate the best resource. The full requirements specication was an ambitious document and its intended functionality was greater than for any existing system. Given the previous diculties, allegedly caused by the supplier's inability to understand the complexity of the service, it was interesting that the new system was intended to go considerably further. The new system failed in October 1992 leading to some interesting headlines. 31 The lesson learned was that the particular geographical, social and political environment in which London Ambulance Service operated, and the cultural climate within the service itself, required a more measured and participative approach from management and sta. 32 Several attempts later, a new system went live in March 2012 and has subsequently met its operational expectations.

These are selected not only for their view, but also for their proximity to the most convenient post-match route from the stadium, as dened by the local police in line with its crowd management policy. The police presence around Highbury operates to a well-rehearsed plan accompanied by the usual assortment of temporary food and memorabilia vendors. Programmes and scarves, bespoke for the day, sell quickly along the directed route. On the stadium plaza spectators are guided through colour-coded quadrants to lettered turnstiles where their membership card, pre-allocated a ticket, is read by a laser scanner ensuring that they enter the correct zone. Inside, fans can immediately access food and drink counters that provide quick service, as well as an extensive number of toilets. The whole system is simple to ensure the ecient Arsenal's Emirates Stadium A football match as a system of systems Case study 6 handling of the large crowds that will converge on such events. 34 Ultimately, the fans' experience is likely to be dominated by the nal score. However, it will also be influenced by the carefully choreographed system of systems, comprising both the physical architecture of the new stadiu m35 and its surroundings, and the numerous organisations and businesses that provide for a safe, fun day out. All these stakeholders will take much satisfaction from successfully serving a typical 60,432 person match day crowd. 34 Creating systems that work , Royal Academy of Engineering, 2007. www.raeng.org.uk/publications/reports/rae-systems-report/ 35 Emirates Stadium, United Kingdom . designbuild-network.com, 2016. www.designbuild- network.com/projects/ashburton/ understanding the match day fan behaviour and role of stewards and policing seeing the stadium as one part of the wider transport, retail and policing system Success factors The continued success of match days at the Emirates Stadium may be attributed to: careful design of major access routes to and from the stadium plaza active consideration of match day crowd safety within and around the stadium Case studies 58 Royal Academy of Engineering The Design Bugs Out programme was launched in 2008 with the Department of Health and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (now NHS Supply Chain). It brought designers and manufacturers together with clinical specialists, patients and frontline sta to help combat infections by making hospital furniture and equipment easier and quicker to clean. 36 A wide-ranging review of the clinical environment, by a team including designers, ergonomists, researchers, patients, nurses, domestics and other sta, identied 51 design opportunities. These were shortlisted to 10 opportunities: ve 'quick wins' that were developed by the Helen Hamlyn Centre (Royal College of Art) and ve that were advertised via a national design competition. The project led to the development of four pieces of furniture and equipment specically designed to eliminate dirt traps, make cleaning easier and reduce the incidence of Healthcare Associated Infections. Designers and manufacturers worked in conjunction with NHS users to create product prototypes for evaluation in eight showcase hospitals. Manufacturers Bristol Maid and designers Kinneir Dufort teamed up to create a radically new bedside cabinet with wipe-clean polymers instead of wood and metal, to make it easier to clean and help stop bacteria spreading. 37 Clean lines and ample storage make the cabinet attractive not only to patients, but also to sta who now spend less time cleaning, releasing more time for patients.

The modelling of such systems requires the development of mathematical and simulation models that are able to account for these conditions, along with complex and large-scale patient pathways, at both operational and strategic levels. Hospitals have traditionally measured demand by the length of waiting lists or numbers of referrals, but this does not provide health professionals with specic information about patients' treatment needs and resource requirements. However, the application of mathematical models has recently enabled the modelling of real life scenarios, such as complex and unpredictable patient flows. Managers are now able to change their processes on screen before they do it for real, avoiding unnecessary risk to patients .38 Models were used in the design of a major new trauma centre at St George's Hospital in London. The Modelling and simulation saves lives Predicting outcomes in London hospitals Case study 8 models informed the required patient- flows and resourcing levels for the centre and were used to create service level agreements with commissioners. This enabled patient waiting time to be reduced and better levels of patient care to be delivered, leading to an observed increase in survival rates. Models were similarly utilised by a new hyper-acute stroke unit covering the South London area. The outcomes were again lifesaving, signicantly lowering risk-adjusted mortality for stroke patients, as veried by data comparing mortality rates pre and post the introduction of the new unit. 38 Mathematics and Healthcare: Saving Lives and Reducing Costs , 2013. impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/ CaseStudy.aspx?Id=3387 working with stakeholders to derive realistic system models taking a system-wide view of patient flow and resource needs Success factors The successful application of the models may be attributed to: creating virtual design alternatives to explore process options evaluating new process risks utilising simulation models Case studies 60 Royal Academy of Engineering The Diskus dry powder inhaler (DPI) was launched in the mid-1990s at a time when the use of pressurised metered dose inhalers (MDI) was being criticised owing to the diculties of repeatability with some users and the use of environmentally unfriendly chlorofluorocarbon propellants. 39 Inhalers are typically used for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An inhaler is one part of a drug delivery system that involves many stakeholders, all focused on providing the right drug in the right formulation to the right patient at the right time. To meet this need, the Diskus delivered individual factory-metered dry powder doses to the patient via multiple reservoirs without the need for any propellant. 40 This design dramatically reduced the risk of dose variation. Indeed, the rationale for the presentation of drug as individually, factory-metered unit doses was specically chosen to ensure a high degree of dose consistency throughout the life of the device. This avoided some of the challenges of multi-dose reservoir devices where the drug is stored in bulk in the device and a dose is retrieved when required. Careful consideration was given to dierent use scenarios of the device, accounting for dierent users, storage regimes and methods of use. As a result, the device has been shown to be easier to use than competitor devices, leading to better outcomes for users. This systems approach to device development enabled the Diskus to satisfy the regulatory authorities, sell over one billion devices and, most importantly, full its original clinical purpose.

The service, which runs across Airedale, Wharfedale and Craven, Bradford City and Bradford District, 41 was designed with input from healthcare professionals, patients, carers and Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) representatives, with funding from the Health Foundation. The service design was provoked by using a ctitious 'Day in the Life' diary of a patient approaching the end of their life. This aimed to evoke an emotional response from those involved and takes into account the support needed by the people delivering the service. The project was built within the Digital Care Hub infrastructure system already in place at Airedale. It used the same telemedicine service to hold key information, including future care 24/7 medical support in end-of-life care in Airedale Coordinated care at end of life Case study 10 wishes of these patients, in a template within the electronic records. This can be accessed by Gold Line and community sta, as well as GPs and district nurses. Several projects are serviced from the same Digital Care Hub meaning that costs are shared and they work in synergy with each other. The project has provided high quality, coordinated care for a large number of people facing the last year of their lives and their carers. It has been recognised with several awards and sta are in talks with the CCG to expand the service model to the top 3-5% of people with the most complex care needs. 42 41 Bringing healthcare home nal report, Airedale NHS Foundation Trust, 2016 www.health.org.uk/sites/health/les/Final%20End%20of%20implementation%20Report%20Jan% 202016.pdf 42 Gold Line service local evaluation, Y ear End Report April 2014 - March 2015 , 2015 www.health.org.uk/sites/health/les/Appendix%202%20%28a%29%20Gold%20Line%20Service %20Local%20Evaluation.pdf understanding the needs of the patients, carers and senior nurses providing care developing a realisable and shared purpose between all stakeholders Success factors The success of the new telecare system may be attributed to: using personal dairies and PDSA cycles to motivate change utilising existing digital infrastructure to ensure integration with other services Case studies 62 Royal Academy of Engineering By mapping the system, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham found that very little of the inpatient clinical event scheduling was visible to inpatients and ward sta. MyDay@QEHB ,43 a Health Foundation project, was designed with the aim of empowering patients and helping ward sta manage resources by generating a daily schedule of clinical interventions. It mines referrals and booked appointments from the trust's existing clinical portal systems. Since each ward has its own ways of working, there was a risk of resistance to change from local teams. However, by understanding each local context and taking account of dierences in working practice by using storytelling, patient and sta feedback were used as powerful tools for alleviating sta fears. The project took the time to understand the people and context. Key clinical support services, including inpatient imaging, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics, and speech and language therapy, did not schedule inpatient appointments at all, and porter bookings were not coordinated. The project enabled all of these services to change the way that they worked before MyDay@QEHB could be deployed. MyDay@QEHB has reduced patient anxiety and allowed sta to better manage resources. There was an increase in the number of patients discharged before midday. Between 2012 and 2015, the percentage of patients who said they had a good understanding of the timing of ward events rose from 54% to 86%. Porter delays were also reduced in the wards using MyDay@QEHB compared to those that did not.

In the 2000s they were facing challenges to improve the energy eciency of the estate, to decrease CO 2emissions and reduce costs, while maintaining estates that were t-for- purpose for patients and sta. The estates and facility management team procured an energy performance contract that included the introduction of a combined heat and power plant, lighting improvements and mechanisms to address maintenance backlog. These were able to reduce CO 2 emissions at the same time as improving the environment for patients and sta and supporting healthcare delivery. The team introduced very low energy LED lamps that adjusted to levels of natural light. These reduced energy use and provided more consistent lighting to enable sta to better monitor patients. Barts Sustainability Strateg y44 Achieving energy eciency and improved patient experience Case study 12 The LEDs had a 10 year life, dramatically reducing the need for re- lamping and the accompanying disruption for both patients and sta that can compromise infection control. The team also increased the use of computer-aided facilities management systems. This directly led to improvements in the management of required maintenance and allowed better monitoring and enhanced control of the internal environment in response to changing external weather, lighting levels, and other occupational needs. Success factors The success of this sustainability strategy may be attributed to: Case studies integrating the needs of sta, patients, and facilities management teams accounting for technology, the external environment and human behaviour developing a flexible technology strategy, building on current systems considering both the short and long term impact of changes made 44 www.skanska-sustainability-case-studies.com/index.php/latest-case-studies/item/128-barts- and-the-london-hospitals-uk?limitstart=0 64 Royal Academy of Engineering Royal United Hospitals Bath opened a new neonatal intensive care unit in 2011 to provide care for up to 500 premature and seriously ill babies every year. The new unit had to allow healthcare to be delivered eectively to babies, provide a calm environment for parents and sta, and reduce energy consumption when compared to the old unit. 45 Architects and design engineers carried out extensive consultations with hospital sta and parent groups that emphasised the importance of creating an environmentally sustainable family centred care facility. Special attention was given to lighting levels as they are a crucial element in creating a therapeutic and calming environment for sick babies. A small self-contained wireless device was also developed for mounting on the baby's nappy to measure breathing, restlessness and sleep patterns, allowing the impact of changes in the unit to be monitored. The design team created peaceful and practical internal spaces with the clinical rooms grouped around a central sta base to enhance visibility. A research study, supported by the Sir James Dyson Foundation, showed that, in the research groups, 90% of the babies went home from the new unit breastfeeding, compared with 64% in the old centre, and babies achieved 20% more sleep in the new unit. Parents also visited their children more often and spent more time in direct contact with them. In addition, during the day, the nurses typically spent nearly twice as much time in clinical rooms looking after the babies. The novel unit design also resulted in energy consumption dropping from \u00a380 to \u00a350 per 100 cubic metres.

A true systems approach is one that consistently delivers a high-quality service and is most likely to be the result of a team successfully integrating people, systems, design and risk perspectives in an ordered and well executed manner. It is only when all four perspectives are robustly understood that a systems approach will have the greatest success. Further reading may be found in the Bibliography, page 85. 66 Royal Academy of Engineering A people perspective uses knowledge of stakeholders' abilities, experience, competence and culture to enable the design of systems that are t for their intended purpose. The contribution of treatments, equipment, systems, processes and protocols are undeniably critical to health and care provision; however, it is people who ultimately aect the quality of that delivery. An appropriate awareness of people applies not only to the recipients of care, but also to the providers of care. It is important to acknowledge the diversity of the population and that health and care services should be accessible to, and usable by, as many people as reasonably possible, regardless of age or health condition (Figure 12). Equally, a chief executive and other senior people can have a signicant impact on an organisation, through their actions and behaviour, creating a culture that values the importance of the quality of relationships between employees and, most critically, the people in their care. People are diverse in their size and capability, whether they are members of the public, patients or providers of care. Systems should be designed to be accessible to, and usable by, as many people as reasonably possible. The success and eectiveness of a system are dependent on consideration of the people within the system, its context or place and the policy dening its operation. This can be represented as a series of iterative identify , locate and situate cycles where it is crucial to pay attention to provider/patient relationships as well as the relationships between health professionals, and how these can be enhanced by providing appropriate technologies, systems and policies to deliver a quality of care judged by the degree of warmth and reassurance shown to both colleagues and the people receiving care. Figure 11: A people perspective \u2014 identify, locate and situate The people perspective can be thought of as the iterative sum of the identify, locate and situate phases. Figure 12: Population diversity \u2014 a need for inclusive systems Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 67 Elements of a systems approach People are at the heart of an eective systems approach, 46 permeate all stages of the development and delivery of a system, and are rightfully central to the systems, design and risk perspectives. A people perspective serves to involve patients, practitioners and the public to ensure that the systems created are truly t for their intended purpose and reflect a deep understanding of how knowledge, competence and culture enables people, individually and corporately, to deliver and receive health and care within a complex socio-technical environment. 47 Situate The situate phase asks the question 'What aects the system?' and leads to an understanding of the wider context within which the system is situated, including reference to policy opportunities and constraints, and the political landscape. It is likely to include a variety of activities to develop this understanding, for example: understand the political landscape identify opportunities for improvement encourage a systems approach to care identify policies that put patients rst. Locate The locate phase asks the question 'Where is the system?' and leads to an understanding of the context within which the system is situated, including reference to organisation and culture, as well as the demographics and needs of the local population. It is likely to include a variety of activities to develop this understanding, for example: capture needs of the local population identify related or adjacent systems of care dene structures that will contribute to success establish culture to maximise quality of care. Identify The identify phase asks the question 'Who will use the system?' and leads to an understanding of the full range of people involved and their needs and capabilities. It is likely to include a variety of activities to develop this understanding, for example: identify all the people who will use the system co-create the system with system users ensure accessibility for all systems users maintain communication between all system users. 46 New care models: empowering patients and communities, a call to action for a directory of support.

Clinical Human Factors Group, 2013. chfg.org/best-practice/how-to-guide-to-human- factors-volume-2/ 68 Royal Academy of Engineering A systems perspective ensures the design and improvement of safe and ecient systems that satisfy their required purpose in the context of a wider system. A system is a set of elements: people, processes, information, organisations and services, as well as software, hardware and other systems that, when combined, have qualities that are not present in any of the elements themselves. A systems perspective takes a holistic approach to understanding this complexity that enables the delivery of intended outcomes based on the way in which a system's constituent parts relate to each other and to the wider system (Figure 14). The design of a system can be considered to be made up of a series of iterative understand , organise and integrate cycles that enable a team to progress from identifying the stakeholders and their needs through to organising a system of elements and interfaces that are subsequently designed, integrated, validated and delivered to satisfy those needs.Figure 13: A systems perspective \u2014 understand, organise and integrate The systems perspective can be thought of as the iterative sum of the understand, organise and integrate phases. Figure 14: Complicated vs complex \u2014 a map of systems behaviour Health and care outcomes are often dependent on systems working together. The inherent nature of these systems and the way in which they are connected determines the predictability of their combined behaviour. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 69 Elements of a systems approach The world is made up of a set of highly interconnected technical and social elements that produce emergent behaviour and challenges for communication and control. Some systems are simple, others are chaoti c48 (Figure 14). Some are complicated with many elements, but operate in patterned ways, others are complex with features whose interactions are continually changing. It is the co-production of health outcomes with the patient, often across a number of systems rather than with any individual health and care system, that can add signicant complexity and uncertainty, leading to behaviours not expected when focus is limited to individual systems. As a result, the solution to a challenge may actually involve changing another system and not the one where the problem or symptom is appearing, relying on collaboration and an integrated holistic view of the systems. 49 Integrate The integrate phase asks the question 'How does the system perform?' and leads to a complete, operational system that is proven to meet the stakeholder requirements and be t for its intended purpose. It is likely to include a variety of activities that can help to deliver an integrated system, for example: combine system elements verify system performance validate system performance monitor system performance in use. Organise The organise phase asks the question 'What are the elements?' and leads to an agreed system boundary and architecture comprising a description of existing systems, requirements for new systems and details of the interfaces between them. It is likely to include a variety of activities that can help to deliver this architecture, for example: agree functional and information requirements dene system boundary and external interfaces dene system architecture and internal interfaces agree system integration and evaluation plan. Understand The understand phase asks the question 'Who are the stakeholders?' and leads to a common and accepted understanding of the range of stakeholders and their individual interests, needs, values and perspectives. It is likely to include a variety of activities that can help to build this understanding, for example: identify system stakeholders capture stakeholder needs dene stakeholder priorities draft system business case(s). 48 The Cynen framework is a decision framework showing that dierent situations require dierent processes to successfully navigate them \u2014 The new dynamics of strategy sense-making in a complex world. Kurtz and Snowden 2003, IBM Systems Journal , 42(3):462-483, 2003. 49 Creating systems that work: Principles of engineering systems for the 21st century , Royal Academy of Engineering, 2007. 70 Royal Academy of Engineering A design perspective ensures that systems are delivered using a range of perspectives, creative approaches and evaluation strategies in order to meet stakeholder needs. It has been argued that many problems addressed by designers are 'wicked problems', dened as a class of problems that are ill-formulated, where the information is contradictory, where there are many stakeholders with conflicting values, and where the behaviours in the system are confusing. In response, the Design Council's 'double diamond '50 comprises an initial analytical phase, which determines all of the elements of the problem and species the requirements for a successful solution, and a synthesis phase, which generates a range of possible conceptual solutions and an implementation plan (Figure 16). In practice, design is iterative in nature, comprising multiple explore , create and evaluate cycles that enable a team to progress from understanding the need through to developing the solution. Design can be seen as a risk reduction exercise, set to maximise the chances of delivering the right solution to the right problem reflecting the right need. Figure 15: A design perspective \u2014 explore, create and evaluate The design perspective can be thought of as the iterative sum of the explore, create and evaluate phases. Figure 16: The 'double diamond' \u2014 dening the problem before the solution Good design focuses on discovering the real need before dening the problem and delivering the solution. Good design also explores a range of problems and solutions before selecting the most likely to full the need. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 71 Elements of a systems approach Explore The explore phase asks the question 'What are the needs?' and leads to a common and accepted understanding of the likely needs for a system, taking account of the full range of stakeholders. It is likely to include a variety of activities that can help to build this understanding and draw the ndings together, for example: observe users to reveal what they really need generate personas to represent key users describe typical user journeys through the system specify performance requirements. Create The create phase asks the question 'How can the needs be met?' and leads to a range of possible system solutions that would help meet the needs and criteria identied by the explore phase. It is likely to include many of the activities commonly thought of as conceptual design, for example: generate a wide range of solution ideas develop solutions that could satisfy the needs make prototypes to demonstrate the solutions select the best solution(s) for development. Evaluate The evaluate phase asks the question 'How well are the needs met?' and leads to an evaluation, both virtually and in practice, of possible system concepts that could meet the needs and criteria identied by the explore phase. It is likely to include activities to provide evidence that the needs are actually met, for example: test system with experts test system with users evaluate how well the needs are met present evidence from the evaluation. The design process is typical of those used to address wicked problems, 51 where it is not only highly creative, but also very likely to be highly iterative in order to deal with the intrinsic uncertainty in understanding the real needs and nding an appropriate solution. This is evidenced by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's iterative model for improvement (Aim, Feedback, Changes, Plan, Do, Study, Act) often encountered in health and care, where the planning stage is particularly influential in ensuring the delivery of safe systems into practice. 50 Eleven lessons managing design in eleven global companies.

Engineering risk and safety management methods, such as Failure Mode and Eects Analysis, Hazards and Operability Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis , are used to identify potential threats and opportunities within a system and to manage their likelihood and/or impact on people, property, progress or prot. The role of risk management is to identify, assess and control the level of known risk, accepting the inherent threat or opportunity that may be present within the system, in particular with complex medical interventions and in the distributed system of social care (Figure 18). It is useful to consider the process of risk management to be made up of a series of iterative examine , assess and improve cycles that enable a team to progress from understanding what is known about the system through to developing interventions to manage the risk presented by the system. Active risk management is appropriate at all stages of a product or service lifecycle, from early conception, through use to disposal. Figure 17: A risk perspective \u2014 examine, assess and improve The risk perspective can be thought of as the iterative sum of the examine, assess and improve phases. Figure 18: Safer systems \u2014 avoiding error and encouraging good practice Risk can be represented as a distribution of possible outcomes, where most reflect normal behaviour. Exceptional outcomes provide opportunities for improvement, while accidents represent threats to be avoided. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 73 Elements of a systems approach Risk can be referenced to a system's ability to deliver high-quality, cost-eective care, where quality is dened as the combination of clinical and cost eectiveness, patient safety and patient experience. 52 Risk management is commonly used as a clinical tool for the prospective analysis of an individual patient's risk, with or without a particular intervention. However, it may also be used to evaluate the risk in sustaining or not achieving the desired outcomes for a population of patients, the eciency of a care process or the nances of a care provider. 53 Dierent stakeholders may have dierent risk priorities within the same system and risk tolerance levels will vary with time and be dependent upon the context of each specic care delivery system or process. Risk may also be attributed to uncertainty in performance where mitigation will likely focus on the identication of the sources of such variation and their reduction. Examine The examine phase asks the question 'What is going on?' and leads to a common and accepted understanding of needs, which takes account of the range of stakeholders. It is likely to include a variety of activities that can help to build this understanding, for example: outline goals of the assessment describe and understand the system identify critical risk stakeholders agree acceptable system risk levels. Assess The assess phase asks the question 'What could go wrong?' and leads to a systematic assessment of the likelihood and potential impact of risk within a system, which takes account of the nature of the threat or opportunity. It is likely to include a variety of activities that enable this assessment, for example: identify threats or opportunities within the system identify current safeguards with the system evaluate resultant risk and its detectability specify mitigation or exploitation needs. Improve The improve phase asks the question 'How can we make it better?' and leads to a specic plan for managing the likelihood and potential impact of risk within a system, which takes account of the acceptability of such risk. It is likely to include a variety of activities that enable this implementation, for example: propose actions to manage the risk within the system examine eectiveness of the planned actions implement key actions within the system review assessment in a timely manner. 52 From Safety-I to Safety-II: A White Paper.

From the simple water heater to the fully integrated international airport, from ancient irrigation systems to modern communication networks, all systems share one key feature: their elements together produce results not obtainable by the same elements alone. These elements, or parts, can include people, processes, information, organisations and services, as well as software, hardware and other systems. \"Systems that work do not just happen \u2014 they have to be planned, designed and built\" 54 The layout of the system, dening all the elements and their interconnections, needs to be carefully considered to ensure that each element on its own and in combination with others performs as required. In response to this challenge and the ever increasing complexity of modern systems, a new discipline of systems engineering has evolved as an interdisciplinary approach to enable the realisation of successful systems. Engineering systems Figure 19: The systems engineering V-Model The systems engineering V- Model (INCOSE UK Z-Guide s55 ) provides a succinct description of an engineering systems approach. It not only makes specic reference to systems, design and risk thinking activities, but also provides implicit reference to the need for and value of people- centric activities. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 75 Elements of a systems approach Systems engineering focuses on dening stakeholder needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem. It integrates all the necessary disciplines and specialty groups into a team responsible for using a structured development process that proceeds from needs to requirements to concepts, and from design to production to operation, addressing all the stakeholders' business and technical needs (Figure 19). A successful system delivery process brings together technical specialists and system architects to ensure a holistic system perspective is maintained throughout; not only in terms of the overall layout of the system and its elements, but also with regard to the whole system lifecycle. Some will provide a focus on individual elements and their role in the system, others will take a holistic view of the system and its performance. Both will play a part in dening the boundary of the system, its requirements, the partitioning of its elements and interfaces, its integration and evaluation, and ultimately its release into service. Typically, dierent and yet coherent perspectives of the system are developed and held by dierent teams and stakeholders. Consider a house that is made up of a number of systems that co-exist to ensure that a house becomes a home (Figure 20). Some are discrete yet interconnected (water, heating, power, security and networks) while others are naturally more holistic (design, structure, planning, illumination and insulation). Figure 20: A typical house system A typical house relies on a number of interrelated systems to provide a safe, functional environment for its occupants. The layout and exterior design rely on a sound structure and deliver should appropriate thermal and acoustic behaviour. Water, heating, power, security and networking all add to the home experience. 54 Creating systems that work: Principles of engineering systems for the 21st century , Royal Academy of Engineering, 2007. 55 INCOSE (International Council on Systems Engineering) UK Z-Guide 1: What is Systems Engineering , INCOSE UK, 2009. 76 Royal Academy of Engineering Figure 21: A satellite navigation system Satellite navigation systems extend far beyond the 'satnav' found in many cars. They rely on the GPS operators for positional information via an array of satellites, navigation service providers for up-to-date maps, trac data integrators for current trac information and mobile operators for real-time communication. The delivery of any particular system requires expert knowledge of that system and how it will interface to the whole. The heating specialist cannot develop an appropriate solution without knowledge of the design, structure and insulation, nor can they deliver the solution without detail of the power and water systems. Each specialist will have a dierent perspective on the house, yet architects, and subsequently builders, act as system integrators, delivering homes with emergent properties greater than the sum of the individual parts. For example, the energy rating of a house depends on a combination of design, structure, insulation and heating, while its desirability may depend on these and many more factors. A good house design is critically dependent not only on its architectural properties but also on engineers systematically evaluating its performance. Structural engineers model the resilience of the house under all expected loads, insulation specialists model its thermal properties and heating engineers size their systems based on these results and the likely behaviour of its occupants. Utility providers model the water, waste and power requirements, particularly where multiple houses are being built. Local authorities model the impact of new homes on the environment and on local services such as schools, hospitals, highways and waste collection. Governments model the demand for new homes based on expected patterns of migration. As a result, the house may be seen as an element in an extended system of systems. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 77 Elements of a systems approach Figure 22: Engineering the Olympics and delivering a system of systems The 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games provided an opportunity for London to deliver the best Games ever, but to do so required the delivery of not only the Games' distributed physical infrastructure (challenges on the left), but also the systems required to organise the single largest peacetime event in the world (on the right). Engineered systems often rely for their operation on a number of independent, but interrelated systems. For example, a satellite navigation system depends on the action and operation of a number of service providers (Figure 21). The degradation of any one of these systems or the interfaces between them will have an adverse impact on the navigation experience and possibly the safety of the vehicle occupants. Further systems, such as rocket launch vehicles, mapping technologies and voice recording studios, are also required to enable the successful deployment of a navigation system. Inevitably, the focus of individual development teams for these systems would have been dierent, particularly since GPS satellite arrays and mobile telecommunication systems were not initially designed with commercial navigation systems in mind. However, the architects of 'satnav' systems would have had a holistic vision for their system of systems and robust descriptions of the interfaces relevant to the individual elements and to the whole. Systems are designed at many levels of scale from the micro to the macro, where they often involve complex interactions between people, physical infrastructure and technology. This is exemplied by the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games: 205 competing nations, 17,000 athletes and ocials, 26 dierent sports, covered by 22,000 journalists and over 10 million tickets to be sold. An Act of Parliament established the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) with a budget of \u00a38 billion to deliver the infrastructure, venues, athletes' village and transport, all to time and budget, in a sustainable manner and to leave a lasting legacy. 56 56 Engineering the Olympics: The 2011 Lloyd's Register Educational Trust Lecture, Royal Academy of Engineering, 2001. 78 Royal Academy of Engineering The ODA commissioned a delivery partner to manage the construction of the Olympic Park in East London and to manage the complex logistics on the site. Both were similarly incentivised to ensure an alignment of objectives between the two teams to deliver a programme over six phases: Plan, Demolish, Build, Test, Games and Legacy. Their common purpose was to deliver the best Games ever and a lasting legacy for London. A number of interrelated elements were developed relating not only to the physical infrastructure required, but also to the practical organisation of the Games (Figure 22). The success of the Games and its legacy was critically dependent on early decisions relating to the Olympic Park, a challenging site that needed signicant redevelopment. Both the immediate and future needs were realised through the provision of temporary or recongurable sports venues, removable bridges alongside permanent structures and landscaping for the longer term. Innovative engineering delivered world-class, cost-eective buildings. Modelling and simulation of people flows informed provision of signage, refreshments, security, helpers, transport and information for visitors. Testing of new venues identied problems early, leading to better provision for athletes, ocials and visitors. The opening ceremony saw the choreographed actions of thousands of volunteers, athletes and ocials broadcast live to more than 900 million people worldwide. Extensive planning and risk management by the engineering-led team made the complex merely complicated. A systems approach, combined with tried and tested engineering methods and tools, delivered real success on a massive scale. Systems engineering enables the co-development of the individual components of a system through the rigorous denition of the whole and individual system requirements, careful design and integration of the parts, and sustained evaluation and improvement of the system performance. Further information on this topic can be obtained from the INCOSE UK Chapter. Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 79 Annex 4 Compilation of approaches Compilation of approaches This annex describes a number of approaches from the health and care improvement and engineering communities that have the potential to help teams understand people , deliver systems , facilitate design and manage risk (Section 2: Approaches to improvement , page 17). Most excel with one of these perspectives while some attempt to support a more holistic integrated systems approach. The approaches range from health and care improvement methods, such as the NHS change model, IHI model for improvement, leading large-scale change, human factors in healthcare, lean in healthcare, experience-based co-design and root cause analysis, to design-led safety management tools and human factors methods. Wherever possible references are provided for further information. 80 Royal Academy of Engineering Change Model The NHS Change Model is an organising framework for sustainable change and transformation that delivers potential benets for patients and the public. It was developed with senior leaders, clinicians, commissioners, providers and improvement activists to support health and care to adopt a shared approach to leading change and transformation. As a way of thinking, the model is relevant to numerous change programmes and provides an approach that can be tailored to t individual situations. It is a way of making sense at every level of the 'how and why' of delivering improvement, to consistently make a bigger dierence. The model has eight components that lead to a better understanding of how to create an environment and programme(s) that can make change happen: Our shared purpose Leadership by all Spread and adoption Improvement tools Project and performance management Measurement Influencing factors Motivate and mobilise www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/qual-clin-lead/ sustainableimprovement/change-model/ Model for improvement The model for improvement was developed by Associates in Process Improvement as a tool for accelerating improvement and has been adopted by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement as its primary framework for improvement in healthcare. The model has two parts: three fundamental questions, which can be addressed in any order; and the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle to test changes in real work settings in order to determine if the change is an improvement. Use of the model is widespread within the NHS due to its simplicity and ability to bring about rapid testing of ideas. Some criticism of its eectiveness has been raised, suggesting that it is poorly applied and often pursued through time-limited, small-scale projects, led by professionals who may lack the expertise, power or resources to instigate the changes required. The model for improvement ensures that teams know the purpose behind what they are trying to accomplish, understand what success will look like and identify those changes that will result in improvement. It also guides them through the process of establishing appropriate measures, creating changes, evaluating changes, implementing changes and spreading changes. www.ihi.org/resources/Pages/HowtoImprove/default.aspx futurehospital.rcpjournal.org/content/3/3/191.long Quality improvement journey - NHS Scotland The improvement journey is a structured approach that supports individuals and teams to test, implement and spread sustainable improvement across a system. The journey consists of seven stages, from identication of the need through to the successful delivery of change and its spread. Each stage provides a particular focus: discover \u2014 identifying the problem to x explore \u2014 further investigating the aim and dening success design \u2014 reviewing all the ideas for improving the system and establishing the priorities for improvement rene \u2014 identifying what has been learned from evaluating the change introduce \u2014 making the change happen spread \u2014 communicating success close \u2014 capturing lessons learned for the future. Each stage consists of a series of questions for quality improvers to consider as they carry out an improvement project. These link to suggested tools and resources that will help to further explore and analyse the wider aspects of improvements being made. The journey pays particular attention to cultural aspects of change in the 'introduce' and 'spread' sections, as well as capturing learning for future projects in the 'close' section. www.qihub.scot.nhs.uk/media/340181/2012 -06 -15_ measurement_improvement_journey_process.pdf Leading large-scale change The guide to leading large-scale change (LSC) was developed by managers and clinicians within the NHS and is based on experience and literature around large scale change. The guide includes change management tools such as: key planning questions, driver diagrams, structure / process / pattern thinking, 30/60/90 day cycles, and stakeholder analysis. LSC is dened as the emergent process of moving a large collection of individuals, groups, and organisations towards a vision of a fundamentally new future state, by means of: high-leverage key themes; a shift in power and a more distributed leadership; massive and active engagement of stakeholders; and mutually-reinforcing changes in multiple Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 81 Compilation of approaches systems and processes. This leads to such deep changes in attitudes, beliefs and behaviours that sustainability becomes largely inherent. Some of the key principles described in LSC may be summarised as: moving towards a new vision that is better and fundamentally dierent from the status quo identifying and communicating key themes that people can relate to and will make a big dierence framing the issues in ways that engage and mobilise the imagination, energy and will of a large number of diverse stakeholders continually refreshing the story and attracting new supporters transforming mind-sets, leading to inherently sustainable change. www.slideshare.net/NHSIQ/leading-large-scale-change- part-1 www.slideshare.net/NHSIQ/leading-large-scale-change- part-2 Human factors in healthcare Human factors is the science of understanding human performance within a given system. Translated into a healthcare context, human factors has been dened as enhancing clinical performance through an understanding of the eects of teamwork, tasks, equipment, workspace, culture, organisation on human behaviour and abilities, and application of that knowledge in clinical settings. Designing healthcare facilities, equipment and the delivery of care around an understanding of human behaviour is vital to reduce the potential for human error. This also helps healthcare sta to act as a barrier against harm. Human factors is a broad discipline that studies the relationship between human behaviour, system design and safety. Many healthcare organisations have carried out work on implementing human factors and the 'how to' guide aims to: broaden understanding among healthcare teams of the potential ways in which human factors methods can be applied to improve patient safety share practical experience of applying human factors in healthcare, using case studies from dierent care settings signpost healthcare teams to further information and resources to support them to implement human factors in their own organisations. chfg.org/best-practice/how-to-guide-to-human-factors- volume-2/ Root cause analysis Root cause analysis (RCA) is a class of problem solving methods, including shbone diagrams, Pareto charts and scatter diagrams, aimed at identifying the root causes of a problem or event. It is predicated on the belief that problems are best solved by attempting to address, correct or eliminate root causes, as opposed to merely addressing the immediately obvious symptoms. By identifying measures at the root cause, it is more probable that problem will not occur again. The principle behind RCA is to take a systems approach to identifying problems that increase the likelihood of errors while avoiding the trap of focusing on mistakes by individuals. Thus RCA identies both active errors (errors occurring at the point of interface between humans and a complex system) and latent errors (the hidden problems within healthcare systems that contribute to adverse events). The approach generally begins with the collection of prescribed data and reconstruction of the event through record review and participant interviews. Within healthcare, a multi-disciplinary team would analyse the sequence of events leading to the error, with the goals of identifying how the event occurred (through identication of active errors) and why it occurred (through systematic identication and analysis of latent errors). RCA is typically used as a reactive method of identifying event causes, revealing problems and solving them, where analysis is done after the event has occurred. Its ultimate impact is typically dependent on spending sucient time, eort and resources on risk control following the analysis. www.nrls.npsa.nhs.uk/rca/ qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/26/5/417 Systems thinking for health Systems thinking has its origins in the early 20th century in elds as diverse as engineering, economics and ecology. With the increasing emergence of complexity, these and other non-health disciplines developed systems thinking to understand and appreciate the relationships within any given system, and in designing and evaluating system-level interventions. Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strengthening oers a practical approach to improving health systems through a systems thinking lens. It works to reveal the underlying characteristics and relationships of systems, which are described as dynamic architectures of interactions and synergies. Such systems typically exhibit non-linear and unpredictable behaviour, are resistant to change, and provide a challenge where seemingly obvious solutions can worsen a problem. The framework describes 10 practical steps in a two-stage conceptual process that can be adapted to many dierent situations. Intervention design includes convening 82 Royal Academy of Engineering stakeholders, brainstorming, predicting performance, and adaptation and redesign. Evaluation design includes identication of indicators, choice of methods, selection of design, planning, budgeting and funding. www.who.int/alliance-hpsr/resources/ 9789241563895/en/ Experience-based co-design Experience-based co-design (EBCD) is an approach that enables sta and patients (or other service users) to co-design services and/or care pathways in partnership. The approach was designed for and within the NHS to develop simple solutions that oer patients a better experience of treatment and care. However, similar user-centric design techniques have been used by leading global companies for many years. EBCD gathers patient and sta experiences, through interviewing, observations and group discussions, and presents the insights gained in the form of a short edited lm. Informed by this, sta and patients collaboratively design and implement activities that will improve the service or the care pathway. Within health and care, the approach has been used in a range of clinical services, including cancer, diabetes, drug and alcohol treatment, emergency services, genetics, inpatient units, intensive care, mental health, orthopaedics, palliative care and surgical units. The EBCD toolkit outlines an approach to improving patients' experience of services. As well as step-by-step guidance, the toolkit includes videos of people who have taken part in EBCD projects. These help bring to life the successes and range of benets that can result from implementing this type of improvement project. The toolkit also includes downloadable resources such as template forms, letters and presentations. www.pointofcarefoundation.org.uk/resource/experience - based -co -design -ebcd -toolkit/ Lean in healthcare Lean thinking is an approach to improvement developed at Toyota in the 1950s to create the Toyota Production System. It is a strategic approach that focuses on dramatically improving flow in the value stream and eliminating waste. It initially came to prominence in health and care systems through The Productive Series: Releasing time to care , a programme developed by the NHS institute for Innovation and Improvement. Lean is typically a team process involving many people across an organisation. The Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, Washington has been using lean management principles since 2002. By working to eliminate waste, they have created more capacity in existing programmes and practices so that planned expansions were scrapped, saving signicant capital expenses. Using lean principles, sta, providers and patients have continuously improved or redesigned processes to eliminate waste, reduce rework and improve quality. Five UK Trusts are now piloting Virginia Mason's approach. Lean thinking is founded on ve principles designed to: specify the value desired by the patient map the value stream and identify those steps that do not create value create a smooth flow through the value-added steps establish pull between the steps seek perfection so that the number of steps and the amount of time and information needed to serve the patient are minimised. In essence, it focuses on improving patient flow, reducing opportunities for error, developing standards and engaging teams in improvement. It is increasingly used in conjunction with Six Sigma. productiveseries.com/lean-healthcare.html www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4833201/ Risk assessment made easy A risk assessment seeks to answer four simple, related questions: What can go wrong? How bad? How often? and Is there a need for action? It is not usually possible to eliminate all risks within a system, but healthcare sta have a duty to protect patients as far as 'reasonably practicable'. In practice, this means that there is an imperative to avoid any unnecessary risk. It is best to focus on the risks that really matter, such as those with the potential to cause harm. This tool is intended to encourage greater use at practice level, and increased awareness and understanding of risk assessment at all levels. It comprises ve simple steps: identify the hazards decide who might be harmed and how evaluate the risks and decide on the precautions record the ndings and proposed actions review the assessment. It is applicable and easily adapted for use in all care settings. Frontline sta may use this tool to identify hazards and decide whether they are signicant and whether appropriate and sucient controls or contingencies are in place to ensure that the associated risks are properly controlled. www.nrls.npsa.nhs.uk/resources/?EntryId45=59825 Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 83 Compilation of approaches Systems engineering Systems engineering has its origins in the 1930s and was conceived in response to the growing complexity of engineered products and their associated systems. It is a discipline that concentrates on the design and application of the whole (system) as distinct from the parts. It involves looking at a problem in its entirety, taking into account all the facets and all the variables and relating the social to the technical aspect. Systems engineering is an iterative process of top-down synthesis, development, and operation of a real-world system that satises, in a near optimal manner, the full range of requirements for the system. It is an interdisciplinary approach that focuses on dening customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, and then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem: operations, cost and schedule, performance, training and support, test, manufacturing and disposal. The INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook denes the discipline and practice of systems engineering for novice and practising professionals. It provides an authoritative reference to understand the discipline in terms of content and practice. incoseonline.org.uk/Normal_Files/Publications/SE_Handbook. aspx?CatID=Publications&SubCat=INCOSEPublications Human-centered design Human-centered design (HCD) oers problem solvers a chance to design with communities: to deeply understand the people they're looking to serve; to dream up scores of ideas; and to create innovative new solutions rooted in people's actual needs. It encourages the belief that all problems, even the seemingly intractable ones, like poverty, gender equality, and clean water, are solvable. Moreover, it means believing that the people who face those problems every day are the ones who hold the key to their answer. HCD is dened by making; embracing ambiguity; and learning from failure. Together, these encourage fearless yet grounded creativity, leading to innovation and solutions never dreamed of when projects are started. HCD has been used to successfully tackle an array of design challenges, from social enterprises to communication campaigns to medical devices. The eld guide to HCD from IDEO presents design as an iterative process comprising three main phases: inspiration \u2014 understanding people, their hopes and desires ideation \u2014 generating ideas, testing and rening them implementation \u2014 taking the idea to market and maximising its impact. Numerous practical tools are provided to assist each stage. www.ideo.com/us/post/design-kit Six sigma Six sigma is an approach to improvement developed at Motorola in the 1980s, which focuses on removing the causes of defects and reducing variation in processes. It has a meticulous focus on understanding wide-ranging customer needs, prioritising these and designing processes and systems to deliver to those needs. Its purpose is derived from the desire to achieve a performance level equivalent to a defect rate of 3.4 defects per million opportunities. Six sigma uses a disciplined and systematic approach look at the improvement journey from a number of related perspectives: dene; measure; analyse; improve; and control (DMAIC). Six sigma is typically a facilitated process where experts use qualitative and quantitative techniques to drive process improvement. Although the tools themselves are not unique, the way they are applied and integrated as part of a system is. Six sigma professionals undergo extensive training to be able to select and use tools to evaluate a process from various perspectives and determine which activities are to be improved. It has been embraced by a number of US companies, while application in the UK health system is more limited. Six sigma tools help to: dene a problem, improvement opportunity or requirements measure process performance analyse processes to determine root causes of variation, defects or poor performance improve process performance by addressing root causes control the improved process and future performance. It is increasingly used in conjunction with lean thinking. asq.org/learn-about-quality/six-sigma/tools.html Inclusive design Inclusive design (ID) is the design of mainstream products and/or services that are accessible to, and usable by, as many people as reasonably possible without the need for special adaptation or specialised design. It applies to all parts of a user journey, not only to the recipients of care, but also the providers of care and care services. At the core of ID is a user-focused systems design process and the realisation that every design decision has the potential to include or exclude people. Inclusive design 84 Royal Academy of Engineering emphasises the contribution that understanding user diversity makes to informing these decisions, and thus to including as many people as possible. In this context, user diversity covers variation in capabilities, needs and aspirations, while care is also taken to address broader issues relating to people, prot and planet. The ID toolkit provides a step-by-step guide to the use of the explore, create and evaluate design cycle, embedded in the context of the identify and locate activities that relate to the people engaged with the systems and its location. This process is directly informed by the purpose of the system, a deep understanding of stakeholder and user needs and a sense of what success looks like. www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/ Risk management Risk management is the coordinated set of activities used to direct and control an organisation with regard to risk. All activities within an organisation involve some level of risk. Successful organisations manage such risk by identifying it, analysing it, and then evaluating whether the risk should be modied in order to satisfy their risk criteria. Such risk management can be applied to an entire organisation, and its many areas and levels, at any time, as well as to specic functions, projects and activities. The practice of risk management has been developed over time and within many sectors to meet diverse needs. The adoption of consistent processes within a clear framework ensures that risk is managed eectively, eciently and coherently across an organisation. Risk management should be both proactive and reactive, and an integral part of an organisation's governance, management, culture and practice. ISO 31000:2009 and IEC 31010:2009 are international standards for risk management that provide comprehensive principles, guidelines and tools to help organisations manage risk. They are designed to: assist proactive assessment improve identication of opportunities and threats increase the likelihood of meeting risk targets improve the engagement of all stakeholders in the management of risk. www.iso.org/standard/43170.html www.iso.org/standard/51073.html System safety assessment System safety assessment (SSA) is a method designed to help health and care professionals think about 'what could go wrong' in a system, which could be anything from a care pathway to a project plan for a service improvement, to a new ward or even the movement of a service from acute care to the community. SSA is a process for proactively thinking about and addressing potential problems, either so they can be prevented from happening in the rst place or so that their consequences can be reduced to an acceptable level. At the core of SSA is a standard process for managing risks. The principles are likely to be familiar to many people involved in health and care, but the systematic and proactive way in which it is done may be less so. Current healthcare risk assessments typically focus on 'health and safety' risks, such as the risk of slips, trips and falls. Conversely, SSA is flexible and can focus on a wide range of risks, including clinical, project management, nancial and organisational risks. The SSA toolkit provides a step-by-step guide to the use of proactive risk assessment, beginning with the trigger and assessing risks through the examine (organise), assess and improve (create) stages of the risk management cycle. www.ssatoolkit.com/toolkit/ Engineering better care -a systems approach to health and care design and continuous improvement 85 Bibliography This bibliography represents a sample of the resources available describing perspectives on a systems approach.

The Royal Academy of Engineering led the forum, in collaboration with the Royal College of Physicians and the Academy of Medical Sciences. It generated thought leadership from a group of people who would never otherwise have met and generated a network of engaged organisations and individuals committed to taking this framework into action. Designed and facilitated by Emma Adams and Pete Dudgeon, the project ran a suite of workshops in autumn 2016 focusing on dierent perspectives of a systems approach. Workshop 1: A systems perspective 21 September 2016 at the Royal Academy of Engineering Workshop 2: A design perspective 28 September 2016 at the Academy of Medical Sciences Workshop 3: A risk perspective 5 October 2016 at the Royal College of Surgeons Workshop 4: Integration and dissemination planning 2 November 2016 at the Royal Academy of Engineering The majority of participants attended all workshops and included: patient leaders acute trust clinicians and physicians who are leading transformation programmes system engineers (including INCOSE UK members) RCP Future Hospital Programme NHS Improvement improvement charities and funders service providers including pharmacy, mental health services and housing clinicians and managers involved in quality improvement and service design. This work was the continuation of a preliminary study conducted by Engineering the Future , led by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE), the Institute of Healthcare Engineering and Estate Management (IHEEM), and the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) that explored the importance of engineering to health and care.
