But no one speaks with more authority on the power of self-healing than Andreas Moritz. In this empowering book, Moritz - author of 16 books on the power of self-healing and supportive natural remedies, and an internationally acclaimed practitioner of Ayurveda and natural medicine - offers hope to patients of Alzheimer's disease and their families, and provides a roadmap for recovery. In his typically cogent style, Moritz convincingly exposes the lies of Big Pharma and their vested interest in keeping Alzheimer's patients trapped in their terrifying predicament. He argues against medical doctors whose questionable ethics and diagnoses put the death fright into their patients, virtually coaxing them towards an untimely death. Most importantly, he backs up his statements with empirical research. Moritz goes on to deconstruct Alzheimer's and demonstrate how the disease is nothing but the body's cry for help. He explains how the condition is a result of sustained toxic overload that suffocates and inflames the brain. Considering modern lifestyles and the careless disregard for health that comes as baggage, this book is more relevant than ever today. After tracing the genesis of the disease, Andreas Moritz discusses its prevention and the healing that can be achieved even after its onset. He lists potent remedies that can detoxify a dying brain and provides numerous supporting therapeutic measures that can restore a toxic brain to optimal health. Often, the results can be remarkable! Insights offered in the book cover a wide spectrum, including: Alzheimer's disease could happen to anyone The mind-body connection Natural aging vs. Alzheimer's Is brain shrinkage really just a part of aging? Environmental causes of Alzheimer's Use technology wisely The dangers of mercury, present in vaccines Fluoride: what you don't know could poison you Aluminum is bad for your brain Lifestyle is everything Get up and get exercising: whatever you do, keep moving Some diets can lead to Alzheimer's; a healthy diet cuts Alzheimer's risk by 40% Keep your weight in check: obesity can slow the mind Dangers of diabetes How are your B12 vitamin levels? Importance of good sleep Are you getting enough sunlight? Dehydration and the brain: are you drinking enough water? The importance of regular cleanses Superfoods for super protection: from turmeric, to blueberries, apples and nuts Exercise your brain; keep your mind active The healing power of the mind is real Miracle of spontaneous disease remission In this book, Andreas Moritz describes the subtle but powerful role of the mind in Alzheimer's and explores a spiritual connection with the disease. At the heart of his message is the basic truth - the first step to getting back on the road to recovery is to believe in the body's innate ability to heal itself. Andreas Moritz was an author, lecturer, and practitioner in the field of alternative and integrative medicine. He wrote over a dozen books on various subjects pertaining to holistic health, and much of his life's work has been dedicated to understanding and treating the root of causes of illness and helping the body to naturally heal itself. He is most well known for his books The Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush, Timeless Secrets of Health and Rejuvenation, and Cancer Is Not a Disease. This is one of the best health books I've ever read. Not only does it give us vital information about how to prevent, treat and perhaps reverse Alzheimer's - though the author doesn't promise that it is an outright cure -, but it also provides essential, general information about how to live in the healthiest way, and prevent and treat poor health in general. As regards Alzheimer's, I'm also fed up with hearing people say \"there's nothing to be done\" or \"it's too late to do anything\", when these things are patently not true. People seem to think that because doctors can offer no effective treatment, then there's no hope. This is false. Alzheimer's is not a natural form of aging but a lifestyle disease. These diseases are a \"predictable consequence of long-term toxic overload that congests, inflames and suffocates the brain\". Unhealthy diets and lifestyles, exposure to harmful chemicals and long-term consumption of pharmaceutical drugs deprive the brain of the oxygen and nutrients it needs to keep functioning. The author makes it clear how the \"treatments\" prescribed by the doctor only benefit Big Pharma. \"Conventional medicine cannot make an iota of difference to Alzheimer's.\" We are not victims of disease, as the drug companies would have us believe, We need to take back our own power, take responsibility for leading healthier lives, and believe in our body's power to self-heal. There are many effective treatments for Alzheimer's that we can put to immediate use. The area of the brain most affected is the temporal lobe, which is responsible for conscious recollection. One main reason for cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is a build-up in the brain of a protein called beta-amyloid, which accumulates as a result of inflammation. A range of factors contributes to this inflammation: poor nutrition or absorption, lack of exercise, accumulation of heavy metals, and consumption of excitotoxins which include artificial food additives, fluoride, aluminium and other environmental poisons. We are advised that Vitamin B12 deficiency has the same symptoms as Alzheimer's, and doctors often fail to check for this deficiency. If high doses of B12 are started soon after the deficiency is detected, the neurological degeneration can be reversed. Causes of Alzheimer's include 1) toxic chemicals including mercury from dental fillings and vaccines 2) excess sunscreen use and sun avoidance 3) fluoride 4) aluminium 5) radiation from cell phones 6) low frequency magnetic fields found in power lines and microwave ovens 7) poor life style with lack of exercise and diet of processed foods 8) foods high in saturated fat and food with a high glycemic index 9) fried foods (trans fats) 10) high-protein diets, which contribute to brain shrinkage 11) sugar addiction 12) diabetes 13) obesity 14) gallstones in the liver (see the author's book \"The Liver and Gallbladder Miracle Cleanse\" for advice on how to remove these 15) stress 16) lack of sleep 17) lack of Vitamin D 18) Use of anti-psychotic drugs 19) emotional factors including unresolved traumas and unfinished business. Together with the factors already mentioned, install a home water filter, don't sleep next to your cell phone, and avoid pharmaceuticals whenever possible. Help your body detoxify itself by staying hydrated and take natural supplements like cilantro, chlorella and spirulina to help eliminate heavy metals like aluminium and mercury. \"Stay active, stay positive, stimulate your mind consistently and get at least eight hours' sleep every night.\" These basic steps are an excellent start to preventing not only Alzheimer's but a host of other chronic diseases. A diet rich in folic acid (found in leafy, green vegetables and citrus fruits) can protect the brain from the neurological damage associated with Alzheimer's and even repair it after it occurs. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, walnuts and flaxseeds were found to slow the progression of Alzheimer's symptoms in mice. Another study showed that people over age 75 had a lower incidence of Alzheimer's simply by playing cards, solving puzzles, learning a musical instrument, dancing or even reading. We need to \"go green\" and detox our environment. Dangerous chemicals are found in our kitchens and bathrooms. The author provides a long list of all these, also indicating in which products they're found. He includes information about the harmful effects of eating microwave prepared food. Research indicates that this can cause loss of memory and concentration, emotional instability and a decline in intelligence. Microwaves dip the food's vital energy field. This was noted in up to 90% of all microwave-prepared food. B-complex, C and E vitamins and essential trace minerals are rendered useless by microwaves. This food is reduced to the nutritional equivalent of cardboard (!). Plants given microwaved water die within seven days. The microwave oven \"whipsaws water molecules dizzyingly back-and-forth more than a billion reversals per second .... fractures food molecules, rearranging their chemical composition into weird new configurations unrecognizable as food by the human body\". The author says this \"food\" turns into \"nuclear waste\". You need to avoid aluminium, non-stick cookware and aluminium foil. Stainless steel cookware also contains \"a toxic brew of different metal alloys, including lead, cadmium, aluminium, copper, nickel, chromium and iron\". He includes a section about the dangers of cell phones, cell towers, etc. The WHO calls mobile phones a \"Class B carcinogen\". Most patients today suffer from \"thirst disease\", a progressive state of dehydration. Those who have lived for many years without proper water intake are likely to succumb to the build-up of toxins in the body. \"Chronic disease is always accompanied by dehydration and in many cases caused by it.\" \"Heart disease ... cancer, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and many other chronic diseases are precipitated by years of body drought. Infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses cannot thrive in a well-hydrated body.\" The use of painkillers sabotages waste elimination and sows the seeds of chronic illness. The body's natural pain signals are normal responses to an abnormal situation, which may be \"simple dehydration\". (See \"Your body's many cries for water\" by Batmanghelidj.) Pain-killers can have fatal side-effects e.g. cause gastrointestinal bleeding which kills thousands every year. For every cup of coffee or tea or glass of beer you drink, the body is forced to \"sacrifice\" about three glasses of water. A hangover results when the brain suffers serious dehydration. Eventually, a huge number of brain cells become damaged and die. The author recommends regular cleanses of the colon, liver, gallbladder and kidneys (see his above-mentioned book). \"Much of the food we eat is SOAKED in chemical fertilizers and pesticides and grown from genetically modified (GMO) seeds\". The optimal health diet is the Mediterranean diet (coupled with regular exercise). This diet includes an abundance of fresh produce, including leafy greens, tomatoes, citrus and other foods, and also foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as nuts, fish and extra virgin olive oil. Also, consumption of vitamins B, C, D and E makes a big difference in maintaining a \"sharp cognitive ability well into the autumn of one's life\". Not the winter of one's life? According to research, eating the Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's by as much as 40 percent. People who ate less red meat, dairy products and processed foods, and more fruits, nuts, fish, cruciferous vegetables and dark, leafy greens were least likely to develop the disease. High doses of B-vitamins significantly slow brain shrinkage and progression of dementia. The author mentions various spices and supplements that help prevent Alzheimer's. These include turmeric, cumin, sage, cinnamon, rosemary, blueberries, strawberries, grapes, pomegranate juice, nuts, particularly walnuts, which resemble the brain in appearance, seeds, omega-3 fatty acids, astaxanthin, niacinamide (B3) and alpha lipoic acid. Though consumption of baked and broiled fish stops our brain from shrinking, it is essential to be choosy about which fish you partake of, since most fish is contaminated by mercury (and now radiation - my comment!). \" ... the most influential factors linked to developing Alzheimer's are: low education, smoking, physical inactivity, depression, midlife hypertension, diabetes and midlife obesity\". Except for smoking and low education, all these risk factors have to do with how much or little you exercise. The improved blood flow to the brain which results from exercise helps in the removal of accumulated environmental toxins. Exercise also stimulates the growth of new brain cells and strengthens the connection between existing ones. \"Exercise is a potent preventative and even reverser of cognitive decline.\" Stay away from smoking and drinking alcohol, drink clean, fresh water, get enough sleep and avoid vaccinations, which can cause serious damage to the nervous system and other vital organs. Repeated vaccinations can set us up for diseases such as autism, Alzheimer's and many others. There is an encouraging chapter entitled \"Curing Alzheimer's after outset\". The author insists that it is almost never too late to get your health back on track. Don't give up, listen to what your body and the disease are telling you and actively support the healing process by living as \"balanced and pure\" a lifestyle as possible. Drugs speed up the process of the individual's decline. Though the disease may have no \"complete cure\", the brain has incredible regenerative abilities. When your brain is under-used and under-stimulated, it will naturally start to lose its cognitive function. Continuous mental stimulation helps to create new connections and strengthen existing ones in the brain. It has been found that even mild learning has \"big effects at reducing Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive decline\". Now, I would just mention alpha lipoic acid (which I take against cataracts and high blood sugar), flavonoids (found in berries, grapes, oranges, lemons, etc,), caffeine, olive oil, coconut oil (my favourite), vitamin D and turmeric. There's a final chapter entitled \"Why Alzheimer's need not scare you\". Well, I'm not scared about the prospect of getting Alzheimer's after reading this wildly encouraging book. The author reminds us that \"the power to improve your health lies with you, and you alone\". To sum up, this is an excellent, comprehensive book, filled with helpful advice of every kind to prevent, delay, and even reverse this disease. And this advice is backed up by innumerable studies. There are references and links to these at the back of the book. The author is somewhat repetitive, but in my view this does not diminish the book's value, since repetition helps us absorb this valuable information. Please inform the families of all Alzheimer patients you know, or the patients themselves, of this book. If its advice is implemented, it could prolong the lives of the patients by many good years. zwalcza. "}
