Physical Education refers to Education through physical activities \"to achieve all round development of an individual\". And for achieving this aim, the objectives must include - physical development cognitive development social development emotional development and development of motor skills of the learner. Physical Education has moved from being an extra-curricular part of school syllabus to being an integral part of the curriculum since UN convention on the rights of the child on May 1st 2012, brought in through article 31 \"The child's right to play\". In India, too, with the focus on \"Swasth Bharat\", the primary thrust is on wellness, preventive health care and awareness. This makes it essential that physical fitness issues are addressed at different levels of schooling. With this objective, CBSE has made Physical Education compulsory in schools and is in the process of developing textbooks on Physical Education for Classes XI and XII to train children for a healthier lifestyle. A sound Sports Policy must regulate the implementation of school sport consistently for all learners, irrespective of ability, across all schools in an age appropriate way based on the principle of equity. This policy applies to all the schools affiliated to CBSE. Keeping in mind the need for inclusion and the right for each child to good health, there is a chapter on Physical Education and Sports for Children with Special Needs that deals with the meaning and importance of adapted physical education and the role of special educators for Children with Special Needs (CWSN). As an essential part of education, Physical Education helps the learners acquire skills that improve their performance, sharpens knowledge of strategy and tactics, and helps them to transfer knowledge from one context to another, including sport and recreational and outdoor activities. Participation in Sports and Games builds confidence, teaches the necessary knowledge and skills for working with and relating to others, and provides the learning opportunities to develop skills like qualities of leadership and teamwork skills. This learning is transferred to other learning areas, when, for example, students cooperate and work together in groups in other subjects in the school setting and in their lives outside school. As students learn 'in, through, and about' movement, they gain an understanding that movement is integral to human expression and can enhance their lives. By demonstrating the benefits of an active life style, they encourage others to participate in sports, dance, exercise, recreation, and adventure pursuits. Physical Education provides a solid foundation for preparing our citizens to live healthy life by involving in active lifestyle and also helps to prepare a base of a pyramid where excellence is at the top. It provides a pathway into the many careers that involve working with people, such as education, health, justice, and the social services. As a subject of study, this textbook of Physical Education highlights a holistic understanding of health, focussing on the importance of exercise, games and sports, nutrition and the environment. This book also discusses the psycho-social and mental 2 health related issues of not just sportspersons, but also children at large and collective responsibilities for healthy community living. About the Book The Textbook of Physical Education has a goal-oriented, activity-based and investigative approach . Learning Outcomes are laid out before each chapter listing the desired goals the learner must imbibe in each lesson. Learning Outcomes are assessment standards indicating the expected levels of learning that children should achieve for that Lesson. These outcomes can be used as check points to assess learning and would help teachers to understand the learning levels of children in their respective classes individually as well as collectively. Holistic Learning refers not only to an all-round development of the learner, but also to a cross-curricular approach. It also means learning must be related to life. The Discussion section that precedes each chapter encourages the learner to examine existing knowledge and to relate what he is learning to his/her life. The learning thereby becomes more meaningful to the child. Physical education engages and energises students. It provides authentic contexts in which to learn. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this subject , cross references have also been integrated into the curriculum. There is a chapter on Anatomy and Physiology and on Psychology. Students challenge themselves to develop their physical and interpersonal skills. The approach towards learning is Experiential or learning through experience . This is distinct from rote or didactic learning, in which the learner plays a comparatively passive role. Experiential learning entails a hands-on approach to learning that moves away from just the teacher at the front of the room imparting and transferring their knowledge to students. It makes learning an experience that moves beyond the classroom and strives to bring a more involved way of learning. Extension Activities are an integral part of the Book and students learn as they research, conduct surveys, debate, discuss, write and draw cartoons and design posters. They experience movement and understand the role that it plays in their lives. Additional information has been given in a box in the Do You Know Section which provides some input, thereby encouraging students to research and acquire additional information. The Art Integration Section suggests certain activities that will entice the students to construct knowledge, and explore novel ways at expressing their learning thereby developing their understanding and problem-solving abilities. The Extension Activities and Activities in the Art Integration Section are suggestions. They could be modified or adapted to suit classroom situations and needs. 3 Unit 1 : Changing Trends and Careers in Physical Education Content Meaning and Definition of Physical Education Aims and Objectives of Physical Education C areer Options in Physical Education Competitions in Various Sports at National and International Level Khelo India Programme L earning Outcomes At the end of this unit, you will be able to: recognize the concept of Physical Edu cation identify the aims and objectives of Physical Edu cation explore different career options in the field of Physical Education clas sify various sports competitions at Nat i onal and International level understand K h elo India Programme DISCUSSION : READ THE NEWSPAPER CLIPPING GIVEN BELOW. Discuss in your group What do you think CBSE's Health and Physical Education Programme includes? Why has CBSE decided to make Health and Physical Education Programme compulsory for schools? Do you think school students are in need of such a Programme? Why/Whynot? Why is the Programme aimed especially for class 9 to 12? If you were to design the Programme, what features would it include? Why? Present your ideas to the class. CBSE Makes Physical Education Compulsory in Schools New Delhi: Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has introduced a streamlined and well- designed Health and Physical Education Programme to mainstream health and physical education in schools especially for students of classes 9 to 12. This Programme will be introduced from next session and will be compulsory for all affiliated schools of the Board. \"CBSE has decided to main stream Health and Physical Education for classes IX to XII with the aim of holistic development of the child, leading to a well-balanced individual in all walks of life,\" said a statement from the board. \"The aim of main streaming Health and Physical Education is also to enable the students to attain an optimum state of health. Therefore, CBSE aims to provide a focussed curriculum for Health and Physical Education imbued with Life Skills in all its affiliated schools,\" the statement added. Keeping this in view, CBSE has asked schools that while preparing timetable for session 2018-19, one period every day may be reserved for Health and Physical Education especially for class 9 to 12 from session 2018-19 onwards. 4 If a survey was to be conducted and individuals asked what they understood when they heard the term Physical Education, the response could possibly be that physical education is knowledge related to sports activity, sports education, sports coaching, health education, education about yoga or anything related to individual fitness. But is this really Physical Education? Not totally. Physical Education is all of the above and something more. While the above-mentioned activities are associated with Physical Education, they are not all that Physical Education is about. In an essence Physical Education uses physical activity or movement to bring about positive changes in the physical, mental, and emotional make-up of an individual. It is a broad field of education which deals with the relationship between physical wellbeing and movement and other domains of education. Physical Education is a combination of two separate words, physical and education . The first word is physical which means related to body or related to any one or all of the bodily characteristics, that include physical strength, physical endurance, physical fitness, physical appearance and physical health . And, the second word is education which means preparation for life or systematic instruction andtraining . When we look at the combined meaning of these two words, we can understand that physical education is a systematic training of an individual by using his/her own body to achieve the objectives of developing and maintaining the body, developing motor skills, physical abilities, making a habit of living a healthy lifestyle, developing the ability to control emotions for a fuller living . Physical Education is more than sports education. Let us see how some eminent scholars have defined Physical Education. 1.1.1 MEANING OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION 1.1.2 DEFINITION OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION Physical Education is the sum of those experiences which come to the individual through movement. -Delbert Oberteuffer Physical Education is an integral part of the total educational process. It is a field of endeavour that has as its aim the improvement of human performance through the medium of physical activities that have been selected with a view to realizing this outcome. - Charles A. Bucher Physical Education is the sum of man's physical activities selected as to kind, and conducted as to outcomes. -Jesse Feiring Williams Physical Education is that phase of the whole field of education that deals with the big muscle activities and their related responses. -Jay B. Nash To sum up, Physical Education is a process of education which aims at the holistic development of an individual by using physical activity or body movement. 5 So, in a broader context, Physical Education may be defined as a teaching-learning process where physical activities are used as medium of instruction, and these physical activities aredesigned in such a manner as to improve physical fitness, motor skills, knowledge, sportsmanship, emotional stability and healthy behaviour. Figure: An illustration of Physical Education The evolution of Physical Education as a discipline has covered a long journey. In the past it has been known by many other labels. Most of them are now considered too narrow and restricted to cover the entire scope of Physical Education. Physical Education evolved from gymnastics (during 1800s) to hygiene to physical culture to physical training and now is known as Physical Education . Figure: Evolution of Physical Education As we know, the needs of the youth today are different from those of the youth of yester years. This holds true in the field of education more than in any other sphere. Changes in the society are reflected in the education system, and education system of yesterday will not meet the needs of today's students. In the modern context, Physical Education lays a strong emphasis on achieving overall fitness and wellbeing rather than only physical fitness through body movement. In fact, Physical Education is now called movement education. It indicates how the body moves to develop efficient motoractivity. Movement is basically governed by mechanical principles. A person must know the forces that act on the body in movement so that the movement is meaningful. Movement is affected by diverse factors such as physical fitness, emotional aspects pertaining to fear and anxiety and, even, atmospheric changes. 1.1.3 CURRENT TRENDS IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION 6 Do you know? There are two types of movements Locomotor and Non- locomotor. Movement such as walking, running, hopping, leaping, skipping, galloping are examples of locomotor movements . Movements such as stretching, twisting, turning, pushing, pulling and swinging are non-locomotor movements . Movement is integral to all human beings. It includes both locomotor movement skills, such as running, jumping etc., which are necessary movements, and non-locomotor movements like twisting, turning etc. Movement is also a means of communication. In movement education, individuals have the freedom of self-exploration and are encouraged to find their own solutions to problems involving movements. They choose methods that are best suited to their abilities and perform movements that they desire. In movement education classes, students are given the freedom to follow their own methods of movement. It is, therefore, essential the curriculum followed in the Physical Education Programme focuses on the overall fitness of a human being which is the need of today's youth and of the country as well, educating individuals to value their overall fitness by suggesting to them how can they improve and assess it. Total education of a child cannot be imagined without Physical Education being an integral part of the curriculum. A well-structured and well-implemented Physical Education Programme is the burning need of the current education system. Study the following diagram to learn what a quality Physical Education Programme can offer to students. 1. Improves Physical Fitness: Regular physical activity contributes immensely to students'overall physical fitness and wellbeing through development of muscular strength and improvement of cardiovascular health. 2. Develops Skill: Regular participation in the Physical Education Programme is essential to the development of motor skills and the enhancement of reflexes. 1.1.4 SIGNIFICANCE OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMME IN SCHOOLS 7 Improvement in hand-eye coordination and body movement, which helps in the development of a healthy bodyposture. 3. Encourages Physical Growth and Development: For proper growth and developments it is important all our organs and systems function optimally. Regular participation in physical activity leads to an improvement in the absorption of nutrients by the body, thereby improving digestive processes and increasing physiological processes. 4. Enhances Intellectual Development: On the sports field one has to take very quick and smart decisions, at times instantaneously. Participation in physical activity and sports helps us reach that level of intelligence where problem-solving becomes part of nature. 5. Leads to Emotional Control and Development: While participating in sports and games, different situations arise where participants learn the art of controlling their emotions and overcoming negative emotions like anger and frustration. 6. Promotes Social Adjustment: Physical activities such as games and sports provide ample opportunities for interaction between fellow participants and others which enable participants to learn social qualities and values like sportsmanship, cooperation, honesty, friendship, fellowship, courtesy, self- discipline, and respect for authority which promote social adjustment. 7. Facilitates Personal Adjustment: Physical Education provides a worthwhile experience for self-expression in varied situations, which facilitates personal adjustment in society. Students involved in sports show higher self-esteem and are more socially competent and less shy and withdrawn. 8. Enhances Neuro-muscular Development: Physical activities lead to neuro- muscular coordination, especially if various types of skills and exercises are carried out repeatedly over a long period of time. For carrying out a task accurately or learning a skill, a good neuromuscular control is in dispensable. 9. Promotes Cultural Integration: Sports and physical activities play an important role in the cultures of all peoples. During such competitive activity, individuals from different cultures mingle with each other and come to know about the customs, traditions, and way of life of others, thereby promoting cultural development. 10. Develops Leadership Qualities: Self-concept, intelligence, loyalty, honesty, dedication, and resourcefulness are some of the qualities of a good leader. Opportunities for cultivation of these character traits are available on the sports field, and the playground is a good laboratory for developing these characteristics. 11. Develops Health and Safety Habits: While participating in any physical activity or sport sports persons have to wear protective gear as well as follow safety rules. This becomes a habit and inculcates healthy and safe habits amongst the students. 12. Develops Democratic Values and Citizenship Quality: Physical Education teaches the art of winning and losing gracefully, the spirit of being fair to others, observing of rules, maintaining a friendly attitude and respect for others, as well as patriotism which are essential to democratic living.8 13. Encourages Constructive Use of Leisure Time: Students have a lot of energy and when they engage in any sort of physical activity that surplus energy is efficiently utilized. If they are not involved in physical activity, they may utilise that surplus energy in ways that are undesirable. Physical Education provides students an opportunity to use their free time constructively. 14. Improves Expression and Creativity: Human body is the main tool in Physical Education for showing expression and creativity. In Physical Education when an individual performs any skill, he/she brings his/her own unique element into it,which is based on his/her expressive ability and creativity. 15. Develops Economic Values: Physical Education is fast emerging as a profitable profession. It offers numerous opportunities for business and for self-employment, as well as employment in various agencies at various levels. The concept of sponsorship of players, teams and events by corporate houses, that is fast entering sports arena, has provided a new and meaningful dimension to it. 16. Helps in Mental Relaxation: Physical activity promotes secretion of feel-good chemicals called endorphins in the brain that improve the mood, reduce anxiety and enhance self-esteem, thereby making the player more relaxed. Physical activities such as yoga, aerobics, fitness Programmes, recreational activities, sports and games help in relieving and reducing mental stress and anxiety causedby modern lifestyle. These activities divert attention from stressful situations andprovide an outlet for frustration.Thus, physical activity becomes an outlet for releasing tension and stress, and facilitates emotional stability and resilience. 17. Improved Self-confidence and Self-esteem: Physical Education provides a stronger sense of self-worth in every player and sportsperson. This makes the individual more confident, assertive, independent and self-controlled when performing any physical activity. 18. Helps in Goal Setting: Physical Education is a systematic process of education, where individuals are trained to achieve short-term, long-term and specific goals. Therefore, it prepares individuals to set personal, achievable goals in life and strive for achieving them. I. Tick the correct option. 1. In 1800s Physical Education was known as i.

Jesse Feiring Williams defined Physical Education as \"the sum of man's physical activities selected as to kind, and conducted as to outcomes\". Elucidate this definition, and give examples how it would be interpreted in practice.10 Physical Education is \"education through movement\". It aims to maximize our physical ability, leading us to be healthy, knowledgeable, skilful, creative, productive and influential in all walks of life. Thus, the aim of Physical Education is the optimal and wholesome development of the individual for complete living, as well as optimum performance in sports competitions. According to National Plan of Physical Education and Recreation, \"The aim of Physical Education must be to make every child physically, mentally and emotionally fit and also to develop in him such personal and social qualities as will help him to live happily with others and build him up as a good citizen.\" Extension Activity Discuss with your group What are the short-term effects of exercise? What changes take place in your body if you exercise regularly over an extended period of time? Are these changes obvious e.g., building of muscles, loss of body fatetc.?

Olympic Games or Olympics get their name from Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece or Olympia, a town in Elis in ancient Greece. The festival and games began in 776 BCE at Olympia. At first, the only event at Olympia was the foot race. Later, sprints wearing full armour, and longer races, were added. Chariot racing and combat sports such as box in gandwrestling were soon regular features too. The open-air track for horse racing was called a hippodrome. The participants were free male citizens of different city states within Greece. All participants had to receive 10-month training prior to the Olympic Games. Women were not allowed to participate in the games. In fact, they were not even allowed to attend or witness the games. There was, however, a loophole to this rule - chariot owners, not riders, were declared Olympic champions and anyone could own a chariot. Kyniska, daughter of a Spartan king, took advantage of this, claiming victory wreaths in 396BCE and 392BCE. The games were conducted every four years and the period between two games was known as Olympiad. The month when the Olympic Games were held was considered a scared month and all disputes and wars would be stopped and peace would be declared to facilitate the movement of spectators and athletes. Initially, the truce lasted for one month butin later centuries it was extended to three. No wars were permitted, no arms could be carried in the territory of Elis and no hindrance was to be given to any spectator, athlete or theoriai - (the official missions representing particular cities) travelling to the games wherever they came from and whichever territory they had to cross. For the first 12 Olympics the stadion foot race was the only event and it remained the most prestigious event throughout the history of the Games. The race was run over one length (a stadion ) of the stadium track, 600 ancient feet or 192 m and preliminary heats were held with the winners of the heats going into the finals. 2.1.1 ANCIENT OLYMPIC GAMES Do you know? It is said that when the Persians invaded Greece in the summer of 480BCE, a lot of the Greek city states agreed that they would put to gether an allied army but they had a very hard time getting one together because so many people wanted to go to the Olympics. So, they actually had to delay putting the army together to defend the country against the Persians. Do you know? The ancient Olympic Games were initially a one-day event until 684BCE, when they were extended to three days. In the 5thcentury BCE, the Games were extended again to cover five days. The ancient Games included running, long jump, shot put, javelin, boxing, pankration and equestrian events. 43Do you know? The Olympic Games included diaulos -the two stadium lengths foot race, added in 724 BCE. dolichos -longer foot races 7 to 20 stadium lengths, added in 720 BCE. wrestling -added in 708 BCE. Competitors had to throw the opponent to the ground three times to gain victory. pentathlon - also added in 708 BCE. All done in a single day, the event order was: jumping (in a soft soil pit using hand-weights or halteres and accompanied music), discuss (instone, ironorbronze), stadion , javelin (in wood and thrown using aleatherthong), and wrestling. Just how an athlete won the over all event is unclear, three event victories may have guaranteed overall victory. boxing - added in 688 BCE. Athletes wore straps of leather ( himantes ) around their hands, initially as protection but they evolved in to destructive weapons with metal pieces added. Rules were limited to no low-blows and noholding. Serious injuries were common and deaths not unknown. Tethrippon - the four - horse chariotrace add edin 680 BCE was run over ten or twelve circuits of the hippodrome. A version using of also ver8 circuits was added in 384 BCE. keles -a horse race adde din 648 BCE and run over 6 circuits. A version for foals was added in 256 BCE. pankration - a mix of boxing and wrestling also added in 648 BCE. The pankration was abruta levent and the only moves not allowed were bit in and gouging, although competitors did not wear the damaging leather thongs of the boxers. Hoplitodromos - the race in hoplite armour (helmet, shield and spear) between 2 and 4 stadium lengths was addedin 520 BCE and was usually the last event of the Games. apene - a race with chariots pulled by two mules, addedin 500 BCE (dropped from 444 BCE). kalpe -a trotting horse race formares, addedin 496 BCE (dropped from 444 BCE). synoris - the two-horse chariot race run over eight circuits of the hippo drome, adde din 408 BCE. A version using of also ver three circuits was added in 268 BCE.Ov er time other events were added to the Games to bring the total Programme to 18 events spread over five days. Sports which were included in the ancient Olympic Games included foot race, chariot race, horse race,Pentathlon (running, long jump, discuss throw, javelin throw, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, Pancratium etc. Athletes were grouped by lot, and in the interest of fairness, this was also the way pairings were matched in the other events. The eventual winner of the stadion would even give his name to that particular Games and so be remembered for all time. Koroibos a Greek cook, baker and athlete from Elis, won the stadion race in the first recorded Ancient Olympic Games in 776BCE. 44The opening ceremony of Ancient Olympic Games started with assembly of the competitors, their coaches, their fathers, their brothers and the judges inthe council house in front of the statue of Zeus to take the oath. The competitors took an oath that they would not use unfair means and would participate in the games as per rules and regulations. The Judges pledged that they would be fair and honest in the judgments during the games. During the march past, the announcer/ commentator announced the name, father's name and city of the competitor in public and asked whether anyone from the spectators had any kind of objection as regards to their eligibility In the times of the ancient Olympic Games, there was only one winner. The Olympionic (the winner of the Olympic Games) was immediately rewarded after the competition. A herald announced the name of the winner, then he was awarded olive leaves plucked from the temple of Zeus and that was the highest honour. They tied a ribbon of red wool, a taenia , around his head and hands in the sign of victory. The official prize ceremony took place on the last day of the Games in the raised hall in the Temple of Zeus. In a loud voice, the herald announced the name of the Olympic victor, his father and his city. Then a Hellanodikos placed a crown made of an olive branch, the kotinos , on the winner's head. Returning to his hometown, the athlete was welcomed as a hero and was given numerous advantages for the rest of his life. To show that he had become famous, the athlete had the right to have his own statue erected, among other things. The\"Discobolus\"is a copy of a Greek statue 5thcentury BC. It represents an ancient Olympic discus throwerThe Olympiad was named after the name of the winner of 200 yards race. The winner's names and figure were engraved on stone by sculptors and poems were written in their name to honour them. The Roman Emperor Theodosius I legally abolished the games in 393or 394 A.D. It was found that the games had lost their original values due to corruption, professionalism and foul play. 45Extension Activity The Olympic Games have an interesting, and sometimes controversial history - from cancelled Games during World Wars to boycotts during international conflicts. Select one of the following Olympic Games and working in groups, research to find out more about it. 1920 1936 1948 1972 1976 1980 Present your ideas to the class in the form of a Power Point Presentation.2.1.2 MODERN OLYMPIC GAMES 15 03 years after Emperor Theodosius I ordered the closure of the Ancient Olympic games, once again Olympic games took place in 1896 in Athens, Greece. The idea behind restarting Olympic games came from French nobleman Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Coubertin was greatly interested in education, and he firmly believed that the best way to develop the minds of young people was to develop their bodies as well; he realised learning and athletics should go together. After he visited the ruins of ancient Olympia, it occurred to Coubertin that perhaps the best way to develop an interest in sports and games was to restart the Olympic Games. He hoped the new Games would bring back the ideals of physical, mental, and spiritual excellence displayed in the ancient Games, as well as build courage, endurance, and a sense of fair play in all who participated. In addition, he hoped the Games would turn the tide he saw world wide of the growing commercialism of sports. He also wanted an event that brought all nations together on one platform without barriers of race, creed, language and colour. In 1892, Coubertin first introduced the idea of starting the Olympic Games again. Few people were ready to accept his idea. But in 1894 Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and began planning the first modern Olympiad. As a result of Coubertin's efforts, the first modern Olympic Games were held in 1896 in Athens, Greece. The Games attracted athletes from 14 nations, with the largest delegations coming from Greece, Germany, Franceand Great Britain. Coubertin remained president of the International Olympic Committee until 1925. In this office he directed the course the Games were to take. He wrote the Olympic Charter, protocol, and athletes' oath, and he also planned the ceremonies. Do you know? Due to its historical significance, the Greek hosts wanted to win the marathon above all else. Spyridon Louisset off from the city of Marathon and took the lead four kilometers from the finishline and, to the joy of the 100,000 spectators, won the race by more than seven minutes. BaronPierrede 46The Olympic games are a competition between sportspersons and not between countries. The selection of athletes is done by the National Olympic Committees of the respective nations. Although the modern Olympic Games are patterned after the ancient Greek Games, there are important differences. Unlike ancient Greece, modern nations have not stopped wars for peaceful athletic competitions. Because of World War I, Games were not held in 1916. Nor were they held in 1940 and 1944, during World War II. While at the ancient Games, athletes competed in individual sporting events, modern games also have lots of team events. Unlike the ancient Olympics, the modern games are not a religious festival. The earlier Games were open only to Greek males who participated in the games without wearing any clothes. The modern Games encourage athletes from all nations who have a National Olympic Committee (NOC) that is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to compete. In modern Olympics man and women are equally encouraged and honoured. All participants at the modern Olympics must wear proper sports kit during the competition. In the first Olympic Games held in Athens in 1896 , 241 athletes from 14 countries participated in 43 events in the Panathenaic Stadium. In 1900, in the Paris Olympics, about 997 athletes from 24 countries competed. The 1900 Olympic Games are of great significance as this was the first one when 22 women competing in select sports. As the games became popular, lots of countries joined up. In 2016, 11,238 athletes from 207 Nations participated in 28 sports at the Summer Rio Olympics.

In 1904 the Olympic was hosted in St. Louis, but the number of nations and athletes competing fell to 12 countries and about 651 athletes. This decrease in participant numbers was due to the lengthy transatlantic boatride needed to be made by the European competitors to attend the Games. However, ever since the 1908 London games, which attracted about 2,000 athletes, more than the first three Olympics combined, there has generally be enarise in participation. 47Due to two World Wars, three times games were cancelled in1916, 1940, 1944.The First Winter Olympics was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France, inconnection with the Paris Games held three months later to feature snow and ice sports that were impossible to hold during the Summer Games. Although figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics, the IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, it was decidedto hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. The 1924 Olympics in Chamonix were the first Winter Olympic Games. Although at first it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart. This tradition was upheld until the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.

The range of disabilities includes impaired muscle power (e.g. paraplegia and quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, post-polio syndrome, spina bifida), impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency (e.g., amputation or dysmelia), leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment. These disabilities are further divided into classifications which vary from sport to sport. The word Paralympics is derived from the Greek word para which means beside or along side and Olympic. Combined, Paralympics means an international Games competition that is parallel to the Olympics . There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, are held almost immediately following the respective Olympic Games.All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). International Paralympic Committee (IPC) was formed on 22 September 1989 and is situated in Bonn, Germany. IPC organizes Summer and Winter Paralympic Games and coordinates and supervises world championships and other competitions. The vision of IPC is 'To enable Para athletes to achieve sporting excellence and inspire and excite the world.' 49 Do you know?

However, competitive games for people with special needs were widely introduced only after World War II. The purpose was to assist the large number of war veterans and those soldiers who had been injured during wartime. In 1948, on the occasion of the opening ceremony of London Olympic games Gutt mann conducted wheel chair competitions first time in the history, that he named \"Stoke Mandeville Games\", in which he involved sixteen injured service persons in the archery event. The first summer Paralympic Games were conducted from 18 to 25 September 1960, in Rome, after the completion of the 1960 Rome Olympics, using the same venues. 400 athletes from 23 countries participated in 57 events of 8 sports in the games After that, Paralympics games were conducted every four years like the Summer Olympic games. In 2016, Paralympics 4342 athletes of 159 countries took part in 528 events across 22 sports. The first Winter Paralympic Games was organized in 1976 in Omnskoldsvik, Sweden and after that the games have successfully been conducted the same year as Summer Olympics. In 2018, at the PyeongChang Winter Paralympics 569 athletes of 49 countries took part in 80 events in six sports. Special Olympics is the world's largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual and physical disabilities, providing year-round training and competitions to 5 million athletes and Unified Sports partners in 172 countries. The concept was the brainchild of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who in 1962 initiated a day camp called Camp Shriver for children with intellectual disabilities at her home in Potomac, Maryland. The camp sought to address the concern that children with special needs had very little opportunity to participate in organised athletic events. With Camp Shriver as an example, Kennedy Shriver, head of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation and a member of President John F. Kennedy's Panel on Mental Retardation, promoted the concept of involvement in physical activity and other opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. The Logo of Special Olympics is based on the sculpture \"Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World\" by Zurab Tsereteli and was adopted in 1979. It reflects joy, happiness, confidence among children and adults with special needs who are learning coordination, mastering skills, participating in competitions and preparing themselves for richer, more productive lives. The mission of Special Olympics is to provide year-round sports training and athletic 51competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in events like Athletics (Track and Field), Badminton, Basketball, Bocce, Bowling, Cricket, Cycling, Equestrian, Figure Skating, Floorball, Floor Hockey, Football (Soccer), Golf, Gymnastics: Artistic and Rhythmic, Handball, Judo, Kayaking, N etball, Skating, Sailing, Snowboarding, Swimming: Pool and Open-Water, Table Tennis, Tennis, Triathlon and Volleyball. There are a large number of benefits for people with intellectual disabilities as a result of participating in activities organized by Special Olympics. Apart from physical and health benefits, it provides psychological benefits including higher self-confidence, self-esteem and social competence. The transformative power of sports in instilling confidence, improving health and inspiring a sense of competition lies at the core of Special Olympics. One of the major events of Special Olympics is World Games, which was first held in July 1968 at Chicago with around 1000 participants from U.S. and Canada. Special Olympic Winter Games were initiated in 1977 at Colorado, US. Special Olympics also conducts Unified Sports Programme for inclusion. Sports Participants who have attained 8 years of age along with condition of intellectual disabilities, cognitive delays identified by the agency or a professional can participate in sports competitions.

Write a short note on Special Olympics. 532.2.3 THE OLYMPIC FLAG 2.2.2 THE OLYMPIC SYMBOL The creed, or guiding principle, of the modern Olympic Games is a quote by Baron de Coubertin: \"The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.\" The Olympic symbol is five interlocked rings of equal proportions of five different colours. The colour sequence of the rings from left to rightis, blue, yellow, black, green and red, where blue, black and red rings are placed at the top, the yellow and green rings are placed at the bottom. The five rings reflect the union of the five continents namely North and South America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and Europe and this is a symbol of the unity of sportspersons from all continents at Olympic Games. The Olympic flag was created by Baron Coubertin in 1913 and was released in 1914. It has a white background without any border. The Olympic symbol of the five interlocked rings is placed in the centre. In the words of Pierre de Coubertin, \"The Olympic flag has a white background, with five interlaced rings in the centre: blue, yellow, black, green and red. This design is symbolic; it represents the five continents of the world, united by Olympism, while the six colours are those that appear on all the national flags of the world at thepresent time (1931).\" . The flag was hoisted for the first time in 1920 in Antwerp, Belgium. 2.2.1 THE OLYMPIC CREED 542.2.6 THE OLYMPICANTHEM The motto of the Olympic Games is \"Citius - Altius - Fortius\" which is Latin for \"Faster- Higher- Stronger\". It expresses the aspirations of the Olympic Movement. It was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin upon the creation of the International Olympic Committee in 1894. Coubertin borrowed it from his friend Henri Didon, a Dominican priest, who was an athletics enthusiast. The Olympic motto was first announced in 1924 held at the Olympic Games in Paris, France. Each Olympic Games hasits own Olympic emblem, which is a design integrating the Olympic rings with one or more distinctive elements. They are created and proposed by the Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (OCOG) or the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of the host country. It is the responsibility of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to approve Olympic emblems for the Olympic Games. Olympic emblems are used in promotional materials, by sponsors of the Olympics, on the uniforms of every Olympic competitor. All emblems are the property of the IOC. The Olympic Hymn, also known as the Olympic anthem, is a musical workcomposed by Spiro Samara, and is played when Olympic flag is raised in the opening of Olympic Games. The Olympic anthem \"Immortal spirit of antiquity, Father of the true, beautiful and good, Descend, appear, shed over us thy light Upon this ground and under this sky Which has first witnessed thy unperishable fame Give life and animation to those noble games! Throw wreaths of fadeless flowers to the victors In the race and in the strife! Create in our breasts, hearts of steel! In thy light, plains, mountains andseas Shine in a roseate hue and form a vast temple To which all nations throng to adore thee, Oh immortal spirit of antiquity!\" 2.2.4 THE OLYMPIC MOTTO 2.2.5 THE OLYMPIC EMBLEMS 552.2.7 THE OLYMPIC FLAME, OLYMPIC TORCHES 2.2.8 RELEASE OF DOVES The Olympic flame was first lit in 1928 at Amsterdam, Netherlands Olympic Games. It is a continuity symbol of ancient and modern Olympic Games. The Olympic flame is lit in front of the ruins of the Temple of Hera in Olympia by focussing the rays of the sun using a parabolic mirror to ignite a flame. A long relay of runners carries the torches to the site of the Games, where the final torch is used to light a cauldron. The games are declared open officially by kindling the torch and the flame remains lit until it is extinguished in the Closing Ceremony. Remember, the runners do not pass the same torch; only the flame is passed on to the next torch bearer. Each runner is allowed to keep their torch. The first such relay took place for the 1936 Berlin Games when 3,331 runners carried the flame through Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. Similar relays have taken place for every Summer Games since. The flame travels by plane between cities, and is relayed by foot within cities. Being a torch bearer is considered an honour, and is often given to local residents with a record of community service, in addition to athletes and celebrities. Since 1964, the Winter Games have also had a torch relay starting in Olympia. In 2014, one leg of the torch relay took place in space as two Russian cosmonauts carried the torch outside the International Space Station, some 200 miles above Earth. After the cauldron is lit, doves are released into the air, as a symbol of peace. This was first done in the 1896 Olympics, and then in the 1920 Olympics. Since 1920, this has been an official part of the Opening Ceremony of the Summer Games. They are generally not released during the Winter Games, because it's too cold for the birds, but symbolic substitutions, like white balloons, are some times used. The order\u2014first lighting the cauldron, then releasing the doves\u2014is important. In the 1988 Seoul Games, when it was tried the other way around, many of the doves were in the area of the cauldron just before it burst into flames, leading to their unexpected demise. The Olympic Oath is taken by one athlete and one judge from the home nation, during the Opening Ceremony, on behalf of all the competitors and judges. Since 1984, this has been taken while holding a corner of the Olympic flag. Before that, the national flag of the home nation was used. The oath was first taken by an athlete in 1920. Originally, this was primarily a declaration that all the athletes were amateurs. The wording has been revised over the 2.2.9 THE ATHLETES' OATH 562.2.10 OLYMPIC AWARDS years, as being an amateur is no longer a general requirement. In 2000, a specific reference to doping was added. The current oath is \"In the name of all the competitors I promise that we shall take part in these Olympic Games, respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them, committing ourselves to a sport without doping and without drugs, in the true spirit of sportsmanship, for the glory of sport and the honour of our teams.\" First time the Olympic oath was taken in 1920 at Antwerp, Belgium by Victor Boin on behalf of all the athletes who participated in the Olympic Games. The Official's oath was introduced in 1972 and the coach's oath was addedin 2010. It is a promise made by anathlete, judge or official in each of the Olympic Games and is usually said in the language of host country. The winners at the Olympic Games are awarded medals. The winner gets a gold medal, the runner up receives a silver medal and the second runner up receives a bronze medal in the awards ceremony on the podium. Participants from first to eighth receive a diploma and all participants receive commemorative medals. The National Anthem of the country of the winner is played during the ceremony. When Modern Olympic Games began in 1896, the winners were given a silver medal and an olive branch, while runners- up received a laurel branch and a copper or bronze medal. In 1900, most winners received cups or trophies instead of medals. The custom of the sequence of gold, silver, and bronze for the first three places dates from the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri in the United States. The International Olympic Committee(IOC) retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in each event of the 1896 and 1900 Games. Medal designs have varied considerably since the first Olympic Games in 1896, particularly in size and weight. However, the IOC has laid down the physical properties of the medals and has the final decision about the finished design though the medals are developed by the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of the country hosting the Games. Recipients: The top three competitors receive medals Extension Activity Each Olympic Games has its own medal design. From 1928-2004, the front side of every Olympic Games medal carried an image of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, the Olympic Rings, the Coliseum of ancient Athens, a Greek vase known as an amphora, a horse-drawn chariot, and the year, number of the Olympiad, and host city. However, a new design was created for the 2004 Games, which featured the Greek Panathenaic Stadium and a new image of Nike. Each host city has allowed to add special details to the other side that is to the Games. Design a medal for the Olympic Games if they were to be held in your town. 572.2.11 THE OLYMPISM Shape: Usually circular, featuring an attachment for a chain or ribbon Diameter: A minimum of 60mm Thickness: A minimum of 3mm Material: First place (Gold medal): It is composed at least 92.5% of silver, plated with 6 grams of gold. Second place (Silver medal): 92.5 % silver. Third place (Bronze medal): It is 97.0% copper with 0.5% tin and 2.5% zinc. Event details: The sport for which the medal has been awarded should be written on the medal. \"Olympism is a philosophy of life, exalting and combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, will and mind. Blending sport with culture and education, Olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy found in effort, the educational value of good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.\" The Olympic Movement or Olympism is a philosophy of Olympic Games which is developed and endorsed by the International Olympic Committee. It promotes friendship, respect, fair play and sportsmanship through sports activities and stands against discrimination on the basis of gender, race, religion or nationality. It also expands the area of Olympism from sports activities to promoting peace and brother hood. \"The goal of the Olympic Movementis to contribute to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport without discrimination of anykind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play.\" Fundamental Principles of Olympism In the Olympic Charter following Fundamental Principal of Olympism are described. 1. Olympism is a philosophy of life, exalting and combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, will and mind. Blending sport with culture and education, Olympism seeks to createa way of life based on the joy of effort, the educational value of good example, social responsibility and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles. 2. The goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of human kind, with a view top romotinga peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity. 3. The Olympic Movement is the concerted, organised, universal and permanent action, carried out under the supreme authority of the IOC, of all individuals and entities who are inspired by the values of Olympism. It covers the five continents. It reaches its peak with the bringing together of the world's athletes at the great sports festival, the Olympic Games. Its symbol is five interlaced rings. 584. The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practising sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fairplay. 5. Recognising that sport occurs within the framework of society, sports organisations within the Olympic Movement shall apply political neutrality. They have the rights and obligations of autonomy, which include freely establishing and controlling the rules of sport, determining the structure and governance of their organisations, enjoying the right of elections free from any outside influence and the responsibility for ensuring that principles of good governance be applied. 6. The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Olympic Charter shall be secured without discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. 7. Belonging to the Olympic Movement requires compliance with the Olympic Charter and recognition by the IOC. The Olympic Games have established themselves as a global celebration of sport and peace. Through a combination of sport, culture and education, the Olympic Movement uses sport as a tool to promote fundamental ethical principles and support harmonious development for all. The Paralympic movement promotes universal values: courage, determination, inspiration, equality. The three important core values of Olympism central to Olympic Games are Excellence, Respect and Friendship. These core values are considered important in life to make it worth living and helps in decision-making on moral terms. The core values also include five educational values which have been incorporated from three domains of learning: Mental, Emotional, and Physical. Joy of effort Fairplay Respect for others Pursuit of excellence,and Balance in life between body, will and mind. Olympic Values Friendship Friendship is at the core of the Olympic Movement. It encourages us to see sport as an instrument for mutual understanding between individuals, and between peoples all over the world. Friendship brings Olympic and Paralympic athletes and people from around the world together in sport, play and competition. It breaks down barriers - encouraging individuals to look beyond the differences such as gender, ability, culture, race or religion. By welcoming everyone's differences we are able to establish 2.2.12 OLYMPIC VALUES 59stronger bonds. Friendships can be the basis of connections within community for working together and supporting each other. Respect Respect lies at the heart of Olympism - respect for yourself and your body, for other people, for rules and regulations, for sports and for the environment. In fact, respect is the key to strong friendships, fair play and sportsmanship. Understanding the impact of our actions, positive or negative, is an important part of playing a participative role in our communities. Respecting yourself and others goes beyond sport. Respect includes knowing that we can offend or hurt someone by not letting them join in our game (respect of others). listening to and asking for the ideas, opinions and beliefs of everyone-boys, girls, people living with a disability (respect for others). helping others to feel saf e from violence-teasing, bullying, and verbal, physical and sexual violence (respect for others). taking care of ourselves by choosing to eat healthy food, while getting enough re st and exercise (self-respect). being confident in ourselves to share and defend our ideas and opinions (self- respect). Ex cellence Excellence means doing the best we can, on the field of play or in our professional life. The important thing is not winning, but taking part, making progress and enjoying the healthy combination of body, will and mind. It is about having an ambition in life, and through determination, effort and perseverance reaching that goal. Excellence is not only on the sporting field; it is also in the classroom, where all children have the right to an education (Article 28), and also by helping children pursue excellence by chasing their dreams. 602.2.13 EDUCATIONAL VALUES OF OLYMPISM Joy of Effort According to the UNESCO Charter \"every human being has a fundamental right to access to physical education and sport, which are essential for the full development of his/her personality. The freedom to develop physical, intellectual and moral powers through physical education and sport must be guaranteed both within the educational system and in other aspects of social life...\".Thus, the child needs to enjoy and have fun with sports and physical activities he/she is engaged in. Otherwise, an individual, if forced to over-exert while playing without being given good experiences to remember or cherish, may develop bad memories. Sports or physical activities should be promoted with appropriate opportunity to enjoy the energy and effort with relative outcomes. Fair Play Although fair play is a concept of sports, it can be applied in many different ways and contexts beyond the sports field. Fair play refers to playing by the rules. Learning fair play behaviour in sport can lead to the development and reinforcement of similar behaviour in one's everyday life. After participating in sports an individual develops the habit of fair play that is reflected in his/her attitude and behaviour in life and towards the community he/she lives in. In sports, an individual follows the rules. Referees and officials enforce rules through penalties and punishments. There are many ways through which the concept of fair play can be reflected like shaking hands with the opponent at the end of the game, appreciating the opponent's extraordinary performance etc. Do you know? An example of joy of effort with running was published in a newsletter of the IOC, where in Kipchoge Keino, a 5-year - old boy from as mall village Kenya, who lived fourmiles from his school with no public transport available, walked or ran to school and back. He enjoyed the running, and, in two to three years he would come home for lunch and go back to school for his remaining classes. At the same time, he developed an incredible aerobic system and soon he competed in national events and went on to become an international player. He got a job with the Kenyan police as a fitness train errand became an example too the rcadets. 61Re spect for others As perthe Olympic Charter \"The goal contribute to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport practised in accordance with Olympism and its values.\" Living in a multicultural world, we need to accept and respect diversity and promote peace. We should appreciate the worth of all peoples and all cultures, irrespective of race, age, gender and ability. Violence is not the best way to solve conflicts. This acceptance can be achieved through sport, because a sports team may consist of people from different cultures, all focussed on one goal,thatis, victory for the team. The task of bringing peace to societies becomes even more challenging for sports leaders and educators in societies where there are ancient hatreds, conflicting values or great economic differences among people. For example, since the end of Apartheid, South Africans have worked to gether to create a new society, one in which there is acceptance and respect for people of all races. Sport spersons and educators have an important role in this process as acceptance and respect for cultural difference has to be taught. Racism and intolerance are often a result of ignorance and fear. Understanding and acceptance of difference develops when people live, work and play together. Do you know? Eugenio Monti made Olympic fair play history in the town of Innsbruck, Austria, during the Winter Games of 1964. One of the world's best bobsleighers, Monti had already won abronzemedal in the four-man bobsleigh. He really wanted to win an Olympic gold medal in the two-man bobsleigh. As he waited with his partner at the top of the run for his turn, he realised his main rivals, Robin Dixon and Tony Nash of Great Britain, had lost a bolt that held the runner to their sled. Without that bolt, they could not participate in the race.Without giving it any second thought, Monti lent the pair the bolt from his own sled. Nash and Dixon raced down the track to capture the goldmedal. Monti had to settle for third place, but he was awarded a special Fair Play Trophy by CIFP for his act of generosity. Four years later, Monti won gold medal sin both the two-manand the four-man bobsleigh events. Do you know? At Nazi-hosted 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, it was virtually demanded that white, Aryan supreme acy and athletic prowess was to dominate. Jesse Owens, a black man from USA won four gold medals, and he was aided to one of those victories by a blond, muscular German athlete, Luz Long. Long, the European long- jump record holder, advised Owens, his competitor at the Games, when he was having difficulty qualifying for the final of the long jump. Owens had failed twice in his bid to qualify for the long jump final, and was on his final attempt when Long suggested Owens adjust his starting point to avoid overstepping the take-offboard. Owens followed Long's advice, and he qualified. In the finals, with Hitler, Goebbelsand Himmler looking on, Owens set about his final attempt. In the frenzied atmosphere, Longlooked to the crowd, raised his arms and then lowered them to quell the noise, before castinga\"furtive\"glance at the Fuhrer. The stadium quietened, Owens was able to concentrate, and he leapt to victory, leaving Longwith the silver medal. 62Pursuit of Excellence In today's competitive and demanding world, an individual's focus is to become the best. Focusing on excellence can help young people to make positive, healthy choices and strive to become the best that they can be in whatever they do. Sports provide an opportunity to players to become the best or to make healthy choices in safe social and physical surroundings. A healthy, clean and safe community makes the welfare of young people its numberone priority. Sport sharpens skills and attends to the needs of all children and youth\u2014girls and boys, children with learning disabilities, and children with hearing, vision and other physical disabilities. It provides an environment free from discrimination, harassment and fear. Sport also provides daily opportunities for children and youth of all ages to participate in physical activity in an environment free from discrimination, harassment and intimidation. It is also a place in which individual differences andcultural traditions are valued and respected. Balance Between Body, Will and Mind Pierre de Coubertin understood that an international revival of the Olympic Games would stimulate interest in sports and physical activity among young people. This remains as relevant today, as it was over 100 years ago. The focus of the modern Olympic Movement extends beyond sports, embracing cultures, artistic works, environmental awareness and education. All of these can play their part in helping young people to build a balanced approach to life. Pierre de Coubertin maintained, \"Modern education... has allowed itself to be carriedaway by extreme compartmentalisation. Each strengthworks in isolation, without any link or contact with its neighbour. If the topic is muscles, they only want to see animal function. The brain is furnished as though it were made up of tiny, air-tight compartments.\" He believed in the concept that learning happened in the whole body, not just in the mind. Physical learning, too, took place in both body and mind but it could not be done without will. Sport is a medium of balancing body, will and mind. Do you know? Deng Yaping of China, a hugely talented table tennis player, started when she was five. By the time she was nine she had won her provincial junior championship. At the age of 13, she had won her first national championship. But being less than1. 5 metre stall, she was initially rejected for the national team, despite her talent. However, it was her talent, her confidence and her perseverance that finally sawher selected in 1988. She won her first international doubles title in 1989 when she was only 16, and her first singles title two years later. \"Even from an early age, I dreamed of being world champion,\"shesaid. In 1989, she won the Asian Cup and in 1991 she captured the world singles title. 63I. Tick the correctoption. 1. The word \"Altius\" in the Olympic motto means i. Faster ii. Higher iii. Heavier iv.

He t wisted, turned and balanced, before performing his landing\u2014a double s omersault with a full twist\u2014 landing perfectly with both feet. He stood for the required three seconds, but then collapsed in agony because he had been performing with a broken knee, injured during the floor exercises. \"I didn't want to worry my team-mates,\" explained Fujimoto. He couldn't take painkillers because of doping regulations. \"I made myself for get what might happen when I landed,\" hesaidlater. So, he endured his pain and kept it to himself. Though Fujimoto wanted to carry on inspite of his injuries, his coach and his team- mates, now aware of his pain, would not allow him to continue with such a severe injury. However, inspired by Fujimoto's pride and courage, they all did their very best and won the gold medal defeating the team from USSR.

In the same year the association was recognized by the International Olympic Committee. The prime objective of the Association was to promote and develop Olympic movement in India. In the early years, IOA selected sportspersons to represent India, but after 1947 they gave the responsibility of selection and training to the National Sports Federations. Now they only arrange transport, board and accommodation for officials and sports persons. Sir Dorabji Tata The Indian Olympic Association is the governing body for the Olympic Movement and the Commonwealth Games in India. It is also an affiliated member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC). IOA is recognized by Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The IOA looks after several aspects of sports and sportspersons which includes sending athletes or teams to represent India in the Olympic Games, Common wealth Games, Asian Games and other international multi-sport competitions of IOC, CGF, OCA and ANOC.

Discussion Look at the cartoon given below. As a result of a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits, obesity among children is on the rise. Using information from the cartoon given below and your ideas, deliver a speech in your class on the importance of healthy eating and regular exercise. Cases of diabetes in India have seen an increase in the last one decade. In fact, incidence of diabetes is the second highest in India, only next to China. The reasons mentioned by the doctors and the experts are change in lifestyle and eating habits. The magnitude of the problem is so huge and growing so rapidly that the government is revisiting health promotion strategies for increasing awareness. Physical activities, healthy diet and a change in lifestyle have been highly recommended to overcome the new health issue. Let's understand the importance of a healthy life style so that contemporary issues leading to lifestyle related diseases can be addressed. 75 B ased on the definitions above, we can conclude that lifestyle is the way of life of an individual or a group (family, peer group, office group, religious group etc.) that includes the way they live, their day to day life,the pattern of their social relationships, food habits, entertainment and dress. Lifestyle is expressed in the individual's activities, attitudes, interests, opinions and values. Life style can, therefore, be described as the actions or reactions of an individual or group. 3.1.1 DEFINITIONS OF LIFE STYLE A way of living of individuals, families (households), and societies, which they manifest in coping with their physical, psychological, social, and economic environments on a day-to- day basis. - Business Dictionary The particular way that a person or group lives and the values and ideas supported by that person or group. - CambridgeDictionary Lifestyle is the interests, opinions, behaviours, and behavioural orientations of an individual, group, or culture. - Adorno (1991) Lifestyle is a way used by people, groups and nations and is formed in specific geographical, economic, political, cultural and religious text. Lifestyle is referred to the characteristics of inhabitants of a region in special time and place. It includes day to day behaviours and functions of individuals in job, activities, fun and diet. - Dariush d. Farhud (2015) Do you know? Lifestyle - A way of life or style of living that reflects the values and attitudes, the living conditions, behaviour, and habits of a person and group that are typical of them or are chosen by them. Wellness - The state of being healthy and free from disease. Physical Fitness - The degree to which one is healthy and strong. Physical activity - Body movement that is carried out by the skeletal muscles and requires energy. Exercise - Planned, structured, repetitive mo vement intended to improve or maintain physical fitness. Workout - The component of a total physical activity programme designed to produce health, wellness, fitness, and other benefits using appropriate amounts of different types of physical activity. 76 While technology has transformed life and benefited society in myriad ways, changing the way we work, live and relax, at the same time these new developments have had certain very serious implications. A worrying consequence of the increase of technology has been its impact on lifestyle and physical health. Since technology has made execution of many of our daily chores possible by the simple pull and push of handles or buttons, most people have no need to exert physically for even the most basic or regular chores because one need not go to the market to purchase the groceries. You just need to send the list online, or on the telephone, and your groceries will be delivered to your home. All kinds of bill payments, banking transactions, sale or purchase of any goods can be done from the comfort of one's home. Use of effort-saving devices like telephones and escalators has minimised human effort and movement. Physical in activity and poor lifestyle habits have led to serious health related problems. Physical inactivity leads to hypokinetic diseases. The term Hypokinetic is derived from hypo meaning low or little and kinetic meaning movement or motion . Hypokinetic diseases, therefore, are diseases brought on, at least in part, by insufficient movement and exercise. Hypokinesis has been identified as a risk factor for the origin and progression of several widespread chronic diseases, including back pain, obesity, heart- related diseases, high blood pressure etc. There are a few factors, other than physical inactivity, which have negative effect on our health including stress, faulty nutrition and environment. There are several identified health related problems in India which occur due to poor lifestyle. Obesity, problems related to mental health, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, cancer, food allergies, hormonal disorders are diseases which are caused by drinking alcohol, smoking and chewing tobacco, eating junk food or food with high salt and sugar content, excessive stress of any kind related to occupation or personal relations, and air, water and noise pollution etc. A press release of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India reveals that in 2016, 62% deaths were caused by non-communicable diseases. National Family health survey tells us that about 60% of these persons had a history of hypertension, and that one woman out of ten and one man out of seven of the ages of 15 to 49 years are hypertensive. A 2017 survey conducted by Centre for Science and Environment revealed that one in every twelve Indians is a diabetic, every third child in Delhi has damaged lungs, and that 30% deaths in India are caused by air pollution. The Study also predicted more than 1.73 million new cancer cases are likely to be recorded each year by 2020 in India due to faulty lifestyle habits. 77 Extension Activity Question at least 15 students from your school or a nearby school.

Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the day time? Yes / No Share your findings in your group. Based on the information, design a poster advocating a Healthy Lifestyle. 78 It is essential to adopt healthy lifestyle habits to stay fit and healthy. 1. Taking a balanced diet - Taking three main meals and two additional meals every day is important. Meals should include proper nutrients like proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres, vitamins, minerals etc. Intake of calories should be balanced with calorie consumption. Junk foods should be avoided because such foods are high in calories and low in proteins and other vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. It is also important to include fruits, vegetables, fibre and water in thediet. 3.1.2 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE HABITS Takinga balanced diet Participating in regular physical exercise safety Measures Spreading Education Maintaining Pollution Making Healthy Friendships Over Coming stress obesity Avoiding use of Tobacco Alcohal Taking adequate rest HEALTHY LIFESTYLE HABITS 79 2. Participating in regular physical exercise - Second only to smoking, physical inactivity is the highest cause of preventable deaths in the world. It is important to get regular physical exercise at least three times in a week. Each session of physical activity should be between 30 minutes to 45 minutes in which 20 to 30 minutes should be given to aerobic exercises like cycling, running, jogging, swimming and the remaining time should be given to strength-training along with flexibility exercises. 3. Taking adequate rest - An individual requires 7 to 8 hours of sleep daily. Any kind of continuous work or activity,e.g.,three to four hours of sitting on a chair, should be avoided. One should avoid maintaining the same posture for long time. Care should also be taken to avoid any kind of vigorous activity which is beyond the physical limits of an individual. It is essential to take proper rest after strenuous activity. 4. Avoiding use of tobacco and alcohol - Smoking and chewing of tobacco is one of the most important causes of illness and premature deaths not just in India, but also in the world, and it is a cause of death which is preventable. According to WHO, tobacco is responsible for more than a million deaths in India each year. Consumption of alcohol is not only a health related problem, but is also a social problem. Alcohol can affect the way the brain works, changing mood and behaviour, making it har der to think clearly or move with coordination. Excessive d rinking over a long time may also damage the heart, or lead to a stroke and liver cirrhosis. 5. Fighting obesity - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat accumulates to an extent that it may have a negative effect on health. It is important to maintain the recommended body weight through exercise and through taking a balanced, nutritive diet. Alternate or cosmetic methods to reduce body weight should be avoided. Obesity leads to health-related problems like cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer and arthritis. 80 6. Overcoming stress - Stress is body's reaction to a challenge or demand. Body reacts to stress by releasing hormones. These hormones make the brain more alert, cause muscles to tense and increase the pulse. It also causes feelings of frustration, anger, or nervousness. In short bursts, stress can be positive, such as when it helps you avoid danger or meet a deadline. But when stress lasts for a long time, it may harm your health. Negative stress leads to health related and social problems, including high blood pressure,heartdisease, diabetes, obesity, depression or anxiety. Stress can be reduced through exercise and stress management techniques. 7. Making healthy friendships - Making friends not only enhances social interaction but boosts good health. Friends encourage positive behaviour, e.g., friends who are fitness enthusiasts, encourage their friend to lead a lifestyle that is physically active. On the other hand, unhealthy friendships play a destructive role and lower self-esteem. Mortality rates are higher in those who are not well adjusted in society as this leads to social isolation and loneliness. 8. Maintaining a pollution-free environment - Increased environmental pollution in present times is responsible for more than one-third of the health- related problems. According to a report published in Down to Earth \"Outdoor air pollution has become the fifth largest killer in India after high blood pressure, indoor air pollution, tobacco smoking, and poor nutrition.\" Breathing polluted air leads tounusually high rates of lower respiratory infections, heart disease, strokes, and lung cancer. In 2015, water pollution, led to 0.5 million deaths, while unsafe sanitation caused 0.32 million deaths. It is important to use proper equipment for protection against pollution e.g., using a face mask, filtering drinking water, washing vegetables and fruit before eating etc. 9. Spreading education - Education is one of the lifestyle indicators which helps to promote longevity. Health economists argue that better educated people are more likely to choose healthier lifestyles. People from a higher educational background are, on average, less likely to smoke, abuse alcohol, and will exercise more, eat healthier foods, and have more frequent health checks than those who are not educated. This can be explained by a variety of different reasons. For instance, students with healthier lifestyles may be more efficient in acquiring knowledge so they tend to perform better at school, they also stay in school for longer, work more at younger ages and invest more in positive health-related behaviours. 10. Adopting adequate safety measures - All of us are familiar with the adage \"Accidents happen.\" This suggests that at times unfortunate happenings are Do you know 81 u npredictable and unavoidable. While it may be true to some degree that tragedy strikes in unexpected ways,we can minimise the effects of these accidents because injuries that occur as a result of these accidents are preventable by taking precautionary measures like wearing seat belts during driving, wearing a helmet while riding a two- wheeler, using occupational safety gear etc. An individual must read and implement all safety rules before using any device and must wear protective gear before carrying out any activity which has high degree of risk of injury. e.g.,while participating in sports, athlete should wear prescribed uniform or sports kit and protective equipment before they participate in the game like wearing a face mask in boxing, abdomen guard, batting pads in cricket etc. Modification of behaviour for lifestyle change is a difficult process. Many a times, an individual pledges that he/she will not eat junk food because it is not good for health, or get regular physical exercise to promote good health, or reduce weight to say fit. There are lots of people who want to change their lifestyle, but are not able to do so because of various factors. There are personal factors that affect an individual's health behaviour but are beyond their control, like heredity, age etc. Heredity plays an important role in health behaviour, e.g., some individuals may have a natural tendency to gain weight and it may affect their fitness level. Genes contribute to obesity in many ways like affecting appetite, satiety (the sense of fullness), metabolism, food cravings, body-fat distribution, and the tendency to use eating as a way to cope with stress. Age is another factor which affects behaviour. e.g., a younger person may be more likely to eat junk food, drink alcohol, or smoke but an older person would try to avoid such substances. However, the most important reason for non-communicable diseases is an unhealthy lifestyle. Thus, these diseases are preventable if lifestyle is modified. The Trans-theoretical model, also called the Stages of Change Model, works on the assumption that people do not change behaviour quickly and decisively. Rather, change in behaviour, especially habitual behaviour, occurs continuously through a cyclical process. There are five different stages in which lifestyle behaviour may be modified. This model has been applied for different lifestyle modifications. e.g., quitting of smoking, alcohol, weight control, regular physical activities etc. Art Integration - AEROBIC EXERCISE Dancing is an aerobic activity that improves your balance and co-ordination. It's suitable for people of all ages, shapes and sizes. Whether you like to jump or jive, tap or tango, do the hip hop or salsa, dancing is one of the most enjoyable ways for losing weight, maintaining strong bones, improving posture and muscle strength, increasing balance and co-ordination, and beating stress. Working in Groups, choose the dance style you wish to incorporate into your exercise routine. learn/improvise steps. choose/create your own musi c. set the dance steps to music. Pe rform your Aerobic Dance Activity in the school PE period.3.1.3 MODIFICATION OF LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOUR 82 1. Precontemplation -- In this stage an individual does not want to change in the near future because she/heis unaware that her/his behaviour is problematic or produces negative consequences. Other people in her/his life -friends or family - clearly identify the problem but the affected person avoids information or indications or warnings. Even somebody offering a free consultation for quitting the unhealthy lifestyle does not affect her/him. At this stage, the individual is the most complex person to deal with, as no one can help someone until the affected person does not want to change herself/himself. Education is the only way to deal with such kind of people. Challenging them in a way that they are held responsible for adverse effects in future or describing the situation that may affect their family members, may help them out from this stage. 2. Contemplation - An individual in this stage recognizes the problem and seriously wants to change her/his behaviour, but they are not ready to change themselves right now. They gather information about the problem and work on it, finding out the positives and negatives in that. They may make an action plan to change their lifestyle behaviour over the next six months, but they may still feel ambivalent towards changing their behaviour. It is also possible that they remain at the same stage for years. The important support groups to help them move out from this stage include friends, family, peer groups. Precontemplation Action Termination/Adoption Do you know? Lapse - A lapse is a slip up with a quick return to action or maintenance. Relapse - a relapse is a full-blown return to the original problem behaviour. 83 3. Preparation - In this stage the individual seriously wants to change the behaviour within the time limit of one month. An individual tries new behaviour for short periods of time and takes a few steps towards change in his/her behaviour like doing regular exercise for few days, stopping intake of junk food for few times etc. In this phase the individual prepares general objectives and illustrates specific objectives to achieve his/her goals. Environmental and peer group support can help them out from this situation. 4. Action - An individual manages time and energy in this stage. Now the individual works on the objectives and modifies her/his behaviour as per need. e.g.,she/he does regular exercise five days a week or balances her/his diet as per set objectives. Downfall is common during this stage as, generally, the individual takes a break or leaves the objective within six months of beginning the new behaviour. Individuals should remain focused on the objective and identify the hurdles or barriers which restrict the action. If people maintain the activity for six months continuously then they enter into the next stage. 5. Maintenance - People at this stage are those who changed their behaviour more than 6 months ago. It is important for people duringthis stage to be aware of situations that may tempt them to slip back into doing the unhealthy behaviour\u2014 particularly stressful situations. Here, the important point is to follow the specific guidelines which govern behaviour like exercising, taking aerobic training along with anaerobic, or taking proper balanced diet with prescribed servings etc. In this phase the individual focuses on the benefits which she/he is getting. 6. Termination/Adoption - In the stage known as Termination or Adoption stage, the individual maintains his/her modified behaviour for more than five years without any break. The term \"termination\" is used in case of negative behaviour being terminated e.g., quitting of smoking, or taking alcohol. The word \"adoption\" refers to positive behaviour that has been adopted for five years continuously. Once an individual has entered in this stage, it is believed that lifestyle behaviour is adopted or terminated. Now the individual feels she/he will not relapse into negative behaviour. However, experts believe that in case of positive behaviour like weight reduction, taking regular exercise or a balanced diet, the chance of relapse is always high. While for some individuals, relapses can be important for learning and helping the person to become stronger in their resolve to change, on the other hand, for others, relapses can be a trigger for giving up the process of change. The key to recovering from a relapse is to review the \"quit attempt\" up to that point, identify personal strengths and weaknesses, and develop a plan to resolve those weaknesses to solve similar problems the next time they occur. Relapse is a factor in the action or maintenance stages. Many people who change their behaviour decide for a number of reasons to resume their drug use or return to old patterns of behaviour. Research clearly shows that relapse is the rule rather than the exception. 84 I. Tick the correctoptions. 1. \"I refuse to quit smoking! There is absolutely nothing wrong with what I am doing.\" Which of the following stages in the Trans-theoretical Model describes this individual? i. Action ii. Preparation iii. Contemplation iv. Pre-contemplation 2. In the Transtheoretical model, the maintenance stage refers to the period of ______________________ when the individual attains new behaviour. i. one months to six months ii. one month to five years iii. six months to two months iv. six months to five years II. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. Define lifestyle with a suitable example. 2. Define the pre-contemplation stage of Trans-theoretical model III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. What is a healthy life style? How does it affect our health? 2. List down some good Lifestyle Habits 3. How can we modify our health-related life style? Do you know? 85 T he WHO defines health as \"a state of physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease.\" While the term Health focuses on an individual's illness status and her/his relationship to that status, wellness transcends the absence of disease. It is much more than merely physical health, exercise or nutrition. In fact, wellness is the full integration of states of physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Wellness is about living a life full of personal responsibility and, therefore, taking proactive steps for one's entire well-being. This means that a person living a life of wellness controls risk factors that can harm her/him. Risk factors are different types of actions or conditions that increase a person's chances for illness or injury. e.g., smoking is a risk factor as there is a risk for developing lung cancer. Alcohol is a risk factor as there is a risk for developing liver damage. So, an individual takes pro-active steps to remove such health risks from her/his life. Maintaining an optimal level of wellness is absolutely crucial to living a higher quality life. Wellness matters because everything we do, and every emotion we feel, relates to our well- being. In turn, our well-being directly affects our actions and emotions. It's an on going circle. Therefore, it is important for everyone to achieve optimal wellness in order to reduce stress and the risk of illness and to ensure positive interactions. Thus, wellness may be defined as \"the optimal state of health of individuals and groups. There are two focal concerns: the realization of the fullest potential of an individual physically, psychologically, socially, spiritually, and economically, and the fulfilment of one's role expectations in the family, community, place of worship, workplace, and other settings.\" - WHO Health Promotion Glossary Update 2006. The integration of many different components (physical, emotional/mental, intellectual, social, and spiritual) that expand one's potential to live (quality oflife) and work effectively and to make a significant contribution to society. Wellness reflects how one feels (a sense of well-being) about life, as well as one's ability to function effectively. Wellness, as opposed to illness (a negative), is sometimes described as the positive component of good health. - Charles B. Corbin, Gregory J Welk, William R Corbin, Karen A Welk Wellness is an active process through which people become aware of, and make choices toward, a more successful existence. - National Wellness Institute Thus, wellness is a continuous and thoughtful process to stay healthy and achieve total wellbeing. It is a positive and ideal state of an individual which is reflected in day to day work, contribution to society, optimal functioning and having a healthy quality of life. 3.2.1 CONCEPT OF WELLNESS 86 Most people think that physical fitness alone is sufficient to lower the risk of health- related diseases but it is not true. e.g., consider an individual who regularly does vigorous physical trainingin which she/he does aerobic exercises thrice a week, does weight training, and stretching and maintains a good ratio of fat percentage of the body, but at the same time she/he eats junk food regularly, smokes and drinks alcohol. By doing so, she/he is increasing her/his chances of suffering from cardiovascular disease and other health related issues. Wellness includes factors like spirituality, healthy diet, regular physical activity, personal safety, avoiding drug abuse, preserving environment, prevention of disease, stress management etc. In fact, there are seven components of wellness namely physical, emotional, mental, social, environmental, occupational, and spiritual which are interlinked with each other. 3.2.2 THE SEVEN COMPONENTS OF WELLNESS 87 1. Physical Wellness - Physical wellness is an individual's ability to meet the demands of day to day work and being able to take care of her/his health. Overall physical wellness encourages the balance of physical activity, nutrition and mental well-being to keep the body in top condition. Obtaining an optimal level of physical wellness allows the individual to nurture personal responsibility for her/his own health. As the individual becomes conscious of her/his physical health, she/he isable to identify elements she/he is successful in, as well as elements she/he would like to improve. Physical Wellness includes regular vigorous activities, balanced diet, proper rest, avoiding intake of tobacco or alcohol, living in a healthy environment, following safety precautions etc. A physically fit individual must have optimum muscular endurance, muscular strength, cardio vascular endurance, flexibility and a fit body composition. 2. Emotional Wellness - Emotional wellness inspires self-care, relaxation, stress reduction and the development of inner strength. It is an individual's ability to understand and balance her/his emotions, accept her/his own weaknesses, and respect another's strength. It is important to be attentive to one's positive and negative feelings and be able to understand how to handle these emotions. It allows the individual to accept her/his feelings. Once the individual accepts her/his feelings, she/he begins to understand why she/he is feeling that way, and can decide how she/he would like to act in response to those feelings. Emotional wellness also includes the ability to learn and grow from experiences. It is important in today's life that an individual should be able to cope with stress, adjust to one's environment, enjoy her/his life. Trust, self-esteem, self-confidence, optimism are key words for emotional wellbeing. 88 3. Mental Wellness - Mental wellness, also known as intellectual wellness, is an individual's ability to learn, evaluate, accept new ideas, develop creative thinking, have a good sense of humour, and promote a lifelong learning process. Intellectual wellness encourages the individual to engage in creative and mentally-stimulating activities that expand her/his knowledge and skills while allowing her/himto share them with others. Intellectual wellness can be developed through academics, cultural involvement, community involvement and personal hobbies. Intellectual wellness encourages learning and enables the individualto explore new ideas and understandings. It also stimulates curiosity, thereby developing a desire to try new things. An individual with intellectual wellbeing is open-minded and clear, enthusiastic to gather knowledge, accepting of ideas put forth byothers. 4. Social Wellness - It is an individual's ability to positively interact with the people of different cultures, ages, gender, religion etc. without building stereotypes. Social wellness refers to the relationships an individual may have and how she/he interacts with others. Her/His relationships can offer support during difficult times. Social wellness involves building healthy,nurturing and supportive relationships. Conscious actions are important in learning how to balance one's social life with one's academic and professional lives. Surrounding oneself with a positive social network increases one's self-esteem. Social wellness enables an individual to establish communication and trust and to manage conflict. Having good social wellness is critical to building emotional resilience. 5. Environmental Wellness - Environmental wellness refers to respecting the environment and natural resources. Environmental wellness inspires the individual to live a lifestyle that is respectful of one's surroundings and leading the individual to take action to protect it. It promotes respect for all nature and all species living in it. It encourages the individual to adopt habits that promote a healthy environment resulting in a more balanced lifestyle. It helps develop habits like producing and eating organic food, minimising the use of petroleum products, and reducing air, water, noise and land pollution or food contamination. We are answerable to future generations in regard to natural resources. We should recycle the products which we use and reduce waste and pollution. 6. Occupational Wellness - Occupational Wellness is the ability to achieve a balance between work and leisure time, addressing workplace stress and building relationships with co-workers. It focuses on the individual's search for a calling and involves exploring various career options and finding where one fits. Occupational wellness deals with satisfaction from job and career of an individual. It is not about holding a big post in a company or drawing a high salary etc. e.g., Individual 'A' may have a good salary in a reputed company, but she/he may not be able to execute the plans or policies of the company effectively. Thus she/he may be stressed. Whereas Individual 'B', drawing a lesser salary and occupying a lower post than A may be satisfied with her/his life. An individual picking up a job should consider internal and external rewards. 7. Spiritual Wellness - Generally, people think that spiritual wellness is linked with religion, but the core of spiritual wellness is to find the meaning and direction of 89 li fe. Spiritual wellness allows an individual to be in tune with her/his spiritual self and to appreciate her/his life experiences for what they are. It lets one find meaning in life events and defineone's individual purpose. By finding meaning in her/his life experiences, the individual will be able to develop a harmony between her/his inner self and the outside world. A spiritually well individual should have beliefs, principles and values which guide and strengthen her/himin life. By following the path of spirituality an individual gets faith, love, peace, joy, closeness with others, altruism, compassion and forgiveness. Thus, we can see that all the components of wellness are linked with each other. Wellness is holistic, because rather than focusing on symptoms, it is important to integrate body, mind, and spirit as one whole person. Wellness also considers the self as the only true healer as one's wellness is one's own responsibility. Health professionals can only help facilitate the healing process. It is the individual's body, mind, and spirit that do all the healing. Therefore, it is important to think positive thoughts as negative thinking strips one of power and control. Wellness is outcome-oriented. As soon as one is able to identify a problem, one's energy must be put into the solutions. Wellness requires continuous and thoughtful efforts to remain healthy and to reach the highest level of wellbeing. Overall physical wellness is achi eved through the balance of phys ical activity, nutrition and mental well-being to keep your body in top condition. Health related lifestyle habits lead to longevity, improve quality of life and help achieve total wellbeing. After reading seven dimensions of wellness an individual can understand the importance of wellness: Wellness Programme should be developed with an aim to providing health-related lifestyle education with required support and resources to achieve wellness. Wellness makes the individual responsible for taking good decisions and adopting good practices and preventative measures for achieving optimum level of physical, emotional and social functioning. Wellness Programmes enable an individual to understand health issues like chronic diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, STDs, obesity, nutrition, diabetes, injuries, and other lifestyle related diseases and enhances longevity and the quality of healthy life. It promotes the behaviours which help maintain good health like quitting smoking, giving up alcohol abuse etc. and reducing social evils like violence, abuse, child labour, gender inequality, caste system etc. and adoption of positive values that result in an individual becoming a good citizen of the country. It also enables an individual to maintain balance between work, personal life and health that results in efficient and consistent output and improves general health,3.2.3 IMPORTACE OF WELLNESS 90 and fitness through adopting regular physical activities. It also helps to develop healthy social environment where people share and solve personal and social problems, thus making the individual socially accessible and culturally sensitive. Wellness components like physical, emotional, mental, social, environmental, occupational, and spiritual are highly inter connected and can help to make environment disease and pollution free. I.

Describe the seven components of wellness 91 B efore we begin, it is essential to understand the meaning of different terms- Exercise, physical activity and physical fitness. We often use these terms inter changeably, which is not the correct usage. Exercise refers to planned, structured and repetitive bodily movements aimed at improving one or more components of physical fitness. e.g., swimming as an exercise aims at improving cardio vascular endurance. Physical activity, on the other hand, is any bodily movement which is not specifically designed for physical fitness but results in significantly increasing resting energy expenditure. e.g., walking will increase the resting energy expenditure but will not contribute to any fitness component. Physical Fitness is a state of health and well-being and the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Extension Activity Your school wishes to draw up an action plan for promoting wellness among all its students. Working in groups, help the school authorities draw up a plan wellness plan by suggesting activities. Wellness Component Activity suggested Physical Wellbeing Emotional Wellbeing Mental Wellbeing Intellectual Wellbeing Environmental Wellbeing Occupational Wellbeing Spiritual Wellbeing 3.3.1 PHYSICAL FITNESS 92 As per above definitions an individual who is physically fit should be able to perform daily tasks efficiently and effectively, without undue fatigue, and, along with that, she/he should also successfully complete the demands of recreational activities and emergent situations. Each individual's physical fitness differs from the other's depending upon their profession or day to day activities. A doctor's activity is to check patients within the room, while a farmer works hard in the field. Similarly, a sports person performs skilfully on the field or court. But as per the definition of physical fitness each of these individuals must successfully perform their day to day tasks without undue fatigue, and have enough energy for leisure activities like going for a walk, playing table tennis or football etc. whatevershe/he wishes to do. In addition, she/he should be able to meet the situation if there is an emergency at work. e.g., the doctor may be called to see a patient in an emergency, and may need to travel some distance to see the patient, or the farmer may have to rush to his farm to save his paddy crop from a natural calamity, when after a day at work, he is participating in some recreational physical activity. There are a lot of health benefits of physical fitness. Optimum fitness is required to prevent injuries, to maintain a stable posture etc. However, physical fitness cannot be achieved without regular physical activity. Physical fitness is an important dimension of the Wellness Programme. Definitions of Physical Fitness Fitness is the ability of an individual to lead a full and balanced life. It includes physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual factors and capacity for their wholesome expression. Charles A. Bucher (1958) Physical fitness is the ability to carry out daily tasks with vigour and alertness, without undue fatigue and with ample energy to enjoy leisure time pursuits and to meet unforeseen emergencies. H Harrison Clarke (1976) Physical fitness is the ability to perform moderate to vigorous levels of physical activity without undue fatigue and the capability of maintaining such ability throughout life. (American College of Sports Medicine) Individuals are physically t when they can meet both the ordinary and the unusual demands of daily life safely and effectively without being overly fatigued and still have energy left for leisure and recreational activities. - Wener W.K. Hoeger, Sharon A. Hoeger (2014) Physical fitness is associated with a person's ability to work effectively, enjoy leisure time, be healthy, resist hypokinetic diseases or conditions, and meet emergency situations. - Charles B. Corbin, Gregory J Welk, William R Corbin, Karen A Welk, (2015) 93 Muscular Endurance Cardio respiratory Endurance Health-related Fi tness Muscular Strength Body Composition Flexibility Ph ysical Fitness Agility Reaction time Skill related Fitness Coordination Balance Speed Power 3.3.2 TYPES OF PHYSICAL FITNESS 94 1. Health -related Fitness - There are five components of health-related physical fitness - muscular endurance, cardio respiratory endurance, flexibility, muscular strength and body composition. These are directly related with good health, and help to reduce the risk of hypokinetic diseases. For health promotion and disease prevention, each of the components of health-related fitness are important in moderation. A higher level of health-related fitness is directly related to the degree of skill performance. e.g., moderate level of muscular strength is required to maintain posture and to prevent neck, back or knee pain etc. but a high amount of muscular strength helps to increase performance in weight lifting, jumps, throws etc. 2. Skill-related Fitness - Skill related fitness has six components namely agility, balance, coordination, reaction time, power and speed. These are associated with performance. An individual who has achieved a good skill-related fitness is able to achieve high level of motor skills, which are a prerequisite in sports and in certain jobs. Though, skill-related fitness is generally known as sports fitness or motor fitness, but it is very specific and multi dimensional. e.g., agility is required in combat sports as well as in the job of a fire fighter. Exercise helps to promote health, to maintain or improve physical appearance and to improve the overall quality of life. Physically active people live life with less health problems and enjoy a better quality of life than people who are physically inactive. Regular physical activity has lots of permanent benefits. 1. Physical and physiological importance - Regular exercise improves posture, thus preventing back pain, neck pain etc. and improving physical appearance. It also helps to strengthen the cardiovascular and digestive systems. Muscular strength, endurance and flexibility is also improved by regular exercise. Exercise helps to maintain the balance between lean body mass and fat,and helps maintain body weight. A physically active lifestyle speeds up the recovery process after injury, disease or intensive work out. Due to continuous physical activity, flexibility of joints increases, reducing chance of developing arthritic pain and helping to relax muscles. It helps to maintain healthy bones and to maintain bone mass, which lowers the risk of osteoporosis. It also upgrades athletic performance and keeps energy levels high. Due to regular physical activity, an individual's resting metabolic rate become high and her/his body develops such immunity which help to lower incidence of disease. As a result, the individual feels energetic and that helps in job productivity, enjoyment of leisure time activities and the ability to face emergencies. 2. Mental and psychological importance - Regular physical exercise increases the function of brain, enhances memory, and develops creative thinking. Physical fitness enhances self-image, increases morale, self-confidence and self-esteem and also reduces tension, stress and anxiety. Psychological well-being helps an individual cope better with stress and anxiety, thereby improving her/his mental health. 3.3.3 IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL FITNESS 95 3. Social importance - Improved emotional health and self-esteem improves social relations. Increased self-confidence prompts an individual to reach out to others. Participation in physical activities and sports promotes leadership qualities and strengthens bonds of friendship. Also, participating in sports activities provides opportunity to meet new people who share a common interest. Meeting others may be the first step towards establishing new friendships and developing a support network. 4. Improved health - Continuous physical activity increases longevity and slows down the process of aging. It also decreases the mortality rate from chronic diseases. It promotes the quality of life, enabling the individual to live longer, happier and healthier. Physical activity improves sleep quality and increases sleep duration. Individuals who exercise regularly are less likely to suffer from troublesome sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome. Regular physical activity reduces risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, adverse blood lipid profile, metabolic syndrome, colon and breast cancers etc. It keeps the blood thin which helps to decrease chances of heart disease and stroke and to maintain level of blood lipid. 5. Improved financial condition - Regular physical activity makes an individual healthier and fitter and helps develop good habits. People who adopt an active lifestyle have less chances of falling ill, and less chance of disease means bigger savings in terms of money and time. I. Tick the correctoption. 1.

What do you mean by Physical Fitness? 2. What is the importance of Physical Fitness? Body Composition - Body composition may be defined as the relative percentage of fat and lean body mass. Lean body mass is fat-free mass of our body which covers muscle, bone, and other tissues that make up the body except fat. A healthy individual should have relatively low percentage of fat in the body. It is important for an individual to regularly check her/his own 3.4.1 COMPONENTS OF HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS Body Composition Muscular Endurance Cardiorespiratory Endurance Muscular Strength Flexibilit y97 b ody composition because body fat is associated with incidence of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension etc. There are several techniques to measure body composition. You will study some of these methods in greater detail in Unit 7. Height and W e ight Body Mass Index Wai st-to-Hip Ratio Gi rth Circum ference S kin folds B io electrical Impedance Analysis H ydrostatic We i ghing 1. Height and Weight - While measuring the height of an individual, keep in mind the following points: first, remove shoes stand up straight, and take a deepbreath look straight ahead r ecord the height in centimetres or inches To measure the weight of an individual, the following points should be kept in mind: remove shoes and as many clothes as poss ible record the weight i n kilograms The next step is to compare height and weight. This can be done using given parameters. However, as per experts' opinion no single number can represent healthy weight because fat, bone, muscle mass varies from individual to individual. 2. Body Mass Index (BMI) - Body mass index (BMI) is a convenient rule used to broadly categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. To calculate the index, it is required to measure height in metres and weight in kilograms. Carrying too much weight can lead to a variety of health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular problems. On the other hand, a weight that is too low can increase the risk of malnutrition, osteoporosis, and anaemia. 3. Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) - The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is a ratio between the circumference of the waist and the circumference of the hip. It indicates health risk of obesity. An individual who has a greater circumference of trunk is an indicator of high risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes as compared to an individual who has equal hip and waist circum ference. 5. Girth Circumferences - Circumferences of different segments of our body also give the estimation of body composition. It is a technique that is easy to administer and can be locally used to measure the size of muscles of arms, legs etc. It also shows the changes in the body before and after training and helps to document the body size. There are formulas to estimate the percentage of body fat where circumference isused. 98 6. Skinfolds - Skinfolds determine body fat quite accurately as compared to techniques mentioned above because skinfold measurements are directly measured. But still,it is not an absolute measure of the percentage of fat. The skinfold technique can only be performed by a trained technician with the help of skinfold callipers. Skinfold estimations are based on the principle that the amount of subcutaneous fat is proportional to the total body fat. But technically it varies according to gender, age and race. 7. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis - Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a commonly used method for estimating body composition, in particular body fat and muscle mass. In BIA, a weak electric current flows through the body and the voltage is measured in order to calculate impedance (resistance) of the body. Most of our body water is stored in our muscles. Therefore, if a person is more muscular there is a high chance that the person will also have more body water, which leads to lower impedance. Bio electrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a portable machine easy to administer and gives reliable results of body composition. 8. Hydrostatic Weighing - Underwater weighing is known as the gold standard method to measure body composition. It is also referred to as \"underwater weighing\", \"hydrostatic body composition analysis\", and \"hydro densitometry\". It is a technique for measuring the mass per unit volume of a living person's body. It is a direct application of Archimedes' principle, that an object displaces its own volume of water. This principle can be used to determine a person's percentage of body fat because the density of fat mass and fat-free mass are constant. Lean tissue, such as bone and muscle, is denser than water, and fat tissue is less dense than water. Basically, muscle sinks and fat floats. Therefore, a person with more body fat will weigh less underwater and be more buoyant. Someone with more muscle will weigh more underwater. Muscular endurance is the ability of the muscles to exert themselves repeatedly. A fit person can repeat movements for a longer period without undue fatigue. The definition of muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle group to execute repeated contractions over a period of time sufficient to cause muscular fatigue, or to maintain a specific percentage of the maximum voluntary contraction for a prolonged period of time. To measure muscular endurance following equipment are used: Free weights (barbells, dumbbells), Gym mat (curl-ups, push-ups), Stop watch. Following activities can be used to measure muscular endurance: Bench-jump Abdominal crunch Bent-legcurl-up Bench Press Biceps Curl Triceps Curl Half Squat 3.4.2 MUSCULAR ENDURANCE 99 Wrist Curl Lunge Cardio respiratory Endurance is the ability of the heart, blood vessels, blood, and respiratory systems to supply nutrients and oxygen to the muscles and the ability of the muscles to utilize fuel to allow continuous exercise. A healthy individual can sustain physical activity for a longer duration without undue stress. Lack of cardio respiratory fitness may cause restriction in daily activities due to inefficiency of the heart to supply blood to different body parts. Cardiorespiratory endurance activities are also called aerobic exercises. e.g., walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, cross-country race, skiing, water aerobics, climbing stairs and skipping a rope. An individual can be tested for cardio respiratory endurance through following tests. 12-Minute Swim Test Step Test 1.0-Mile Walk Test 1.5-Mile Run Test Muscular strength is the ability of the muscles to exert an external force or to lift a heavy weight. A fit person can do any work that involves exerting force like lifting or controlling own body weight, pushing almirah at home, lifting gas cylinder etc. The definition of muscular strength is the maximalforce that can be generated by a specific muscle or muscle group. Muscular endurance is defined as the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to repeatedly exert force against resistance. Muscular strength is defined as the maximum amount of force that a muscle can exert against some form of resistance in a single effort. There are two types of muscle fibres that allow for both muscular endurance and muscular strength. These are the fast and slow twitch fibres. Fast twitch fibres, also called Type 2 fibres, are the main source of muscular strength. Fast twitch fibres are able to produce more force but they fatigue much faster than slow twitch fibres. Slow twitch , or Type 1, fibres are mainly used for muscular endurance exercises because they contract more slowly and take a much longer time to fatigue. 3.4.3 CARDIO RESPIRATORY ENDURANCE 3.4.4 MUSCULAR STRENGTH Do you know? Fast Twitch fibres : muscle fibre that contracts quickly especially during brief high -intensity physical activity requiring strength such as sprinting. Slow Twitch fibres : muscle fibre that contracts slowly especially during sustained physical activity requiring endurance such as long-distance running. 100 Muscle strength is specific to the muscle group, type of contraction (static or dynamic; concentric or eccentric), the speed of the contraction, and the joint angle being tested. Therefore, no single assessment exists for evaluating total body muscular strength. The measurement of muscle strength production is used for the following: To assess muscular fitness To identify weaknesses To monitor progress inrehabilitation To measure effectiveness of training An individual can test Muscular Strength through following tests: Handgrip Test Procedures 1-Repetition Maximum (RM) Bench Press Test Upper Body Strength Isokinetic Testing Flexibility is the ability of a joint to move effectively through its full range of motion without incurring pain. Movement happens due to muscle length, joint structure, and other factors. A healthy person can move the body joints through their full range of motion in work and in sports. Due to lack of flexibility, performance of daily life activities decreases, and there is occurrence of problems like lower back pain. While whole body flexibility cannot be tested in one run, but \"sit and reach\" test is broadly used test to assess the flexibility of hamstring, hip, and lower back muscles. To measure flexibility through \"sit and reach\" test following equipment are used: Goniometers, sit and reach box Sit and Reach Test (Trunk Flexion) Before starting the test, an individual should do proper warm-up and stretching. 3.4.5 FLEXIBILITY Do you know? Static Contraction : where muscle exerts force but movement does not take place. Example: pushing wall, pulling rope Dynamic contraction : an individual can see movement when muscle exerts the force. Example: pushups, pull-ups Concentric Contraction : When muscle contraction takes place, shortening of muscle happens; that is concentric contraction. Eccentric contraction : in the process of contraction, the opposite muscle's lengthening takes place; that is known as eccentric contraction. 101 1. ReactionTime-Reaction time is an individual' sability to quickly respond to a stimulus. It is the interval time between the presentation of a stimulus and the initiation of the muscular response to that stimulus. e.g., in a sprint start, focusing on the starter's voice and the sound of the gun and reacting, reaction to a football, reaction of the goalkeeper during the penalty kick in a football match. Tests to measure reaction time include Reaction Time Ruler Te st Reaction Stick Ti mers Other game specific te st 3.4.6 COMPONENTS OF SKILL-RELATED FITNESS Reaction Time Power Balance Speed Agility Coordination 102 2. Power - Power refers to an individual's ability to act fast with resistance. It is a combination of strength and speed. Throwing shot put, long jump, kicking in karate are power dominant activities. Power can be tested by the following tests: Standing broad jump test Burpee jump test Medicine ball throw test Vertical jump Other game specific tests 3. Balance - Balance is an individual's ability to maintain the state of equilibrium while moving or in a stationary position. There are two types of balance one is static and another is dynamic. Static balance is where individual maintains the state of equilibrium in a stationary position. Dynamic balance refers to maintaining equilibrium during motion. Gymnastics, surfing, squash, diving are balance dominant sports. An individual can test the fitness component balance through following tests Flamingo Balance Test Stork Stand Test Standing Balance Test One Leg Stand Other game specific test 4. Speed - Speed refers to an individual's ability to perform the movement in the shortest possible time. It is the minimum time taken to complete the task. Examples are 100 m and 200 m sprint, ice hockey etc. Following are the tests to assess the speed of an individual: 20 meter dash 30 yard dash Other game specific tests 5. Agility - Agility is an individual's ability to change the direction of the body rapidly and accurately. It is a combination of speed, balance, power and co-ordination. Rugby, football, hockey are the examples of sports requiring agility. Following are tests to assess the agility of an individual: AAHPERD Agility Test Illinois Agility Run Shuttle Run test Zig Zag Test 103 ccc Other game specific te st 6. Coordination - Coordination is the ability of an individual to perform a motor task by using body movements and senses accurately and fluently. Juggling in football, hitting a tennis ball and kicking of football are good examples coordination. Stick Flip Coordination Test Wall-Toss Test B lock Transfer P late Tapping I.

Discuss in a group In what ways are the students in your class different from each othe r? (e.g., some may be short or tall, or have differentabilities) In what way do their different needs impact their learning capabilities? How important is it to respect individual differences and strengths? Share your views with the class. Wi th the introduction of the Right to Education, which makes education a fundamental right of every child between the ages of 6 and 14 all children - including those who are physically and mentally challenged, or afflicted with various types of disabilities and disorders - have the right to come to school to develop their abilities through the process of education. 4.1.1 WHAT IS ADAPTED PHYSICAL EDUCATION. 106 Do you know According to the WHO: Disabilities is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairmentisa problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; while a participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations. Disability is thus not just a health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person's body and feature softh society in which he or she lives. It is, therefore, the duty of all schools to provide them with such opportunities that they develop their learning. Do you know? Autism\u2014 a developmental dis order of variables everity that is characterized by difficulty in social inter action and communication and by restricted or repetitive patterns of thought and behaviour. Cerebral Palsy\u2014 a condition marked by impaired muscle coordination (spastic paralysis) and/or other disabilities, typically caused by damage to the brain before or at birth. Down Syndrome\u2014 a congenital disordera rising from a chromo somed efect, causing intellectual impairment and physical abnormalities including short stature and a broad facial profile. Dyslexia\u2014disorders that involve difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters, and other symbols, but that do not affect general intelligence. Muscular Dystrophy\u2014 a here ditary condition marked by progressive weakening and wasting of them uscles. Spina Bifida\u2014 a congenital defect of the spine in which part of the spinal cordand its mening esare exposed through a gap in the backbone. It often causes paralys is of the lower limbs, and sometimes learning difficulties. Children with Special Needs (CWSN) face different challenges in undertaking certain activities. So, in addition to the regular programmes of Physical Education (PE), the schools must provide Adapted Physical Education (APE) Programmes for children who may not receive benefits from regular Physical Education Programmes. Physical Education and sports are an integral part of a school routine. Regular PE sessions in school help develop a heathy lifestyle and attitude in school going students. It caters to their physical as well as social and emotional health. As you know, PE is important for development of gross motor and fine motor skills conditioning different systems in the body developing emotional health and wellbeing inculcating social values and obligations 107 Extension Activity Take a paper and make a ball with it. Throw the ball on the floor. Try to pick up the ball in as many different ways as you can. You may use your right hand, your left hand, foot, or your mouth. You could also use some equipment that may be available or take help from a friend. You could also try to pick up the ball with your eyes closed. How did you feel while picking up the ball? 4.1.2. ORIGIN OF ADAPTED PHYSICAL EDUCATION To make PE accessible for all students has been a need as well as a challenge. Every child is different as per their ability and they might need different plans, resources, teaching strategies and environment to enhance their learning. Children with special needs have less exposure to sports and physical activities. The very nature of their disability restricts the kind of physical activity that they can participate in. This exclusion from physical activity adds to the life style related challenges caused by their disabilities and they suffer from additional problems such as hyper activity, obesity, hyper tension, diabetes, and postural and movement deformities. This makes it imperative to adapt PE to their special needs. When you picked up the ball in the Extension Activity using different methods, it reflected your body's modification to the challenge. By using a tool, or a modified tool, you adapted equipment to suit your task. Similarly, by asking a friend for help, you experienced inclusion in the activity. The first Physical Education Programme for students with disability started in 1838, at the Perkins School for students with visual disabilities in Boston because the Director of the school wanted the students to receive the health benefits that could accrue to them through physical activity. Students of the school participated in gymnastic exercises and swimming. However, until 1952, many schools excused students with disabilities from participating in the Physical Education Programme. It was in 1952 that the American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation (AAHPER) formed a committee to define Adapted Discuss in your group Do you think everyone benefits from PE and Spor ts? In what way do students with special needs benefit through taking part in P E and Sports? 108 Physical Education and give direction for teachers. This committee defined Adapted Physical Education as \"a diversified Programme of developmental activities, games, sports, and rhythms suited to the interests, capacities, and limitations of students with special needs who may not safely or successfully engage in unrestricted participation in the rigorous activities of the regular Physical Education Programme.\" Adapted Physical Education is the art and science of developing, implementing, and monitoring a carefully designed Physical Education instructional programme for a learner with a disability, based on a comprehensive assessment, to give the learner the skills necessary for a lifetime of rich leisure, recreation, and sport experiences to enhance physical fitness and wellness. Adapted Physical Education (APE) generally refers to school-based Programmes for students aged 3-21 years. It is a structured way to make Physical Education and sports accessible to all with modified instruction, resources, space and environment for CWSN as per their ability. According to Adapted Physical Education National Standards (APENS) Adapted Physical Education is Physical Education which has been adapted or modified, so that it is as appropriate for the person with a disabilityas it is for a person without a disability. In other words, Adaptive Physical Education (APE) is Physical Education which has been adapted or modified to make it as appropriate for a person who is differently-abled as it is for a person without disability. It is basically a Physical Education Programme specially designed for differently-abled students so that physical education activities are safe, achievable, enjoyableand, therefore, a successful experience. APE is safe and beneficial even for infants and toddlers who need early intervention services because of developmental delays in physical, cognitive, communication, social and emotional aspects. Moreover, APE is not only for differently-abled infants and students but also for the people of all ages. Adapted Physical Education can be provided to students with special needs and leads to the development of 1. Physical and motor skills which include development of gross motor skills like sitting, standing, crawling, rolling and stretching and fine motor skills like holding, picking, pulling, pushing and pinching. 2. Fundamental motor skills and patterns including activities like throwing, catching, walking, running, and swinging. 3. Skills in aquatics, dance, and individual and group games and sports including intramural and life time sports. 4.1.4. IMPORTANCE OF ADAPTED PHYSICAL EDUCATION 4.1.3. MEANING OF ADAPTED PHYSICAL EDUCATION 109 T he Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (1990) uses the term disability as a diagnostic category that qualifies students for special services. These categories include 1. Physical disabilities - A physical disability is a limitation on a person's physical functioning and mobility. Physical disabilities include impairments which limit other facets of daily living. Amputation Arthritis Cerebral Palsy C lubfoot/hand Dwarfism Muscular Dy strophy Spina Bifida S pinal know? Padma Shri & Arjuna Award winner Deepa Malik became India's first female para-athlete to win a medal at the Paralympics. She won silver medal in the shot put at the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio. Deepa Malik has successfully proved that physical limitations can not detera strong mind. She was diagnosed with a spinal tumour in 1999. Although she under went three surgeries, she wasleft paralyzed from the waist down. Deepa did not let her physical impairment deter her and started her sports career at the age of 36. This all-ro under is the first paraplegic Indian wom an biker, swimmer, carrallyist, entrepreneur and social activist. 110 Do you know? 13-year-old autistics wimmer Yash Singh is the first Indian to win a medal at Special Olympics World Summer Games 2015 in Los Angeles. He won the bronze in the 25-metre backstroke swimming event. 2. Intellectual disabilities -Intellectual disabilitiesinvolve impairment of general mental abilities that impact adaptive functioning in three domains, or areas including conceptual, social and practical. These domains determine how well an individual copeswith everyday tasks. Intellectual disabilities have multiple causes including biological, psychosocial, or a combination. Developmental or inherited conditions include DownSyndrome 3. Cognitive disabilities - Neurological disorders which create hindrance instoring, processingand producing information are called Cognitive Disabilities. Cognitive disability affects ability to read, compute, speak and write. Extension Activity Find out about Indian athletes who have won medals at the Paralympics and the Special Olympics. What disability did they suffer from? In which game did they win the medal? 111 D yscalculia Dysgraphia Dyslexia 4. Affective disorders - Affective Disorders, also known as mood disorders or psychiatric disorders, include depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorder. Symptoms of these disorders may vary from individual to individual and can range from mild to severe. Individuals with these disorders may require help from a psychiatrist or other trained mental health professionals. Treatment would include both medication and psychotherapy. To involve students with affective disorder in individual sports like trekking, swimming, badminton, squash, cycling, tennis and rafting ,starting from non- competitive format, will be beneficial. A trained APE teacher or a trained coach may use different ways to occupy these students gainfully to enhance their confidence and self-esteem. The services provided by an APE teacher include (Adapted from Sherrill, 1998): Planningservices Assessment o f individuals Prescription/placement: the IE P Teaching/counselling/coaching Evaluation of services Coordination o f resources and consulting Advocacy Extension Activity Specially Designed Equipment CWSN require equipment which is specially designed or modified to suit the irability.

Category Physical disabilities Intellectual disabilities Cognitive disabilities Definition Examples 114 IV. Answer the following questions in 150-200words. 1. Describe some of the impairments of CWSN with suitable examples. Aim The chief aim of Adapted Physical Education (APE) is to provide every individual an opportunity to participate in Physical Education and sports and to make Physical Education accessible to all as per their need. Objectives The main objectives of adapted physical education include 1. To build a Programmeto meet the needs of CWSN - Since APE is developed as per the needs of the individual, it is, therefore, more beneficial for the student. For this purpose, the student is assessed on the physical education parameters and an individual education plan is designed. e.g., for a student with autism a structured programme with clearly defined timings, day, trainer/coach, start and finish of activity and description of skill withvisual cards is helpful for successful partnership. 2. To build in CWSN the capacity to be functionally active for lifetime - APE is a planned and structured Programme designed to fit the need of an individual. For Children with Special Needs, daily life skills become difficult due to restriction in movement, co-ordination challenges, life style issues, behavioural problems and cognitive challenges. APE conditions the brain, musclesand specific movementsfor different functional tasks, activities or sports/games skills. In this manner, APE stimulates activeness for life time with a regular Programme. e.g., a student with Cerebral Palsy crossing an elementary ladder hurdle where she/he needs physical help to accomplish the task though she/hetries to control her/his reflexes for lifting her/hisknee up, judging the space to cross the hurdle and landing her/his foot appropriately to maintain and regain her/his balance to finish the task. 3. To provide a safe and accessible PE and sports Programme as per the needs of the individual - During PE Programme, safety must be a primary concern as PE is very dynamic and reactive in movements. For children with special needs,who suffer from different physical and psychological challenges, the safetyissues may become magnified. Therefore, during an APE session, environment, instruction and equipment are modified to make PE safe and accessible. Specially designed Physical Education Programme is for those students who are not benefiting from general PE Programme or modified PE Programme. Here, special equipment and support is given to a student to access and enjoy sports and PE sessions. e.g., a guided or supported rope for a person withvisual impairment for running or walking, using light equipment for students with lower acti on time, using a structured programme or behaviour management for hyper4.2.1. AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF ADAPTED PHYSICAL EDUCATION 115 or emotionally challenged students. 4. To ensure active participation or transition towards the integrated or regular PE Programme (Inclusion) - APE ensures transition of a student from specially designed PE to integrated PE. APE ensures active and passive participation of a student through a planned programme according to individual needs. This programme can be implemented for maintenance of basic functional fitness, motor movements, skill oriented activities, competitive sports, integration and inclusion. e.g., a person with severe intellectual disability will be involved in physical education activities passively or with physical help to give her/him basic fitness to accomplish daily functional tasks,or a person with mild disability can be given a skill oriented programme where her/his goal is to perform a single sports skill such as dribbling, shooting or floating in water. 5. Helping to develop self-esteem in CWSN- APE helps to enhance self- esteem and self-image of CWSN when they are able to access the activity or sports and participate successfully. Ability to perform these tasks and activities easily, and the recognition they derive from this, encourages them to move on to higher goals. Once the goals set a rerealistic and achievable by working on their motor skills, and students receive recognition, their self-esteem is enhanced and leads to a better self-image. e.g., when a student with cognitive disability achieves success in a physical activity or sport, the resulting recognition leads to enhanced self-image and behavioural change. 6. To promote regularity and discipline -Participation in physical activity and sports provides a feeling of wellbeing which in promotes regularity and discipline. It encourages the student to continue the activity/sport and adopt a healthy lifestyle which helps overcome the challenges and achieve greater success. e.g., a child with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) may benefit even in cognitive fields with regular participation in sports as not only is her/his energy channelized gainfully but the increase in physical activity is also therapeutic. 7. To promote sportsmanship - The Collins dictionary defines sportsmanship as behaviour and attitudes that show respect for the rules of a game and for the other players. Sports include an element of fun and also discipline, where you try to achieve a target whether individually or as a team. When she/he learns and participate ssuccessfully in a particular sport, follows the simple rules such as regularity, waiting for her/his turn, listening to and implementing instructions, appreciating the efforts of others, accepting defeat, celebrating victory, feeling of oneness with the team, respecting authority and maintaining decorum on the field modifies her/his behaviour on as well as off the field. 116 I. Tick the correct options 1. The most important area catered to by Adapted Physical Educationis i. Physical health ii. Mental health iii. Social health iv. Emotional health 2. Exclusion from physical activity adds to lifestyle related challenges. The most important is i. Hyper activity ii. obesity iii. diabetes iv. postural problems II. Answer the following questions. 1. What is Adaptive Physical Education? 2. How does Adaptive Physical Education provide CWSN the capacity to be functionally active? 3. Why are safety issues important for CWSN during Physical Education? 4. How can safety standards be met for CWSN? 5. How does Adaptive Physical Education build self-esteem in CWSN? III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. Write a detailed note on the concept of Adaptive Physical Education. 2. What are the chief objectives of Adaptive Physical Education? Disability refers to limitations in individual functioning, including physical impairment, intellectual impairment, cognitive impairment, sensory impairment, mental illness and various types of chronic diseases. A person with disability is not able to participate in sports and physical education due to her/his impairment, and attitudinal and environmental barriers. 4.3.1. ORGANISATIONS PROMOTING ADAPTED PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORTS 117 E ncouraging participation in Physical Education and Sports 1. Role of Family - The role of family in encouraging a healthy, sports oriented lifestyle for a child with a disability is crucial. At times the family may find it difficult to accept reality, and may give up on the child. It is essential to promote awareness and to treat CWSN as equal in the family. CWSN may require a structured life routine where participation in recreational games and sports plays a very important role in developing a healthy mind and body of the child. Parents should observe certain different abilities of the child and take professional help to enable her/him to excel in the area. 2. Role of School - School gives a structured programme to a child or a group where co- scholastic activities and sports are a part of the regular routine. All schools must have trained APE teachers to give a specially-abled child access in games where movements are involved in a fun way for her/his holistic development. Here, a teacher or a coach helps a child to transit towards competitive sports under different organizations such as Special Olympics, Paralympics etc.. The school should take care to provide infrastructure that is compatible with the needs of CWSN e.g., a ramp along with stairs. Schools must run sensitization programmes so that CWSN are recognised for their efforts and organise intramural and extramural sports competitions or carnivals. 3. Role of Organisations - There are few organizations working at the grass root level to promote adapted sports. These organizations are responsible for training teachers and coaches for teaching, coaching and organizing sports events at Zonal, District, State, National and International levels. Art Integration - CREATING ZERO COST MATERIAL FOR CWSN CWSN are at times excluded from PE activities. As a result, they are likely to have poorer health, less education, and have to deal with greater inequalities than their peers. One of your classmates is a child with special needs. You would like to include her/him in your Sports/Games. Using the available material, design equipment for her/him that is safe and usable so that she/he is able to participate in Physical Exercise. Extension Activity Find out the history of the following events: 1.Special Olympics Bharat 2.Special Olympics 3.Paralympics 4.Deaflympics \"Paralympic\" derives from the Greek preposition para meaning beside or alongside and the word Olympic . Thus, the word Paralympics refers to an International Games Competition that is parallel to the Olympics and illustrates how the two movements existside-by-side. Although sports clubs for the deaf were already in existence in Berlin since 1888, and some sports competitions for athletes with an impairment were being organised for more than 100 years, it was not until after World War II however, that that they became widely accepted. The purpose at that time was to assist the large number of war veterans and civilians who had been injured during wartime. Dr Ludwig Guttmann opened a spinal injuries centre at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Great Britain in 1944, and in time, rehabilitation sport developed to recreational sport and then to competitive sport. On 29 July 1948, during the Opening Ceremony of the London 1948 Olympic Games, Dr Guttmann organised the first competition for wheelchair athletes which he named the Stoke Mandeville Games where 16 injured servicemen and women who took part in archery. This was a milestone in Paralympics history. In 1952, Dutch ex-servicemen also joined the Movement and the International Stoke Mandeville Games were founded. These Games later became the Paralympic Games which first took place in Rome, Italy in 1960 featuring 400 athletes from 23 countries. Paralympics is a major international multi sports event involving athletes with a range of disabilities. The first Paralympic games were held in Rome in the year 1960. The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs; at the 1976 Summer Games, athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at the Summer Paralympics. Till 1988, Winter and Summer Paralympic games were held as per a separate schedule. However, since the Summer Games of Seoul, Korea in 1988 and the Winter Games in Albertville, France in 1992 the Games have also taken part in the same cities and venues as the Olympics due to an agreement between the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). All Paralympic games are governed by the IPC. There are twenty-two sports on the Summer Paralympic programme and five sports on the Winter Paralympics programme. Several events are organised within some of the sports to include various disabilities. The vision of the IPC is, \"To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and to inspire and excite the world.\" The Paralympic anthem is \"Hymne de l'Avenir\" or \"Anthem of the Future\". It was composed by Thierry Darnis and adopted as the official anthem in March 1996. Given the wide variety of disabilities that Paralympics athletes have, there are several categories in which the athletes compete. The allowable disabilities are broken down into ten eligible impairment types which vary from sports to sports. 4.3.2. PARALYMPICS 119 Ca tegories A major challenge facing the organisers of para-sports is that the competition may become one sided and predictable, in which the least impaired athlete will always win. To prevent this, para-athletes are placed in categories for competition based on their impairment, these are called sport classes. Paralympic athletes have an impairment in body structure and functions that leads to a competitive disadvantage in sports. Consequently, criteria are put in place to ensure that winning is determined by skill, fitness, power, endurance, tactical ability and mental focus. When an athlete starts competing, she/he is allocated a class that may be reviewed throughout the athlete's career. The purpose of the criteria Defining the impairment group in which an athlete can compete i n the various sports. Grouping athletes in classes defined by the degree of activity-limitation related to the impairment and/or specific to the task in the sport. The IPC has established ten disability categories, including physical, visual, and intellectual impairment. Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics though not every sport can allow for every disability category. These categories apply to both Summer and Winter Paralympics. 1. Physical Impairment - There are eight different types of physical impairment: Impaired muscle power - With impairments in this category, the force generated by muscles, such as the muscles of one limb, one side of the body or the lower half of the body is reduced.e.g., spinal cord injury, spina bifida, post-polio syndrome. Impaired passive range of movement - Range of movement in one or more joints is reduced in a systematic way. A cute conditions such as arthritis are not included in this category. Loss of limb or limb deficiency - A total or partial absence of bones or joints from partial or total loss due to illness, trauma, or congenital limb deficiency.e.g., amputation, dysmelia. Leg-length difference - Significant bone shortening occurs in one leg due to congenital deficiency ortrauma. Short stature - Standing height is reduced due to shortened legs, arms and trunk, which are due to a musculo skeletal deficit of bone or cartilage structures. e.g., achondroplasia, growth hormone deficiency, osteogenesis imperfecta. 120 Hypertonia - Hypertonia is marked by an abnormal increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. Hypertonia may result from injury, disease, or conditions which involve damage to the central nervous system.e.g., cerebralpalsy. Ataxia - Ataxia is an impairment that consists of a lack of coordination of muscle movements.e.g., cerebral palsy, Friedreich's ataxia, multiplesclerosis. Athetosis - Athetosis is generally characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture (e.g. cerebral palsy,choreoathetosis). 2. Visual Impairment - Athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. This includes impairment of one or more component of the visual system - eye structure, receptors, optic nerve pathway, and visual cortex. The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team. Beginning in 2012, these guides, along with sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football, became eligible to receive medals of their own. 3. Intellectual Disability - Athletes with a significant impairment in intellectual functioning and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour fall under the category of intellectual disability. The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities, but the Intellectual Disability group has been added to some Paralympic Games. This includes only athletes with exceptional athletic ability who have intellectual disabilities diagnosed before the age of 18. However, the IOC recognized Special Olympics World Games are open to all people with intellectual disabilities. Special Olympics is the world's largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities. It provides year-round training and competitions to 5 million athletes and Unified Sports partners in 172 countries. Special Olympics competitions are held every day, all around the world\u2014including local, national and regional competitions, adding up to more than 100,000 events a year. Like the IPC, the Special Olympics organization is recognized by the IOC; however, unlike the Paralympic Games, Special Olympics World Games are not held in the same year or in conjunction with the Olympic Games. History of Special Olympics In June 1962, Eunice Kennedy Shriver started a day camp called Camp Shriver for children with intellectual and physical disabilities at her home in Potomac, Maryland. The camp sought to address the concern that children with special needs had very little opportunity to participate in organised athletic events. With Camp Shriver as an example, Kennedy Shriver, head of the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation and a member of President John F. Kennedy's Panel on Mental Retardation, promoted the 4.3.3. SPECIAL OLYMPICS 121 con cept of involvement in physical activity and other opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. Camp Shriver became an annual event, and the Kennedy Foundation gave grants to universities, recreation departments, and community centres to hold similar camps. The first games were held on July 20, 1968 in Chicago, Illinois, with about 1000 athletes from the U.S. and Canada. International participation expanded in subsequent games. In 2003, the first Special Olympics Summer Games held outside the United States were in Dublin, Ireland with 7000 athletes from 150 countries. The first World Wi nter Games were held in 1977 in Steamboat Springs, C olorado. Austria hosted the first Winter Games outside the United States in 1993. The World Games alternate between Summer and Winter Games, in two-year cycles, recurring every fourth year. Recognition Like the International Paralympic Committee, the Special Olympics organization is recognized by the International Olympic Committee; however, unlike the Paralympic Games, the Special Olympics World Games is a major event put on by the Special Olympics. Logo and Oath The Special Olympics logo is based on the sculpture \"Joy and Happiness to All the Children of the World\" by ZurabTsereteli. The logo is a symbol of growth, confidence and joy among children and adults with disabilities who are learning coordination, mastering skills, participating in competitions and preparing themselves for richer, more productive lives. The Special Olympics athlete's oath, which was first introduced by Eunice Kennedy Shriver at the inaugural Special Olympics international games in Chicago in 1968, is \"Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.\" Programmes run by Special Olympics around the world Young Athlete Programme For young people with and without intellectual disabilities between the ages of 2-7, Special Olympics has a Young Athletes Programme \u2014 an inclusive sport and play Programme with a focus on activities that are important to mental and physical growth. Children engage in games and activities that develop motor skills and hand- eye co-ordination. Unified Sports Programme In recent years, Special Olympics has pioneered the concept of Unified Sports, bringing together athletes with and without intellectual disabilities as teammates. The basic concept is that training together and playing together can create a path to friendship and understanding. The programme has expanded beyond the U.S. and North America: more than 1.4 million people worldwide now take part in Special Olympics Unified Sports. The goal is to break down stereotypes about people with intellectual disabilities and promote unity. Healthy Athletes Programme - This Programme offers health screenings to athletes in need. In 1997, Special Olympics began an initiative called Healthy Athletes that currently offers health screenings in seven areas: Fit Feet (podiatry), FUN fitness (physical therapy), Health Promotion (better health and well-being), Healthy Hearing (audiology), MedFest (sports physical exam), Opening Eyes (vision) and Special Smiles 122 (dentistry). Screenings educate athletes on health issues and also identify problems that may need additional follow-up. For example, the FUN fitness Programme assesses flexibility, strength, balance, and aerobic fitness of the athlete. Following the screen, the physical therapist would provide instructions on how to optimize their physical fitness in the are as screened. Special Olympic Sports Rules/Guidelines Athletes shall be divided into competition division based upon their ability, age and sex. Competition divisions are structured so that an athlete competes against another athlete of similar ability Special Olympics has more than 30 Olympic-type individual and team sports that provide meaningful training and competition opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. At competitions, medals are awarded to the first, second and third-place winners in each event, and ribbons are awarded to athletes who finish in fourth through eighth place. To participate in Special Olympics, a person must be at least 8 years old and identified by an agency or professional as having one of the following conditions: intellectual disabilities, cognitive delays as measured by formal assessment, or significant learning or vocational problems due to cognitive delay that requires or has required specially designed instruction.

Each individual is different in terms of his physical, social, emotional and cognitive characteristics. This diversity is a reality, and everyone should respect the differences of each other. Inclusion is vast concept that implies including everyone in education without being judgmental about the abilities, appearance economic condition etc. Inclusion in education refers to a model wherein CWSN spend most or all of their time with students with non-special needs. It is based on the notion that Inclusive Education is more effective for students with special needs since they get mixed experience. This social interaction leads to success in later life. Inclusion plays a big role to inculcate a safe, comfortable and emotionally secure environment in any educational institution. Inclusion is not a law to be forced on anyone. It is a process which enables a child smooth transition to understand, accept and implement the culture of inclusion in different situations. Physical education and sports play a very important role to promote inclusion in any educational institute. 4.4.1. INCLUSION ITS NEEDS AND IMPLICATION 124 N eed for Inclusive Education Inclusive education provides a student training for real life situations as all students, with or without disabilities, learn to interact and work collectively. 1. Builds Self Esteem - Inclusive classrooms are filled with diverse learners. This lets kids observe and talk about diverse learning patterns and the manner in which everyone learns in their own way. CWSN may find that they have more in common with other students and this goes a long way in building self-esteem. It also helps reduce stigma faced by those who have learning and attention issues. Differently-abled individuals show marked improvement in self- confidence if they have studied in a regular school. It can also help students build and maintain friendships. 2. Improves Social and Communication Skills : Inclusive education provides ample opportunities for all students - students with disabilities and those without disabilities - to have better social relations amongst themselves. Since social skills are learnt properly through observation and imitation, students with special needs get a better understanding of the world around them by being part of a regular classroom. This is especially true of students with intellectual impairment like autistic students. 3. Enhances Sensitivity - It has been noted that students without disabilities become more sensitive if they study in a classroom where they have students with special needs. They understand and appreciate their emotions and feelings and become more sensitive and caring towards them. They learn how to be more patient and to empathise with others. When children are involved in helping their peers, they not only derive immense satisfaction out of it, but often strike life long friendships with them. 4. Creates Better Understanding and Appreciation of others -In an inclusive classroom, students with or without special needs understand and appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of their classmates. They learn to appreciate these differences. 5. Creates a Sense of Belonging - All children are able to be part of a community and develop a sense of belonging. This makes them better prepared for life as they learn to value each other despite their differences. CWSN enjoy the acceptance and develop a feeling of belonging to the group of students with or without special needs. 6. Enhances Academic Performance - Inclusive education leads to better academic performance than in exclusive education. It provides better opportunities for learning as children with varying abilities are often better motivated when they learn in classes surrounded by other children. 7. Improves Performance - Since the expectations of all the children are higher in a mixed abilities classroom, inclusion attempts to develop an individual's strengths and gifts by stretching each individual to optimal performance. Implementation of Inclusive Education in India In India, the number of children/persons with disabilities or special needs is really large. As a result, they have a number of problems in getting education, especially 125 i nclusive education. It is important to implement inclusive education in India not only to provide benefits of inclusion to all individuals but also to ensure optimal utilisation of resources. India should emphasize on the following measures for effective implementation of inclusive education. 1. Ensuring effective implementation of the Right to Education in all states so that no child is left out of the ambit of education so that we are able to take care of the needs of CWSN. 2. Equipping teachers, especially in rural areas, through appropriate training and in-service workshops to teach CWSN in an inclusive classroom. 3. Developing a support team through regular analysis of schools, curriculum and amenities in order to give access to the regular curriculum methods to children with difficulties in learning. 4. Encouraging a flexible approach towards curriculum transaction whereby teachers and students are able to diagnose and resolve the problems that they face during the teaching learning process. 5. Involving parents as partners and as a resource in the decision-making process for enhancing their child's learning so that a collaborative effort results in effective inclusive education. 6. Looking at all children at what they can do rather than what they cannot do. It is important for the student's self-esteem that a child with special needs is not looked at with sympathy, but is recognised for her/his talents, capabilities and abilities. 7. Designing schools and classes in ways that help children learn and achieve to their fullest potential. Enrolling of CWSN in regular schools requires a lot of adjustments in terms of classrooms, transport facilities and educational materials and assistive devices such as audio textbooks or Braille text books, etc. 8. Developing education goals according to each child's abilities. Curriculum experts should carefully design programmes so that curriculum is made parallel for all the children with or without special needs in inclusive education. This also means that children do not need to have the same education goals in order to learn together in regular classes and will require the designing of a suitable examination system and putting in place periodic evaluation of CWSN to meet the challenges and changing trends. 9.

International Yoga Day New Delhi: International Day of Yoga (IDY), Yoga day or Antarashtriya Yog Divas is an annual event celebrated all over the world on June 21 since its inception in 2015. The idea of IDY was first proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), on September 27, 2014. Later, IDY was declared unanimously by the UNGA on December 11, 2014. Yoga is a physical, mental and spiritual practice that has its routes mostly in India. The date of June 21 was suggested by PM Modi in his UN address as it is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and is highly important in many parts of the world. Last year, 72 students and teachers from City Montessori School of Lucknow performed yogic exercises at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on the occasion of International Day of Yoga. In 2018, PM Modi participated in the event organised in FRI Dehradun. As many as 60,000 people are expected to turn up for the event. Discuss in your group What prompted our PM to introduce yoga to the world? How does yoga contribute to an individual's growth, development, health and fitness? Why was June 21 chosen as IDY? What are the objectives of IDY? Present your ideas to the class. 131 The intention behind introduction of yoga to the world is holistic development of the child which will lead to a well-balanced individual in all walks of life. In this unit you will learn what yoga is and how it can contribute to maintaining health and fitness levels in all walks of life. Apart from this you will also learn about different aspects of yoga. Yoga is a word derived from Yuj which in Sanskrit means union . Yoga is the union of soul with spirit. This union of soul and spirit is a long process which may take even many births according to Hindu scriptures. Yoga is also considered as union of the nerves Ida and Pingla , union of sunnerve and moonnerve, union of negativ e and positive, union of Shiva (spirit) with Shakti (mother nature) and union of Mooladhar Chakra (Coccyx plexus) with Sahasrar Chakra (thousand lotus petal a union of Prana Vayu with Apan Vayu (life current with excretion current.) While in the West, Yoga is being acknowledged for its many physical and psychological benefits, such as improved muscle tone, lower blood pressure, stress relief, increased vitality, and mental clarity, yet the original purpose of yoga was \u2014 and its highest purpose has always been \u2014 spiritual. Yoga is a science of experience which is meant for the upliftment of humanity. Yoga is the art and science of attaining true, lasting happiness. It is a science because it offers specific, practical methods for obtaining these benefits. It is an art, because its highest benefits come only through sensitive and intuitive practice; otherwise it yields only superficial results. Therefore, Yoga should not be misunderstood merely as a science for treatment of some diseases. In a broader sense it is a science which brings health and happiness on causal, astral and physical planes. All the religions of the world speak of the divine union of soul and spirit in one way or the other. Yoga (union of soul and spirit) can be achieved through any means, but yoga as propounded by Maharishi Patanjali is the fastest way. Do you know? In the modern era, Swami Vivekananda, introduced the importance of Yoga to the Western world, when he addressed the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893. Swami Vivekananda is also credited for being the greatest proponent of Yoga in the West. Stilling the whirlpools (modifications) of the mind stuff (Yogahchittavritt-inirodhah). - Yogamaharishi Patanjali. Skill in action (Yogahkarmasukoushalam). - in Bhagavad Gita. 5.1.2 DEFINITIONS OF YOGA 5.1.1 MEANING OF YOGA 132A skillful and subtle process to calm down the mind. - Yoga Vashistha \"Yogaiss aid to be the oneness of breath, mind, and senses, and the a band on ment of all states of existence.\" - Maitri Upanishad \"Yoga is said to be the unification of the web of dualities (Dvandva Jaala).\" - Yoga Bija \"Yoga is said to control.\" - Brahmaanda Purana Yoga is not a religion; it is a way of living which aims at achieving \"a healthy mind in a healthy body\". Man is a physical, mental and spiritual being; yoga helps to promote a balanced development of all the three. Other forms of physical exercise, like aerobics, assure only physical wellbeing. They have little to do with the development of the spiritual or astral body. Yogic exercises recharge the body with cosmic energy. Extension Activity Discuss with your group What are the short-term effects of yoga? What changes take place in your body if you do yoga regularly over an extended period of time? Are these changes obvious - relating to visible changes in your body e.g., building up of muscles, loss of body fat etc.? What changes occur in heart rate and breathing? What about changes that are not so obvious and are long-term - increased stamina, improved flexibility? Design a poster to show the effect of yoga on the body. You could use an outline of the body to show which parts of the body are affected, what those effects are and how to maximize benefits of exercise. The benefits of Yoga include facilitating attainment of perfect equilibrium and harmony. promoting self-healing. removing negative blocks from the mind and toxins from the body. enhancing personal power. increasing self -awareness. helping develop attention and concentration, especially important for children. 5.1.3 IMPORTANCE OF YOGA 133 reducing stress and tension in the physical body by activating the para sympathetic nervous system.

What is the modern concept of yoga? 3. How does yoga help inself-actualization? 4. How does yoga help in attitude formation? Yoga is more than just a physical discipline. It is a way of life-a rich philosophical path. And the yamas (social restraints) and niyamas (self-discipline) are ten good common-sense guidelines for leading a healthier, happier life and for bringings piritual awareness in to a social context. They are for the individual to think about and ponder over with a rational mind, because yoga is not about mindlessly accepting externally imposed rules - it is about finding the truth for oneself and \"connecting\" with it. 1. Yamas : Yama is the first \"limb\" of Ashtang Yoga . The 5 yamas are universal practices that help us move forward in our personal and spiritual development. The five yamas ask practitioners to avoid violence, lying, stealing, wasting energy, and possessiveness. The five yamas , or codes of conduct or moral disciplines towards the outside world are: a) Ahimsa \u2014 Sanskrit for\"non-harming\" Aparigraha \u2014 Sanskrit YOGA (ASHTANG YOGA) 134 Practicing Yoga's \"golden rules\" helps us attain a healthy mind and body, and it is important to follow the yamas without the desire for an end goal. a) Ahimsa (non-violence): Ahimsa means practicing kindness towards others, towards animals and towards ourselves in every thought and action. When we are compassionate and accepting of all ways of life we can handle any situation with grace. b) Satya (refraining from dishonesty) Satya is the principle of living with integrity. Satya refers to refraining from dishonesty and betrayal in thought, word, and deed. It is important to note, though, that ahimsa is still the most important principle. Thus, in case truth can cause harm or violence, the option to be exercised is one that will not cause harm. c) Asteya (non-stealing): Asteya teaches that everything we need in life is already within us. By choosing Asteya , we rise above our \"base cravings\" and become self-sufficient because we no longer desire something outside of ourselves. Feeling gratitude for what we have, and only taking what's freely given, makes it easy to wipe out feelings of envy or entitlement, and for authentic generosity. d) Brahmacharya (wise use of energy) Brahmacharya refers to the wise use and preservation of vitality. It does not mean celibacy, but rather acting responsibly with your vitality, as a way to respecting others and yourself. e) Aparigraha (non-possessiveness) Aparigrah a re fersto the ability to let go. It encourages non-grasping, non-clinging, and non-attachment to possessions or even thoughts. Aparigraha teaches you not to take it easy and be happy with what you have. 2. Niyamas : The niyamas, the second constituent of Asthang Yoga, deal with the manner in which we interact with ourselves and our internal world. Following the Niyamas helps the individual regulate her/his behaviour and maintain a positive environment in which to grow. Energy generated through the cultivation of the yamas is harnessed through the practice of the Niyamas . Swadhyaya or self-education,and e) IshwarPranidhan or meditation on the Divine. a) Sauchaimplies both external as well as internal purity. According to Manu, just as water purifies the body, truthfulness the mind andtrue knowledge the intellect, the soul is purified by knowledge and austerity. It advocates the practices of intellectual purity, purity of speech and of the body. b) Santosha or contentment is the second niyama , which is described as not desiring more than what one has earned through honest labour. Santosha implies that the state of mind does not depend on any 135externalcauses, and that one must maintain equanimity through all that life offers. Santosha involves the practice of gratitude and joyfulness - maintaining calm at all costs. c) Tapa or Austerity, the third niyama , is described in the philosophy of yoga as the power to stand thirst and hunger, cold and heat, discomforts of place and postures, silent meditationand fasts. It also maintains that the perfect man is he who practices both mental as well as physical austerity. Do you know? Maharishi Patanjali is a saint who is believed to have lived some time during the 2nd century BCE. He is known for his treatise on Yoga, entitled \"Patanjali Yoga Sutra\". d) Sw adhyaya or self-education, according to the commentator Vyas, consists of scriptural studies - the study of the Vedas and Upanishads together with the recitation of the Gayatri Mantra and the Om Mantra. e) Ishwar Pranidhan , the last of the niyamas , is described as the dedication of all our actions, performed either by intellect, speech or body, to the Divine. The results of all such actions are, therefore, dependent upon Divine decision. The mortal mind can simply aspire to realize the Divine through dedication, purification, tranquillity and concentration of the mind. This Divine contemplation spills over into all aspects of the yogi's life. Benefits of Practicing Yamas & Niyamas They amas and niyamas help in managing our energy in an integrated manner, complementing our outer life to our inner development. They help us view ourselves with compassion and awareness. They help in respecting the values of life, in balancing our inner growth with outer restraint. Inshort, Yamas and Niyamas are not about right and wrong, but are about being honest with oneself. Living according to these principles is about living our lives in a better way, and moving towards connecting with the Divine. 1. Asanas : Asana is a posture in harmony with one's inner consciousness. It aims at the attainment of a sustained and comfortable sitting posture to facilitate meditation. Asanas also help in balancing and harmonizing the basic structure of the human body, which is why they have a range of therapeutic uses too. 2. Pranayama : Pranayama is a compound term ( Prana and Yama ) meaning the maintenance of prana in a healthy manner throughout one's life. More than being merely a breath-control exercise, Pranayama is the art of the life force or prana . Ancient yogis, who understood the essence of prana , studied it and devised methods and practices to master it. These practices are better known as Pranayama since breath or prana is basic to life, the practice of Pranayama helps in harnessing the prana in and around us, and by deepening and extending it, Pranayama leads to a state of inner peace. According to Hatha Yoga , Pranayamas can : Pratyahara is the \"withdrawal of the senses\" and it is the fifth element among the eight stages of Patanjali's Ashtang Yoga , as mentioned in his classical work. It is also the first stage of the six-branch yoga of the Buddhist Kalachakra tantra , where it refers to the withdrawal of the five senses from external objects to be replaced by them entally created senses of an enlighten eddeity. 4. D harana : The last three limbs of Ashtang Yoga are the three essential stages of meditation. Dharana involves developing and extending our powers of concentration. This consists of various ways of directing and controlling our attention and mind - fixing skills, such as concentrating on the chakras or turning inwards. 5. Dhyana : Dhyana is the state of meditation, when the mindattains a state of concentration without getting distracted. Strictly speaking, unlike the other six limbs of yoga, this is nota technique but rather astate of mind, a delicate state of awareness, where the mind has been quieted, and in the stillness it produces few or no thoughts at all. This state rightfully precedes the finalstate of Samadhi . 6. Samadhi: Samadhi or total absorption is the ability to become one with the true self and merge into the object of concentration. In this state of mind, the perceiver and the object of perception unite through the very act of perception-a true unity of all thought and action. This is the acmeofallyogic endeavours the ultimate \"yoga\" or connection between the individual and the universal soul. Do you know?

Meditation can be an effective form of stress reduction and has the potential to improve the quality of life and decrease health care costs. Meditation involves achieving a state of \"thoughtless awareness\" inwhich the excessive stress producing activity of the mind is neutralized without reducing alertness and effectiveness. Authentic meditation enables one to focus on the present moment, rather than dwell on the unchangeable past or undetermined future. Meditation is the art of focusing 100% of your attention in one area. The practice comes with a myriad of well-publicized health benefits including increased concentration, decreased anxiety, and a general feeling of happiness. Although a great number of people try meditation at some point in their lives, only a small percentage actually carry on with it for the long-term. This is unfortunate, and a possible reason is that many beginners do not begin with a mindset needed to make the practice sustainable. Meditation is an absolutely wonderful practice, but can bevery difficult in the beginning. 1. Mindfulness Meditation: Mindfulness meditation, is about being aware of the sounds and activities happening around you. Brooding over past events, or thinking about future possibilities may lead to anxiety. In such situations, mindfulness meditation, themost widely practised type of meditation, can be helpful in calming the mind. It brings you and your thoughts into the present, focusing on emotions, thoughts, and sensations that you're experiencing \"in the now.\" While it can be initially difficult to quiet your thoughts, with time and practice you can experience the benefits of mindfulness meditation, including reducing stress and anxiety. It is almost a flow-like type of meditation, because you just let your mind be fluid and flow from one thought to the next, not really focusing on one particular thing. For instance, if you live in a noisy city, you don't have to block out the outside sirens and screaming children, you let your mind be aware of the sounds without becoming too focused. 2. Spiritual Meditation: This type of meditation is for those who regularly participate in prayer, as it is based on communicating with God. Just like the other styles, you must become calm and quiet and then begin to focus on a5.3.9 TYPES OF MEDITATION 5.3.8 MEDITATION (DHYANA) 158question or problem you might have. This style of meditation can be not only relaxing, but rewarding aswell. 3. Focused Meditation: If the idea of clearing your mind of all thoughts stresses you out, focused meditation is great because you can focus on a sound, object, mantra, or thought. The key here is to just focus on one of these things and stay committed to that one thought or object. This is when relaxation music comes in handy. Even though you are essentially using your mind, you will be amazed at how rejuvenated you feel afterwards because in our day to day lives, our mind can wander off to ten different places at the same time! 4. Movement Meditation: Movement meditation may seem intimidating, but if you are by yourself and you really get into it, it can be extremely uplifting and relaxing at the same time. Sitting with your eyes closed, simply focus on your breath and try out different gentle, repetitive flowing movements. Rather than focussing on a sound, object, or thought, just turn your attention to your movement. You may find a slow left and rights waying motion to be therapeutic, or you cou ld try moving your entire upper body in a slow circularmotion. 5. Mantra Meditation: Mantras are words that are chanted loudly during meditation. It may seem odd to be making loud noises during a meditation session, but it is actually the sounds that become the object being focused on. In Yoga, the mantra \"Om\" is regularly used since it delivers a deep vibration that makes it easy for the mind to concentrate on that particular sound. Produces a feeling of tranquillity and freedom in daily life. Reduces psychological disorders like anxiety, tiredness and depression etc. Provides relief from aches and pains, such as headache, joint pains etc., Leads to beneficial effects in problems such as in insomnia. Encourages peace through infinite patience, and increase in affection and sympathy for others. Leads to growth in devotion and belief in the SupremeBeing. Brings about a stronger urge and aptitude for service and cooperation in social life.

This process can be repeated 5-6 times, or for as long as there is still power in the abdominal muscles. 7. After the kriya is practised for some time, it is possible to move the Rectusabdominus from right to left, then left toright and also later, to move these muscles inacircular motion.

LEADERSHIP Leadership is the art of motivating a group of people to act towards achieving a common goal. He/she is the person in the group who possesses the combination of personality and leadership skills that makes others want to follow his/her direction. Leadership can be defined as a certain set of characteristics, behaviour or style that one exhibits on a day to day basis, through one's thoughts, words, and actions. \"It is better to lead from behind and put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership\". - Nelson Mandela \"The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things.\" - RonaldReagan 6.1.1 MEANING AND DEFINITION OF LEADERSHIP 179\"A leader is one who has power in authority.\" - H.T Mazumdar \"Leadership is the behaviour that affects the behaviour of the people more than their behaviour affects that of a leader.\" - LaPierre What, according to you are the qualities of a leader? Based on the quotations you read, and your own views, complete the web chart given below listing essential qualities of a leader. 1. HONEST Y 2. DELEGATION6. ACCOUNTABILITY 4. CONFIDENCE 8. RESPONSIBILITY 3 COMMUNICATION 9. FOCUS 5. COMMITMENT 10. ABILITY TO INSPIRE 7. ENTHUSIASM Inspiring A leader is 6.1.2 QUALITIES OF A GOOD LEADER 1801. Honesty One of the qualities that defines a good leader is her/his honesty. When a leader is responsible for a team of people, it is important for her/him to be straightforward. If she/he makes honest and ethical behaviour a key value, the team will follow. President Dwight D Eisenhower of United States once said, \"The supreme quality of leadership is, unquestionably, integrity. Without it, no real success is possible, no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office.\" Honesty and integrity are two important ingredients which make a good leader. A leader will not be able to get his teammates to be honest if she/he lacks honesty. Leaders succeed when they stick to their values and core beliefs and without ethics, this will not be possible. \"A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way.\" - John C. Maxwell Extension Activity Work in groups of six. Interview the Captains of your school's/a nearby school's Cricket Team, Football Team, Hockey team etc. 1.

How did you a handle a time when you had to make an unpopular decision Discuss what you have learnt and share your views with the class about the qualities of a successful Captain. 2. Delegation of duty It is important for a leader to focus on key responsibilities and delegate work, duties and, even, authority to other team members. A good leader delegates tasks to her/his teammates and oversees how they perform. By empowering the other members of the 181team, the leader shows that she/he has confidence in their abilities, and this can result in a positive morale in the team. If the leader continues to micromanage the team members, there will be a lack of trust between them. More importantly, she/he will not be able to focus on important matters. By providing them with all the resources and support they need to achieve the objective, and giving them a chance to shoulder responsibility, the leader empowers the team. Given a specific role or responsibility, the team members feel honoured and, as a result of the trust and faith of the leader, the teammates are able to handle the task given to them satisfactorily. 3. Communication Skills Communication is the key to success. Without clear communication skills, no one would understand their mission, goals, and vision. Communication should also be consistent when assigning a task or passing instructions. If the leader has effective communication skills, the team members will have a good understanding as to what is expected of them. Until the leader clearly communicates her/his vision to the team, and tells them the strategy to achieve the goal, it will be very difficult to achieve the desired results. In other words, if the leader is unable to communicate her/his message effectively to the team, she/he can never be an effectual leader. It is the leader's words that have the power to motivate the team and make them achieve the desiredgoal. 4. Confidence Another quality that defines a good leader is her/his confidence. To be an effective leader, she/he should be confident enough to ensure that others follow her/his instructions and the team places their trust in her/him. A leader must be confident and assertive to gain the respect of the teammates. If the leader is uncertain about her/his decisions and programmes, then the other team members will never follow her/him. Of course, confidence does not mean overconfidence or arrogance, but the leader must be responsible for holding the team together and winning the team's confidence and keep them moving forward by staying calm and self-possessed. 5. Commitment There is no greater motivation for the team than seeing their leader working alongside everyone else. By proving her/his commitment to the team, she/he not only earns the respect of the team, but also instils that same drive among the team members. The leader's commitment sets an example for others to follow, and leads to greater loyalty and respect for her/him as a leader. Since the team looks up to her/him, the leader's passion is the best way to motivate and inspire the team members to give their best shot. It also helps the leader gain the respect of her/his teammates and infuse new energy in the team, which helps them perform better. A feeling that the leader is not fully committed or lacks passion, on the other hand, demotivates the team. It is important to remember that if a leader expects the team to work hard and produce quality work, she/he would need to lead by example. 1826. Accountability A good leader takes responsibility for everyone's performance as well as her/hisown. When a leader takes personal accountability, she/he is willing to take responsibility for the outcomes of her/his choices and behaviours. Leaders do not blame others when things go wrong. Rather, they make things right - they are fixers. Accountability goes beyond the leader's actions and decisions. Accountable leaders assume ownership for the performance of their teams. When things are going well, she/he praises the team members. H owever, when problems arise, they identify them quickly, seek solutions, and get the team back on track. The leader must also ensure that every one of the teammates is accountable for what they are doing. If they do well, they must be praised, but if they struggle, they must also be made to realize their mistakes, and then work together towards improving performance. Holding the team members accountable for their actions will create a sense of responsibility among the teammates and they will go about their business more seriously. Extension Activity Look at thepicture. MS Dhoni tells his players: \"Don't think about winning or losing. Just go out, play your best cricket and enjoy the match. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. It does not matter as long as you are giving your 100%.\" What do you think the Captain is saying to the team? What would you tell your team if you were the Captain? Share in your group. Share the best advice with the class. \"With great power comes great responsibility\" - Anonymous \"A good leader takes little more than his share of the blame and little less than his share of the credit.\" - Arnold H Glasow 7. Enthusiasm The term enthusiasm is derived from the Greek origin meaning possessed by a god , is used for a leader who is motivating, energetic, passionate, and dynamic. A good leader is enthusiastic about her/his own work and performance and also about her/his role as 183leader. Teammates respond more openly to a person who is passionate and dedicated towards good performance. Leaders should be a source of inspiration, and be motivators towards the required action or cause. The leader should be a part of the team when working towards the goal. An enthusiastic leader brings excitement, enjoyment, and anticipation to the task, engaging teammates to participate. Thus, the leader's enthusiasm can lead to positive attitudes, better performance, and improved team behaviour. 8. Focus A good leader is generally focused and is able to think rationally. A leader should also be self- driven to work harder in wanting to achieve better results. Since she/he is the driving force in the team and also someone the team could look up to, the leader must be mentally strong. Inevitably, the leader will be criticised at some point, both within and outside the team. Equally, she/he needs to remain focused and aware while under intense pressure during a task or a programme, so that she/he can make the correct decisions at the right time. To cope with such situations requires considerable mental strength. So, the leader must stay focussed and encourage the rest of the members to be together for achieving the desired goal. 9. Ability to inspire Probably the most difficult job for a leader is to persuade others to follow. This is possible only if the leader is able to inspire her/his followers by setting a good example. In difficult situations, the team members look up to the leader and watch out for her/his reactions to the situation. If the leader handles it well, they will follow her/him. A leader should think positive and this positive approach should be visible through her/his actions. Staying calm under pressure and keeping the motivation level up, is an essential job of the leader. As John Quincy Adams puts it, \"If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.\" If you are successful in inspiring your teammates, you can easily overcome any current and future challenges easily. A leader should be able to inspire others to follow the path of loyalty, hard work, regularity and the value of time. 10. Responsibility Last, but not least, the quality that defines a good leader is responsibility. A good leader understands that leadership is about responsibility, and not power. A leader takes responsibility for her/his actions which includes both failures and successes. Being responsible requires accountability and adaptability. When leaders are accountable for things within their power and control, they are being responsible. Great leaders, at the same time, know that when it comes to their team members, they need to take personal responsibility for failure. A good leader does not make excuses; they take the blame regardless and then work out how to fix the problem as soon aspossible. I. Tick the correct options. 1.

Extension Activity \"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\" - Gandhi Look at the cartoon given below. Leadership is the process by which one individual influences the behaviours, attitudes and thoughts of others. A leader's actions are held to an unspoken standard of what is appropriate and what is not. In present day cricket, where sledging is very common, Rahul Dravid's boys showed exemplary behaviour. Discuss the role of a leader in the light of the above statement. 6.2.1 ROLE OF A LEADER 185Successful teams have strong leaders and the importance of this role is evident in all categories of sports. Leadership is an integral part of any sport. Whether you've been a coach for the last 20 years or you recently stepped up to lead your team as the captain for the first time, leadership should always be at the forefront of your thinking. It does come with a lot of pressure that's why it's important to incorporate certain values into your leadership to allow your team to reach its full potential and ease the overall pressure. 1. Instilling Positivity - Whether it has been a difficult training session, or a few dropped catches or a face-off with a very tough opponent in a crucial match - each of these situations requires a strong support system in place to tell the players not what they are doing wrong, but what they're doing right. This positive reinforcement is delivered on the field by the Captain, and off the field, by the Coach. The team's morale does not remain high if there hasn't been a pre-match motivational team-talk or some encouragement from the side-lines. This affects the team's performance. Thus, positivity is a very important part of leadership. The leader should be able to judge when to use a firm approach to motivate a member of the team and when it is the right time to encourage them. Success is more likely if the team is motivated. Indeed, motivation is an intrinsic part of team building and a challenge for the team leader. According to Sir Alex Ferguson of Manchester United \"For a football player and for any human being, there is nothing better than hearing 'well done'. Those are the two best words ever invented insports.\" 2. Regulating Group Behaviour - Groups are formed of individuals, and individuals influence work and work behaviour. Therefore, they cannot be ignored. A leader always tries to minimise individual behaviour that may be against the best interests of the whole team. The leader enforces rules effectively using rewards and punishments. She/He may warn the member or player of a team who demonstrates indiscipline, and reward a player who performs well. Thus, the leader deals with all matters pertaining to group or team discipline like rewards, warnings or, arbitration. 3. Communicating with the Team - The leader must set clear goals for the team and communicate these to the team. Communicating specific and clearly laid down goals leads to greater output and better team performance. Defining, developing, articulating, and communicating the vision inspires the team as they get a simple, clear, and relevant vision of the way ahead. This can be done either on a one-on-one basis, or collectively with the entire team. A successful leader, whether it is a Coach or a Captain, is one who can communicate her/his views to the team and her/his expectations from the team clearly and strongly. The main aim for a Captain or Coach is to find a way of communicating her/his views, ideas, suggestions in a manner that inspires the teammates to listen. She/He should be able to influence the players and bring about a change in their behaviour and performance. 4. Providing Feedback - Coaches and Captains lead their teams in different ways. Some coaches use a philosophy of pointing out mistakes and speaking negatively to players in order to keep them determined and on their toes, some take a 186softer, more informal approach. Whatever method the coach or captain uses as a leader, he/she should always look for opportunities to deliver useful feedback to players about their performance. However, the method of delivering feedback is very risky. The leader must work hard on her/his method of delivery because she/he runs the risk of not being listened to, which can prove pointless for certain players, or worse still, being resented for the way feedback is delivered, which can be disastrous for the team. A leader should also draw up an individual plan for each of the players in his/her team for their personal development and to help them progress. She/He should organize continuous review sessions with them throughout the season. It is a good idea to set targets for players so that they improve their levels. 5. Instilling a Desire to Win - A good leader always has the desire to win no matter what the circumstances are and instils the team with the same attitude too. A leader who has a negative attitude and a negative approach is not good for the team morale as she/he will lower the team's passion to win. A good leader leads by example and motivates the team whether it is in training, or on the field, or in the dressing room before or after a game, the leader's words must inspire the team and keep them all together, not just in a win but even after a defeat. The leader should not lose focus as she/he shoulders the responsibility to hold the fort and keep the players in the winning mindset. 6. Structuring the Situation - The leader has a duty to structure the situation for the group members by interpreting the actual situation, by clarifying ambiguities and by emphasizing certain aspects of a tournament or competition. She/He focuses on the goal and, in doing this, constantly strives for objectivity, without in any way denying important facts and distorting the data, however unpleasant or unpalatable it might be. Co-operative behaviour of group becomes possible only if group members accept her/his interpretation. The leader observes every situation minutely, and after the tournament or competition, she/he interprets the complete situation to members of a team. She/He clarifies doubts and sets goal for her/his team. 7. Commitment to Win - The leader puts in the extra hours to review a match, talk to the players - together, or one-on-one - or, even plan an extra training session because players are going to benefit from this hard work. Such commitment in the leader will produce a positive response from the players. By putting in these hours, the leader will gain a lot of respect and hard work from theteam. 8. Gaining the Team's Respect - A good leader must have the team's respect. The respect of the players for the leader is vital to gaining their commitment on the field. Respect makes people listen to the leader, and take her/his advice. e.g.,ifthe leader suggests a new strategy, the team will put it into practice only if they respect the leader. The leader must remember, however, that respect is earned, not demanded. To gain a good level of respect, the leader needs to be able to relate to players, be approachable and open to feedback herself/himself. Otherwise she/he will struggle to strike up relationships with players. 187I. Tick the correct options. 1. The leader instils positivity among the teamby i. holding difficult training sessions ii. pulling up players making mistakes iii. telling players their strengths iv. sitting and observing the team from the sidelines. 2. The leader regulates group behaviour by i. ignoring individual differences within the group ii. enforcing rules firmly through rewards and punishment iii. dealing with matters of group discipline in an arbitrary manner iv. overlooking a member spreading indiscipline within the team II. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. How does a good leader regulate team behaviour? 2. A leader's responsibility is to see that the plans of the group are put into execution. Elaborate. 3. The leader's foremost function is to structure the situation for the group members. How does she/he do this? III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. What role does a leader play in leading her/his team tos uccess? 2. Explain the role of the leader in holding her/his team together. Leadership is a complex process that involves the effort of an individual to help groups identify and achieve personal and group goals. Physical activity and sport Programmes offer great opportunities for youth to develop important life skills, including leadership. The battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton. - The Duke of Wellington Le aders have both innate and acquired qualities. Through physical education acquired qualities can be created and developed successfully. Sports and physical activities are highly interactive, provide numerous leadership opportunities or \"moments\" for young people to gain leadership experience e.g., enforcing rules for teammates provides an opportunity for a young captain to learn leadership in an enjoyable, motivating way. For creating or making the effective and efficient leaders in the field of physical education, stress must be laid down on the following points: 6.3.1 CREATING LEADERS THROUGH PHYSICAL EDUCATION 1881. Analysing leadership skills required for further development : It is essential to analyse leadership skills that are already well developed among the students and those which need further development. 2. Identifying the students or groups of students whose leadership skills required to be improved : Once players are involved in leadership activities, they must be given the chance to further improve their leadership skills by being given opportunities in leading teams and organising various sports competitions, and then observing signs of improvement in their leadership skills. 3. Offering opportunities for leadership roles : For improving leadership skills it is important students are offered leadership roles such as supervising and managing sports activities. They may be appointed captains of different sports teams, given various responsibilities such as membership of various committees, official duties and ground preparation duties, supporting other students in their play, organising festivals and assisting teachers and coaches in running clubs andteams. leadership courses are organised for students. Care should be taken, however, to ensure that these courses lead to an application of the knowledge, skill andunderstanding. students are given opportunities to develop their skills by giving them tasks that show progression in challenge and complexity. leaders are recognised by giving them a symbol of recognition like a cap or other uniform. This will serve to motivate other students. 4. Having faith and confidence in the students : It is essential to believe in the leadership skills of the students and to give them a chance for improving them. 5. Rewarding them for their success : Rewarding students for showing improvement by giving them more responsibilities helps in developing their potential. Parental involvement also has a key role to play in training successful leaders. They should be included in physical activity instruction and in co-curricular and community physical activity programmes, and encouraged to support their children's participation in enjoyable physical activities. Parental involvement in children's physical activity is key to the development of a psycho-social environment that promotes physical activity among young people. Involvement in these programmes provides parents opportunities to be partners in developing their children's knowledge related to physical activity, attitudes, motor skills, confidence, and behaviour. Thus, teachers, coaches, parents and other school and community personnel should encourage students to become great sports leaders. We can certainly do much more to \"intentionally\" help young people develop their leadership capabilities and skills. We cannot only make them physically fit but we can teach them life skills, like leadership, that enable them to be more productive members of society. 189I. Tick the correct options. 1. The three long-term goals in a Physical Education include i. developing competency in sport, leadership and team work ii. creating leaders, communicators and coaches iii. organising leadership training and literacy in sports iv. highlighting sports culture, knowing the sport and being a good fan 2. Sports and physical activities provide numerous leadership opportunities as they i. identify students for improvement ii. analyse leadership iii. develop individual skills iv. are highly interactive II. Complete the following flowchart outlining how leaders are created through Sports . 190Discussion Which of the following sports would you describe as Adventure Sports? Why? Adventure is about going out of one's comfort zone to open up to the experiences and beauty that life gives all. Adventure sports are also called extreme sports . They are activities involving high degree of risk. Such activities often involve speed, height, a high level of physical exertion and at times specialized gear. They also involve a high level of danger. These are usually outdoor sports involving intense, sometimes even life-threatening, actions. Do you know? Adventure: Engaging in an unusual and exciting, typically hazardous, experience or activity. Objectives of Adventure sports 1. Developing self-confidence: By overcoming the fear and experiencing the thrill of successfully completing an adventure activity one can develop self-confidence. 2. Building concentration : While participating in these adventure sports a person has to be very alert and attentive all the time. Therefore, it helps develops concentration. 3. Developing mental and physical fitness : These sports help in developing mental and physical fitness. Physical fitness is developed because the individual works for long hours in difficult circumstances, in tough terrains. And because one has to pass through such difficult situations a number of times, one becomes mentally strong. 6.4.1 MEANING OF ADVENTURE SPORTS 1914. Improving social relations : During participation in adventure sports, qualities like sympathy co-operation, helpfulness, adjustment, group cohesion, unity, sincerity, patience, fraternity are developed because one normally works in groups together with unknown people. 5.

Inculcating sportsmanship : Adventure sports develop honesty, sincerity and similar virtues in the participants and these qualities together improve sports manship. Types of Adventure sports: (Rock climbing, trekking, River Rafting, Mountaineering, Surfing and Para Gliding) 1. Rock Climbing : Rock climbing is a sport or activity where an individual climbs a rock, especially with the aid of ropes and other special equipment. It is done for locomotion, recreation and competition. It is generally done outdoors but can also be done indoors on man-made structures. 192 Rock climbing styles include free, trad (or, Traditional), aid, solo, ice and mountain. Before one sets out to climb, one needs appropriate equipment, including carabineers that connect rope and harness. The harness is needed to hold up while one is climbing. Equipment required: Carabineers Harness Strongrope Helmet Gloves Climbingshoes 2. Trekking: Trekking is walking long paths on uneven routes, in extreme weather conditions. It is a soft- adventure sport and therefore almost anyone in reasonable physical condition can go trekking. To get initiated into trekking, begin with day hikes, returning to the starting point in the evening. One can venture into the mountains with an experienced trekker, join an adventure club, or go with an adventure travel company. It is not a good idea to venture out into the mountains alone. A basic knowledge of camp craft, map- reading and first-aid is essential before one goes trekking. A basic course in mountaineering and a first-aid course are recommended if one decides to take it up more seriously and trek to remote/high-altitude areas. Equipment required: Small rucksack /knapsack Sleepingbag Armyknife Whistle Jacket/vest for cool evenings. jacket: waterproof and breathable. Trekking pants, light, comfortable, waterproof/breathable. Long sleeve shirt; light weight, fast-dry (for sun/in sect protection). T-shirts for day time Long sleeve jacket or warm pullover. Short pants,under wear, Sun hat to protect skin from directs unlight Woollen cap for high altitude or during evenings incamp. Sweatpants for cold evenings. A pair of hand gloves or woollengloves Scarf to protect from dust or sunlight. 3. River Rafting: Rafting is a recreational outdoor activity which uses an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on white- water or different degrees of rough water. Dealing with risk and the need for teamwork is very important. It is a challenging, but tremendously fun, activity. The presence of rocks and a sudden surge of water makes it a thrilling experience. Difficulty/adventure are felt due to sudden plunges in the river's height, and also because of small or big rocks that are sometimes found lurking in the waters. Equipment required: Inflatable raftingboat. Lifejacket. Helmets. Carbon throwbags. 4. Mountaineering: Mountaineering , also called mountain climbing, is the sport of attaining, or attempting to attain, high points in mountainous regions. Climbing mountains embodies the thrills that are born out of testing one's endurance, courage and stamina to the utmost in inherently risky situations. Mountaineering is normally a group activity, where every member appreciates and supports each other. For most climbers, the pleasures of mountaineering lie not only in the \"conquest\" of a peak but also in the physical and spiritual satisfaction brought about through intense personal effort, ever-increasing proficiency, and contact with natural surroundings. There are three phases of the sport - hiking, rock-climbing, and climbing the snow and ice - and each is quite different. Hiking is the essential element of all climbing, because in the end mountains are climbed by placing one foot in front of another over and over again. The most arduous hours in mountaineering are those spent hiking or climbing slowly, steadily, hour after hour, on the trails of a mountain's approach or lower slopes. Do you know? Bachendri Pal is an Indian mountaineer, who in 1984 became the first Indian woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest. She was awarded the third highest civilian award, Padma Bhushan, by Governmentof India in2019. In 1984, India had scheduled its fourth expedition, Everest '84, to Mount Everest. Bachendri Pal was selected as one of the members of the elite group of six Indian women and eleven men to attempt to climb Mount Everest (Sagarmatha in Nepalese). The team was flown to Kathmandu in March 1984, and from there they moved onwards. Recalling her first glimpse of the Mount Everest, Bachendri once reminisced: \"We,the hill people, have always worshiped the mountains...my over powering emotion at this awe-inspiring spectacle was, therefore, devotional.\" The team commenced its ascent in May 1984. Her team almost met disaster when an avalanche buried its camp, and more than half the group abandoned the ascent 195because of injury or fatigue. Bachendri Pal and the remainder of the team pressed on to reach the summit. On 22 May 1984, Ang Dorjee (the Sherpa Sirdar) and some other climbers joined the team to ascend to the summit of Mount Everest; Bachendri was the only woman in this group. They reached the South Col and spent the night there at Camp IV at the altitude of 26,000 ft (7,924.8 m). On 23 May 1984, early morning at 6:20 a.m., they continued the ascent, climbing \"vertical sheets of frozen ice\"; cold winds were blowing at the speed of about 100 km per hour and temperatures touching minus 30 to 40 degrees Celsius. On 23 May 1984, the team reached the summit of Mount Everest at 1:07 p.m. IST and Bachendri Pal created history. She achieved this feat on the day before her 30th birthday. Eq uipment required: Rope (dry preferred) Helmet. Harness (with adjustable legloops) Boots (crampon-compatible) Crampons. Ice axe (with leash) Belay/rappel device. Pulley. 5. Surfing: Surfing is a surface water sport in which the waverider or a surfer rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools. 196 Equipment required: Surfboard Fins Leash Surf Wax Traction Pad Wetsuit 6. Paragliding: Paragliding is a recreational adventure sport. A lightweight glider aircraft is used for the purpose. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside. Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres. The speed range of paragliders is typically 20-75 kilometres per hour (12-47 mph). 197Equipment required: Wing orcanopy Harness. Variometer. Radio. GPS. I. Tick the correctoptions 1.

Working in groups, complete chart given below listing the importance of testing and measurement insports. 2. What are the tests that could be administered to the athletes? Importance of Testing and Measurement of Athletes Selection of an athlete for a particular game 201Re member when you tried sit-ups for the first time. As a child, you probably did number of sit-ups. You were performing sit-ups to improve your strength endurance. Do you remember your Physical Education teacher counted your sit-ups in your Physical Education class and said, \"You were very good!\" Numbers are a part of everyone's life and they can be used in measurement. Measurement is a way of giving meaning to numbers. Further, decision making is a daily task. Many people make hundreds of decisions daily; and to make wise decisions, one needs information. The role of measurement is to provide decisionmakers with accurate and relevant information to make informed choices. Do you know? A test is an instrument or tool used to make a particular measurement. This tool may be written, oral, a mechanical device (such as a treadmill), physiological, psychological, or another variation. Measurement is the act of assessing. Usually this results in assigning a number to the character of whatever is assessed. Evaluation is a statement of quality, goodness, merit, value, or worthiness about what has been assessed. Evaluation implies decision making. Example 1: A physical education teacher records the 30 sit-ups that a student completes in 1 min and reports the score as Good. In this example, Test is Sit-ups, Measurement is 30 sit-ups and Evaluation is Good. In our day to day life we all collect data and information before making decisions. e.g., you might gather information about your friend's marks, health, fitness, type of vehicle, number of vehicle, number of students in a class etc. Physical Educationists collect data related to fitness characteristics because of the relationship between fitness, physical activity and quality of life. The variables measured might include the amount of physical activity, blood pressure, weight height, strength what not. Physical educationists might be interested in measuring different items for taking better decisions.Thus,to make decisions, it is extremely important to measure and evaluate in an accurate manner. Making effective decisions depends on first obtaining relevant information. This is where testing and measurement enterthe picture. The most basic principle of this text is that measurement and evaluation are essential to sound educational decision making. 7.1.1 WHAT IS A TEST 202The terms test, measurement, evaluation, and assessment are occasionally used inter changeably, but most users make distinctions among them. Test is usually considered the narrowest of the three terms; it implies to the tools, instrument or set of questions to measure a dimension, quality or condition, of a any person, object, event. Measurement Measurement refers to the quantitative form of assessment and also refers to the scores obtained through test. Measurement is requisite for evaluation in a quantitative form of numbers or scores. E valuation is \"the process of delineating, obtaining, and providing useful information for judging decision alternatives.\" Other definitions simply categorize evaluation as professional judgment or as a process that allows one to make a judgment about the desirability or value of something. Thus, measurement is not the same as evaluation. Two athletes may obtain the same measure (test score), but we might evaluate those measures differently because of the different criteria for evaluation available in-terms of norms and criterion measures. The term assessment is also used in a variety of ways. Much of the time the word is used broadly, like evaluation; or,it is often used to indicate the use of both formal and informal data-gathering procedures and the combining of the data in a global fashion to reach an over all judgment. At times, assessment isused more particularly to refer to 7.1.2 TEST, MEASUREMENT, EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT 203the clinical diagnosis of an individual's problems.It is important to point out that we never measure or evaluate people. We measure or evaluate characteristics or properties of people: their scholastic potential, knowledge of algebra, honesty, perseverance, ability to teach, and so forth. Definitions A test is a tool to evaluate the skill, knowledge, capacities or aptitudes of an individual or a group. - Webster's Dictionary Test refers to any specific instrument, procedure or technique used by an administrator to elicit a response from the test-taker. - H M Barrow and Megee Test is the form of questioning or measuring used to access retention of knowledge, capacity or ability of some endeavour. - Barry L Johnson and Jack Nelson A test is an instrument or a tool used to make a particular measurement. The tool may be written, oral, mechanical, or an other variation. Measurement refers to the process of administrating a test to obtain quantitative data. - H M Barrow Measurement aids evaluation process in which various tools and techniques are used in collection of data. - Barry L Johnson and Jack Nelson An evaluation is an assessment, as systematic and impartial as possible, of an activity, project, Programme, strategy, policy, topic, theme, sector, operational area, institutional performance.. - United Nations Evaluation Group Evaluation is the process of education that involves collection of data from the products which can be used for comparison with preconceived criteria to make judgement. - H M Barrow and Megee Me asurement numbers are composed of scales. There are four scales of measurement: Nominal measurement scales - Nominal measurement scales are used to name or label thingsor to depict categories. Nominal scales put things or people into categories. e.g., Gender is categorized in Male andFemale. Ordinal scales - Ordinal scales order or rank things. In measurement, an assigned rank given to a person or thing is an ordinal number. e.g., First, Second and Third rank in sports. Interval scale - The most commonly used scale in measurement in physical education is the interval scale. Interval measurement scales are based on a7.1.3 SCALES OF MEASUREMENT 204 continuum where the interval (or distance) between any two numbers is always the same. The intervals are equal to each other. e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8 are at equal interval of 2. This scale does not have an absolute meaning of zero. Ratio scale - The most advanced, the most sophisticated, and the most precise measurement scaleis the ratio scale. The ratio measurement scale is distinguished from the interval measurement scale by the fact that it has an absolute, true zero that has meaning. e.g., if somebody's pulse is zero mean there is no life in the individual. If something weighs zero, it means it is w eightless. I. Tick the correct option. 1. Zero degree temperature is an example of scale of measurement. a. Nominal b. Interval c. Ordinal d. Ratio 2. Mohan's height is 3ft 11in. 3ft 11 in is an example of a. test b. measurement c. evaluation d. assessment II. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. What is a test? 2. What is measurement? 3. What is Evaluation? There are several ways, then, in which evaluation procedures aid the teacher: (1) they help in providing knowledge concerning students' entry behaviours. (2) they help in setting, refining, and clarifying realistic goals for each student. (3) they help in evaluating the degree to which the objectives have been achieved. (4) they help in determining, evaluating, and refining the instructional techniques. The importance of readiness for learning is a well- accepted principle. To teach effectively we must establish where a student is, and start from there. We should have estimates of the student's capacity for learning, as well as estimates of what he currently knows. We cannot, for example, teach lofted kick to a student who cannot hitt he ball. To be effective teachers, we must be aware of what our students already know. 7.2.1 IMPORTANCE OF TEST, MEASUREMENT & EVALUATION IN SPORTS 205A physical educationist might be interested in knowing whether the students are physical fit or whether they are equipped with sufficient fundamental skills for them to participate in different activities. So, in order to give them the best form of physical education Programme, a physical education is needs to have the knowledge of Test, Measurement and Evaluation be cause the ultimate goal is to make an informed decision. Measurement and evaluation aid the student by (1) communicating the teacher'sgoals, (2) increasing motivation, (3) encouraging good study habits, and (4) providing feedback that identifies strengths and weaknesses. Overall there are six general points that highlight the importance of measurement and evaluation in physical education and sports: placement, diagnosis, prediction, motivation, achievement, and programme evaluation. Placement : Every student cannot be given the same training programme. Placement refers to the grouping of the students into categories like high fitness and low fitness, swimmers and non- swimmers, skilled and unskilled because students must be put into categories for being imparted the most suitable training. In other words, test and measurement is important to provide a means of classifying students for instruction and participation. Diagnosis: Diagnosis is important to determine the strengths, weaknesses and limitations of individuals in physical education activity so that appropriate training can be provided. Diagnosis helps to determine the need(s) of the student. Thus, it is important to measure the abilities and capacities of each student in physical education activities. Prediction : Test scores can be viewed as predictors of one's future success in school. Physical Education teachers may use the physical activity patterns, cardiovascular endurance, blood pressure, body fat, or other factors to predict the student's fitness level. 7.2.2 IMPORTANCE OF MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION 206Motivation : Testing, measurement and evaluation gives the status of physical fitness, sports skills and other parametres which motivate the student to do better and better. Achievement : In a Programme of instruction or training, a set of objectives must be established by which participants' achievement levels can be evaluated. For instance, in this course, your final achievement level will be evaluated and a grade will be assigned on the basis of how well you met some objectives set forth by the instructor. Programme e valuation : The goal of Programme evaluation is to demonstrate (with sound evidence) the successful achievement of Programme objectives to your superiors. A physical education teacher, may be asked to demonstrate how the students are receiving appropriate physical fitness training. So, one might compare students' fitness test results with the test results of students in another school district or with national test norms. I. Tick the correct options. 1. The term 'placement' refers to i. giving all students the same training Programme ii. placing students into categories based on their skills iii. determining the strengths and weaknesses of individuals iv. predicting a student's future success in a particular sport 2.

Answer the following questions briefly. 1. What is the role test and measurement in Diagnosis? 2. What is role of Test and measurement in Placement? III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. Distinguish between Test, Measurement and Evaluation. Highlight their importance in Sports. Confusion surrounds the precise meaning of the terms overweight , overfat , and obese as applied to body weight and body composition. Each term often takes on a different meaning depending on the situation and context of use. The medical literature infers the term overweight to an overfat condition despite the absence of accompanying body fat measures while obesity refers to individuals at the extreme of the overweight (overfat) continuum. The Body Mass Index (BMI) is the measure most often used for this distinction. The overweight condition refers to a body weight that 7.3.1 BODYMASS INDEX (BMI) 207exceeds some average for stature, and perhaps age, usually by some standard deviation unit or percentage. The overweight condition frequently accompanies an increase in body fat, but not always (e.g., male power athletes), and may or may not coincide with the comorbidities like glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension (e.g., physically fit overfat men and women). When bodyfat measures are available (hydrostatic weighing, skinfolds, girths, bioelectrical Impedance Analysis [BIA], Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry [DXA] that you have already studied in Chapter 3) it becomes possible to more accurately place body fat level on a continuum from low to high, independent of body weight. Overfatness, then, would refer to a condition where body fat exceeds an age- and/or gender-appropriate average by a predetermined amount. In most situations, \"overfatness\" represents the correct term when assessing individual and group body fat levels. The term obesity refers to the overfat condition that accompanies a constellation of comorbidities that include one or all of the following components of the \"obese syndrome\": glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, increased risk of coronary heart disease and cancer. Extension Activity Record the height and weight of all students in your class. Find the BMI byapplying formula. Find the Waist Hip Ratio using the givenformula. Clinicians and researchers frequently use the body mass index (BMI), derived from body mass and stature, to assess \"normalcy\" for body weight. This measure exhibits a somewhat higher, yet still moderate, association with body fat and disease risk than estimates based simply on stature and body mass. BMI Computation BMI computes as follows: BMI = Body mass / stature (m2) Example Male stature: 175.3 cm, 1.753 m ; = 97.1 / (1.753)2 = 31.6 kg .m-2, or simply 31.6 BMI Classification < 18.5 Under weight 18.5-24.9 normal weight 25.0-29.9 Overweight 30.0-34.9 class I obesity 35.0-39.9 class II obesity 40.0 class III obesity 208 The waist to hip ratio determines the possibility of health risks and is an indication of whether you have an apple- or pear-shaped figure. The waist to hip ratio measurement is calculated by dividing the measurement of your waist by your hip measurement. Aim: the purpose of this test to determine the ratio of waist circumference to the hip circumference, as this has been shown to be related to the risk of coronary heartdisease. Equipment required: tape measure Procedure: A simple calculation of the measurements of the waist girth divided by the hi p girth. Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR) = Gw / Gh, where Gw = waist girth, Gh = hip girth. It does not matter which units of measurement you use, as long as it is the same for each measure. Scoring: The table below gives general guidelines for acceptable levels for hip to waist ratio. Acceptable values are excellent and good. You can use any units for the measurements (e.g. cm or inches), as it is only the ratio that is important. Target Population: This measure is often used to determine the coronary artery disease risk factor associated with obesity. Advantages: the WHR is a simple measure that can be taken at home by anyone to monitor their own body composition levels. Other Comments: The basis of this measure as a coronary disease risk factor is the assumption that fat stored around the waist poses a greater risk to health than fat stored elsewhere in the body. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a healthy WHR is: 0.9 or less in men 0.85 or less for women giving from Tableno-1 e.g., A man who is183 cm tall, and weighs 95 kgs. Assessment: As per Table No 1, ideal weight should be in between 72.6 - 88.9 kg, hence he is overweight. 7.3.2 WAIST TO HIP RATIO (WHR) 209Table No. 1: Height and Weight Table In both men and women, a WHR of 1.0 or higher increases the risk for heart disease and other conditions that are linked to being overweight. I. Tick the correctoptions. 1. Skinfold technique is used tomeasure i. weight ii. fat percentage iii. girth measurement iv. over fatness 2. WHR is calculate by i. multiplying waist by hip measurement ii. adding hip by waist measurement 210iii. dividing hip by waist measurement iv. subtracting waist from hip measurement II. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. What is BMI? 2. What is WHR? 3. What is Overweight and obesity? III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. Vilas, a male person whose weighs is 90 kg and his height is 1.7 m. Calculate his BMI. Also state the category in which he falls. Why should you use somatotyping? Of what value is it in exercise and sports science? These are important questions that are often asked. The somatotype gives an overall summary of the physique as a unified whole. Its utility is in the combination of three aspects of physique into a somato type rating. It combines the appraisal of adiposity, musculo-skeletal robustness and linearity into the three-numbered rating and conjures up a visual image of the three aspects of thephysique. A diposity is related to the relative fatness or endomorphy; the relative muscle and bony robustness is related to the fat-free body or mesomorphy; and the linearity or ectomorphy gives an indication of the bulkiness or mass relative to stature in the physique. From a few simple measurements, the somato type gives a useful summary of a variety of possible measures or observations that can be made on the body. The somato type tells you what kind of physique you have and how it looks. It has been used to describe and compare the physiques of athletes at all levels of competition and in a variety of sports. Somato types of athletes in selected sports are quite different from each other, whereas somato types are similar in other sports. Somato typing has also been used to describe changes in physique during growth, ageing and training, as well as in relation to physical performance. Somatotype is a method for describing the human physique in terms of a number of traits that relate to body shape and composition. The definition of the traits, and the form of the scales that are used to describe the relative importance of the traits, vary from one body-type method to the other. Attempts to establish such methods date from Hippocrates, and continue to the present time. A classic approach that led to today's commonly used method, was introduced by Sheldon. The somatotype system presented by Sheldon was based on subjective method based on photography of the participants. The Sheldon somatotype was further modified by H.Carter in 1967 for developing an objective method of classifying body type based on anthropometric methods. The present chapter delimits itself to the basic understanding of the characteristics associated with the three different body types known as Endomorph, Mesomorph, Ectomorph. 7.4 Endomorph , describes the relative degree of adiposity of the body, regardless of where or how it is distributed. It also describes corresponding physical aspects, such as roundness of the body, softness of the contours, relative volume of the abdominal trunk, and distal tapering of the limbs. Endomorph are rounded shaped or pear shaped body with high percentage of body fat. They reflect wide hip and narrow shoulders along with under developed muscles. Due to this, they may not be found to be athletic or highly active in sports and less active toward exercise. The second component, called Mesomorph , describes the relative musculo-skeletal development of the body. It also describes corresponding physical aspects, such as the apparent robustness of the body interms of muscle or bone, the relative volume of the thoracic trunk and the possibly hidden muscle bulk. The definitions of endomorphy and mesomorphy reflect the anatomical model of body composition. Mesomorph are square shaped and muscular in structure. They have well developed muscles, wedge- shaped body, narrow hips and broad shoulders. Mesomorphs are also found have less fat percentage, therefore found to be more physically active in sports, fitness and high intensity activities. The third component, called Ectomorph , describes the relative slenderness of the body. It also describes corresponding physical aspects, such as the relative 'stretched- outness, 'the apparent line a rity of the body or fragility of the limbs, in absence of any bulk, be it muscle, fat or other tissues. Ectomorph are thin and fine-boned in shape and mostly have narrow chest and abdomen. Being underweight is a common reflection of ectomorphs. They also demonstrate narrow shoulders and hips with less percentage of fat. They may not be found to be athletic in characteristics, especially due to being more prone to injuries and lack of muscularity required for competitive sports. Som atotype modified by H. Carter is a quantified expression or description of the present morphological conformation of a person. It consists of a three-numeral rating, for example, 3.5-5-1. The three numerals are always recorded in the same order, each describing the value of a particular component of physique. Category is the qualitative description of the individual somatotype, in terms of the dominant component or components. For example, a subject with a high rating on mesomorphy and an equally low rating on endomorphy and ectomorphy, will be called a mesomorph or a balanced mesomorph. 212The principal rating of the component values is based on a visual inspection of the subject, or his or her photograph - preferably a front, a side and a back view - taken in minimal clothing. This rating is called the photoscopic (oranthroposcopic) somato type rating. If the investigator cannot performa photoscopicrating, the component values can be estimated from a combination of anthropometric measurements. The calculated three-numeral rating is then called the anthropometric somatotype. The recommended somato typing procedure is a combination of an anthropometric followed by a photoscopic evaluation. I. Tick the correct option. 1. Somatotype is a method for describing i. human body length ii. human physique iii. human skull iv. human behaviour 2. The term ectomorphy describes i. the relative volume of the abdominal trunk ii. the relative slenderness of the body ageing iii. the roundness of the body iv. the musculo-skeletal development of the body II. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. What is somatotype? 2. What is endomorph? 3. What is ectomorph? III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. Explain the procedure of measuring somatotypes. Components of health related physical fitness has already been defined and discussed in unit-iii and the present unit will discuss about the test battery items, test protocols and evaluation norms for assessment of physical fitness. Health related physical fitness as defined in earlier chapters, need to have multiple test items which are combined together to form a battery or group of tests. There are many health related physical fitness test batteries used across the world for different age groups and demographics. One of the prominent health related fitness test is 'AAHPERD Health related test' developed for college students in 1980 at USA. The test item of AAHPER health related physical fitness test are: FITNESS COMPONENTS TEST ITEMS 7.5. Measurement of health related physical fitness 213Body Composition Triceps and subscapular skinfolds Low Back Hamstring Flexibility Sit and Reach Abdominal Muscle Strength/Endurance Bent knee sit-ups in one minute Cardiorespiratory Endurance Mile run or Nine-minute run In this chapter, we will discuss about a health related physical fitness test battery for Indian school children between the age group of 9-18 years, developed by Fit India Mission in 2019. HEALTH REALTED FITNESS COMPONENTS TEST ITEMS a. Body composition BMI b. Cardiorespiratory endurance 600 mt Run/Walk c. Muscular strength and Muscular endurancePartial Curl-up and Push-Up d. Flexibility. Sit and Reach Le t's discuss briefly discuss about the test procedures for the test items: 7.5.1 BMI (Body Composition): Body Composition refers primarily to the distribution of muscle and fat in the body. Body mass index is calculated from the measures of body Weight (W) and height(H). It is also referred as BMI, for which the formula is Weight (w) divided by Height (h) in squares ( BMI = W/ (H x H), where weight (W) is in kilograms and height (H) is in meters. The higher the score usually indicates higher levels of body fat. Procedure i.) Height measuring procedure (protocol): a. Barefoot, stand erect with heels together b. Both heels touching the base of the stadiometer, c. Arms hanging naturally by the sides. d. The heels, buttocks, upper part of the back and usually, but not necessarily, the back of the head are in contact with the vertical wall. e. The subject is instructed to \"look straight ahead\" and \"take a deep breath\". f. Mark the highest point on skull (Vertex). g. Measure before exhalation h. Measurement is read to the nearest 0.1 cm. 214ii.) Weight measuring procedure: a. Place the scale on firm flooring (such as tile or wood) rather than carpet. b. Have the participant remove shoes and heavy clothing, such as sweaters. c. Have the participant stand with both feet in the center of the scale. e. Record the weight to the nearest decimal fraction (for example, 25.1 kilograms). 7.5.2 Partial Curl Up -30sec (Abdominal/ Core Strength): The curl up test measures abdominal muscular strength and endurance of the abdominals and hip-Flexors, important in back support and core stability. Procedure: a) Lie down on flat surface with knees flexed, usually at 90 degrees, with hands straight on the sides (palms facing downwards) closer to the ground, body and near to the first parallel strip on the floor. b) Curl the trunk up and raise it towards the knees in a smooth motion by keeping the arms stretching above/along the ground towards the six inch apart parallel strip). c) Return to the earlier position to complete one set of curl by lowering the trunk back to the floor so that the shoulder blades or upper back touch the floor. d) Complete maximum sets possible in 30 seconds and stop after the time finish signal is received. Equipment: A comfortable mat with a marking of two parallel strips (6 inch apart). Stopwatch. Scoring: Record the maximum number of Curl ups in a certain time period 30 seconds. 7.5.3 P ush Up for Boys/Modified Push Up for Girls (Muscular Endurance): Upper body strength and endurance is tested through the Push-Up test for boys and modified Push-Up for girls. 215 Procedure: Standard push-up for Boys - a) Initial position for push up begins with the hands and toes touching the floor, the body and legs in a straight line, feet slightly apart, the arms at shoulder width apart, extended and at a right angle to the body. b) Push-up is executed by keeping the back and knees straight, the participant lowers the body to a predetermined point or until there is a 90-degree angle at the elbows, then returns back to the starting position with the arms extended. c) Repeat the sets to the maximal numbers till exhausted, as there is not time limit. Modified Push-up for Girls: Position will be with knees bent, ankles crossed and resting on the floor. Scoring: Total number of correct push-up will be recorded as scores. 7.5.4 Sit and Reach Test (Flexibility): is the test for assessment of flexibility of the lower back and hamstring muscles. It is a simple test of stretching the trunk forward by placing the hand on a measuring scale fixed to the flexometer (sit and reach box) and positioning the feet on to the sit & reach box without bending knees. Procedure: a) Sit bare foot on the floor with soles of the feet placed flat against the Sit and Reach box. Both knees should be locked and pressed flat to the floor. b) Measure the initial positing score by placing the hands on to the measuring scale. 216c) For final position, reach forward along the measuring scale with the palms facing downwards, and the hands on top of each other. d) Hold the final position for one-two seconds while the distance is recorded, avoid jerky movements. Equipment : Sit and Reach box (Flexometer) - Sit and Reach box with 12\" x 12\" (sides); 12\" x 10\" (front and back) ; 12\" x 21\" (top), fixed with a measuring scale on the top panel. Scoring: Difference between initial position and final position is recorded in cm and mm as the final score. 7.5.5 600mt Run/ Walk (Cardiovascular endurance): the test is recommended to assess cardiovascular endurance for school children by asking them to run or walk for 600mt and record the time for coving the distance. Procedure: a) The track can be a standard track or a modified arena of 600mt distance. b) The participant can run or walk for the given distance. c) Participant should be motivated to cove the distance in shortest possible time. Score: Time taken for completion (Run or Walk) in min, sec, mm Discussion SLAUGHTER-LOHMAN FORMULA TO CALCULATE BODY FAT FOR CHILDREN Body composition assessment for school children can also be effectively done with various other ways including using of skinfold measurements. Lets read a procedure for skinfold test using two sites for body fat measurement with the help of skinfold calliper as explained by M.H.Slaughter and T.G.Lohman in 1988. Objective : The Slaughter-Lohman formula calculates the percentage of body fat from the taking of two skinfolds. This is based on an age range from 8 to 18 years old. Slaughter-Lohman Equation Skinfold Sites Triceps Calf Equipment: Skinfold calliper Procedure: To calculate the percentage of body fat, measure take the skinfolds (in mm) with a skinfold calliper and perform the followings equations: Formula: Boys : Body Fat = 0.735 (Triceps skinfold + Calf skinfold) + 1.0 Girls Body Fat= 0.610 (Triceps skinfold + Calf skinfold) + 5.1 217Test Battery Norms for Evaluation Norms for the Health related Fitness Indicators as per Khelo India battery of fitness assessment test can be referred by scanning this code I.

Histology refers to the study of the 219 a. cells of the body b. history of anatomy c. tissues of the body 5. The membrane on the surface of a lung is called the a. pleura b. pericardium c. mucosa Anatomy is a science that deals with the structure of the body and the relationship between the body parts. The word anatomy is derived from the Greek words Ana which means apart and tomy meaning to cut. Hence, the word anatomy refers to dissection and it can be defined as the science of the structure of a body learned by dissection. In other words, anatomy is the study of the shape and structure of human body and body parts along with their relationship to one another. Anatomy is divided into the following categories: Gross/Macro anatomy is the study of the larger structures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification. It deals with the large body structures such as heart, lungs and bones. Microscopic anatomy is the study of those structures of body which can't be seen with the naked eye. Gross anatomy may further be subdivided into the following categories: 1. Systemic anatomy: Systemic anatomy is the study of the working and structures of a discrete body system. It is the study of a group of structures that work together to perform a unique body function. e.g., a systemic study of the muscular system would include all of the skeletal muscles of thebody. 2. Regional anatomy: is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region. Regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and other structures work together to serve a particular body region. e.g., the study of an area of the body such as the abdomen would include a study of all organs, blood vessels etc in that part of the body. 3. Surface anatomy: this is a study of external features of the body like the bony projections of the body which act as a landmark and help us to locate the other deeper structures. e.g.,skin, nails, hairetc. Microscopic anatomy includes 1. Cytology or the study of the internal structure of cells 2. Histology or the study of tissues (groups of cells) 8.1.1 DEFINITION OF ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND KINESIOLOGY 220 Physiology is the science of the functions of living organisms and their parts. The word physiology is derived from the Greek words phys or nature and logio which means the study of . Hence, the word physiology refers to the study of the human body and its functions and of the different parts and organs of the body .e.g., the detailed working and function of the skeletal system, respiratory system and the circulatory. Here we understand and study how human body responds to a givens timulus. We can also say physiology is the detailed study of life, including the functioning of the smallest of cells, tissues and other organisms. Physiology is further divided into sub parts which are as follows: Human physiology : This branch of physiology refers to the study of a specific organism, i.e. the human being. Cellular and systemic physiology : Cellular physiology is the study of the function of ce lls while systemic physiology is the study of the function of the body's systems. 1. Helps in physical fitness: Study of anatomy and physiology helps a sports person to understand the structure and functioning of different parts of the human body and to acquire a fit and healthy body. e.g., building muscle strength, muscle endurance through appropriate exercises. 2. Provides knowledge about body structure: Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of one's body can help the sports person develop her/his strength in the field of games or sports which are suitable for as per her/his body structure. e.g., designing exercises based on movement of joints like shoulder rotation, due Helps to know about individual differences Helps in selection of games Helps in maintaining healthy body Enhances the process of rehabilitation IMPORTANCE Provides knowledge about body structure Helps in physical fitness Protects from sports injuries 8.1.3 IMPORTANCE OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY 8.1.2 PHYSIOLOGY 221 t o presence of ball and socket joint in the shoulder, and extension and flexion of elbow due to hinge joint in theelbow. 3. Provides knowledge about the functions of various organs of body: Knowledge of the capacity or functions of the various body systems like the cardiovascular system or the nervous system, muscular system, excretory system is essential for imparting proper and beneficial training to the athletes by the physical education tea cherora coach. e. g., as printer usually has fast twitch muscle fibres whereas long distance runners have slow twitch muscle fibres. 4. Helps in selection of games: On the basis of the knowledge of body structure, a coach or player can choose an appropriate sport for the student. e.g., weight lifting is more appropriate for short statured students in comparison to volley ball and basket ball which are better suited for students who are tall. 5. Protects from sports injuries: Injuries related to sports such as sprain, contusion, fracture, dislocation of joints, etc., are fairly common on the sports field. Sports equipment is designed to ensure safety on the basis of knowledge of anatomy. Designing protective equipment in games and sports to provide protection to the soft and delicate organs requires appropriate knowledge about the functions of bones, muscles, tendons and ligaments. 6. Helps in the process of rehabilitation: Injuries are common and natural on thes ports field. Knowledge of ligaments, tendons and muscles helps in rehabilitation from the injuries sustained during the game or sport and the injured player can recuperate enough to give a good performance again. e.g., a physiotherapist who helps an injured sportsperson in recuperation and rehabilitation so that she/he can get back to the game. 7. Helps in maintaining healthy body: Study of anatomy and physiology provides detailed knowledge about all body parts, their nature and function, adopt good, safe and healthyuse of body. e. g., knowledge of anatomy provides information a bout good and bad posture while sitting, standing, lying down, running. 8. Helps to learn about individual differences between male and female athletes: Understanding the basic physiological differences between the body of male and female sports persons is essential because games and sports equipmentis designed differently on the basis of these differences. e.g., the difference in the structure of shoulder among males and females is the reason for difference in the weights of sports equipment such as shotput, discus, hammer and javelin for males and females. Have you ever wondered what makes a physical activity as simple and routine as walking possible? The fact is, even such simple movements require an in tricate coordination of muscles, ligaments, and joints. The study of these bodily movements is called Kinesiology. The term Kinesiology is derived from the Greek word kinesis which means movement or motion and logio , or the study of . Thus, Kinesiology is the scientific study of human or non-human body movement. The dictionary defines Kinesiology as \"the science dealing with the interrelationship of the physiological 8.1.4 KINESIOLOGY 222 processes and anatomy of the human body with respect to movement.\" It is an analysis of human motion based upon scientific principles, bio- mechanics, muscular system an atomy and neuro muscular physiology. Therefore, to understand kinesiology, it is imperative we have an adequate knowledge of anatomy and physiology. Importance of Kinesiology 1. The main focus of Kinesiology is the study of the mechanical concepts related to human movement which is beneficial for every individual even in their daily activities. 2. Kinesiology applies sciences like biomechanics, anatomy, physiology and psychology to better understand how the human body responds to physical activity and various stimuli. 3. Kinesiology and physical education study the role of exercise, physical movement and sports in the development of human health and happiness. 4. It helps to understand the interconnection between human structure and functions. 5. It provides adequate knowledge of movement to athletic trainers who can, then, try to prevent athletes from suffering injuries. 6. It provides knowledge regarding efficient movements as a part of daily living in order to achieve optimum quality of body efficiency. 7.

The human skeleton is composed of cartilage and bones. The human skeleton is the internal framework of the body. It is composed of around 270 bones at birth - this total decreases to around 206 bones by adulthood after some bones get fused together. The human skeleton is divided into two functional parts: Axial skeleton - consists of the vertebral column, the rib cage, the skull and other associated bones. Appendicular skeleton - is attached to the axial skeleton. It is formed by the shoulder girdle, the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limbs. Functions of the Skeleton The functions of the skeleton include: 1. This skeletal system provides shape and support to the body. 2. It allows the body to create movement by forming the frame work of the body, to which the muscles are attached. Movement occurs when muscles contract and pull on bones making them create movement in the joint. 3. Internal organs of the body like heart, lungs, liver, brain etc. are soft and delicate. The skeleton protects these organs. 4. The hard substance of the bones also serves as a store house of minerals. 5. Blood cells are also formed within the cavitation of the skeleton which is known as Haematopoiesis. 8.2.1 SKELETAL SYSTEM 224 Do you know? joint : a point where two or more bones are connected in the body in a manner that permits movement. cartilage : a form of connective tissue that is semi-rigid yet flexible. It is found in the joints and other places such as the nose, throat, and ears. tendo n: a strong piece of tissue in the body connecting a muscle to a bone ligament : fibrous cords that bind the bones together at joints What makes up the Skeleton Along with bones, joints and cartilage, the skeleton also includes tendons and ligaments. 1. Bone is a rigid part of the skeleton. In the body, bones have a variety of shapes and sizes and serve multiple functions. 2. Cartilage is more flexible than the bones. It is found in plenty in the embryo and the foetus. In adults, the surfaces of bones within the movable joints are covered with cartilage. It provides both a firm and a flexible support inside certain structures of the nose, external ears, ribs and trachea. 3. Tendons and Ligaments are strong bands of fibrous connective tissues. Tendons connect muscles to bone, whereas ligaments connect one bone to another bone. 8.2.2 SKELETAL SYSTEM 225 Extension Activity Working in groups of five draw and label the bones of the following parts: 1. Skull 2. Clavicle 3. The kneecap 4. Bones of the fingers of the palm 5. Bones of the fingers of the feet. Bon es can be classified on the basis of different categories: Classification is on the basis of bone tissue. Classification is on the basis of shape and size. Classification on the basis of bone tissue. There are 2 Basic types of bone tissue Compact Bone Spongy Bone It is dense, smooth Compound of small and homogenous needle like pieces of bone Classification of bones on the basis of shape and size. 1. Long Bones Long bones are hard, dense bones that provide strength, structure, and mobility to the body. BONES LONG BONES SHORT BONES FLAT BONES IRREGULAR BONES 8.2.3 CLASSIFICATION OF BONES 226 Each long bone is composed of a central shaft and two knobends. The long bone is covered with a fibre sheet except where it joins with other bone. Where the long bone joins with other bone it is covered with a thin sheet ofcartilage. Long bones are found in upper and lower arm (Humerus, Radius and Ulna) and thigh and leg (Femur, Tibia and Fibula). Some bones in the fingers and toes are also classified as long bones, even though they are short in length. This is due to the shape of the bones, not their size Long bones contain both yellow bone marrow and red bone marrow, which produce blood cells. Ulna Radius Femur 2. Short Bones Short bones are about as long as they are wide. In fact, they are in cube shape. A short bone is composed of central spongy bone and covered with a thin layer of compactbone. The motion of short bones is limited, and they glide on one another. The carpals in the wrist and the tarsals in the ankles are examples of short bones.. Capital (carpal) Bone Talus 3. Flat Bones Flat bones are thin and flat. They are composed of a central layer of spongy bone between two outer layers of compact bone. 227 They form a bony cage and help in the protection of soft internal organs. Flat bones are found in cranial bones, ribs, sternum, scapula and hipbone. Scapula Sternum 4. Irregular Bones Irregular bones vary in shape and structure and therefore do not fit into any other category (flat, short or long). They often have a fairly complex shape, which helps protect internal organs. e.g., the vertebrae.Irregular bones of the vertebral column, protect the spinal cord. Some bones of the skull are also irregular bones. Vertebra Extension Activity Working in groups of five draw and complete the following table: Bone Type Where it is found in the body Radius Patella Metatarsal Femur Do You Know? The shortest Bone in the human body is the STAPES found in the middle ear. 228 A joint or articulation (articular surface) is the point where the two or more bones meet and muscles act on them to cause movement. A joint is usually considered movable, but it's not necessary in all the cases. There are many joints which show limited movement and some that are completely immovable. Joints are further classified on the basis of their functions and structure. Extension Activity Working in pairs, locate the joints in your Shoulder Arms Wrist Fingers Hip Legs Toes Can you identify the movement in these joints? The functional classification of joints focuses on the amount of movement permitted by the joint. On the basis of this: Synarthroses or they may be called immovable joints Amphiarthroses which are also known as slightly movable joints Diarthroses or the freely movable joints. The freely movable joints are majorly found in the limbs, where movement and mobility is of utmost importance. The immovable or slightly movable joints are mostly 8.2.4 JOINTS 229 to be found in axial skeleton where the priority is protection of internal organs and firm attachments. In the structural classification mainly there are fibrous, cartilaginous and synovial joints. This type of classification is based on whether fibrous tissue, cartilage, or a joint cavity separates the bony regions at the joint. Fibrous joints are generally immovable and, synovial joints are freely movable joints. Cartilaginous joints have a combination of both immovable and slightly movable joints. 1. Fibrous Joints - In this type of joint, the bones are united together by fibrous tissue and show little or no movement. They are again further classified on the basis of structure of the sutures , syndesmoses or gomphoses . i. Sutures - A suture is a type of fibrous joint forming a tight union between the bones that prevents any movement between them. Sutures are only found between the bones of the skull or the cranium. The skull bones of a foetus are unfused but after birth, the bones slowly begin to fuse to become fixed, making the skull bones immovable in order to protect the brain from impact. 230 ii. Syndesmoses - Syndesmosis is a fibrous joint in which the bones are separated by some distance and united together with the help of ligaments. e.g., fibrous membrane connecting maximum distal parts of the radius and ulna. Due to the lack of flexibility in these joint structures, ligament injuries in syndesmoses joints are common, particularly at the wrist and ankle. iii. Gomphoses -Agomphosis mostly consists of a pegattached into a socket and held by ligaments. The best example of this is the joint between a tooth and its socket. 2. Cartilaginous Joints - This type of joint unites two bones by the help of a cartilage.Very slight movement can occur at these joints. Another characteristics of this type of joint is that the articulating bone surfaces are connected by pads (discs) of fibrocartilage. e.g., cartilage of the growing long bones and the cartilages between the ribs and the sternum. 3. Synovial Joints - These are freely movable joints. These joints contain synovial fluid. They are mostly found in the limbs. All synovial joints consist of four distinguishing features. Articular cartilage Articular capsule Joint cavity Reinforcing ligament 231 S ynovial Joints Ball and socket Hinge joint Pivot joint Gliding joint Saddle joint Condyloid joint Types of synovial joints: Synovial joints are classified according to the shape of the articulating surface. As you know, they can further be subdivided into the following categories. i. Ball and socket joint: The ball and socket joint is a type of synovial joint. It is formed when the ball-shaped head of one bone fits into the cup-like socket or depression of another bone. The ball and socket joint allows the greatest range of movement. These multiaxial joints permit movement in all axes including rotation. e.g.,hipjoint and shoulder joint. This joint allows movement like an overhead clear in badminton or bowling in cricket. ii. Hinge joint: The cylindrical end of one bone fits into at rough shaped surface of another bone. Angular movement is possible in just one plane there by restricting the movement of the bone to only bending and straightening. e.g. elbow, knee. The extension and flexion movement is essential for building biceps, triceps and quadricep smuscles. 232 iii. Pivot joint:- Pivot jointalso called rotary joint, is a freely moveable joint that allows only rotary movement around a single axis. The moving bone rotates within a ring that is formed from a second bone and adjoining ligament. e.g., the joint between the first and the second cervical vertebrae which allows the turning of the head from side toside. iv. Plane or Gliding joint: A gliding joint, also known as a plane joint, is a type of synovial joint that is formed between bones that meet at flat or nearly flat articular surfaces. Gliding joints allow the bones to glide past on another in any direction along the plane of the joint \u2014 up and down, left and right, and diagonally. The movement in this joint is nonaxial which indicates that gliding does not allow rotation around any axis. e.g., inter carpals or joints of the wrist. v. Saddle joint: In the saddle joint, the articulatings urface is shaped like a saddle, having both convex and concave areas. The bones in a saddle joint can rock back and forth and from side to side, but they have limite drotation.These biaxial joint sallow very limited movement like the condyloid joints. e. g., thumb joint. Example of as addle joint used in sport is in a thumb war. The thumb moves side to side and back and for thin a thumb war. 233 vi. Condyloid joint: Condyloid joints are a type of synovial joint where the egg- shaped articular surface of one bone fits into an oval cavity in another. This joint allows the moving bone to travel from side to side, back and forth butit does not allow it to rotate. Movement occurs only around two axes so they may be also called biaxial. e.g.,wrist joint, meta carpal, phalangeal joint. This joint is useful the players use their wrist when dribbling with the ball in basketball. Extension Activity Practise the following movements. Can you identify the joint used? I.

Write about the types of synovial joints in details with suitable examples Every movement from heartbeat to completing a marathon takes place due to contraction of the muscles. There are basically three types of muscle tissue. 8.3.1 PROPERTIES AND FUNCTIONS OF MUSCLES 236 1. Skeletal Muscles-Skeletal muscles comprise 40% of the body weight. They are named so because they are attached to the skeletal system. They are also called striated muscles as their striations can be seen when observed under the microscope. These muscles are responsible for locomotion, facial expressions, posture, and other body movements. They are also known as voluntary muscles as they are under conscious control of the brain. They can contract very rapidly and forcefully but they also tire very easily and require rest after short periods of activity. 2. Smooth Muscles - Smooth muscles are small and spindle shape. They are called smooth muscles as their cells are not striated. They are also called involuntary muscles as their expansion or contraction is not under our control. These muscles contract much more slowly as compared to skeletal muscles. They are found mostly in hollow organs such as stomach, urinary bladder and respiratory passages.Smooth muscles are also present in the eyes, where their function is to change the size of the iris and alter the shape of the lens; and in the skin where they cause hair to stand erect in response to cold temperature or fear. 3. Cardiac Muscles-Cardiac muscles are found in the heart where they form the walls of the heart. They are long and striated but not as clearly striated as skeletal muscles. The rate of contraction of cardiac muscles is intermediated between smooth and skeletal muscles. Cardiac muscles are in voluntary as their expansion and contraction is not underour control. Skeletal muscles have four major functional properties: Properties of Skeletal Muscle Tissue Excitability Contractility Extensibility Elasticity 8.3.2 PROPERTIES OF SKELETAL MUSCLES Types of Muscle Tissue Skeletal Muscle Smo oth Muscle Cardiac Muscle 237 Excitability is the ability to respond to as timulus, which may be delivered from a motorneuron or ahormone. Contractility is the ability of muscle cells to forcefully shorten or the ability for self- contraction. Extensibility is the ability of a muscle to stretch or the capacity to lengthen. Elasticity is the ability to recoil or bounce back to the muscle's original length after being stretched. 1. Movement : Muscles give rigidity to our body. Skeletal muscles can yank and pull on the bones in the skeleton, resulting in body movements such as walking, chewing, running, lifting and manipulating objects with ourhands. 2. Maintenance of posture: Muscles generate a constant contractile force that allows us to maintain an erect position or posture, without much consciouscontrol. 3. Heat generation : Contraction of muscle tissue generates heat, which is essential for maintenance of temperatureor homeostasis. 4. Respiration : Ourmuscular system automatically drives movement of air into and out of our body. 5. Constriction of organs and blood vessels : Nutrients move through our digestive tract, urine is passed out of the body, and secretions are propelled out of glands by contraction of smoothmuscles. 6. Pumping blood : Blood moves through the blood vessels because our heart tirelessly receives blood and delivers it to all body tissue and organs. Do You Know?

Respiration is made up of two phases called inspiration and expiration: You inhale (breathe in) oxygen during inspiration. You exhale (breathe out) carbon dioxide during expiration. Respiration includes the following processes Ventilation, the movement of air into and out of the lungs Gas exchange between the air in the lungs and blood, sometimes called external respiration Transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. Gas exchange between the blood and the tissues, sometimes called internal inspiration. Structure of Respiratory System: The respiratory system consists of The nose The nasal cavity The pharynx Thelarynx The trachea Bronchi8.4.1 STRUCTURE AND OF SYSTEM 239 Thelungs Bronchioles Alveoli Diaphragm The Nose: The term nose usually refers to the visible structure that forms a prominent feature of the face and also refers to the internal nasal cavity. The Nasal Cavity: It extends from the external opening in the nose to the pharynx, and it is divided by the nasal septum into right and left side. Pharynx: The pharynx is the common passageway of both the digestive and respiratory systems. The pharynx can be divided into three regions The nasopharynx: It is the superior part of pharynx and extends from the internal nares of nasal cavity to the level of uvula. The oropharynx: The oropharynx is a passage way for both air and food. It extends from the uvulato the epiglott is. Theoropharynx is bordered superiorly by the nasopharynx and anteriorly by the oral cavity. The laryngopharynx: The laryngopharynx extends from the epiglottis to the lower margin of the larynx. It continues the route for ingested material and air until its inferior end, where the digestive and respiratory systems diverge. Larynx: The larynx consists of an outer casting of nine cartilages that are connected to each other by muscles and ligaments. It is also known as Voice box. Trachea: The trachea, also known as the windpipe, is a membranous tube that consists of connective tissues and smooth muscles. Bronchi: The trachea divides into the left and right primary bronchi. The main function of the bronchi, like other conducting zone structures, is to provide a passageway for air to move into and out of each lung. In addition, the mucous membrane traps debris and pathogens. Bronchioles: Bronchioles, which are about 1mmindia meter, further branch until they become the tiny terminal bronchioles, which lead to the structures of gasex change. There are more than 1000 terminal bronchioles in each lung. The muscular walls of the bronchiolesdo not contain cartilage like those of the bronchi. This muscular wall can change the size of the tubing to increase or decrease airflow through thetube. Alveoli: An alveolar duct is a tube composed of smooth muscle and connective tissue, which opens into a cluster of alveoli. An alveolus is one of the 240 many small, grape-like sacs that are attached to the alveolar ducts. Lungs: The lungs are the principal organs of respiration. These spongy, pinkish organs look like two upside-down cones in your chest. Lungs are divided into two parts 1. Right lung: The right lung is made up of three lobes 2. Left lung: The left lung has only two lobes to make room for your heart. Diaphragm: The diaphragm is a thin skeletal muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest. It contracts and flattens when you inhale. This creates a vacuum effect that pulls air into the lungs. When you exhale, the diaphragm relaxes and the air is pushed out of lungs. The circulatory system is a network consisting of blood, blood vessels, and the heart. This network supplies the tissues in the body with oxygen and other nutrients, transports hormones, and removes unnecessary waste products. Do you know? Arteries - blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood from the hear Arterioles - a small branch of an artery leading into capillaries. Capillaries - any of the fine branching blood vessels that form a network between the arterioles and venules. Venules - a very small vein, especially one collecting blood from the capillaries. Veins - blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart The Heart The heart is made of specialized cardiac muscle tissue that allows it to act as a pump within the circulatory system. 8.4.2 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 241 - The human heart is divided into four chambers. The two sides of the heart are separated by a thick muscular wall called the septum. There are two chambers - one atrium and one ventricle - on each side of the heart. The atria receive blood and the ventricles pump blood. The human circulatory system consists of several circuits: The pulmonary circuit pumps blood to the lungs and back to the heart. The systemic circuit pumps blood to the body and back to the heart. The coronary circuit pumps blood to the heart. Blood and Blood Vessels Blood from the heart is pumped throughout the body using blood vessels. Arteries carry blood away from the heart to the body using smaller arterioles and capillaries. They provide oxygen (and other nutrients) to tissue and cells. Once blood is de-oxygenated, it travels back to the right chambers of the heart through a network of veins. From the heart, blood is pumped into the lungs where it is re-oxygenatedand returned to the heart. 242 I. Tick the correct answer. 1. Trachea is also knownas a. Windpipe b. Voicebox c. Pharynx d.

In other words, when the sum of all forces is zero, the object is in a state ofequilibrium. In all activities whether stationary or moving, balance is an important factor. All activities demand stability and sometimes, instability depends on its purpose. 8.5.1 EQUILIBRIUM 244 Static Equilibrium Dynamic Equilibrium 1. When the sum of forces acting upon the object and sum of the movement acting upon the body is both equal to zero, then the body is said to be in static equilibrium. 1.When all the forces acting on an object are balanced, and the body is in motion, then the body is said to be in dynamic equilibrium. 2. In other words, Static balance is maintaining equilibrium when stationary. e.g., Yoga 2. In other words, dynamic balance is maintaining equilibrium when moving. eg. jump shot in basketball. 3. e.g., A gymnast performing 'T' position on the balancing beam, because the gymnast is not making any movement. 3 e.g., A cycle is moving with uniform velocity. 1. Two people balancing on a see-saw. 8.5.2 APPLICATION OF EQUILIBRIUM IN SPORT Equilibrium Static Dynamic forces are balanced and body is at rest forces are balanced but body is moving e.g., - a book lying still on a table e.g., - a fan rotating with uniform speed has a net force as zero. 245 2. In every sport, the athletes maintain stability by lowering the centre of gravity by bending their knees. 3. Boxers can lose balance if they shift their weight on heels because the centre of gravity must fall within the line of base of support for greater stability. 4. Dynamic equilibrium is required by a tennis player to change her/his position after hitting a shot. 1. Centre of gravity is a point at which a body balances or the point at which the weight of body is equally distributed. 2. It is a point in the body or system around which its weight is evenly distributed or balanced and through which the force of gravity acts. 3. Centre of gravity is the intersection point of all the three planes and axis. 4. The centre of gravity is the average location of the weight of anobject. 5. The position of centre of gravity changes depending up on the position of the body or object. Application in Sports 1. An athlete who bends legs will lower his/her centre of gravity which will result in greater stability for the athlete. 2. Centre of gravity needs to be lowered for greater stability in sports like wrestling. 3. A jumper's centre of gravity must lie on the base of support for greater stability while take-off. I.

Define & Differentiate between Growth & De velopment Developmental charact eristics at Different Stage of Growth and Development Adolescent Problems & their Man agement Learning Outcomes At the end of the unit, students will be able to: 1. identify the role of Psychology in Physical Education andsports 2. correlate the psychological concepts with the sports and athlete specific situations 3. differentiate characteristics of growth and development at different stages. 4. determine the issues related to adolescent behaviour 5. recognise different management strategies for adolescent relate dissues Discussion Read the newspaper clipping given below regarding the role of Sports Psychology in an athlete's performance. Discuss in your group Think of a sports team from your school/ state/country. Are they confident of winning, and often win, over teams said to be stronger than them? Is the team repeatedly making the same mistakes/ losing cons tantly? Are athletes more at risk of mental health issues than the generalpublic? Why/why not? Do all athletes have similar problems, or do the y differ according to their age or gender? Based on the news clipping and your discussion above, can you think how a sports psychologist can help improve the performance of athletes? Present your ideas to the class. 248 Sportspersons often display different behaviour on the field. Let us consider the following cases. Case 1: Luis Suarez, an International soccer player, began his career in Europe with Groningen in Holland. In the career of this Barcelona striker there have been three biting incidents on the sports field. The first occurred while he played for Ajax Amsterdam in a game against PSV Eindhoven. Suarez bit midfielder Otman Bakkal. The second incident was when Suarez bit Branislav Ivanovic while playing for Liverpool against Chelsea in 2013. The third incident was when Suarez bit Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup in Brazil in 2014 while Uruguay played Italy. In his book, Crossing the Line , Suarez attempted to justify the action by saying, \"The adrenaline levels in a game can be so high; the pulse is racing and sometimes the brain doesn't keep up. The pressure mounts and there is no release valve................ I was frustrated because we were drawing what was a very important game, and we were on a bad run. I wanted to do everything right that day, and it felt as though I was doing everything wrong. The pent-up frustration and feeling that it was my fault reached a point where I couldn't contain it anymore.\" Case 2: MS Dhoni, popularly known as Captain Cool, has always remained composed under pressure and carried India out of delicate situations single-handedly. Whether he was chasing or defending a total in a cricket match, Dhoni, unlike others, was usually seen to be cool and unflappable, concentrating on guiding his teammates to deal with pressure. Unlike the brash aggression of some of the other players, Dhoni did not lose his cool on the field. In an interview Dhoni revealed that he, too, experienced the same emotions as the other players -- frustration, anger, disappointment -but he rather focussed his energy into thinking what should be done. \"Whatever the format may be, I get into the process of what can be done now, depending on the situation. In Test cricket, you get a slightly longer duration to chalk out your plan. In one-day cricket, you do have some time constraints and in T20s, everything happens very quickly. So the demands are very different,\" Dhoni explained. \"I would say I feel equally frustrated, angry and times, disappointed as well. But for me, none of these are very constructive and what is more important for me is that what needs to be done right now, that mostly matters. And once I get into that process of thinking I manage to handle my emotions in a much better way. I am like everyone else, but I tend to control my emotions better than others,\" Dhoni added. Sports are played by athletes, and athletes are only human. Like other humans, they are capable of great feats of courage, strength and heroism, just as they are prone to making mistakes. What, then, are the factors that lead to unrestrained aggression amongst some players, and restraint and exemplary behaviour in others? Is aggression caused due to intrinsic physiological factors? Or, is it due to psychological factors like mental stress? Is it the demand of the situation? Do you feel aggression and assertiveness can be gainfully channelised through training? Games and sports have always occupied an important place in human life and have flourished in all cultures since times immemorial. However, evena non-trained 9.1.1 DEFINITION AND CONCEPT OF PSYCHOLOGY IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORTS 249 sportsperson, who is not involved in competitive sports, needs a psychological commitment to participate in regular physical exercise. It is this involvement keeps her/him physically and mentally healthy and helps her/him pursue day-to-day tasks with confidence. This sense of well-being and and enhanced confidence provides the intrinsic motivation the the individual to participate in physical activity. Participation in sports also influences the culture of a society, and its influence can be seen in theindividual'srelation to society or vice versa. In the same way, psychology of a sportsperson can influence the society or social culture can influence the psychology of a sports person. Sports Psychology also attempts to define those factors which motivate not just an individual but also a social group. e.g., success of athletes from a particular area in a particular field of sporteffects the psychology and interest of general masses in particular sports. People relate to the success and this works as motivation for exercise adherence for general masses. Thus, understanding the behaviour and mental process of people who participate in sports and physical exercise can answer questions like: \"Is there any particular kind of sport or exercise which suits certain personality traits?\" or \"Does participation in sports and exercise influence the behaviour of an individual or a group?\" Extension Activity Choose any two sports of your interest and complete the table below Name of the Sports International Competitions/ Medals won Names of Athletes Region they belong to Factors that led to their success Knowledge of psychology helps not just athletes achieve optimal performance but also addresses the needs, objectives and quality of action to achieve excellence and highest performance in any competition. Let us first try and understand the meaning of the terms sport and psychology . The term Sport can be described as physical activity for the purposes of recreation, health, competition and education . The term Psychology , on the other hand, is derived from the Greek word psyche meaning soul and logas meaning study. So, psychology was considered as study of soul . This concept was promoted by Greek philosophers under the branch of Philosophy as they believed that the soul was the essence of a person, and it decided how the individual behaved. It was during the late 19th century, that philosophers shifted their interest towards trying to understand how the body is influenced by what is \"inside the body\" - the mind , and by the events \"outside the body\" - the environment . They started inquiring about the link between 250 the body and the mind. Psychology, then, came to be explained as a study of the mind . Do you know? Goal: a desired aim or outcome, something that you are trying to achieve Motivation: the desire required to be successful; a driving force that makes you do something and decide how much effort to put in. Intrinsic motivation: motivation that comes from simply doing the activity itself, rather than to gain external rewards or praise. Extrinsic motivation: motivating forces that come from outside the person and the activity, such as prizes, trophies, praise from others orfame. Reward: something given to someone to recognise their achievement. Incentive: something that motivates or encourages someone to do something. Psychology as a scientific study of behaviour and mental processes has three important aspects to be discussed. Firstly, it is scientific in nature; this means it has a scientific approach to acquiring knowledge involving certain key values and standards which are universally accepted and reliable. Secondly, it is the study of behaviours which are observable actions and reactions. Thirdly, it also includes study of cognitive processes, which involve different aspects of mental life, like memory, reasoning, intelligence, attention etc. In the modern context, psychology is a science about \" understanding of behaviour \". The European Federation of Sports Psychology defines it as \" the study of the psychological basis, processes and effects of sport. \" Sport psychology, therefore, is an interdisciplinary science that draws on knowledge from the fields of Kinesiology (the scientific study of movement) and Psychology. It includes the study of the manner in which psychological factors affect performance and the way in which participation in sport and exercise affect psychological and physical factors. Sport psychology is used for team sports as well as individual fitness endeavors. It was in 1925 that Coleman Griffith, often called the \"Father of Sport Psychology\", set up the Athletic Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois. The field of Sport Psychology became an area of proficiency that uses psychological knowledge and skills to address performance and well-being of athletes, developmental and social aspects of sports participation, and systemic issues associated with sports settings and organizations. \u0000 Sports Psychology is the study of psychological factors that affect the learning and performance of motor skills. Due to its important role in the enhancement of performance in the sports field, it is necessary for us to understand the broader meaning and scope of Sports Psychology. 251 According to the American Psychology Association (APA, 2009), the field of psychology focusses on two main areas: (a) helping athletes use psychological principles to achieve optimal mental health and to improve performance (performance enhancement) and, (b) understanding how participation in sport, exercise and physical activity affects an individual's psychological development, health and well-being throughout life. Exercise and Sports Psychology is the scientific study of the psychological factors that are associated with participation and performance in sport, exercise, and other types of physical activity. APA (2009) A field of study in which the principles of psychology are applied in a sports setting. R Cox (2007) Sports Psychology is concerned with the psychological foundations, processes and consequences of the psychological regulation of sport related activities of one or several persons acting as the subject(s) of the activity. The European Federation of Sports Psychology (1996) Sports Psychology is a science in which the principles of psychology are applied in a sport or exercise setting. Richard. H. Cox (2012) Sport and exercise psychology is the scientific study of people and their behaviours in sport and exercise activities and the practical application of that knowledge. Weinberg and Gould (2011) The European Federation of Sport Psychology (1996) recognises three interrelated tasks for sport psychologists. Research - investigation into all aspects of the psychology of sport, both theoretical and applied. Education - teaching students, officials and athletes about sport psychology. Application - assessment of and intervention in psychological problems connected to sport. Sport psychology involves consulting to whole teams or counselling ofindividuals. 9.1.3 ROLE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORTS 9.1.2 DEFINITION OF SPORT PSYCHOLOGY 252 Cognitive and behavioural skills training for performance enhancement Many strategies and procedures are used to address problems faced by athletes and other sports participants. Some of the applications of psychological concepts and theories in physical education and sports are: 1. Cognitive and behavioural skills training for performance enhancement include Concentration and attention control strategies Goal setting Imagery Training Cognitive-behavioural self-regulation techniques 2. Counselling and clinical interventions include support for managing: Athletic motivation Over-training and burnout Eating disorders and weight management Substance abuse Grief, depression, loss and suicide Sexual identity issues Aggression and violence Athletic injury and rehabilitation Career transitions and identity crises. 3. Consultation and training include Team building Programmes for sports teams and organisations. Sports organization consultations for behaviour economics Consultation and training Counselling and clinical interventions 9.1.4 APPLICATION OF PSYCHOLOGY IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORTS 253 Systems interventions with parents and families involved in youth sports participation Education of Physical Educators, Coaches and Trainers regarding role of interpersonal and leadership skills for talent development Education of Physical Education and sports professionals towards early identification and prevention of psychological difficulties. A. Benefits of Exercise and Physical Activity: i. Physical Aspect: (a) Exercise leads to improvement in physiological efficiency by conditioning the various systems in the body. It strengthens the cardiovascular and muscular systems and lowers the risk of many diseases. (b) It leads to anatomical growth and development. e.g., strong bones, lean body mass, strong muscular system. (c) Due to physiological and anatomical enhancement, there is improvement in motor performance. e.g., improved strength, speed and endurance. ii. Cognitive Aspect: The benefits of physical activity go beyond health and wellness of the body. Research suggests that physical activity positively impacts the brain and improves cognition, mood, attention, problem-solving abilities, strategic planning and academic achievement in students. iii. Emotional Aspect: Physical Activity provides positive feelings and counters negative moodstate, depression and anxiety because of increased engagement in recreational, health-related and competitive activities. Sports psychology enhances physiological capacities such as strength, speed, flexibility, etc. as motivation plays a major role in the enhancement of the physical capacity of sportspersons. Acute bouts or short duration of exercise are also beneficial, but chronic or regular exercise is required for maintaining long term benefits. Extension Activity 1. Choose a sport or activity in which you regularly participate. Explain the motivational forces that have driven you when you have achieved yourbest. 2. Are the motivators you chose the same as for all your class mates? Why/why not? 3. Think of times when you have been anxious and nervous when facing a challenge. What strategies did you employ to overcome your anxiety? Do you think athletes utilize similar strategies? Why/why not? Share your ideas with the class. iv .Social Interaction : Exercise as an activity provides opportunity for people to participate in both group as well as individual exercise programmes. e.g., participating in a team event, group exercise programme or an individual activity in a social structure. Group Exercise experience is pleasurable for participants; hence it is good for mental health and social wellbeing. However, choice of individual exercise is preferable and beneficial for people low in self-esteem or suffering from anxiety related to body image and physical self-concept. In addition, spectators and fans at a match or sports activity also bond socially.9.1.5 IMPORTANCE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE 254 v. Distraction Ability : Exerciseprovides opportunity for distraction from the current mood state. Acute dose or short duration of exercise is helpful in reducing anxiety through the distraction ability of exercise; regular exercise has long term benefits. Art Integration - WRITING A STORY Choose an Indian athlete who has won a medal in the International arena - Olympics, Paralympics or Special Olympics. Research and write the story of the athlete highlighting the factors that made her/him succeed. B. Psychological Advantages of Sports Participation i. Life skills: Sports participation and competitions help to develop sense, sensitivityand sensibility among participants which helps them to approach andtackle the issues and challenges of life with positivity. ii. Developmental aspects : Sports participation experience provides opportunity among the participants to develop social relationships including making friends and enjoyingteam atmosphere; it also helps in developing a spirit ofhealthy competition. iii. Behaviour modifications : Sports participation increases perceived competence and self-efficacy. Positive sports experience enhances intrinsicmotivation iv. Cognitive and Motor Skill acquisition : Repeated training and playing sports helps in: improving attentiondeficit disorder developing memory developing reasoning ability developing decision making skills C. Performance enhancement of athletes Develops coping skills to deal with setbacks and errors Improves teamcoh esion Helpsbuild confidence Importance of Psychology for Athletes Helps find the right zone of intensity Helps to control emotions Improves focus and helps deal with distractions 255 Developing athletes for prolonged participation in sports with optimal performance is always possible through various cognitive and behavioural intervention techniques andother psychological skill training methods along with goal setting principles. This helps in developing and maintaining psychological aspects influencing sports performance which include self-confidence and self-efficacy intrinsic motivation aggression management anxiety and arousal control stress management psychological response to injury and rehabilitation team cohesion leadership and communication D. Exercise adherence through psychological interventions Regular exercise is an essential component for a healthier lifestyle and the concept of following a culture of exercise and physical activity throughout life is appreciated uniformly across the world . However, there may be still a large population whose exercise level must be low or some of those who have begun exercise, but may not continue for long, and many who may lose steam in between. Psychological theories and research understand the determinants of exercise adherence and non-adherence to help participants maintain alifelong commitment to regular exercise, and may also be used to identify potential drop outs.

Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. In what ways could knowledge of sports psychology benefit athletes? 256 Growth and development of human beings is a natural process which brings changes in mental, emotional, social, physical and moral aspects of life. Growth and development are complimentary to each other for human wellbeing. However, growth is structural and absolute in measure with limitations in progression, while development is functional and coordinate with various systems of the body through life. Growth and development are processes common to all, intimately linked with each other in time and space but practically independent of each other. Both are, however, interrelated with genetic and environmental factors and modifications. In Psychology, growth refers to the changes in physical aspects in terms of size and shape, whereas development is multi-dimensional in approach which refers to all types of changes. Changes in height, weight, size of body, organs are referred to as growth, on the other hand, development refers to changes in behaviour, intellect, emotional or social aspects of life. Elements Growth Development Meaning Growth refers to change in size Development refers to change in ability Process Growth is non-continuous and limited Development is lifelong Measure Growth is quantifiable and measurable with objectivity Development is qualitative in nature and subjective in assessment Variables Growth refers to increase in physical variables like height, weight etc. Development refers to increase in skill and functions Nature and Aspects Growth is related to physical aspects Development is related to mental, social, emotional aspects Direction Direction of growth can have positive or negative values Direction of development is always positive Progression Growth is structural and absolute, can have spurts Development is progressive and sequential Learning influence Growth is not affected by past or new learning Development is affected by past and new learning and experiences 9.2.2 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 9.2.1 CONCEPTS OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 257 T he term \"Growth and Development\" is many times used interchangeably in the field of Psychology and Sports, as also in various other areas like Education etc., as they are interrelated and are dependent on each other. It is essential to understand the difference between the two terms from various perspectives for holistic understanding of an individual and for wider opportunity to exploit the potentials of an individual. In physical education and sports, the term growth refers to change in quantity, size and shape of an object or individual e.g., height, weight etc. whereas the term development refers to change of quality in ability to perform, move, think, feel etc. In sport for example, quantitative change in height of an athlete refers to growth whereas change in the ability and performance skills or change in cognitive abilities and changes in emotional aspects are reflections of development. One of the major differences between growth and development is in its process - growth aspects are non- continuous and limited whereas development is a never ending and lifelong process. Most of the social, mental and emotional aspects are developmental in nature and are, therefore, progressive and sequential. Thinking ability, group cohesion, aggression control etc. are abilities and functions that are affected by past and new learning experiences and are considered as developmental elements.The term development applies to the changes that have a direction and hold definite relationship with what precedes it, and in turn, will determine what will come after. On the contrary, progress of growth elements is visible but may not be influenced by past or new learning. Concerns Ph ysical educators and coaches need to be aware that children grow at different rates through varying stages of development. These stages are physical, emotional and mental and impact all areas of a child's academicand athletic life. Sport readiness will vary from child to child and coaches need to be aware that it is not enough to assume every child reaches a certain stage of development at a given age. Children who participate in Programmes that are beyond their developmental capabilities can suffer injury, discouragement and disappointment, leading to their giving up sports altogether. It may also result in their developing wrong techniques, thereby hindering technical skill advancements. Extension Activity Identify people who have participated in a variety of physical activity challenges \u2014 for example, rock climbing, skydiving or rafting. Interview or write to these people to find out how such challenges influenced their physical, social and emotional development. Which physical activity/activities did you find challenging? Why were they challenging to you? How did you prepare yourself to meet these challenges? Have you changed since participating in these activities? How?9.2.3 CONCEPTS OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SPORTS AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION 258 How have you benefited physically from these challenges? What were the social benefits, if any, of participating in these activities? What were the emotional benefits of participating in these activities? Share your findings with the class. For the reasons given above, it is important to introduce sports to different age groups with equipment variations, length of time spent playing and practicing, avoidance of specialization and changing the focus of sports from competition to fun, and to create transition or developmental sports models to facilitate easy transition of athletes from recreational sports to professional sports without pushing them towards dropping out of sport altogether. Therefore, it is essential to provide : 1. scientific knowledge of different developmental stages related to physical, cognitive, emotional, and social aspects to sports and physical education professionals. 2. facilitation of social and emotional growth to athletes through a supportive and positive sporting experience, which will encourage a lifelong participation in physical activity. The following aspects are important for consideration: awareness about social influences acting on young athletes, both positive and negative e.g., drugs and alcohol. tailor detailed explanations of tactics, skills and rationales to suit the age appropriate development of athletes. Athlete support system to help build realistic and achievable goals during different stages of growth of development. 3. understanding about emotional outbursts due to frustration, when learning new skills, and hormonal mood swings during adolescence. 4. understanding about factors creating anxiety among adolescents that may negatively affect performance. 5. providingall athletes with responsibility and age appropriate leadership opportunities as student athletes mature. This can be achievedby understanding athletes, recognising the importance of independence and personal responsibility and providing the same understanding to the athletes. giving athletes opportunities to run part of practice sessions and participate in the decision-making process regarding team policies. 9.2.4 APPLICATION OF PSYCHOLOGY IN AN ATHLETE'S GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 259 I. Tick the correct option. 1. Which of the following is an aspect of growth? i. Intelligence ii. Emotion iii. Height iv. Leadership 2. Growth refers to i. change in emotion ii. change in physiology iii. change in ability iv. change in maturity II. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. Define Growth and Development? 2. Discuss the importance of Growth and Development in Sports? III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. Differentiate between Growth and Development? 2. Describe various elements of growth and development?. Growth and development are multidimensional requiring integration and coordination between the various aspects. To understand the growth and development of an individual, it is helpful to understand the four main areas of development. Figure-1: Schematic illustration of the interaction between the four main areas of development S. No. Areas of Growth and Development Characteristics 1. Physical height and weight 2. Mental thinking and understanding 3. Social interacting with others 4. Emotional feelings and attitudes Physica l Emotiona l Growth & DevelopmenMenta l Socia l 9.3.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 260 As is illustrated in Figure 1, the overall development of an individual is influenced by a constant interaction between the four areas of development. Growth and development of an individual is the result of interaction between physical, mental, emotional as well as social aspects of development. What is physical development? Development of physical aspects includes of the various physiological changes occurring to an individual starting from birth till death. Measurement and assessment of physical aspects of development includes factors such as height, weight, strength, flexib ility and other motor abilities. Changes in body composition d ue to change in age influences various other aspects of development. Most of the physical developments are quantifiable and measureable interms of size, shape and weight, therefore have standard tools to assess them. With the change in age, there are observable changes in physical aspect which have a structure and pattern. Any deviation from the patterns of growth associated with that particular age group or gender can be identified and diagnosed and remedial measures can be applied. Various aspect of physical development may have stagnation after certain age, whereas spurts are also observable at particular stage of growth. What is cognitive development? Cognitive, or its extended term mental development, is an essential aspect of an individual's development. It includes abilities such as memory, perception, language, information processing, and thinking which influence decision-making abilities.According to change in biological age, these abilities keep changing along with growth and maturation. There is a general pattern of mental development, but each individual develops their mental abilities in a unique pattern which is influenced by genetic factors, social environment and experience available to an individual during different stages of growth. The important aspect about cognitive aspect is that, all the abilities are inter-related and they develop as aunit. What is social development? Social development refers to the aspects wherein an individual interacts with the society and which results in development in various aspects of an individual at different stages of life. Social development is also the ability to communicate effectively with the members of the society and to observe societal norms of the community according to one's age group. Appropriate social behaviour consists of being able to get along with members of the society, as well as showing respect for societal rules and understanding one's roles and responsibilities. The development of social aspects areaffected by various stages of growth, thus different varieties of social skills are reflected by individuals. What is emotional development? Emotion refers to responses consisting of physiological reactions and expressive behaviours which may be subjective in nature. Emotional development is part of a person 's personality development and it refers to the ability to express and control one's emotions. It includes control over psycho-physiological reactions of the body with respect to the conditions, environment and situations surrounding them. From 261 chi ldhood to old-age, individuals acquire new skills to manage feelings and emotions as it is highly affected by the environment and conditions around an individual. A wide variety of emotions are expressed by individuals at different stages of growth and display. Age and gender along with quality of emotional experiences are major factors affecting the emotional decisions anindividual. Change is the one inevitable thing in life. Change could be visible, as in physical aspects, involving weight, height gain or muscle and fat mass reduction and increase etc., or it could be related to cognitive abilities, i.e., the ability to understand, the emotional ability to respond to different stimuli, or the ability related to social aspects and the capability to choose groups and individuals, or the ability to evaluate the moral aspects and to value and respect people and happenings with rationale regarding ethical and moral principles. These changes are commonly described according to various stages of development based on different age groups. If we observe the behaviour of people living around us, we see they are not similar in their behaviour. Most of the changes or differences are because everyone is in different stages of development. The developmental stages are considered to be temporary and consist of characteristics which are dominant at a particular stage. Individuals differ with respect to time and rate of development, but they are expected to attain these developments within their stages. Thus, these accomplishments become social expectations which are known as developmental milestones. It is interesting to understand that certain milestones or characteristics are acquired easily whereas certain skills or milestones become difficult to acquire within a specificstage. From the perspective of physical education and sports, these changes influence participation and performance in physical activities, exercise and sports. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the changes which occur at different age groups or different stages of growth and development is very essential and critical for optimal growth and development of an individual. While there is no consensus in classification of different stages of growth and development, broadly speaking, the stages of human life span can be divided into: Infancy (birth to age2) Childhood (2-11years) Early childhood ( 2 to 6years) Middle childhood ( 6 to 11years) Adolescence (11 years to about 20years) Adulthood (20 -65years) Young Adulthood (20 to 40 years) Middle Adulthood (40 to 65years) Late Adulthood ( 65 years andabove)9.3.2 STAGES OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 262 Stages Developmental milestones Infancy : 0-2 yrs Physical : The child 's body weight increases to almost triple the birth weight, and increase in height is about one-third during the firstyear alone. Growth of brain size is also rapid during first 18 months. Linguistics: Children start developing language ability and learn through their sense organs. They explore the world in their own ways and express their intellect by making various sounds like gurgling, cooing, etc. Social & Emotional : Expressing joy, anger, sadness is achieved by 6 months. Motor skills: The infant first controls his head and trunk, then lift his chest, sits upright, crawls, creeps, stands with help, stands holding some objects and starts walking. Early Childhood: 2-6yrs Physical : The child develops athletic appearance and loses baby chubbiness. Brain and head grow rapidly during this period. Cognitive: The child develops ability to classify objects, people orevents. They are imaginative, animated and create their own hypothetical world. Psycho Social : He/She is able to express his/her feelings and emotions and communicate needs and feelings with others. Linguistic: The child develops the ability to speak in complete sentences. Motor skills: The child has better control of his/her physical movement and can have better coordination of body parts. Late Childhood (Pre -Adolescence) 6-11yrs Physical : There is an increase in strength as body parts become stronger. Cognitive: By this age children develop concrete thinking abilities, in which they develop ability to think logically and use mental operations to solve problems. However, they still lack abstract thinking ability. Psycho Social : The child develops gender identification and social comparison to identify themselves from others. Motor skills: They have developed the ability to use body parts with appropriate speed. Adolescence (11-20 years) Physical : Boys and girls develop height, weight, muscles and achieve maturity but in growth is in spurts. The onset of this stage is marked by the onset of puberty. Psycho Social : At this stage boys and girls are argumentative and they have a tendency to find fault with the authority figures. They are self- conscious and influenced by their peer 263 group. Cognitive: Boys and girls become innovative and take great interest in learning various skills. They also develop the ability of abstract thinking. Motor : They develop strength, speed, endurance, flexibility, coordination at a rapid rate. Early Adulthood (20 -40) By the time they reach adulthood, individuals are responsible, mature, self-supporting and well-integrated into society. Middle Adulthood (40-65 years) This period is characterised by strong social networking, relatively stable personality, and life is dominated by work and family. Old Age (65 and above) This period is marked by decline of health and faculties, and individuals often plan to retire. It is marked by inactiveness and people are prone to various physical limitations. Inf ancy: This stage of infancy starts from the time child is born and extends till the age of two years. Physical aspects develop at a rapid rate, especially increase in body weight and height during this period and the infant gains three times its body weight during the first year alone. There is also a rapid growth in brain size during the first two years. According various research, the brain size of a two year old is found to attain 55% of its adult size, whereas at around six years of age, the child brain attains 90% of the adults size. An new born infant does have reflexes and sensory capacities to help him interact with the environment from the moment of birth. All healthy babies are born with certain reflexes, or inborn automatic responses to particular forms of stimulation. These reflexes are essential for survival and can the infants to survive until it is capable of more complex behaviours. Children at this stage start developing language ability and start learning through their sense organs and explore the world in their own ways. They also start expressing themselves by making various sounds like gurgling, cooing, etc and by smiling. Newly infants are found to be emotional, but during this stage they have no control over their emotions. When they attain the age of six months, they reflect psycho-social development through activities like expressing joy through laughter, or anger and sadness through crying. Motor development in infants is reflected through the initial control of head and trunk, followed by lifting their chest, sitting upright, crawling, creeping, standing with help and walking. By the age of two years, a child is able to walk up and down stairs and kicks aball. Early Childhood : This (2-5 years) is the phase post-infancy, wherein changes inphysical appearance occur as the child loses the chubbiness associated with infancy. Brain develops rapidly and the child has better control over his/her physical movements along with improved coordination of his/her body parts. Psycho-social development involves development of feelings, emotions and the ability to communicate their needs and feelings with others. Cognitive ability develops rapidly and the child can count, name colours, and can also make few decisions on their own, such as choosing an outfit to wear. Basic time concepts and sequencing (e.g., before and after) are understood at this age group. They do start enjoying use of humour in 264 stories and are able to predict what next in the stories they listen. Because they can think symbolically, they enjoy pretend play and inventing elaborate characters and scenarios. Curiosities toward new and unknown is one of the reflective elements of mental development occurring during this stage of growth. According to Jean Piaget's theory on cognition, 2-3 year olds are described as egocentric, meaning that they do not have an awareness of others' points of view. Whereas, children between 3 and 5 years old can understand that, people have thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that can be different from their own. Cognitive abilities to classify objects, people or events are developed along with qualities of being imaginative, animated and creative by being in their own hypothetical world. They have a well-developed language ability and are able to say full sentences, and sing songs and recite rhymes from memory. Late Childhood: Between 6-11 years, physical development can be seen in an increase in strength as the body becomes stronger. However, there are often fluctuations in physical development between children. One child can be in a completely different growth phase thananother child who is the exact same age. The disparity in physical development may continue well into adolescence, when growth patterns even out. Physical growth and development supports motor development and the individual can train at appropriate speed and intensity. Psycho-social development plays a major role as child develop gender identification and initiates social comparisons to identify him/herself from others. Child develops cognitive abilities through development of ability to think logically and use mental operations to solve problems, but lacks abstractthinking. Adolescence : Adolescence is an important stage of growth and development wherein an individual goes through a transition from childhood to adulthood due to which a large amount of physical, mental, social and emotional changes occur at a very rapid pace along with physical growth spurts. The term adolescence is derived from the Latin word adolescere , meaning to grow up. Adolescence is a transitional stage of physical and psychological development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood. While adolescence is marked with onset of puberty, it is usually associated with the teenage years. However, its onset may vary from individual to individual due to physical, psychological or cultural variations and may begin earlier and end later with individuals. Also, boys generally attain puberty around 12-13 years of age, whereas, girls attain puberty at a much younger age of 10-11 years. Boys indicate attainment of puberty through appearance of whiskers whereas in girls the onset of puberty is identified by the beginning of menstruation. Adolescent boys and girls develop height, weight, muscle mass and bones at a high rate of maturity but with growth spurts, due to which motor development is also rapid. Puberty occurs due to various hormonal changes during this stage of development. Hormones like testosterone among boys and oestrogen among girls are released during this stage for helping puberty development, and are closely associated with various emotional or psycho-social behaviours among both boys and girls. Adolescents tend to be more argumentative and have a tendency to find fault with the authority figures. Self- consciousness and increased influence of peer group are common scenarios during this stage of development. Aggression and depression are closely associated among adolescents leading to various issues of juvenile delinquencies which will be discussed in the later part of the chapter. Parents, school, and society have to play a positive role 265 an d strengthen relationships for optimal development of adolescents. Since adolescence results in various changes in their appearance and abilities, adolescents develop various cognitive aspects like becoming more innovative and taking an interest in learning various skills with enhanced involvement. They develop abstract thinking ability wherein they start creating their own understanding of the world as they start accumulating knowledge through interaction and apply the learned concepts to newtasks. Adulthood: An adult is someone who is responsible, mature, self-supporting and well-integrated into society. Since all characteristics and attributes do not develop in all individuals at the same time and at the same rate, so to understand this stage better, its further divided into two sub- stages as \"early adulthood\" and \"middle adulthood\". In early adulthood stage, development of physical health, strength and energy is at the peak and sensory and motor systems are at their peak. Physical characteristics are reflected through weight gain and height increase, whereas psycho- social development is reflected through family-oriented behaviours and commitment towards relationships. This stage is also marked with choices regarding career options, selection of lifestyle etc. Middle adulthood is a later stage reflecting gradual decline in physical abilities, efficiencies and motor components. Women in this stage go through various hormonal changes which results in menopause. This stage reflects relatively stable personality and strong social networking as are largely well-settled as responsible individuals and citizens. Developmental Characteristics and Stages of Growth and Development: A Sports Model In sports, an athlete's growth and development at different stages of life is an essential component to be considered while planning training, selection of activity, grouping of athletes according to abilities etc. The growth and development stages of athletes can be grouped into four categories: below 9 years Fun Phase 10-12 years Foundation Phase 13-15 years Formative Phase 16-19 years Final Phase By identifying and understanding the main characteristics of each of these developmental stages, athletes' needs can be better taken care off. Key Features Fun Phase: Below 9 Elements Physical Motor Skill Cognitive Psycho-social Characteristics Slow but steady increase in height and weight Learns basic motor skills Short attention span. Sensitive to criticism 266 Teaching/ Coaching Pedagogy Add minimal physical conditioning Plan fun- oriented activities to develop motor skills Add variation and variety in drills Create stress free atmosphere Foundation Phase: 10-12 years Elements Physical Motor Skill Cognitive Psycho-social Characteristics Growth spurt and changes due to puberty Motor skill development at different rate Increased perception and Logical High Self- Confidence Tendency to self- evaluate and compare one self with others Teaching/ Coaching Pedagogy Plan low intensity physical conditioning Focus on skill refinement and development Introduction of Small Sided Games (SSG); Allow guided discovery Avoid winning and losing; Give positive feed backs Formative Phase: 13-15 Years Elements Physical Motor Skill Cognitive Psycho-social Characteristics Physical and hormonal changes Increase in adaptation Development of ability for abstract thinking Sensitive to peerpressure High level of criticism Self-centred Teaching/ Coaching Pedagogy Plan Training at match speed Add fitness component Practise in Real match situations Add tactics and Strategy Schedule long and intense playing hours Allow increased decision making 267 Final Phase : 16-19 Years Elements Physical Motor Skill Cognitive Psycho-social Characteristics All round development (Automatic capacity).

Define concepts of Growth and Development? 268 2. Explain characteristics of Growth and Development? 3. Which type of activities can be undertaken in early childhood?Why? III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. Discuss the developmental characteristics of early childhood and their impact on learning. Adolescence as defined by WHO includes individuals between the age group of 10-19 years, a period of transition from childhood to adulthood. It is marked by the onset of puberty, which now occurs earlier, on an average, than in the past. This age group is considered critical because it marks the developmental transition of an individual from childhood to adulthood, which involves physical, psychological, social and neuro developmental changes. Raman is a 14-year-old who has just entered Class 9 in his Secondary School. He has noticed that his body is going through some physical changes. As a result, he has become self-conscious about his physical appearance. He has also begun taking measures to insure more privacy at home. For example, he locks the door every time he enters the bathroom, and he always takes his phone calls in his room with his door closed. He also values his relationships with his friends and has begun spending more time with them. He started valuing his freedom, thus gets aggressive or irritated with restrictions by family members on certain tasks. His parents understand the behaviour changes, thus creating space for him at home and listening to his thoughts and ideas. They involve him in sports and outdoor activities to channelize his energy. Raman's behaviour and physical changes are common during adolescence. Adolescence stage is a critical time of life, when a child transforms into an independent individual, develops new relationships, enhance social skills andacquires behaviours which will be everlasting throughout life. Due to these various changes, adolescents need explicit attention and support to help them contribute positively to society. Physical growth and development during adolescence is marked by changes in height and weight, body composition, skeletal mass, and sexual maturation. The biological changes during adolescence that occur due to the onset of puberty, mark the transition of the child into an adult. The growth spurt associated with puberty, which results in physical and hormonal changes is also marked by remarkable changes in energy levels, thus developing in the individual a strong recognition of personal identity, moral and ethical value sets, and a feeling of self-esteem. The hormonal changes are linked to the cognitive and psycho-social changes, wherein adolescents develop stronger reasoning skills, logical and moral thinking, and become more capable of abstract thinking and making rational judgements. This stage of adolescence surely creates opportunities for significant developments because of wide chronological age range, but it also creates space for dissatisfactions too, thus creating turbulence in the adolescent which can be reflected in behavioural as well as 9.4.1 ADOLESCENT PROBLEMS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 269 e motional aspects. They are exposed to a variety of substance abuse like tobacco, drugs etc. They face greater risk of violence and can experience different types of emotional drainage leading to depression and suicide tendencies. Do you know? To understand the psycho-social and cognitive developments and concerns, it is suitable to review the three sub-stages or periods of adolescence presented by Ingersoll (1992) as early adolescence (10-14 years), middle adolescence (15-17 years), and late adolescence (18-21 years). Psycho-social Processes and Substages of Adolescence Substage Emotionally Related Cognitively related Socially related Morally related Early Adolescence Adjustment to a new body image; adaptation to emerging sexuality Concrete thinking; early moral concepts Strong peer effect Pre- conventional Middle Adolescence Establishment of emotional separation from parents Emergence of abstract thinking, expansion of verbal abilities and conventional morality; Increased health risk behaviour; sexual interests in peers; early Conventionally moral 9.4.2 SUB-STAGE OF ADOLESCENCE 270 adjustment to increased school demands vocational plans Late Adolescence Establishment of a personal sense of identity; further separation from Parents Development of abstract, complex thinking; emergence of postconventional morality Increased impulse control; emerging social autonomy; establishment of vocational capability Post- conventional moral Source: Adapted and reprinted from Ingersoll GM, Psychological and social development.

How important is it for you to be accepted by your peers? What are some situations in which you have, or someone you know has, experienced peer pressure? Why do you think it's so difficult to withstand peer pressure? What would you do if one of your friends began pressuring you todo something you didn't want to do, or didn't approve? If someone were consistently trying to pressure you to dosomething you were uncomfortable with, would you consider that person a friend? Why or why not? Why do you think peer pressure is so often associated withnegative behaviour? What are some ways to avoid negative peer pressure? Is there positive peer pressure? What are the ways in which friends could have a positive influence? Share your views with the class. Early Adolescence (10-14 yrs) is the initial stage wherein a child like Raman starts adjusting to the rapid body changes and adapts to sexual changes. This stage is very suitable for cognitive development, the child develops concrete thinking, and an ability to understand the perspective other than their own. They also fall short of problem-solving skills related to behaviour modifications. They develop early moral concepts about there being just no one right view, instead there can be different opinions regarding similar concerns. At this stage, a strong peer effect is also reflected through development of relationships among peer group/ friends and admiring celebrities. 271 Middle adolescence (14-17 yrs) is the stage wherein puberty has passed, thus creating a con sciousness in the adolescents about their physical appearance and sexual attractiveness. This stage is very critical, as it establishes emotional separation from the parents and a desire for being independent and need for space. This period is also marked by development of abstract thinking, ability to use verbal communication effectively, and development of conventional morality. With the development of conventional morals, importance of peer pressure and peer acceptance and approval increases. They start focusing on maintaining social order but will surely like to match their behaviour with their beliefs by trying the things which they consider as \"bad\". Due to this, individuals in this age group are prone to engage in social problems including addiction to smoking, drug abuse and other health-risk behaviours. Late adolescence (17-19 yrs) is the stage where the adolescent develops a personal sense of identity as the biological development concludes for most. Thus, he/she is now better able to cope with situations of peer group pressure, body imaging and behaviour impulses. They move on from concrete thinking to abstract thinking which prompts them to set their own moral guidelines without any need for social acceptance. This stage is also marked by increased behaviour control, consistency and stability leading to creating space for themselves within the society. Adolescence Problems Adolescence problems : When various problems like behaviour issues, emotional problems, moral dilemmas, social concerns along with career uncertainty combine together, they create behaviour deviations among the adolescents and raise concerns and problems among the society members at home, at school, in the sports teams etc. These behaviour deviations lead to problems such as substance abuse which have negative effects on health, developing of eating disorders leading to anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, indulging in anti-social behaviour due to aggression and anxiety, non-adherence to outdoor activity, sports and exercise. The various types of concerns associated with adolescence at different stages are to be understood and supported by family, friends, teachers, coaches, relatives in accordance to the needs and demands of the individual. Any deviation in any of the mentioned aspects of the adolescent leads Behaviour Concerns Emotional Concerns Moral Concerns Social Concerns Career Uncertainty Behaviour Deviation Substance abuse Antisocial behaviour Eating disorders Exercise adherence Group cohesion 272 to different types of problems which need appropriate understanding and management. The problems associated with adolescence due to behaviour deviations can be many, but a few major issues along with their management are discussed below. 1. Substance abuse is one of the major concerns among the adolescence. It is behaviour that is neither ethical nor socially acceptable. Drugs have addictive properties, and have lethal effects on health. Alcoholism, smoking, drugs etc attract the adolescence age group due to peer pressure and various otherfactors. Management : The issues related to intervention include a combination of cognitive and behaviour techniques. The cognitive techniques include expression of concern for individuals bycoaches and parents, setting limits on unacceptable behaviour and developing behaviour policies for class, team orgroup. The behaviour techniques include involvement of peer for transfer ofaccepted behaviours, engagement of individuals during free time through participation in sports, exercise, recreation or any outdoor or indoor activities for constructive modification. 2. Eating Disorders are the result of various psychological aspects like anxiety, depressionetc. due to which the adolescent develops eating disorders like a. Anorexia nervosa which is reflected in bizarre eating patterns and habits like unusual starvation due to social or physique anxiety for weightloss b. Bulimia Nervosa which is presented by binge eating patterns due to depression andother psychological fluctuations. Eating disorders can be found among addicted exercisers when they stop exercising, start dieting and develop anorexia or bulimia due to depression, and in females especially, who develop consciousness towards physical appearance and sexual appearance. Management: These issues concerned with eating disorders can be managed through two essential processes Diet Awareness is essential towards management of eating disorders. It can be done through promotion of awareness about dietary habits among the adolescents at various levels including at school, home, residential organizations and at community events involving adolescents. Promotion of Fitness : Physique and physical appearance have no substitute other than exercise and physical activity along with a healthy diet pattern. Promotion of fitness activities and participation in sports or outdoor activities need to be facilitated at all levels of community interaction opportunities. 3. Anti-Social Behaviour is a prominent pattern reflected among the adolescents due to the psychological turbulence happening along with sudden spurts of physical changes during adolescence when not adequately supported by the 273 com munity and associated members. Issues of aggression have a larger impact on the adolescent due to change in cognition abilities. Management: Catharsis: Aggression can be regulated through fulfilment or discharge of negative feelings, or catharsis. Individuals should be given an opportunity to speak and express their emotions, as suppressing of emotions and provision of opportunities for adolescents to share their thoughts along with their peer group. Circular Effect: Aggression has a circular effect, as one act of aggression leads to another. Therefore, there is a need is to break the circle so that it is not repeated again. Ideal recommended style to break the circle is through positivere inforcement. Management: - Break the violence cycle as soon as frustration is reflected i.e., aggressive behaviour of seniors is reflected on juniors or of one player on another. - Provide space for players to speak and express their opinion and the manager/coach must listen to it positively. 4. Exercise Adherence: With the growth in physical aspects and development in social, mental, cognitive aspects in adolescence, energy channelization is essential for cohesive development. Participation in outdoor and indoor activity along with participation in sports and exercise is essential for lifelong learning towards wellness. Dropout rate from participation of sports and exercise is a common reflection among the adolescence. The general reasons identified for the dropoutsare: a) Intrapersonal Constraints : (i) Lack of fun and enjoyment or getting bored; (ii) Low perceptions of physical competence; (iii) Low intrinsic motivation and high stress level; (iv) Negative feelings towards team orcoach; (v) Anxiety and nervousness due to excessive criticism. b) Interpersonal Constraints: (i) Family or peer pressure; (ii) Social priorities; (iii) Excessive alternate opportunities; c) Structural Constraints: (i) Time available for training; (ii) Sports related injuries; (iii) Financial feasibility; (iv) Insufficient facilities and infrastructure; (v) Overuse/Burnout; 274 Adherence Management : S upport of family, teachers, coaches, trainers is essential towards helping adolescence towards exercise adherence as an essential component towards life. Adoption Maintenance Access to facility and time Self-motivation Social influence Self-efficacy Behaviour coping skills Knowledge about importance of healthy life style, exercise and sports Positive attitude towards exercise and sports Confidence to succeed in vigorous exercise Programme/sport Group Cohesion: Belonging to a peer group is a key need for an adolescent, which can be dynamic in both structure as well as process. Group cohesiveness and its norms help to facilitate the group to achieve more than individuals would be able to on their own. The purpose of a group is towards bringing a change along with providing support and insight into either the individual, the group as a whole, or the environment. Working in groups may well encounter internal problems and conflict at certain stages, but with effecting group functioning strategies, they provide a positive and supportive environment to develop and learn new interpersonal skills. Teams are special kinds of groups, members of teams often have complementary skills and are committed to a common goal or purpose and they are mutually accountable for their activities. In teams, there is a positive synergy attained through the coordinated efforts of the members. Group Management: a. Goal Setting i. Set teams goals and take pride in their accomplishment. ii. Each player must be aware of their roles and make them believe it is important iii. Take time to learn something personal about an individual b. Avoid formation ofcliques i. Promote regular meetings and interactions ii. Positive encouragement on loosing and avoiding public punishment iii. Avoid personal prejudice or scape goats usage iv. Provide equal opportunity v. Focus on maximum transparency vi. Develop team drills and activities to promote team cooperation vii. Highlight areas of success even during failure. 275 I. Tick the correct option. 1.

Sports performance training simply is a type of training that is designed to improve the sportsperson's fitness level and ability to perform in a given sport. It includes corrective and restorative exercises, strength training, conditioning and cardiovascular training, sports specific technique sand drills, periodization, nutritional advice, mental and psychological training by a qualified trainer. Do you know? MODERN SPORTS TRAINING is a method of developing an athlete's performance. And for improvement of performance it is important to know about the Periodization. Periodization means dividing the training plan of an athlete in order to enable him/her to achieve his/her optimum performance during the main championship. It includes a preparatory period, competition period and transitional period in one periodization cycle. 10.1.1 MEANING AND CONCEPT OF SPORTS TRAINING 278 Preparatory period is the longest phase where players work on their fitness components, sports technique and tactics. During th Competition peri , players play minor competitions before playing the main competition. Minor competitions help an athlete to identify his/her own error and to rectify it before the main competition Transitional perio is at the most a month which starts just after the end of the main competition. It is an active rest period of an athlete where recreational activities are advised. Players need to enjoy and help their body and mind to recover. Sports Training is not a new concept; it has been implemented and assessed from ancient times. During the times of Ancient Olympics, players trained themselves for achieving high levels of performance. They were required to report at the venue one month prior to the commencement of the Games for training together. Do you know? The preparations of an ancient Olympic athlete started many months, even years, before the opening of the festival, in the gymnasion. The Ancient Greek gymnasion was a public location used for training, education, exercise and socialising - something like the modern community centre. In Ancient Greek society, achieving a harmonious balance between body and mind was an important aspect of an individual's personal development. The gymnasion therefore hosted wrestling matches and provided weight lifting training as also music rehearsals and philosophy lectures. Now a days, as you know competition has increased in all the fields. Similar is the case with sports. Modern sports training has become very scientific and systematic with well-designed equipment and means for developing the performance of an athlete as per his/her abilities. This is the reason why proper training schedules are now designed on an annual or Olympic period basis. In these periods, training is divided into different phases for better acquisition or adaptation of skills, and to attain optimum results during the main competition. Extension Activity Sport training is a process of preparation for a sport performance, put simply. It consists of four parts: Conditioning training (strength training, endurance training, flexibility training) Training of technique (Technical preparation) Training of tactics (Tactical preparation) Psychological training (Mental preparation) Working in groups, interview ten sports persons from your school, or another near by school, who have participated in CBSE's Zonal Competitions (or, any equivalent Competition). Find out details of their training under the heads given above. 279 Today sports training is not only related to the training of physical exercises, but is a complex process which includesa sequential way of training where an athlete develops his physiological and psychological adaptation through working on different areas such as individual care, specific fitness and conditioning, technical help, utilising appropriate machine equipment, considering climate conditions, special athletic diet plan, safety means, emotional stability in competition, feedback, increased participation in competition, rehabilitation treatment, motivating forces, overload etc. All these factors are inter-related and produce high levels of performance in the competitions. In the present competitive world, these factors are as important as physical training/exercises for improving the performance of an athlete which is the ultimate aim of sports training. As you are aware, though exercises and training are different in nature, they are related to each other. In fact, exercise is a part of training. Exercise is a short-term physical activity which results in increasing the breathing rate, heart rate, blood pressure, blood flow and fatigue etc. On the other hand, training is a long-term process which involves a number of scheduled days and results in decreased breathing rate and resting heart rate, lowering of blood pressure,quick recovery and reduced risk of disease. According to Harre, \"Sports training, based on scientific knowledge, is a pedagogical process of sports perfection which through systematic effect on psycho- physical performance ability and performance readiness aims at leading the sportsman to high and the highest performance.\" Matweyew, \"Sports training is the basic form of an athlete's training. It is the preparation systematically organized with the help of exercises, which in fact is a pedagogically organized process of controlling an athlete's development.\" Martin,\"Sports training is planned and controlled processing which, for achieving a goal, changes in complex sports motor performance, ability to act and behaviour are made through measures of content, methods and organisation.\" Hardial Singh, \"Sports training is a pedagogical process, based on scientific principles, aiming at preparing sportsmen for higher performances in sports competitions.\" According to G. Thiess and G. Schnabel, \"Sports training is a scientific based and pedagogically organised process through which planned and systematic effect on performance ability and performance readiness aims at sports perfection and performance improvement as well as at the contest in sports competition.\" According to Todd Townes, \"Sports training is a targeted approach to training focused on your sport of choice.\" According to P. Garrison, \"Sports training is training designed specifically to increase performance and minimize injury of general sports performance as well as specialised sports performance. \"S ports training is the preparation of an athlete on scientific based principles in sequential manner to attain optimum performance in their desired competition.\" 280 So, in broad terms it can be said that, training is a well-planned, systematic, pedagogical (educational) process through which optimum performance can be achieved by an athlete in sports and games by working on implementing scientific principles. In simple word \"Sports training is an organised procedure by which people learn skills for a definite purpose.\" I. Tick the correct options 1.

What do you understand by the term sportstraining? 2. What is the need for sportstraining? 3. Differentiate between Training and Exercise. III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. In what ways does sports training become an essential part of a trainee's life in sports? 2. Why is systematic sports training required for anathlete? 3. Apart from training, list the factors, that contribute to a successfulplan? 4. \"Scenario of sports training is changing day by day.\" Justify thestatement. 281 In order to prepare a sportsperson for his/her highest performance in the desired tournament acertain process has to be followed; that is called training. Sports training nowadays demands certain technicalities and to make the process simpler, yeteffective, few principles should be kept in mind. These principles facilitate a trainer in successfully employing an efficient training Programme. Do you know? endurance - the ability to work for a longer duration of time under the condition of fatigue. strength - the ability to overcome from resistance. flexibility - the ability to cover maximum range of motion of joints. speed - the ability to perform any task in minimum possible tim coordination - the ability to maintain stabilised and generalised pattern of motor contro performance - the manner in which sport participation is measured. 1. Pr inciple of Continuity: Sports training is a regular phenomenon that should be done consistently, without irregular breaks. Though, it is a continuous process that includes planned intervals, the breaks should not be long as that can reduce the capability of the sportsperson. The important point to be kept in mind is that only an uninterrupted training can lead to an optimum/desired performance. 2. Principle of Individual Differences: Every individual is different. Each one possesses different qualities and capabilities, and responds differently to exercise and training. Some people handle higher volume of training while others may respond better to higher intensities. Therefore, a training plan must be constructed by keeping in mind the principle of individual differences. While building a plan a trainer must keep in mind the trainee's age (both chronological and athletic), gender, predominance of muscle fibre types and other related factors. 10.2.1 PRINCIPLES OF SPORTS TRAINING 282 3. Principle of Cyclicity: A training plan is constructed by incorporating various training cycles. These cycles are: micro, meso and macro; where micro is the shortest cycle which may last for 3-10 days. Meso cycle is the medium duration cycle and may be done for 3-6 weeks. Lastly, macro cycle, this is the longest duration cycle that lasts up to 12 months ora year. A macro cycle consists of different micro and mesocycles. 4. Principle of Overload: Load, in sports training, is known as the demand, that can be physical, physiological or psychological, put on the body to enhance the performance of the individual. The key point to note, while planning a training session, is the load should be greater than the normal load to aid adaptation process and thus facilitate the performance enhancement 5. Principle of Progression of load: As we discussed above, training load must be greater than the normal load. This principle testifies that training load must be increased gradually in order to avoid any unwanted tension on the muscles of the individual by increasing the load slowly and in accordance with the capabilities of the sports person. Also, this principle highlights the significance of rest and recovery in between the training sessions. Without optimum rest, there is higher risk for the athlete of getting injured. Therefore, while increasing the load, rest and recovery should be given required importance too. 6. Principle of Active Involvement: The performance of an athlete is not merely because of the coach's skills. A training plan results best and is effective only when the coach's knowledge blends with athlete's efforts. This principle lays stress on the athlete's ready participation in the training design. Also, this principle incorporates the \"Law of Readiness\" since this type of involvement prepares the athlete to perform upcoming tasks willingly. 283 7. Principle of Variety: Training is along-standing process that can turn in to aboringerr and. Therefore, to avoid monotony and to make a training design successful, a coach must incorporate variety in to it. The change can be made by introducing different exercises and drills, changing the time of the day of the session or training group etc. But, it is important to keep in mind that the change must be done according to the load and adaptation process and also facilitate performance enhancement. 8. Principle of Specificity: This principle lays emphasis on the notion \"practice makes a man perfect\". It further states that working on a particular muscle or fitness component will predominantly develop that part. Therefore, to enhance a specific skill or component one must practise it to achieve desired outcomes. E.g., a boxer must focus on punching and dodging skills whereas a basket baller must practise dribbling and shooting. 9. Principle of General and Specific Preparation: In order to enhance sports performance both general and specific preparation of an athlete is required. General preparation provides the base for the specific preparation. General preparation focuses on the development of overall fitness components whereas the specific preparation will enhance the functional capacity of the body systems which further improves the performance. 10. Principle of Warm Up and Cool Down: Warm up and cool down play vital role in delivering optimum performance. These two are an unavoidable part of training design. Warming up before a training session prevents muscle tenderness by increasing blood flow to the working muscles and therefore, prevents injury. On the other hand, cooling down helps an athlete to return to normal level by transferring blood from the working musclesto vital organs. It also helps in removing waste products from the body. 11. Principle of Rest and Recovery: It is evident that during rest, the body restores itself and become better and stronger than before. Both short periods, like hours between multiple sessions, and longer periods, like days or weeks to recover from a long season, are required to ensure that the athlete does not suffer from 284 exhaustion or an overuse injury. Therefore, a training plan must be designed in such a manner that proper rest recovery can take place in between the training sessions. 12. Principle of Ensuring Results: The pinnacle of sports training is to achieve desired result of delivering optimum performance. Therefore, a training Programme must be made by keeping in mind the goal of performance enhancement. This principle ensures achievement and maintenance of optimum performance only when all the above-mentioned principles are implemented while designing a training plan. 13. Principle of Periodization: Periodization is the blue print of a training plan. Its aim is to reach best possible performance in the most important competition. It comprises of following three phases: i) Preparatory Phase: In this phase, a sportsperson works on his/her motor fitness and specific preparation. This phase provides the base for the competition phase. ii) Competitive Phase: In this phase the sportsperson participates in variousp re- competitions and main competitions. iii) Transition Phase: This phase is used to facilitate psychological rest, relaxation and biological regeneration as well as to maintain general level of fitness. I. Tick the correct options. 1. Meso cycle is a training of i. one week ii. 4 to 10 days iii. 3 to 6 weeks iv. 3 months 2. Transitional Phase is a i. rest and recovery period ii. training period iii. competition period iv. fitness period 3.

What do you understand by Principle of Meso Cyclicity? 2. List the phases of Principle of periodization. 3. What do you mean by progression of load?285 4. Differentiate between general and specific preparation. III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. All players diligently follow the principles of training. What are the important principles of training which followed by coaches and players during training to attain good results in a championship? 2. Specify the factors that should be kept in mind while preparing a training plan.

These exercises also enable the nerve impulses of the person respond quickly and effectively. In short, warming up is the process of heating up the body temperature of a sportsperson before the competition or training for optimum performance. Warming up is short term in nature and activities performed while warming up are of low intensity with little repetition of specific exercises. It prepares the athlete physically, physiologically and psychologically before indulging in sports activity reducing the possibility of error and injury during the main sport or competition. Do you know? Warming up is a preliminary exercise of physical and mental preparation for a strenuous exertion. Limbering Down/Cooling Dow is an easy exercise, done after a more intense activity, to allow the body to gradually transition to a resting or near-resting state. 10.3.1 WHAT IS WARMINING UP 286 Art Integration - STAGING A PLAY ABOUT FAIR PLAY IN SPORTS Games and contests become opportunities to strive - with opponents - for excellence. Those who cheat or take performance enhancing drugs do not play the game. Fair Play means more than just following the rules. A sportsperson who plays fair: respects the Rules respects the officials and accept their decisions respects opponents gives everyone an equal chance to participate maintains self-control at all times Choose a situation where an athlete broke rules cheated/took drugs Or, helped an opponent. Write a play about her/him. Perform the play during Special Assembly of your school. Warm ing Up includes the following types. 1. Passive Warming Up: Passive Warming Up helps increase body temperature before the competition or training without performing any physical activity. This involves drinking warm water, hot beverages (tea, coffee, etc), taking as team bath, wearing heavy (extra) warm clothes, massage and sun bath etc. It enables the player to save his/her energy.This technique is usually preferred before events like pole vault, long jump etc. 2. Active Warming Up: Active Warming Up involves increasing the body temperature by performing different low intensity, repetitive exercises. These exercises or activities increase muscle efficiency and reduce risk of injuries. Although the intensity, repetition of exercises, and duration of warm up depends on individual difference, it is advisable to perform the activities for 10 to 30 minutes. The sequence of exercises must move from simple to complex at slow pace. Active warming up is further divided into two types.10.3.2 TYPES OF WARMING UP 287 (i) General Warming Up is performed before all types of activities and includes walking, jogging, running, jumping, striding, wind sprints, callisthenics, upper and lower limb movements such as rotation, stretching etc. It increases the coordination among different body muscles, mobility of joints, muscle tone andflexibility. (ii) SpecificWarming Up is performed specially according to the sport and event and is aimed at toning all thosespecific muscles which play a major role in a particular sport. e.g., in basketball players attempt lay-up shot, jump shot, rebounding, dribbling, overhead etc. This reduces the chance of ankle twisting, shoulder dislocation, knee injuries which are common in basketball. Do you know? Some specific warming activities include Hockey: Stick rotation, dribbling, stopping the ball with stick, scoops Badminton: Tossing, high clear, low clear, smashing, drop shot Tennis: Knocking, wall practise, slice, lob return. Kho-Kho: Dodging, Zig-Zag running pole to pole running. Volley ball: Blocking, passing, smashing etc. The re are various methods through which an athlete can warm up his/her body. 1. Physical Activities are activities which involve some set of exercises for the body parts through which the body gets prepared to perform any task at optimum level. These exercises must be done at slow pace and low intensity to prevent fatigue or overload before the competition or sports event. This is the best 10.3.3 METHODS OF WARMING UP 288 method which allows the athlete to increase his body temperature at required level. Find out and name the warming up activities in the picture Physical warming up activities include (i) Jogging is generally done at slow pace for 5 to 10 minutes to increase the body temperature. (ii) Bending and Stretching Exercises include limb and trunk exercises like stretching of shoulder muscles, arm muscles, clavicle muscles, back muscles, hip muscles and leg muscles and include movements like flexion, extension, abduction and adduction circumduction, and rotation. (iii) Striding is best before events requiring explosive effort. The athlete may run around 30 to 40 meters at sub maximum intensity at least 3-4 times with proper rest in between. (iv) Wind Sprints are sprinting exercises performed for short distance with spikes onas the athlete moves from a walk or slow run to a faster run and repeatedly reverses. 2. Massage increases and regulates blood flow in the body, thereby increasing the athlete's body temperature for producing efficient movement. Different techniques of massage include effleurage, petrissage, kneading, friction, vibration andpercussion. 3. Beverages Drinking of beverages including warm water, tea, coffee etc stimulates the body functions. However, care must be taken to consume these in limited quantity to avoid any discomfort. 4. Bath Hot bath therapy is usually very common in sports in cold countries. It can be performed before and after the task. A hot bath before the event may improve 289 the blood flow, increase body temperature and muscle activation of the athlete. After the task, it may help an athlete to cure muscle tension and reveal relaxation to the body. Do you know? The Muscular System Do you know the names of some important muscles in the body? Find out from the illustration given below. Warm ing up plays a vital role in sports training or competitions. 1. Psychologicalpreparedness: Performing a set of routine or specific activities/ exercises before the training and competition helps an athlete plan and build himself /herself to competing readiness, thereby eliciting optimum output. Extension Activity During your games period, take part in 100m race without doing any jogging and stretching activities. In the next game period, do warm up before participating in the 100m race. Record the difference in body efficiency. 10.3.4 IMPORTANCE OF WARMING UP 290 2. Reduces anxiety and tension : Warming up reduces anxiety and tension and increases motivational levels of a sports person. 3. Facilitate optimum performance by increasing the speed of nerves impulses and metabolic rate improving the reaction time of a sports person. 4. Prevents sports injuries Adequate warming up before training period or competition prevents loosening and tearing of muscles and reduces muscle cramping. 5. Assists flexibility and increases the range of motion helping a sportsman to exert force up to maximum reach. 6. Enhances mechanical efficiency by increasing the suppleness ofmuscles. 7. Facilitates motor fitness components like strength, endurance, flexibility, coordinative abilities andspeed. 8. Increases muscle temperature as a result of which muscles both contract more forcefully and relax more quickly, reducing the risk of over stretching a muscle and causing injury. It also improves muscle elasticity; this can enhance speed and strength. 9. Increases blood temperature and lactic acid leading to weakening of the binding of oxygen to haemoglobin. So oxygen is more readily available to working muscles, which may improve endurance. 10. Blood vessels dilate increasing blood flow and reducing stress on the heart. 11. Increases range of motion allowing large joints such as shoulders and knees to reach their maximum movement potential. Limbering Down or Cooling Down refers to activities or exercises performed by an athlete or sportsperson after training or competition to gradually transition from an exertion state to a resting or near resting state. Due to training, some physiological changes occur in an athlete's body. To get the body to normal or resting condition, cooling down is a necessary activity. Depending on the intensity of the exercise under taken, cooling down can involve as low jogor walk, or after a sports activity of lower intensity, stretching, especially static stretching allows muscles to be elongated and lengthened. Rehydration is an essential part of the procedure and should be done either during stretching and light intensity or after these steps. Players take a cooling bath, ice bath or cryotherapy for relaxing their muscles. 10.3.5 LIMBERING DOWN 291 There are some exercises designed for cooling down or muscle relaxation after a com petition. In cooling down stretching exercises plays vital role as well. 1. Ham Strings: Lying on your back, raise and straighten one leg directly above hips. Holding the calfort high, press the heel towards ceiling as you pull the leg back towards the chest. Do the same for otherleg. 2. Chest: Standing straight, interlace fingers behind your back. As you straighten out your arms, lift your chin towards ceiling. 3. Glutes: Lying on your back, cross right leg over bent left knee. Then bring the left knee to chest, holding onto the back of your thigh, gently pressing right knee wide. Do the same for otherleg. 4. Quadriceps: Lying on your right side, pull left into left glute, feeling the stretch in front of the thigh. Repeat with the right leg. 5. Triceps/Shoulders: Take one arm overhead, bend at elbow, and extend palm down centre of your back, gently pulling elbow with opposite hand. Take same arm across the chest, gently pulling at the elbow joint, to extend through the shoulder. Switch arms. 292 Do you know? Dynamic stretche - controlled leg and arm movements that involve active tightening of muscles to move joints through their full range of motion; used to engage muscles and mobilise joints; improves speed, agility, and acceleration. e.g., torso twists, walking lunges. Static stretche - involve gradually easing into the stretch position and maintaining it without pain for 15-20 seconds; a very effective way to increase flexibility. It must be noted that using static stretching post- event will help prevent injury. e.g., hamstrings stretch, quadricepsstretch. 1. Re duces body temperature : Appropriate cooling down or limbering down helps in reducing the body temperature. 10.3.6 BENEFITS OF LIMBERING DOWN 293 2. Reduces chances of unconsciousness: Proper cooling down reduces the heart rate slowly and blood does not pool in the legs and feet. It continues to flow back to the heart through veins and consequently such process reduces the chances of dizziness or fainting. 3. Restores supply of oxygen: Proper cooling down restores blood supply and oxygen to the muscles, restoring them to the position they were in before performing training. 4. Removal of waste products: Proper cooling down reduces the accumulation of waste products like lactic acid, uricacid, phosphates, sulphates, chlorides and carbon-dioxide etc. from the muscles. 5. Reduces tension: Proper cooling/limbering down reduces the muscular tension and mental tension.

Enlist the benefits of cooling down. 3. How is general warming up is different from specific warming up?294 Skill, Technique and Style are essential attributes for an athlete to perform at optimum level in sports. Some people are born with a natural ability for a particular game or sport such as speed, agility, coordination, flexibility, balance, reaction time. But they still need to develop and perfect their skills with frequent practice to bring about the result they wish to achieve. In simple words, skill is a learned and practised ability that helps an athlete or sportsperson achieve the desired result with maximum certainty and efficiency. Technique is the way of performing that fundamental skill/activity in sport involving a well-timed and coordinated sequence of muscle actions so that the movements involved produce the best performance and are least likely to cause injury. Style, on the other hand, is the individual's way of adapting skill and technique to develop his/her performance in a smartway. Skill Skill is the fundamental ability that enables an individual to perform a large movement with correct technique. It comprises a whole movement of motor action, the ease of which is the result of long hours of practice. Skill is, thus, the result of repetitive practice to get automatisation of movement, by which a performer spends the least energy on are quired task. If an athlete requires a great effort, or struggles to perform any activity, then, it clearly indicates that there is a lack of skill efficiency in the task. In simple words, a motor action which is performed smoothly, with the least error is called skill. Champions possess this quality of movement that enables them to them produce graceful movement with minimum effort. Skills which are complex in nature can be learned or performed more easily, if the different elements of the movement can be separated and adapted through \"learning-by-parts\" method. Once mastered, the \"parts\" may be combined to perform the whole skill. With practice, the movement or motor action of an athlete become accurate and sometimes even automatic. Do you know? Anders Ericsson, a psychologist, writes that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. In other words, an athlete training for 5 hours a day, for 7 days a week over 365 days anyear would take about 5.5 years to acquire expertise in her/his chosen sport or game. Tec hnique Technique is the mechanical model of doing any task through which an athlete minimises his energy expenditure and produces remarkable output. It involves a well- timed and coordinated sequence of muscle actions which have been developed through the experience of players, coaches and the analysis provided by sports science. These techniques have evolved and been refined so that the movements involved 10.4.1 SKILL, TECHNIQUE AND STYLE 295 produce the best performance and are least likely to cause injury. Using good technique in sport is beneficial because it promotes high performance and reduces the risk of injury. \"Technique is an imaginary model of performing any task in cyclic manner which is ideally based on scientific principles to attain effective movement in sports with least energy expenditure.\" e.g.,in cricket, a batsman should play the ball with a straight bat, aiming to connect the ball with the middle of the bat for a sound drive. Or, in ice or roller skating, athletes need to bend their body to keeping the central of gravity (COG) lower for efficient and effective balance andspeed. Study the picture below, where the player demonstrates correct batting stance and technique. Style Style is the unique ability of an athlete to perfor many activity in his/her own distinctive manner according to his/her individual technique and ability. It may or may not have a scientific basis. It is just the way the player adapts the movement according to his/her anatomical structure or other factors, and performs it in a unique manner. This unique technique becomes \"style\". Thus, style is a particular movement started by some one as an innovation, and if the movement becomes popular, it comes to be known after the athlete. e.g., in cricket, M S Dhoni's \"helicopter shot\" has become his style. The popular Parry O'Brien style of shotput is named after the American athlete, Parry O'Brien. Similarly, in high jump, American athlete, Dick Fosbury, has given his name to the Fosbury flop. MS Dhoni ParryO'Brien DickFosbury 296 Skill Technique Style Meaning Skill refers to the whole movement of motoraction.A mechanical model of doing any task in sequential way based upon scientific principle. It requires practice of particular task scientifically.A personalised way of performing any task (signature step). A player's/ athlete's own expression of presenting the technique Example - Cricket Batting is askill. Foot movement, back foot defence, covers shot, straight drive etc are different techniques of playing shots.Each individual has an imaginary model in his/her mind about batting technique, but they all act differently because of individual differences. e.g., MS Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar have their own style of foot movement while playing drives Example - Basketball Shooting is askill Lay-up shot is holding the ball in hand and taking one or two step towards the basket with jump to attempt basket.different players have unique style of performing it. Like dunk shot is a style in it. Sk ill, technique and style all are inter-related as technique and style are a part of skill. In fact, Skill = Technique + Style Acquiring style is a long and continuous process in which a player sets an imaginary mechanical model in his/her mind for performing any skill. Then, through repeated practise he/she adapts the skill in his/her unique style. In the initial phase of learning the technique, an athlete may make many mistakes. However, through practise and proper supervision bycoach or teacher, these errors are minimised. Thereafter, a player is able to learn and execute that particular technique in his own style with least energy and error. An athlete can perform at his best if he follows the complete process of skill acquisition by interlinking skill, technique and style. 297 I. Tick the correct answer. 1. Style is i. a mechanical model of doing anything ii. a unique, personalised expression iii. an automatisation of movement iv. a natural ability for a particular game 2. In basketball, shooting is required to score goals. Shooting is a i. technique ii. style iii. skill iv. tactic II. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. Define Technique. 2. How they are Skill and Techniques inter-related to each other? 3. Elucidate style in brief. III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. Doping in sports is not a new phenomenon; it goes as far back as the first Olympic Games in ancient Olympia. Since the inception of the competition in 776 BC, historians have written about use of performance-enhancing substances. There were experts who offered nutritional components to athletes in order to provide them an advantage over their competitors. Athletes in those times took herbal infusions to increase their muscle mass etc. Increasing performance by taking mushrooms and opium was also a very common method in those days. In 100AD Roman gladiators used stimulants and hallucinogens to delay fatigue and to prevent injuries. Do you know? Doping was punished even in ancient times. If athletes were caught cheating, they were banned from the games and their names were often engraved into stone and placed in a pathway that led to the stadium. To this day, stone pedestals line the entranceway to the Olympic stadium in Olympia, Greece, site of the ancient Olympics (776 BC-394 AD). Inscribed on each pedestal is the offending athlete's name, his wrong doing, and the names of family member. Si milarly, in modern times athletes use various techniques to get a winning edge over their competitors. In the late 19thcentury, French cyclists and lacrosse players took wine and coca leaves - source of cocaine andrelatedalkaloids-tocounter fatigue. Vin Mariani was even called \"the wine for athletes\" as it is a fusion of wine and coca leaves. 10.5.1 DOPING 298 Do you know? In Modern Olympics, the first case of doping came to light in 1904 when runner Thomas Hicks collapsed after winning the marathon and nearlydied.Itwas later found that he was using a blend of brandy and strychnine (a stimulant). The use of a mixture of strychnine, heroin, cocaine and caffeine in various proportions was a common practice until 1920 when heroin and cocaine became available only by prescription. In 1960 Summer Olympic Games, heldin Rome, Knut Jensen, the Danishcyclist, diedand traces of an amphetamine known as Ronicol was found in the autopsy. In 1967, British cyclist, Tommy Simpson, consumed excess of amphetamines and brandy to fight the effects of an illness. Simpson collapsed and died during the race at the age of 29. In 1928, IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federation) became the first governing body to prohibit doping. Later in 1967, after the much-hyped death of Tommy Simpson, the IOC (International Olympic Committee) established a commission for anti-doping. As a result, the first doping test was done in 19 68 Winter Olympics. In 1988, the Canadian sprinter, Ben Johns on was stripped off his gold medal at the Olympic Games in Seouland suspended for two years initially after he was found positive for an anabolic steroid called stanozolol. Later, he was banned for life after testing positive for the second time in 1993. In the year 1999, World Anti- Doping Agency was established as an independent international anti-doping agency to be fully operational for Sydney Olympics 2000.The list of athletes who indulged in doping isavast one after that. Famous athletes who were found guilty include Lance Armstrong, Marion Jones, Maria Sharapova, Martina Hingis, Tyson Gay, Diego Maradona, Carl Lewis, Shane Warne, Michael Phelps among others. Doping in sports is a critical issue putting an athlete's health at risk, maligning the integrity of clean athletes and damaging the spirit of sports. Doping can be defined as the use of a substance or technique to enhance the sports performance illegally. 299 It is a deliberate attempt by an athlete towin at any cost, even if it is by using life threatening substances or methods. International Olympic Committee defined doping as \"the use of any method or substance that might harm the athlete, in a quest to gain an unfair advantage, over his/her fellow competitors.\" In other words, it can be said that doping is the use of such substances or methods that are custom-made to increase the abilities of an athlete, bothphysical and mental, and/or to cover the use of such substances while intraining. According to World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) REFERNCE YEAR, \"Doping is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the anti-doping rule violations set forth in Article 2.1 through Article 2.8 of the anti-doping code. These are as follows: I. Presence of a prohibited substance or method. II. Use or attempt to use a prohibited substance ormethod. III. Refusing to submit sample collection after beingnotified. IV. Failure to file athlete's whereabouts after beingnotified. V. Tampering with any part of the doping control process. VI. Possession of a prohibited substance or method. VII. Trafficking a prohibited substance or method. VIII. Administering or attempting to administer a prohibited substance or method to an athlete. Thus, according to the anti-doping code, it is clear that doping is not only about using a prohibited substance or method to improve performance, but also about breaking any of the rule(s) listed by WADA. Doping can be classified into two major categories. 1. Performance Enhancing Substances : These are the drugs or medicines that can be used to enhance athletic performance. Some of the examples of performance enhancing substances are anabolic steroids, stimulants, narcotics etc. 2. Physical Methods : These are the techniques used by athletes to increase the performance by unfairmeans. The seme thods include blood doping, genedoping and chemical physical manipulation.10.5.2 CLASSFIFICATION OF DOPING 300 I. Ti ck the correct answers. 1.

In which Olympic Games, was the doping test first done by IOC under the Anti Doping Agency Campaign? i. 1960 Summer Olympic Game ii. 1960 Winter Olympic Games iii. 1968 Summer Olympic Game iv. 1968 Winter Olympic Game II. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. Of the eight athletes in the 1988 Olympic 100 metres final, only two were not disqualified. Why? 2. Is doping only about using a prohibited substance or is it a method to improve performance? Comment. 3. Enlist any three (WADA) Anti-Doping Codes which are mentioned in Articles 2.1 to 2.8. 4. Classify the methods of doping in brief. III. Answer the following questions in 150-200 words. 1. Doping at the Olympics is not a new phenomenon.Discuss. 2. Compare the substances used for doping in ancient times with those used in the modernera. 3. Has doping become a critical issue in sports? Explain the role of WADA in controlling doping. 4. List the rules laid down by WADA in the anti-dopingcode. 302 Extension Activity Survey of Doping in Sports. Talk to at least 15 sportspersons or athletes from your school, or a nearby school. You could also talk to persons who regularly go to a Gym for a workout. Fill up the following questionnaire. No Don't know Maybe Proba bly Yes Do you think doping is necessary to achieve the best results? Does anyone you know use performance enhancing drugs? Are you aware of the substances you cannot use in competitions? Do you think your performance would improve by banned substances? Have you ever tried any banned substances to improve performance? Are you aware of the side effects of doping? Is the NADA doping test available for the tournaments/competitions you participate in? According to you who recommends performance enhancing drugs toplayers? Have you felt a pressure to use banned substances? Based on the survey above, and your own ideas, make a PPT on Sports. Pr ohibited substances are the drugs, supplements andother techniques which are banned from use in sports as these might enhance the performance of the players through use of unfair means. World Anti-Doping Association (WADA) is responsible for regulating the consumption or use of these substances or methods worldwide. Every year WADA updates and publishes a prohibited items list, which is the paradigm that outlines the substances that are prohibited in sports. A substance or method is added in the list if it enhances sports performance; it damages the athlete's health; violates spirit of sports.10.6.1 WHAT ARE PROHIBITED SUBSATNCES 303 Do you know? There are certain substances and methods that are prohibited only during the competition period whereas others depend on the technique or method of imbibing the substance like inhalation, taking tablets or injection. If an athlete is taking any such substance for medicinal purpose, he must apply to the International Federation of the concerned sport for exemption. Also, it must be verified by the physician on the following basis: The athlete would face critical health problems if he does not take such drug or substance. There is no appropriate alternative for that drug. There is no significant enhancement of the sports performance due to taking that drug. Extension Activity Look at the pictures of some athletes who have been disqualified for taking Performance Enhancing Drugs (PED). Find out the sport they participated in. what drugs they took and why. for how long were they banned. Lance Armstrong Maria Sharapova Tyson Gay 304 Diego Maradona Anderson Silva Ben Johnson Shoaib Akhtar S hane Warne Kunjarani Devi Substances Prohibited In and Out of the Competition Methods Prohibited In and Out of the Competition Substances Prohibited During Competition Substances Prohibited in Particular Sports Anabolic Steroids Peptide Hormones Beta -2 Agonists Diuretic Hormones GlucocorticosteroidsBeta Blockers 1. Ana bolic Steroids are synthetic human made variations of the male sex hormone that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurallydesigned to provide similar effects. Anabolic steroids are used to increase muscle mass, performance and endurance and to reduce recovery time in between the training sessions. 10.6.2 PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES AND SIDE EFFECTS 305 2. Peptide hormones such as erythropoietin, human growth hormone (HGH), insulin, human chorionic gonadotropin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are the substances produced by the various glands and when circulated by blood can affect organs and tissues to alter bodily functions. These are banned because they can stimulate various bodily functions such as growth rate and sensitivity to pain. They stimulate the production of naturally occurring hormones, increase strength and production of red blood cells, therefore, increasing oxygen carrying capacity that results in improving endurance level of an athlete. 3. Beta 2 Agonists are majorly used for medicinal purposes for treating asthma because they open up the bronchial tubes of the lungs and hence clear the air passage. In sports, they are used for improving the breathing by relaxing the muscles around air passages and thus widening them. Athletes take these to boost their respiratory functions. They also accelerate the will to win insports. 4. Diuretics help athletes by increasing excretion of water from the body. They are also known as \"water pills\" as they increase production of urine. Athletes use diuretics to flushout the remains from steroids and to facilitate temporary weight loss by shedding water from the body. They are majorly used in sports such as boxing, wrestling, weightlifting etc. 5. Hormones and Metabolic Modulators are used to alter the effects of hormones or to quicken or slow down certain enzyme function such as supressing the conversion of male sex hormone (testosterone) into female sex hormone (estrogen), there by helping in building muscle mass. 6. Stimulants are also known as \"uppers\" as they enhance sports performance by stimulating the mind and body artificially. They basically increase the activities of Central NervousSystem(CNS)resulting in improved alertness, reaction time and energy. Some of the most commonly used stimulants are cocaine, amphetamines etc. These are taken by either swallowing in tablet form or injecting in liquid formor, they may even be,crushed and snorted. 306 7. N arcotics was at ermoriginally used to refer to any psychoactive compound with sleep inducing properties and used for medical purposes. In sports, when used in small amounts, narcotics may result in relieving severe pain. However, overdose can result in respiratory problems and even death. 8. Cannabinoids are a class of diverse chemical compounds that alter neurotransmitter release in the brain. They help in reducing anxiety, leading to a feeling of relaxation and decreasing pain sensation. The most common example of a cannabinoid is Marijuana. 9. Glucocortic osteroids are majorly used for treating allergies, asthma, skin disorders and inflammatory conditions and other such ailments. In sports, these are primarily used as pain relievers and to improve the pain threshold of an athlete. Substance Side effects Anabolic Steroids Continuous use of anabolic steroids may result in serious health issues. Anabolic steroids elevate blood pressure reduce high density lipoprotein(HDL) lead to several cardio vascular diseases like atherosclerosis and may even result in a cardiacattack increase aggressiveness, sexual desire and may lead to criminal behaviour cause jaundice, liver tumour andcancer. lead to mood swings, depression, withdrawal symptoms and dependence onothers Peptide Hormones Use of peptide hormones may lead to blood clots due to increased blood viscosity increased risk of heart attack overgrowth of limbs and face musculo-skeletal enlargement low blood sugar levels shortness of breath brain damage and death headache and joint pain ulcer, cataract and osteoporosis Beta 2 Agonists Prolonged use of Beta 2 Agonists may result in 10.6.3 SIDE EFFECTS OF PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES 307 increased risk of cardiac arrest trembling (specially in hands) headache palpitations muscle cramps Diuretics Side effects of diuretics may vary from mild to severe. Some of these effects include headache dizziness too little or too much potassium inblood diarrhoea unusual thirst and dehydration muscle cramps kidney failure increased cholesterol and bloodsugar irregular heart beat skin rashes Hormones and Metabolic Modulators Use of hormones and metabolic modulators may cause cardiac problems osteoporosis abnormal vaginal bleeding shortness of breath hotflashes swelling/numbness anxiety rapidheartbeat moodswings blurryvision loss of consciousness, if severe can lead tocoma. Stimulants The side effects of using stimulants include exhaustion addiction increased heart rate and palpitation irregular heartbeat hypertension heartfailure308 headache upsetstomach anxiety and insomnia depression Narcotics Use of narcotics may result in nausea and vomiting drowsiness constipation failing to recognize injury due to increased pain threshold increased heartrate physical and psychological dependence leading toaddiction hallucination Cannabinoids Cannabinoids lead to increased risk of heart diseases lung cancer impaired memory decreased concentration respiratory issues increased heart rate poor coordination and reaction of reflexes moods wings distorted sense of space and time Glucocorticosteroid Prolonged use may lead to loss of muscle mass weakening of injured area decreased rate of growth in young people. Beta blockers Prolonged use of Beta Blockers may result in increased stress on heart blood clotting stroke309 1. Bl ood Doping is an attempt to enhance sports performance by infusing oxygenated blood into an athlete before an event. This leads to increased red blood cell count resulting in higher oxygen carrying capacity and thus, improving endurance. The two basic types of blood transfusion are Autologous : The athlete's own blood, which was drawn and stored for future use is transfused. Homologous: An athlete is transfused with someone else's blood of the same blood group. Injections: Other examples of blood doping include Erythropoietin injections and injections of Synthetic Oxygen Carriers. Side effects of Blood doping: Increased risk of bloodclots Stroke HIV/AIDS HepatitisB Various Allergies Hypertension Do you know? 10.6.4 METHODS OF IMBIBING PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES 310 Do you know? 2. Gene Doping is the practise of transferring genes, or genetically altered cells, into an athlete as a possible method of enhancing sporting performance. It plays a vital role in the growth and development of musculo-skeletal structure. Side effects of Gene Doping: Heart failure Cancer Leukemia Immune Dysfunction 3. Chemical and Physical Manipulation include stampe ring or attempt to tamper the integrity or validity of the samples collected during doping control procedure. Also, intravenous injections of more than 100 ml per 12 hours are prohibited. The only exceptionis, if the athlete is dependent on the drug for medical treatment. Side effects of chemical and physical manipulation : Infection in urethra, bladder or kidney Cardiac Issues Chronic Systemic Inflammation Hepatitis HIV/AIDS 311 I. Tick the correct option. 1.

Comment on how harmful doping is for health. 3. Explain any two doping Steroids. Mention five side effects of each. 312 A ce Substance abuse refers to the injurious use of psychoactive substances including alcohol and illegal drugs, or other such substances as are harmful to the individual himself/ herself or others. Abuse results when a person uses a substance in a way that is not recommended, or uses more than the prescribed amount. In other words, it can be said that a person canuse a substance and still not be addicted. Substance abuse interferes with every facet of life. Drug and alcohol abuse affect an individual's health,work and social relationships. The person who uses drugs hurts people around him emotionally, or even physically. Thus,substance abuse can wreck relations and financial health. Substance abuse often leads to addiction and causes serious health issues, even death. Do you know? psychoactive substan is a substance that changes brain function and results in alterations in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, or behaviour. These substances include caffeine, alcohol, cocaine, LSD, nicotine andcannabis. Classes of drugs frequently used recreationally include: Stimulants, which activate the central nervous system. These are used recreationally for their euphoric effects. Some categories of psychoactive drugs are prescribed by physicians and other healthcare practitioners. e.g., anesthetics, analgesics, anticonvulsant, anti depressants, and stimulant medications. Some psychoactive substances may be used in the detoxification and rehabilitation Programmes for persons dependent on or addicted to other psychoactive drugs. Addiction is a maladaptive pattern of using any substance in a harmful way. Therefore, substance use is considered to be substance abuse when the repeated use results in Healthissues disabilities failure to meet responsibilities impaired control riskyuse socialissues Most commonly abused substances are: alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, tobacco, heroin etc. Signs and symptoms of substance abuse include increased confusion memory impairment moods wings sleeping disorders weakness orfatigue abnormal blood results anaemia dizziness severe nervedamage dementia depression Some psychoactive drugs may have actual performance-enhancing side effects in the short- term. However, many actually decrease performance, primarily because of 10.7.3 DEALING WITH ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE 10.7.2 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE 10.7.1 ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCES ABUSE 313 adverse cardiovascular effects and impaired judgment. Athletes and nonathletes alike may be knowingly or unknowingly exposed to psychoactive substances if they use over-the-counter, recreational, or prescription drugs. Psychoactive substances often bring about subjective changes in consciousness and mood that the user may find rewarding and pleasant, e.g., euphoria or a sense of relaxation, or advantageous, e.g., increased alertness and are thusreinforcing. Substances which are both rewarding and positively reinforcing have the potential to induce a state of addiction - compulsive drug use despite negative consequences. Substance abuse can be life threatening if not controlled in time. Therefore, it is important to monitor a person's behaviour for the signs mentioned above. In order to deal with alcohol and substance abuse, National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) maintains a list of principles of effective treatment and management.
