Levy, who has learned origami from books, included one of the folds in his thank you letter. \"These were all from single squares of paper without cutting,\" Levy said as he described the pieces displayed on the table. \"Sometimes, when you've been working on a complicated fold for a while it can be frustrating, but when you complete one, that's a "}
