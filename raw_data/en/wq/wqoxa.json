DISCU SSIO N The Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction to review the record of the proceedings before a special master, and upon such review, may: (A) uphold the f indings of f act and conclusions of law of the spec ial master a nd sustain the specia l master's de cision, (B) set aside any finding s of fa ct or c onclusion of law of the spec ial master f ound to be ar bitrary , capr icious, an abuse of discre tion, or otherwise not in ac corda nce with law and issue its own finding s of fa ct and c onclusions of law, or (C) remand the petition to the special master for further action in accordance with the cour t's direc tion. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2). In the case, pursuant to Vaccine Rule 24(a) , seven obje ctions to the special maste r's de cision:12 1.The Use of a Pane l of Thre e Specia l Masters to Hea r the \" Gene ral Causa tion\" Issue in Colten's Case Was Arbitrar y, Capricious, an A buse of Disc retion, and Not in Accordance With the Law; 2.The Spec ial Masters' Decision to All ow the L ast-Minute Expert Reports and Testimony of Dr. Stephe n Bustin Was Arbitrar y, Capricious, and a n Abuse of Discretion; 3.The Spec ial Master A bused He r Discr etion by Ignoring Concessions by the Respondent's Expert Witn esses; -7-4.The Spec ial Master A bused He r Discr etion by Simpl y Ignoring Other Important Aspects of Petitioner[s'] Evidence; 5.The Spec ial Master A bused He r Discr etion by Failing to Require T hat Dr. Rima Disclose Under lying D ata and Fa cts Concer ning H is Opinions About the Reliability of the Unigenetics Laboratory; 6.The Spec ial Master A bused He r Discr etion by Refusing to Consider Significa nt Post -Hearing Evidence ; and 7.The Spec ial Master' s Dec ision W as Not in Acc ordanc e With the L aw.

Before turning to petitioners' numbere d objections, howeve r, the c ourt discusses the role of specia l masters under the Vac cine Ac t, an issue implicated throug hout numbere d objections and finally conclude s with some comments conce rning the complaints lodg ed by petitioners outside of the c onfines of their numbered objections. A. Role of Sp ecial Mast ers As mentioned above , sever al of pe titioners' objections to the spec ial master' s decision implicate the role of special masters in conducting proceedings and rendering decisions in Vaccine Ac t case s. There fore, a discussion of their r ole is warr anted. Cong ress, in cr eating the National Va Injury Compensation Progr am (\" Vaccine Prog ram\" ), intended to a ddress \" per spective as we ll as vacc ine manufacturers-of the current approach to compensating those who have been damaged by a vaccine . . . .\" H.R. Rep. No. 99- 908, at 7 (1986); a ccord id. at 12 (noting the twin g oals of compensa ting those injure d by vacc ines without resort to a f ull-fledg ed tort sy stem and decreasing the number of lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers). Thus, in the Vaccine Act, it crafted \"a Federal 'no-fault' compensation program un der which awards can be made to vaccine-injured pe rsons quickly , easily , and with ce rtainty and g enerosity .\" Id. at 1. To accomplish t hese a ims, Congre ss set forth a pr ocedur e in the Va ccine Act to dec ide claims that placed special masters on the front lines: (2) A special master shall serve as an adjunct to the court and may - (A) r equire such evide nce a s may be appr opriate f or the pre paration of proposed f indings of f act and conclusions of law with respec t to whether compensa tion is t o be provide d under the Prog ram a nd the amount of a ny such compensa tion, Although Cong ress did not initially specify in the Vac cine Ac t that this section applied13 to the special masters, see \u00a7 311(a), 100 Stat. at 3763 (limiting the application of the section to \"the court\"), it soon amended the Vaccine Act to reflect the fact that this section also applied to specia l masters, see Omnibus Budg et Reconc iliation Act 1989, Pub. 6601(j)(1) , U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(b) (1) (2006)). -8-(B) require the submission of such informa tion as may be re asonable and necessary to determine if the petitioner is entitled to compensation, (C) re quire the te stimony of any person a nd the produc tion of any document as may be reasonable and necessary to determine if the petitioner is entitled to compensa tion, (D) c onduct such he aring s as may be appr opriate, a nd (E) pr epare and submit to the court pr oposed finding s of fa ct and c onclusions of law. . . . discove ry in a proc eeding on a petition other than the discovery require d under this par agraph. Pub. L . No. a t 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(3)(A)-(B) (2006)). In the House Report for the underlying bill, Congress explained that beca use it expected a spe cial master \"to be vig orous and dilig ent in investiga ting factual elements necessary to determine the validity of the petitioner's claim,\" discovery would be at the \" prerogative\" of the spec ial master a nd neither pa rty was pe rmitted to \"cross- examine witnesses, file inter rogatories, or take de positions.\" H.R. Rep. No. 99-908, at 14-15. Congress also specified in the Vaccine Act what matters the special master should consider in r ender ing a decision on a pe tition:13 (1) I n deter mining whe ther to aw ard c ompensation to a petitioner unde r the Prog ram, the c ourt shall consider, in a ddition to all ot her releva nt medical and scientific e vidence contained in the r ecord - (A) a ny diag nosis, conclusion, medical judg ment, or autopsy or cor oner' s repor t which is contained in the r ecord reg arding the nature , causa tion, and aggravation of the petitioner's illness, disability , injury , condition, or dea th, and (B) the re sults of any diag nostic or eva luative test which a re contained in the record and the summaries and c onclusions. -9-Any such diagnosis, conclusion, judgment, test result, report, or summ ary shall not be binding on the court. I n evalua ting the w eight to be aff orded to a ny such diagnosis, conclusion, judgment, test result, report, or summ ary, the court shall consider the entire r ecord and the c ourse of the injury , disability , illness, or condition until the date of the judgment of the court. Id. at 3763 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(b)(1) (2006)). Co ngress elaborated in the House Repor t that special master s should \"exercise [their] best judgment in eva luating whether the re sa tisfies the requir ements for compensa tion.\" H.R. Rep. a In 1988, Congr ess amende d the Vac cine Ac t to require, a s opposed to permit, specia l masters to \"pr epare and submit to the court pr oposed finding s of fa ct and c onclusions of law.\" Medica re Cata strophic 100-360, \u00a7 411(o) (3), 102 Stat. 683, 808. Then, in its comprehensive amendment of the Vaccine Act in 1989, Congress formally established the OSM and reiterated the special masters' duties: (3)(A) A spe cial master to whom a petition has bee n assig ned shall issue a decision on such pe tition wit h respe ct to whether compensa tion is t o be provide d under the Prog ram a nd the amount of such c ompensation. The de cision of the special master shall- (i) include f indings of f act and eeding on a petition a spec ial master- (i) may require such evidence as may be reasonable and necessary, (ii) may require the submission of such information as may be re asonable and necessary, (iii) may require the testimony of any person a nd the produc tion of any documents as may be reasonable and necessary, (iv) shall af ford a ll interested per sons an opportunity to submit relevant written informa tion- (I) relating to the e xistence of \u00a7 relating a ny alleg ation in a petition with respec t to nd-10-(v) may conduct such hearings as may be reasonable and necessary. There may be no discove ry in a proc eeding on a petition other than the discovery require d by the spec ial master. Omnibus Budg et Reconc iliation Act of 1989 the proce eding s befor e a specia l master in the Confer ence Report for the underly ing bill: \"The system is intended to allow the proceedings to be conducted in what has come to be known as an 'inquisitorial' format, with the master c onducting discovery (as ne No. 101-386, at 87 (1989) (Conf. Rep.). To cement the importance of the role it intended special masters to perform, C ongress added teeth to the special masters' decisions, providing that the United States Claims Court (\"Claims Court\"), the pre decessor of the Court of Federal Cla ims, could set aside a special master's findings of fact or conclusions of law only if they were arbitrary , capr icious, an abuse of discre tion, or otherwise not in ac corda nce w ith law. Omnibus Budg et Reconc iliation Act of 1989 intentionally \"provide d for a limit ed standa rd for appea l from the maste r's de cision\" and tha t it did \"not int end that this proce dure be used fr equently but rathe r in those ca ses in which a tr uly arbitra ry decision has be en made .\" H.R. Rep. No. 101- 386, at 87. Also among the 1989 amendme nts to the Vacc ine Act wa s a provision requir ing the Claims C ourt to promulga te rules g overning proce eding s on vacc ine petitions consistent with the purposes of the Vaccine Program: (2) The specia l masters shall re commend rule s to the Claims C ourt and, taking into account suc h rec ommended rule s, the Claims Court shall promul gate rules pursuant to section 2071 of title 28, United States Code. Such rules shall- (A) pr ovide for a less-adve rsarial, expeditious , and informa l proce eding for the resolution of petitions, (B) include f lexible and infor mal standards of admissibili ty of evide nce, (C) include the opportunity for summ ary judgment, (D) inc lude the opportunity for pa rties to submit arg uments and evide nce on the record without requiring routine use of oral presentations, cross examinations, or hearing s, and This was the sec ond set of rule s promulga ted by the Claims Court for Vac cine Prog ram14 cases. The first set of rules, date d Januar y 25, 1989, was c riticized by Congr ess as too for mal. See H.R. Rep. No. 101-386, at 84 (\"The Claims Court has issued rules for vaccine proceedings that forc e proc eeding s to be forma l and that virtually foreclose a ny opportunity for pe titioners or responde nts to procee d without lit igators at their sides.\" ); accord id. a t 86. -11-(E) provide for limitations on discovery and allow the special masters to replace the usual rules of discovery in civil actions in the United States Claims Court. Omnibus Budg et Reconc iliation Act of 1989 \u00a7 6601(g \u00a7 300aa- 12(d)( 2) (2006) ). The Claims Court complied with this di rective on Marc h 15, 1991. See Rules of the14 United States Claims Cou rt, App. J, 2 2 Cl. Ct. XXXIX, CXLVIII-CLX (1991). Vaccine Rule 3(b) set forth the duties of the special masters: The spec ial master sha ll be responsible for conducting all proce eding s, including requiring such evide nce a s may be appr opriate, in orde r to prepa re a decision, including f indings of f act and conclusions of law , deter mining whe ther a n awa rd of compe nsation should be made unde r the Va ccine Act and the amount of any such award.

Vaccine Rule 7 re iterate d that there would be \"no disc overy as a ma tter of r ight,\" and provide d: (a) Informal Disc overy Prefe rred. The infor mal and coope rative e xchang e of information is the ordinar y and pre ferred pr actice . (b) F ormal Discove ry.

Suc h a motion may also be made orally at a status confe rence. (c) Subpoena. When nec essar y, the spec ial master upon r equest by a par ty may instruct the cler k . . . to issue a subpoena for the ta king of a deposition with or without the production of docume nts. -12-Vaccine Rule 8 governed the taking of evidence and argument: (a) Gene ral. The specia l master in ea ch ca se, base d on the spec ific circ umstances there of, shall deter mine the forma t for taking evidenc e and he aring argument. The particular format for each case will be ordered after consultation with the parties. (b) Evide nce.

When nece ssary , the spec ial master may conduct a n evidentiar y hearing. T he spec ial master will deter mine the forma t for such a hear ing. T he specia l master may permit testimony at such a hear ing via telephone. T he spec ial master may permit direc t examination of a witness or may permit or re quire that the direc t testimony be submitted in written form. The specia l master may question a witness and ma y, on reque st, permit questioning by opposing c ounsel. The clerk, on request, may issue a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at such hearing. The re maining V accine Rules cra fted by the Claims Court, while providing a framework f or Vaccine Program proceedings, did not directly implicate the broad role of the special masters. For example, Congre ss has amende d the Vac cine Ac t to introduce a pr ovision for15 suspending proce eding s, to chang e the c ompensation provision, and to expand the scope of compensa ble injuries. See, e .g., Children's Hea lth Act of 2000, Pub. L . No. 106-310, \u00a7 1701, 114 Stat. Vac cine I njury Compensation Amendments of 1991, Pub. L . No. 102- 168, tit.

On May 1, 2002, the Court17 of Federal Claims adopted a r evised set of Vaccine Rules, lea ving the substance of Vaccine Rules 3, 7, and 8 intact while making minor chang es to the three rules and r earranging the order of the subsec tions in Vaccine Rule 8. The Court of F ederal Claims amended the V accine Rules in 2003, 2005, and 2006, but did not make any chang es to these pa rticular r ules. As noted above , the Vaccine Rules were recently restyled, but Vaccine Rules 3, 7, and 8 were not otherwise altere d. -13-Although the Vaccine Ac t has bee n amende d on numerous occ asions since 1989, at no15 time did Con gress substantively disturb the provisions of the Vaccine Act that describe the role of spec ial masters in the no appre ciable c hang e to the substance of the16 Vaccine Rules conc erning the role of specia l masters. Given these two deca des of c onsistency17 in the rele vant provisions of the Va ccine Act and the Vaccine Rules, it is unsurprising tha t the United States Court of Appea ls for the F ederal Circuit (\"F ederal Circuit\") a nd the Court of Federal Claims have repe atedly recognized the significa nce of specia l masters in the Va ccine Prog ram. As ea rly as 1991, the F Circuit acknow ledged the c ongressionally mandated of eview a ccorded dec isions of the special maste rs, noting tha t \"[i] f the specia l master has c onsidered the relevant evidenc e of r ecord, draw n plausible infer ences and articulated a rational basis for the decision, reversible error will be extremely difficult to demonstrate.\" Hines ex rel. Sevier v. Sec 'y of HHS, 940 F .2d 1518, 1528 (F ed. Cir. 1991). Indeed, he ld the Fe deral Circuit, \"arg uments as hing of evidenc e, par ticularly wher e, as her e, witness cr edibility is involved, do not demonstrate re versible e rror.\" Id. at 1527. The following year, the Fe deral Circuit ag ain ac knowledg ed the \" great defe rence\" ow ed the spe cial master's findings and conclusions by a reviewing court, recognizing that \"[w]it h regard to both Prior decisions of the Court of F ederal Claims, \"while per suasive, do not set binding18 precedent f or sepa rate and distinct case s\" in the Court of F ederal Claims. W . Coast Gen. Corp. v. Dalton, 39 F.3d 312, 315 ( Fed. Cir. 1994). -14-fact-finding s and fa ct-ba sed conc lusions, the key decision make r in the first instance is the special master.\" Mu nn v. Sec'y of HHS, 970 F.2d 863, 870-71 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Moreover, it emphasized that \"the pr obative value of the e vidence \" and \" the cr edibility of the witnesse s\" we re within the special master 's purview as fa ct finder . Id. at 871. ederal of defe rence applicable to special master s has re mained consta nt. For e xample, in B radle y ex rel. Br adley v. Secretary of HHS, it noted that the special master, as fact finder, had \"broad discretion in deter mining cr edibility beca use [the special master ] saw the witnesses and he ard the testimony .\" 991 F.2d 1570, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Similarly, in Burns, by Burns v. Secretary of HHS, it noted both that a spec ial master \" had wide disc retion in conduc ting the pr oceedings in a case \" and that cr edibility deter minations were \" uniquely within the purview of the specia l master.\" 3 F.3d 415, 417 ( Fed. Cir. 1993). I n Hodg es v. Secr etary of HHS, the F ederal Circuit explained: Congr assig ned to a g roup of spe cialists, the Special Master s within the Court of Fe deral Claims, t he unenvia ble job of sorting throug h these pa inful case s and, base d upon their ac cumulated e xpertise in the f ield, judging the merits of the individual claims. The statute make s clea r that, on re view, the Court of F ederal Claims is not to second guess the Special Master[']s fact-intensive conclusions; the standar d of re view is uniquely defe rential for what is essentially a judicial proce ss. . . . That level of de ference is especia lly apt in a ca se in which the medical e vidence of ca usation is in dis pute. 9 F.3d 958, 961 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The deference standard was reiterated by the Federal Circuit in Whit ecotton, by Whit ecotton v. Secr etary of HHS in its remark tha t \"Cong ress de sired the spe cial masters to have very wide discre tion with respect to the e vidence they would consider a nd the weig ht to 81 F.3d 1099, 1108 ( Fed. Cir. 1996). And, in L ampe v. Secretary of HHS, it concluded that \"[t]he arbitrary and capricious standard of review is difficult for an appellant to satisfy with respec t to any issue, but particular ly with respec t to an issue that turns on the weig hing of evidenc e by the trier of fact.\" 219 F.3d 1357, 1360 ( Fed. Cir. 2000). The pivotal role pla yed by the spec ial masters ha s also been r ecognized by the Court of Federal Claims. In Sharpnac k by & T hroug h Sharpnac k v. Secre tary of HHS, the c ourt18 recognized both the \"unique role of the spec ial master in the [Vac cine] Progr am\" a nd the deference owe d to the specia l masters' de cisions. 27 Fed. Cl. 457, 459 (1993) . Thus, it held that specia l masters had the \"discre tion to evaluate the utility of\" a particula r piec e of e vidence \"diffe rently in the light of a ll facts re levant in a spe cific c laim,\" conc luding [s]uch t he ana lyses of the spe cial master s are within [ Vaccine] Progr am ds.\" I d. at 461. In Ultimo, by Ultimo v. Secretary of HHS, the court noted that weight and credibility Although the responde nt in all Vacc ine Act c ases is the Sec retary of the De partment of19 and Human Servic 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa- 12(b)( 1), the re spondent in Sword is identified as the United States. -15-deter minations are within the provinc e of the specia l masters as f act finders and w ere, there fore, \"'virtua lly unrevie wable.' \" 28 F ed. Cl. 148, 151 (1993) (quoting Hambsch v. D ep't of the Treasury, 796 F.2d 430, 436 ( Fed. Cir. 1986)); ac cord id. (\" Simpl y beca use a w itness is found qualified to testify as an e xpert doe s not mean that the trier of fa ct must acc ept his testimony .\"); Epstein ex rel. Epstein v. Sec'y of HHS, 35 F ed. Cl. 467 (1996) (r eitera ting that \" a dete rmination of credibility is uniquely within the discretion of the special master\"). It also remarked that it was \" incumbent\" upon the spe cial master to \"apply his body of knowledg e . . . to the re solution of ccine Act ca ses . . . .\" Ultimo, 28 Fe d. I n Lankfor d v. Secre tary of HHS, the court c oncluded: [A] de cision that reflects a reasoned evaluation of the evidence and that is otherwise f ree of leg al error cannot be ove rturned. We ha ve such a decision her e. The spec ial master c onfronted the task of choosing betwee n two competing expert opinions by articula ting a reasoned basis-dra wn from the e vidence -for pr eferring one over the other. N o more c an be de manded. 37 Fe d. Cl. 723, 727 (1996) (citation omitted). Several years later, in Sword v. United States, the court expou nded in detail on the role19 of special masters: As fac t-finder s, Special Master s, like juries, are often fa ced w ith the \"battle of the experts\" when it comes to interpreting facts. And as fact-finders, they may find that truth lies somewhere in between the opposing, uncompromising views of the partisan experts. Expe rt opinion testimony is just opinion, and the fa ct-finde r may weig h and asse ss that opinion in coming to her own conc lusions. However , even mor e than or dinary fact-finder s, this C ourt has recognized the unique ability of Specia l Masters to adjudg e cases in the light of their own a cquire d specia lized knowledg Master' s sole profe ssional responsibility for y ears has bee n to preside ove r vaccine ca ses jury can be forced to ac cept or reject an e xpert's opinion or a party's theory at face value. To require such a choice in this context is to neglect the Spec ial Master' s duty to \"vig orously and dilige ntly investiga ing the petition. The proba tive value of surfa ces indire ctly in providing specia lized knowledg e with which the f act-finder ma y make r ational infer ences-16-and reconcile the conflicting expert opinions. A fact-finder, especially one with specia lized experienc e such a s a Specia l Master, c an ac cept or reject opinion testimony , in whole or in par t. When the evidence is in, and it is t ime to apply the facts to the law, the expert's role is over. Partisan testimony then g ives way as the Special Master evalua tes the testimony in light of the e ntire re cord, ba sed on reasonable infe rences born of common experience or the produc t of specia l expertise. . . . She did so in this case, weighing factors not present in the cold record-cr edibility and those other intang ibles that lead re viewing courts to def er so greatly to the fac t-finder who observe d the witnesses a nd hear d the evidenc e. In exercising its jurisdiction pursuant to the Vaccine Act, the Cou rt acts not as a trial court, but as a reviewing authority. That role does not lend itself easily to resolving differing accounts of causation or other factual disputes, nor to weig hing the credibilit y and streng th of testimony . The Spec ial Master, by contrast, heard all of the evidence first-hand and was afforded the opportunity to question the witnesses and evaluate their credibility and persuasiveness. She was, there fore, best able to stee r a course throug h the diverg ent opinions in thi s case . 44 Fe d. Cl. 183, 188-89 (1999) (c itations omi tted). I n Ry man v. Secr etary of HHS, the c ourt explained that a spec ial master pe rforms a g ate-keeping function \"w whe ther a particula r s expert medical testimony supporting biolog ic proba bility may be admitted or credited or othe rwise r elied upon,\" 65 F ed. Cl. 35, 40 (2005), but also ac ts as \"a tr ier-of -fact and ther efore y and applica bility of medica l theories,\" id. a t 41. Finally , in Doe v. Secr etary of HHS, the c ourt stated: Instead of be ing pa ssive rec ipients of information, such a s jurors, spec ial masters are given an a ctive role in determining the fa cts rele vant to Vac cine Ac t petitions. One r eason tha t proce eding s are more e xpeditious in the hands of spec ial masters is that the special maste rs have the expertise and e xperie nce to know the type of information that is mos t probative of a claim. 76 Fe d. Cl. 328, 338-39 (2007); ac cord H ines ex rel. Sevier v. Sec 'y of HHS, 21 Cl. Ct. 634, 648 (1990) ( \"The Special Master is not required to be a 'potted pla nt' at the he aring . a ff'd, 940 F.2d a t 1518. In sum, when consider ing the provisions and leg islative history of the Va ccine Act, the language of the Vaccine Rules, and the case law, one f actor that has re mained consta nt in the Vaccine Prog ram is the nec essar y and important role of specia l masters in conduc ting proce eding s and re ndering decisions in Vac cine Ac t case s. The spec ial masters ha ve great leeway in how they conduct proceedings, including wh at evidence to consider and how to weigh that evidenc e, and the ir cre dibilit y deter minations are a fforded great defe rence. Howe ver, this is not to sugg est that the spec ial masters a re infa llible and that their final de cisions are sacrosanct. To be sure, the Court of Federal Claims on review, and the The F ederal Circuit has desc ribed the standa rd of r eview it applies in Va ccine Act20 cases in the following manner: \"This court reviews the United States Court of Federal Cla ims' revie w of the Spec ial Master' s decision without defe rence.\" Paf ford e x rel. Paff of HHS, 451 F.3d 1352, 1355 ( Fed. Cir. 2006) (citing Hines, 940 F .2d at 1524). As outlined in Sharpnack, a decision is arbitra ry and ca pricious if:21 the spec ial master ha s relied on f actor s which Cong ress ha s not intended to be considered, or has entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, or has of fered an e xplanation of the de cision that runs counter to the evidenc e, or is so impl ausible it could not be asc ribed to a diff erence in view or a pr oduct of expertise. 27 Fe d. Cl. at 459-60. The c ourt notes that c ally to what evidenc e the spe cial master is require d to consider, a nd not the subsequent -17-Federal Circuit on appeal, do not mer ely rubber stamp special maste r final de cisions. Dec isions20 from both cour ts demonstrate a willingness to re verse the dec ision of a spec ial master whe n the specia l master has f ailed to ade quately develop the r ecord, failed to c onsider fa cts critica l to the case, failed to g ive ade quate c onsideration to a viable medical theor y, or otherw ise misapplied the law. See , e.g., Althen v. Sec' y of HHS, 418 F .3d 1274, 1276-77 (F ed. Cir. 2005) (a ffirming the Court of F ederal Claims' reve specia l and conc luding that \" the specia l master er red a s a matter of law by imposing Sec'y of HHS, 55 F ed. Cl. 460, 477 (2003) (f inding that the spe cial master \" abused his discre tion by excluding fr om his review the ve ry evidenc e he sta ted was necessary to assist in determining the timing of the onset of injury \"); Dic kerson e x rel. Dic kerson v. Sec'y of HHS, 35 F ed. Cl. 593, 601-02 (1996) ( finding the spec ial master' s failure \"to obtain a complete r ecord\" to be a rbitrar y and ca pricious). Ne verthe less, the law is settled that neither the Court of Fe deral Claims nor the Fede ral Circuit ca n substitut e its judgme nt for that of the specia l master merely because it might have reached a different conclusion. Reversal is appropriate only when the special master's decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in21 accordanc e with the Num bered Objec tion: Using a Panel of Th ree Special Master s to Hear the \"General Causation\" Issue The court's explor ation of the role of special masters in the Vaccine Program is directly implicated in petitioners' first numbered objection. Spe cifically, petitioners contend that because three specia l masters hea rd all of the g eneral causation evidenc e pre sented in Colten's ca se, they \"had the burden of persua ding not one but cial Va ccine Rule 8.\" 22analy sis of that evidenc e in re ndering a dec ision. S ee Vaccine Rule 8(b)( 1) (\"In rec eiving evidenc e, the spe cial master will not be bound by common law or statutory rules of e vidence but must consider all relevant and reliable evidence governed by principles of fundamental fairness to both parties.\"). Of course, the special masters, like all judicial officers, are required to treat all parties f airly. See, e.g ., Caperton v. A.T . Massey Coal Co., 129 S. t. 2252, 2266 (2009) (acknowledg ing the \"par ties' basic r ight to a f air trial in a f air tribunal\" ); Day v. McDonoug h, 547 U.S. 198, 210 (2006) (\" [B]efore a cting on its own init iative, a c ourt must accor d the par ties fair notice and an oppor tunity to present their positions.\"). Only decisions of the U nited States Supreme Court (\" Supreme Court\") , the Fe deral23 Circuit, the Fe deral Circuit's prede cessor court (the United States Court of Claims), and the Court of Fe deral Claims i n the same c ase on r emand a re binding on the spec ial masters. See Jones v. Sec' y of HHS, 78 F ed. Cl. 403 (2007) (\" The Spec ial Master c orrectly conclude d that he is bound by the dec ision of the Fe deral Circuit.\"); Hanlon e x rel. Ha nlon v.

Cir. 1999). -18-Mot. 23. It is clear from the proceedings before the special masters that petitioners' contention is not supported by the re cord. As noted above , it was deter mined that three specia l masters would consider the g eneral causa tion evidence for The ory 1 and that ea ch spec ial master would then a pply the g eneral causation evidence, along with the case-specific evidence for his or her individually assigned test case, in rende ring a dec ision. At the tim e that the c ases we re first apportioned a mong the three specia l masters, with one-third of the ca ses re tained by Special Master Hasting s and the rema ining c ases divided be tween Spec ial Masters Vow ell and Campbell-Smith, petitioners objected, \" stating tha t 'multipl e dec isions by multipl e Specia l Masters addr essing near ly identical issues of law, f act, sc ience and medicine c dela y at level, fur ther slowing the prog ress towa rds re solving c laims in the omnibus.'\" I d. (quoting petitioners' February 26, 2007 written objection). Notwithstanding petitioners' objection, the Chief Spec ial Master, on be half of the OSM, ex plained in his Notice Reg arding Reassig nment that, \"af ter much thoug ht and discussion with the other spec ial masters,\" he wa s assig ning two a dditional special master s to facilitate the e xpeditious resolution of all of the c ases in the Omnibus Autism P roceeding . Notice Reg arding Reassig nment 2. He noted tha t the final resolution of all of the c ases would r equire ruling s from the F ederal Circuit beca use only the Federal Circuit's binding pre cedent could provide the O SM with t he ability to resolve the c ases with \"spee d, consistency , and ce rtainty .\" Id. at 1. He f urther e xplained: \"The OSM is confident23 that the assig nment of two additional spec ial masters off ers the be st opportunity to resolve a ll of the autism cases within the shortest period of time, without negatively affecting the parties' prese ntation of their re spective e vidence and ar gument.\" I d. at 2.

Autism Update 5; see a der, 2009 WL 332044, at *6 (\" Recog nizing specia l masters have authority to issue causa tion decisions only in the context of an individual claim for c ompensation under the Prog ram a nd that appellate revie w could ensue only when a n individual claim for compe nsation was dec ided, the three specia l masters orde red [petitioners] to i dentify three test case s, rather than just one, on each of the theor ies of ca usation.\"). The special masters have wide discretion to conduct proceedings in a manner which, in their individual judgme nt, best fac ilitates their ability to rende r a de cision in a particula r case. See 42 ting \" require e vidence , information, testimony , or hea rings, and that spec ial masters ha ve complete control over discovery ); Vac cine Rule 8(a ) (\"The spec ial master will deter mine the forma t for taking evidenc e and hea ring argument based on the specific circumstances of each case and af ter consultation with the parties.\"); Burns, 3 F.3d at 417 (noting that the special master \"had wide discretion in conducting the proceedings in a case\"); Doe, 76 Fed. Cl. at 338-39 (\"One reason that proceedings are more expeditious in the hands of special masters is that the special masters have the expertise and experienc e to know the ty pe of infor mation that is most probative of a cla im.\"); Sword, 44 Fed. Cl. at 190 (\"On a more funda mental level, judicial of ficers conduc ting e videntiary hearings-trials-are afforded great latitude on how they administer the proceedings in their forum.\") . Her e, the spe cial master s determined tha t the interests of pe titioners would best be serve d by having three specia l masters hea r the g eneral causation evidenc e and the n apply that evidenc e to the individual case s. The cour t finds no error in that decision.24 Further, pe titioners' contention that they were required to prove their ca se to all three specia l masters lac ks merit. Although a ll three spec ial masters he ard a nd considere d the g eneral causation evidence, they issued separate decisions applying that evidence to their respective test case. See Sny der, 2009 WL 332044; Hazlehurst ex rel. Hazlehurst v. Sec'y of HHS, No. 03- For this reason, the litany of ca ses that petitioners re cite in their motion for re view for25 the propositions that (1) spec ial masters in other c ases ha ve, \"ba sed on circ umstantial evidence alone,\" established that vac cines ha ve ca used var ious injuries and (2) spe cial master s in other cases have found that \"[t]he MMR vaccine . . . was the off-Table neurological injuries,\" see Mot. 12-15 & nn.14-38, is irrelevant. At oral argument, petitioners appeared to change their argument, contending:26 I should clarify that the pre judice that wa s cause d was primar ily when e were errors ] occurre d in front of a panel of three . It's a bell that one c annot unring in front of thre e diffe rent pe ople. And so it creates on any one individual petitioner the burden of having to then make sur e . . . that the e vidence that was a dduced in the othe r cases and the procedures and the decisions in the other cases were all without error too. It compounds the burde n on petitioner[s] in the prese ntation of evidenc e and it has the . of c ompounding a nd mag nifying a n error in one c ase a nd making it an error in the other [ca ses] because it all happened in f ront of the sa me g roup of people a t the same time. Oral Arg ument Tr. 15-16, July 29, 2009. Howeve r, this arg ument suffe rs from the sa me flaw s as the argument petitioners advanced in their motion for review. If Special Master Vowell conclude d that an evide ntiary or proc edura l error had occ urred, she wa s free to make suc h a ruling independe nt of the other two spe cial master s when re ndering her de 2009 WL 332306 12, 2009); Cedillo ex rel. v. Sec'y of HHS, 2009 WL 331968 (F ed. Cl. Spec. Mstr. Fe b. 12, 2009). The spe cial master s were free to r each differ ent conc lusions based on the same e vidence . ., Sharpnac 461 (noting that spe cial master s had the \" discretion to eva luate the utility of\" e vidence \"diffe rently in the light of a ll facts re levant in a spe cific c laim,\" and that \" varia tions in t he analy ses of the spe cial master s are within [ Vaccine] Progr am standar ds\"); see also Hanlon, 40 Fed. Cl. at 630 (holding that special masters are not \"bound by their own decisions\"). That all three reached the same c onclusion-rejec ting pe titioners' theory of ca usation-does not mean that petitioners wer e required to satisfy all three specia l masters. Ther e is nothing in the r ecord suggesting that the spec ial masters we re bound to spea k with one voice. N or ca n petitioners point to evidence tha t Special Master Vowell re ndere d her de cision in consultation with the other two specia l masters. Rather , petitioners g enerally contend that their revie w of the thre e spec ial masters' decisions caused them to conclude that they had to prove their individual case to all three special masters. Mo t. 23. The court finds no evidence in the record to support this26 purported he ighte ned burde n. Moreove r, the de cision of the spec ial masters to conduc t the general causation hear ing tog hear ings c oncer ning the general causation issue with the resultant duplication of the time and resources of the OSM , petitioners, and respondent, hardly suggests fundamental unfairness. To the contrary, it reflects a It bear s noting that pe titioners do not disput e the spe cial master 's recitation of the27 following procedural history in their motion for review; in fact, they fail to me ntion it at all. There is no evidence in the rec ord that petitioners dispute re spondent's re prese ntation28 that he did not asce rtain the c ritical role pla yed by Unig enetics' testing in pe titioners' theory of the use of a panel of three specia l masters to hea r the g eneral causation evidenc e was not arbitrar y, capr icious, an abuse of discretion, or c ontrary to law. Petitioners' first number ed objec tion: bmission of E xpert R eports of Dr. Stephen Bust in In their sec ond numbere d objection, petitioners ar gue that the spe cial master s, and, necessarily , the spec ial master in this case , should not have allowe d responde nt's submissi on of two expert repor from Dr .

The court notes that despite petitioners' e mphasis on this i ssue, there is no right to cr oss-examination in Vaccine that responded to petitioners' la te-filed e xpert re port. Id.29 at *23. In the meantime, in early May 2007, after determining that \"several of petitioners' experts in Cedillo had also served as experts\" in the U.K. MMR litigation, respondent \"decided to attempt to obtain their repor ts and some evidenc e per taining to Unig enetics' testing\" from the court in the United K ingdom.

Petitioners complain that the filing of Dr. B ustin's \"hig hly technica l\" reports from the U.K. MMR litigation \"on the eve of trial\" and the submission of Dr. Bustin's \"impossibly technica l power- point [ sic] aring \" were \"grossly unfair\" use counse l for the Cedillo petitioners had \"no time to review the documents, let alone prepare for cross- examination.\" Mot. 24-25. Howeve r, petitioners c ould not have bee n surprised that r espondent31 would need to a ddress the la boratory results from Unig enetics-e vidence that the petitioners, not responde nt, put in play . As is clear from the r ecord and as the y acknow ledge in their motion for revie w, the Unig enetics te st results were \"the sing le-most critica l issue in the case .\" Id. at 25. This knowledg e was exempli fied by petitioners' filing of an e xpert re port addre ssing this topic a mere twenty days before the first day of hearing. Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *23. Further, it At the November 2007 hearing, one of petitioners' expert witnesses, Dr. Ronald32 Kenne dy, testified, in response to questioning by the spec ial master, that he had not bee n asked by petitioners' c ounsel to \"support the re lease of his own re port in the U.K. MMR litigation,\" despite having no objections to its release. Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *25. Given this testimony, the special master inquired about petitioners' progress in obtaining the U.K. MMR litigation ma terial. Id. One of petitioners' attorneys asserted \"that petitioners' experts wanted to use informa tion from the U.K. litiga tion, but could not obtain it .\" Id. On furthe r questioning from the spe cial master , he ela borate d that petitioners' c ounsel \"ha d made inquiries, but we re informed by outside counsel that they could not obtain the information.\" I d.; acc ord Ora l Argument Tr. 8-9 (indicating that petitioners retained a barrister in the United Kingdom to assist them). Ye t, he contende d, \"petitioners' counsel wa s actively investiga ting wha t neede d to be done to g ain re lease of docume nts.\" Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *25. As the spec ial master explained in her dec ision, thi s \"cha racterization . . . of the ef forts to obtain additional U.K. reports differs from the statement that appears in the notice\" filed by petitioners' counsel on July 31, 2008, id. at *25 n.77, which provide d: \"In the per iod betwee n the Cedillo om the -23-was petitioners' own experts who relied upon the laboratory results from U nigenetics in rende ring their opinions on causa tion, and whose re ports aler ted re spondent to the importance petitioners place d on the labora tory results. I d. Indeed, D r. Mar cel Kinsbourne , petitioners' expert in pediatric ne urolog y, testified that these te st results were critica l to his, and thus petitioners', theor y of ca usation. See, e.g ., id. at *78 n.234 (\"[T]he validity of spec ific tests for measles vira l material in g ut tissue perfor med by the Unig enetics la boratory is critical to Dr. Kinsbourne' s theory .\"), 87 ( noting that Dr .

Not only should petitioners not have be en surpr ised by responde nt's need to a ddress the testing done by Unig enetics, but they were provide d ample opportunity to addre ss Dr. B ustin's expert repor ts in the many months following their r eceipt of the repor ts. During a June 8, 2007 status confe rence, the thre e spec ial masters sug gested, a nd the petitioners in the thre e test ca ses agreed, that additional proce eding s could be c onducted with re spect to the mate rial obtained f rom the U.K. MMR litigation at a later time, thus leaving the evidentiar y door open.

The spe cial master s and responde nt ag reed to join petiti oners' application. I d. at *24-25. How ever, there is no evidence that petitioners took any action to re quest materia ls from the U.K. MMR litigation betwe en the June 2007 hea ring in Cedillo and the November 2007 hear ing in Sny der. Id. at *25. 32UK,\" A utism L itigation Mate rials and the F irst Theory of Gene ral Causa tion 2, J uly 31, 2008.

I t was appa rent to me fr om Dr. Ke nnedy 's testimony that his support for re lease of his repor t had not been soug ht, and from the on-the-record response of counsel to my questions, that petitioners' efforts to obtain these mate rials had not prog resse d to the stag e of ma king a ny application, or, indeed, anything beyond talking about the process. Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *25 n.77. is but tressed by the statements made by petitioners' counsel at oral argument. Cou nsel stated that in order to submit an applica tion to the court in the United King dom, petitioners \"nee ded to . . . g et affirmative waiver s of any confide ntiality from all of . . . the litigation . . . and we made those e fforts. For diff erent rea sons, the experts whose re ports we sought were not forthcoming with their permission.\" Oral Argument Tr. 8; see also id. at 9 (indicating that the two individuals in possession of the information they desired-D r. John O'Leary and Dr . re quests). -24-At the Novembe r 2007 hea ring, the spec ial master e ncoura ged \"pe titioners to procee d with speed a nd diligenc e\" in their attempt to obtain the materia l and re spondent's counse l reiter ated their support of petitioners' Id. at *25-26. \" Between N ovember , 2007, and July, 2008, the special masters repeatedly raised the issue of petitioners' attempts to obtain additional evidenc e from the U.K. MMR liti gation\" during status confe rences. I d. at *26. They even \" signe d a letter indicating [their] support for re lease of the doc uments sought by petitioners.\" Id. Yet, \"[a]t n o point did\" petitioners \"indicate that an application had actually been ma de.\" Id. \"Ultimately, based on the delay and expense that would be involved in litigating the release of some reports without the consent of the experts, [petitioners] chose not to seek the release of any of the a dditional ex pert re ports.\" I d. Acc ording ly, the spec ial master closed the e videntiary record on Jul y 31, 2008. Based on the pre ceding proce dural history , it is clear to the c ourt that petitioners have no basis to complain about the spec ial master a dmitti ng Dr. B ustin's ex pert re ports into the rec ord. It was not until February 2007-when petitioners filed their expert reports-that respondent could have be en aw are that the test results from Unig enetics w ere cruc ial to petitioners' theory of causation. Indeed, respondent did not actually become aware of the importance of the test results until March 2007-after he retained expert witnesses to review, analyze, and respond to petitioners' e xpert re ports. There is no question that respondent wa s not dilatory in obtaining a s much information relevant to petitioners' theory of causation as possible prior to the Cedillo hearing in Jun e 2007. It would have been grossly unfair to respondent had he been hampered in his ability to counter petitioners' theory of causation as a result of petitioners' failure to fully explain their theory of ca usation until four months before he aring , espec ially in light of his due diligenc e. It is worth remembe ring that in Vacc ine Prog ram proc eeding s, petitioners have the cha of statements as \" conce ssions\" is somewhat33 misleading , as it impli es that the e xperts we re admitti ng facts not supportive of responde nt's position. As will be shown, such an implication is incorrect. Petitioners' contention at oral argument that they \"outlined and explained in some34 detail\" in their motion for r eview the evidenc e alleg edly ignor ed by the spec ial master, Or al Argument Tr. 16-17, is fla tly untrue. -25-burden of going f orwa rd, and only after petitioners ha ve made a prima f acie case does the burde n of per suasion shift to respondent. See D e Bazan v. Sec' y of HHS, 539 F .3d 1347, 1352 (F ed. Cir. 2008). Thus, without the formal discove ry that is available in other civil liti gation, it is not surprising that respondent in this case could not anticipate the precise nature of petitioners' theory of causation and supporting testimony. Moreover, as previously described, the special master afforded petitioners ample opportunity to respond to the conte nts of Dr. B ustin's reports once the Cedillo hearing had conclude d. She, along with the two other spec ial masters, re peate dly querie d petitioners about their ef forts to the U.K. MMR liti gation, encour aged petitioners to obtain the information, and offered to join in petitioners' application for the release of the infor mation from the cour t in the United King dom. There were almost five months between the Cedillo and Snyder hearings, eight months between the Snyder hearing and the close of the e videntiary record, and six mont hs betwee n the close of the evidentiar y record and the specia l master's issuanc e of a decision. Thus, petitioners ha d approximately nineteen months within which to obtain whateve r informa tion they believed ne cessa ry to respond to Dr. B ustin's expert repor ts and testimony . Given this ext raordinary amount of time to secur e any additional information, petitioners' claim of prejudice fails. The special master's conclusion to this effect, see Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *27, was not a Number ed Objections: Ignoring Evid ence Petitioners next argue, in their third and f ourth numbere d objections, that the spec ial master disre garded evidenc e relevant to their c ase. I n their third objection, they contend that the specia l master \"ig nore[d] t he the responde experts,\" Mot. 28,33 of Drs. D Gr iffin, B rian Ward, a nd Robert Fujinami, as w ell as those re lated to the quality of testing by and test results from U nigenetics, id. at 28-36. In their fourth objection, they asser t that the specia l master ig nored e vidence in five subject a reas: reliability of test results from the Unig enetics la boratory ; nd replica tion; neuroinflammation; and merc ury and immune dy sfunction. I d. at 36-49. B ecause of the over lap betwe en the two objec the court addr esses c oncurr ently . Immediately problematic is that petitioners do not explain how the spec ial master' s alleg ed fa ilure to consider certain evidenc e would have altere d her de cision. They alleg e that34 Petitioners also advanc ed anothe r theory of ca usation via the re port and testimony of35 Dr. Jean Ronel-Corbier , a ered d Colten's autism-like sy mptoms. I d. at *93-94. The master re jected D r. Corbier' s -26-the special master disregarded evidence, but fail to explain the evidence's materiality to their case. This failure, in itself, nullifies petitioners' criticism. Yet, even presuming that petitioners' contention is that this evidence would have tipped the scales in their favor such that they would have been able to demonstrate causation by a preponderance of evidence, their contention is flawe d in two respec ts. First, the spec ial master' s decision re flects that she car efully considere d the entire voluminous record in this case . Second, petitioners f ail to demonstrate that the spe cial master imprope rly weig hed the e vidence in the rec ord. 1. Petitioner s' Theory of Causation To place petitioners' spec ific conte ntions in contex t, a brief discussion of their theory of causa tion is appropriate. Petitioners pre sented their the ory to the specia l master in the following manner : (1) the e thylmercur y in [thimerosal-c ontaining va ccine s] is an immune suppressant; (2) the attenua ted measle s virus contained in the MMR vac cine is an immune suppressant; both [t himerosal-c ontaining vaccines] and the measles vaccine virus suppressed the imm une system of at least some children w ho rec eived both; (4) this immunosuppression permits the measles virus to per sist in t hese c hildren; (5) a persistent mea sles virus can e nter the bra in and ca use a ne urolog ical injury ; and (6) tha t neurolog ical injury can include autism o r [autism spectrum d isorder] symptoms. Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *28. In their motion for review, petitioners articulate how this theory of ca usation applies to Colten's case : (1) [Co lten] was born healthy; (2) he had normal development and met all milestones; (3) he r eceived all re quired c hild damag ed sy stem; (5) the MMR vaccine she [sic] received at 14 [sic] mon ths further damaged his immune system; (6) he was unable to clear the vaccine-strain [m easles virus] contained in mune def the [measles virus] plicated in Colten; (8) the [measles virus] cause d her [sic] to suffer [inflamma tory bowel disease]; and (9) the [measles virus] entered his brain, causing inflamma tion and autism. Mot. 17. Howeve r, as e xplained by the spec ial master, the me dical theor y advanc ed by petitioners' testify ing e xperts does not c onform to this frame work. 35testimony, id. at *94, and petitioners have not challenged the special master's ruling on this point. -27-Dr. Kinsbourne, petitioners' expert in the causa tion cases we re ba sed.\" Snyder, 2009 WL at *11.

Krig sman's opinions in [autism s pectr um disorder], and Dr. Aposhian's opinions on me rcury toxic ology and the role of [thimerosal- containing vaccines] in [autism spectrum disorder]. Id. at *87. She explained Dr. Kinsbourne's hypothesis as follows: [D]ue to an ineffective imm une response, some children with regressive autism are unable to clear the measles vaccine virus from their bodies. The virus inhabits the g ut, and is transported by macr ophag es throug h the circ ulatory system to the brain. Af ter crossing the blood-bra in barrie r, the virus invade s the astrog lia, neurons, and possibly microglia, invoking a response by the brain's innate immune sy stem, the microg lia. The microg lia produce proinflammatory cytokines, causing brain inflammation. This inflammation disorg anizes critical circuits in t he bra in, interrupting communication among various ar eas of the bra in. These disorganized circuits manifest in autistic symptoms. Alterna tively , or additionally , . . . the d gliosis, or scarring , of astroc ytes (a ty pe of g lial cell sometimes referred to as astroglia). One function of astrocytes is to m op up excess glutamate at the sy napses, the br idges betwee n neurons.

Excess glutamate, the brain's mo st prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter, can kill neurons a nd can c ause a n imbalance betwee n excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Id. at *77 ed). N otably , Dr. Kinsbourne \"did not rely on the theory of mercury dysregulation of Colten's immune system,\" id. at *183, contending that the damage done to Colten's immune sy stem was done sole ly by the MMR vacc ine, id. at *184. I n fac t, the specia l master explained that \"[t] he only witness who testified that Colten's immune sy stem was dysregulated prior to his MMR ination\" was D r. Ke nnedy ist, id. at *9, but \"[ w]hen informed that Dr . Bradstree t had testified that Colten's immune sy stem was not dy sregulated prior to the re ceipt of the MMR vaccine , Dr. Ke nnedy petitioners' theor y of ca usation depende d upon, among other thing s, Colten's \"PCR\" is short for \"polymerase chain reaction\" and \"is a method of expon entially36 replica ting strand D NA.\" Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *110.

With t his backg round, the court proceeds to petitioners' contentions. 2. Dr. Diane Griffin Petitioners beg in by descr ibing a number of sta tements that Dr. Gr iffin either made or with which she concurred, which the special master purportedly ignored. These statements include: (1) \" measles is one of the most infectious of all vira l diseases\" ; (2) \"a 'targ et org an' gastrointestinal tract\"; (3) \"the attenuated me asles vaccine can atal disease the immune sy stem\"; (5) \" measles virus cause s immunosuppression that continues for months after the per iod of viremia\" ; (6) \"measles virus skews T cells, and . . . when Th1 and Th2 are not in balance the body's ability to clear viruses will be impaire d\"; (7) \" the measle s vacc ine, like the wild virus, ca uses lymphopenia\"; ( 8) \"y ou can de finitely identify chang es [in antibodies] that are occur ring as par t of the induction of the imm une response to the vaccine\"; (9) \"measles can cause neurologic disease\" in an immunosuppresse d person\" ; can persist in the human body\"; (12) \"the PCR te chnique used by [Unigenetics] is commonly used to detec t viral RNA\"; (13) \" a mea sles vacc ine should not be g iven to an36 immunosuppressed child\"; and (14) \"evide nce phy sician.\" Mot. 28-31. Notwithstanding petitioners' representations, the special master addressed each of these asser tions in her decision. See, e .g., Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *95 (\" [Measles] i s one of the most infectious viruses known. . . . I t spreads to g ut . .\"), 96 (\" The pe riod of immunosuppression beg ins at 9-15 day s after exposure to the virus, and continues f or approximately two to three months af ter re cover y from mea sles disease.\" ), 97 (noting a \"ske wing of the immune sy stem to a Th2 re sponse\" a fter \"a period of imm unologic abnormalities\" that are \"coincident with inducing the immune lso results in transient ly mphopenia.\") , 105 (\"Measles vaccine virus may cause or contribute to fatal respiratory or neurological disease in In making this arg ument, petitioners er d not review ed the Uhlmann a rticle\" that supported their c laim. Mot. 42. P etitioners did not provide a c itation for this testimony , and the court could locate no testimony to this effect. Indeed, Dr. Griffin's testimony strongly suggests that she had r ead the article , but did not have it in front of her at the hea ring. See Cedillo Tr. 2834A-36, 2863, 2866. More over, the article is both discussed in, and attache d to, Dr. Grif fin's expert repor t. See ipients.\"), 106 (\" [V]iruses per sist when the host fails to form an appr opriate immune re sponse or fa ils to clear the vir us . . . .\"), 106- 08 (desc ribing the devasta ting, a nd almost alway s fatal, e ffects of the two known \" diseases r ecognized to be associated with persistent measles virus in humans\"), 107 (\"[M]e asles virus is known to persist only rarely . . . .\"), 115 ( discussing the use of PCR testing to detec t measles virus RNA), 166 n.481 (noting that there was no credible testimony that Colten was immunocompromised prior to receiving his MMR vaccination). I t is of no import that the special master may not have attributed the assertions to Dr. Griffin or indicated that Dr. Griffin concurred with them-it is clear that she did, in fa ct, consider the statements, or the underly ing ide as represe nted by the statements. Petitioners also alleg cial conf licting e vidence from Dr . Griffin concerning whether the presence of measles virus RNA means that the measles virus is replica ting. Petitioners' position is that Colten's CSF contained r eplicating measles virus, a nd38 that an ar ticle coa uthored by Dr. Gr iffin supports the idea that replica tion of the measles virus can be inferr ed from the prese nce of measles virus RNA in a tissue sample. Mot. 42-43. I n that article , Dr. Gr iffin indicated he r belief that the pre sence of the mea sles virus at multiple clinical sites in children infected with HIV represented \"continued me asles virus replication, not simply the persistence of measles virus RNA after the cessation of viral replication.\" Cedillo Pet'rs Ex. 112, tab L , at 535; acc ord Mot. 31, 42; cf. Mot. 36 (a ddressing Dr. Rima's discussion of Dr . Griff in's article Howe ver, a llege petitioners, Dr. Gr iffin denied tha t the detec tion of the measles virus RNA in Michelle[ Cedillo]'s gut tissue implied the presence of the protein necessary of the disease to replicate and persist, or the presence of infectious disease in M ichelle . . . .\" Mot. 30; acc ord id. at 41-42. Petitioners fa il to provide any citation for this alleg ation, but the court will assume that they are referring to pages 2830A through 2831 of the Cedillo transcr ipt, which contain Dr . Griff in's testimony that the re plication of a virus c an be inf erred by the existe nce of an antibody reaction, something that occurs when the viral RN A makes proteins; in other words, if the re is no antibody response , there are no proteins being generated by the viral RNA, and ther efore ther e is no replica tion (even if the prese nce of viral RNA ca n be dete cted) . See also Cedillo Tr. 2830A- 31 the g ut tissue findings for Michelle Cedillo). As a threshold matter, the court cannot see the relevance of petitioners' contentions with respe ct to this iss ue. The specia l master conc luded that if there indeed wa s measles virus RNA detec ted in Colten's CSF, then one must conclude that the virus had to be r eplicating . See, e.g ., Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *188 (\"If reliable, the report of measles virus RNA in Co lten's CSF In addition to these statements, petitioners a rgue that ther e is a c onflict betwe en Dr .39 Ward's testimony conce rning opportunistic infections and the te stimony of Dr. War d's collea gue in another c ase. Mot. 32 & n.51. The testimony of Dr. War d's collea gue wa s not before the specia l master, and, thus, is irre levant her e. More over, the testimony of that collea gue coinc ides with what the spec ial master e xpressly conclude d here , that \"as a general rule, if a wild-ty pe virus can c ause a problem, the va ccine virus can a lso cause the problem, albe it in a milder or more -30-would be strong ly probative tha t there w as an ong oing pe rsistent measles infe ction in Colt en's brain.

If no antibodies are present to fight the virus, it can replicate virtually unchecked. Thus, if measles virus w ere actua lly prese nt in Col ten's bra in, but he was not manufa cturing any antibodies ag ainst it, the results would be incompatible with Colten's continued life or health.\" (citation omitted)). Thus, she a ppear s to concur w ith petitioners' position that the presenc e of measles virus RNA in Colten's body would demonstrate r eplication. Additionally , replica tion would only have be en sig nificant if ther e had be en a r eliable positive test re sult for measles virus in Colt en's CSF, whic h, as the spec ial master f ound, was not the c ase. See id. at *189-90. Finally , althoug h the spec ial master discusse d an enor mous quantity of evide nce in he r decision, she doe s not appea r to have specific ally addre ssed the alleg ed conf lict (if there is an actual conflict) between Dr. Griffin's testimony and Dr. Griffin's article. At worst, this is harmless e rror, espec ially given the spec ial master' s repr esenta tion that she had consider ed all of the evidenc e in the re cord. See id. at *7-8. The spe cial master was not re quired to discuss eve ry piece of evide nce or testimony in her de cision. Maza, by Maza v. Sec'y of HHS, 67 F ed.

Dr. Brian Ward Next, petiti oners c laim that the specia l master ig nored the following statements that Dr. Ward either ma de or w ith which he conc urred: (1) \" wild measles virus ca uses a wing39attenuated form.\" Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *99; accord id. at *104. Thus, petitioners' argument lacks merit. Once again, the cour t notes that Congr ess has e xpressly deter mined that there is no40 right to cross-examination in Vacc , which happe ns to occur dur ing the period of ma ximum viremia (1-2 weeks after exposure or immuniz ation)\"; (2) ing of the Th2 re sponse ca uses immunosuppression and allows the deve lopment of opportunistic infections\"; (3) \"mea sles vaccine ca n cause a skew ing towa rds a Th2 r esponse\" ; ca n persist\"; (5) \"Dr. [Michael] Oldstone one of the ists in North America[,] . . spent virtually his entire prof essional ca reer study ing vir al per sistence[, and] . . . has written many article s on viral per sistence\" ; and (6) va rious quotations from an a rticle wr itten by Dr. Oldstone. Mot. 31-33. As with the statements made , or ag reed to, by Dr. Gr iffin, the spec ial master a ddresse d each of these topics in he r dec ision. S ee, e.g., Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *10 (noting that Dr. Oldstone was a \"widely recognized expert in virology and in the study of measles\"), 96 (\"In measles infe ctions, the immune sy stem is actively involved in fig hting the me asles virus, and does not respond normally to other pathogens. Thus, mos t measles-related deaths are the result of . . . opportunistic infections, rather than from the measles disease itself.\"), 97 (\"The time frame in which the Th2-de viated re sponse occ urs would roug hly correspond to the per iod of maxi mum viremia a fter occ urs betwe en nine a nd fiftee n day s after infec tion, marking the pea k level of virus in the body , known as the pe riod of maximum viremia.\" ), 106 (\"[T]he diseases c aused by replica ting viruse s are often ne w and une xpecte d.\"), 106 & nn.337-38 (citing Dr. Wa rd for the fact that \"Dr. Michael Oldstone [is] on e of the world's mo st highly regarded virolog ists\" and discussing petitioners' re liance upon a n article written by Dr. Oldstone), 107 (\" [M]easle s virus is known to persist only rarely . . . .\"). A gain, it is of no import that the spec ial master may not have a ttributed these asse rtions to Dr. Ward or indica ted that Dr. Ward conc urred with them-it is clear that she did not ig nore the statements, or the unde rlying ideas represented by the statements. 4. Dr. Robert Fujinami Petitioners next argue that the spe cial master ignor ed evide nce supplied by Dr. F ujinami. As a preliminary matter, petitioners complain that because respondent failed to call Dr. Fujinami to testify, they lacked any opportunity to cross-exami ne him on the contents of his expert report. 40 Mot. 33-34. Howeve r, the spec ial master c learly stated that bec ause D r. Fujinami, an immunologist, did not t estify , she \"r elied on his ba ckground informa tion on immunology not supplied by Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, claim that Dr. Fujinami \"provided significant evidence in support of [Col ten's] case.\" Mot. 34. I t was so sig that pe titioners neede d just one No forma l motion was filed in the instant case. Sny der, 2009 WL decades . . . that measles virus can persist in human cells, injure tissues, and c ause a potentially damag ing a utoimmune response.\" Id. P et'rs Ex. 132). I ndeed, pe titioners do not even attempt to explain the signific ance of the a rticle or how the ar ticle applies to Colten's ca se. Ha d the ar ticle bee n as valuable to pe titioners' ca se as they claim, surely they would have soug ht to subpoena Dr. Fujinami's testimony or re tain his service s. 5. Unigenetics Petitioners next alleg e that the spe cial a ple thora of e vidence conce rning the reliability of test results from U nigenetics. As a preface to addressing petitioners' contentions, a brie f summary of the spec ial master' s conclusions on this topic is i n order . As alluded to above , responde nt mounted a vig orous attac k against the reliability of the labor atory results from U nigenetics. The evidence regarding the laboratory's reliability came from b oth publicly available information and doc uments obtained fr om the U.K. titioners in o and Ha zlehurst moved to strike the evidenc e der ived from the U .K. MMR lit igation, the spec ial master, out of a n abundanc e of41 caution, split her ana lysis of the labora tory's reliability into two parts, and conc luded: [A]n a nalysis of the public evidence alone clearly demonstrates that the results from Unig enetics c annot be r elied upon as e vidence of the pe rsistence of mea sles virus in children with autism. When considering the U.K. litiga tion information, the evidenc e that Unig enetics' results are not reliable is over whelming . Unigenetics' operations reflect unsound applications of the sound scientific process of PCR testing. Id. (empha sis added); a ccord id. at *189. Acc ording ly, the spec ial s considera tion of the U.K. MMR liti gation documents for ms the basis for a n alterna tive holding; her conclusion that the laboratory results from U nigenetics were unreliable does not depend on them. P etitioners' assertions concerning the evidence regarding the reliability of the Unigenetics laboratory results descr ibed below implicate both of the spec ial master' s holdings. a. Dr. Stephen Bust in Petitioners' first contention to support the re liability of the labor atory results from Unig enetics c enter s upon the copy numbers der ived during its P CR testi ng and Dr . Bustin's opinion relative to those copy numbers. As explained by the special master, PCR te sting \"is a method of exponentially replica ting a strand of D NA,\" w here \"extremely small quantities of DNA c an be a mplified, cre ating enoug h DNA to produc e a visible 'ba nd' on a g el.\" I d. at *110. Specifically, a primer (i.e., a complementary strand of DNA) is selected, the target strand DNA is split by heating , and a poly mera se is added, a ll resulting in the f ormation of two strands of DNA In her a lternative r eliability analy sis that information42 conce rning Unig enetics a long w ith obtained fr om the U.K. MMR liti gation, the special master addressed Dr. Hepner's independent research referenced by petitioners in their motion for revie w. See Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at ontaining titled \"6. The Walker-He pner ' Poster Presentation.'\" ); Mot. 39 (noting tha t Dr. He pner \" has her self re plicated the [Unige netics] lab's finding s\"). Give n the pre liminary , unpublished nature of Dr. He pner' s data, a mong othe r issues, the spec ial master did not cr edit it. See Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *135-36. Fur ther, to the e xtent that petitioners ar e conte nding tha t Dr. B ustin's \"dispute was43 only with [ Unig enetics' ] numbers,\" Mot. 35 (c iting Cedillo Tr. 2042); ac cord id. a t 36 (citing Cedillo Tr. 2045[A]), to the exclusion of any other criticism of Unigenetics, their contention is err oneous. I t is appare nt from his testimony that Dr. B ustin had conce rns about Unig enetics' low copy numbers, hig h cycle number s, and standar d curve . See, e.g ., Cedillo Tr. 2040 (indicating that \"there is a problem with the low copy numbers and the higher cycle numbers\") , 2045A (indica ting that Dr . Bustin's \"c oncer n rea lly is with low copy numbers and high cycles, high number of runs\"), 2062A-65A (explaining his problems w ith Unigenetics' standard c . It was . Kenne dy, who testified: \"I think the issue was that no one had a ny problem with hig h copy numbers.\" Sny der Tr . 337A; 2009 WL 332044, at *117 (\"Doctor Kennedy testified that, at least with the high copy number results, -33-from the or igina l single stra nd. I d. at *111. This proce ss constitutes one PCR testing c ycle.

A third cy cle turns the f our strands into eight, a nd the proc ess proc eeds e xponentially cy cles . . . .\" Id. Thus, when the PCR testing on a target strand of DNA ha s conclude d, the labora tory performing the test would know how many copies of the DNA we re ma de and how many cycles of te sting were required to make that number of c opies. To demonstrate the exist ence of a pa rticular D NA molecule in a sa mple, the optimal result would combine a hig h copy number a nd a low number of cycles. See generally id. passim. Petitioners ge nerally asser t that the specia ig nored te stimony from Dr . Bustin that suggested that his lone objec tion to the results from Unig enetics w as to the low copy numbers. Mot. 34-37. I n making this contention, petitioners aver : \"Hig h copy numbers ar e conside red accurate because the detection of RNA occurs at a lower cycle number, in other words, earlier in the experiment, and make s them inherently reliable .\" Id. at 34-35; ac cord id. a t 37. Howeve r, the spec ial master, c iting var ious portions of hear ing te stimony , expressly noted that \"[e]ven when the copy numbers were high, the high values could reflect contamination rather than high amounts of the tar get substance in tissue\" and that \"[a] high c opy number of me asles virus does not nece ssarily imply that the threshold cy cle (CT) was low.\" Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *135. Although the y acknow ledge Dr. Bustin's testimony that a hig h c ould refle ct contamination, petitioners conte nd that the spec ial master ig nored the contra ry testimony of Dr. Karin Hepner. Mot. 39. This contention is demonstrably false. See Snyder, 2009 WL42 43he conside red the Unig enetics' results to be re liable.\") . As an a side, petitioners attributed the following asser tion to Dr. the discr epanc ies betwee n the labs unanimously conclude d that [Unigene tics'] findings with respe ct to high c opy numbers we re absolutely reliable .\" Mot. 39 (citing Snyder Tr . 346[A] ). The te stimony cited by petitioners, howeve r, does not appe ar to c onform with their re prese ntation. Accordingly, it is of absolutely no import that \"Colten, of course, had no access to this44 alleg edly 'sealed' e vidence from the UK 38 n.57. More over, a s descr ibed elsewhere in this opinion, the special master concluded that petitioners' lack of access was a problem of their own making. In raising this concer n, petitioners ac cuse the specia l master of king the45 \"preposterous conc lusion\" that Dr. B ustin's testimony reflected tha t contamination in the Unig enetics la boratory was \" 'rampart'[sic].\" Mot. 37-38 n.56. Assuming that petitioners mea nt \"rampant,\" their claim is baseless. Nowhere does the special master describe contamination in the Unig enetics la boratory as ra mpant. Petitioners may instead be r eferring to the decision of -34-332044, at *117 (\" Based on the hig h copy numbers of me asles virus RNA found in some of the samples, [Dr. Hepne r] concluded that the positive finding s were not artifac ts and repr esente d actua l 135 (discussing Dr. He pner' s challeng e to Dr. B ustin's \"testimony that high c opy number samples c produc t of 'spontane contamination\") ial master d Unig enetics' copy numbers within her a lternative a nalysis, ssed the publicly available information conc erning Unig enetics a long w ith the information obtained from the U.K. MMR litigation.

MMR li tigation evidenc cial master disreg arded Dr. B ustin's hearing testimony about Dr. Finbar Cotter's effort to replicate Unigenetics' results, including his ability to replicate results at hig h copy numbers, which the y asser t proves that the r esults were reliable . Mot. 34-35, 38-39. First, the special master clearly addressed this evidence-she devoted an entire section to it. See Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *132-33 U.K. . Second, bec ause D r. Cotter's testing was performed \"within the context of the U.K. MMR litigation,\" the special master considered this testimony within her alter native ana lysis, which addre ssed the publicly available information conce rning Unig enetics a long w ith the information derive d from the U.K .

Thus, to the ext ent that there is error in the specia l master's a nalysis, such err or would be harmless be cause her pr imary reliability holding e xcluded, a nd thus there wa s no relianc e upon, the U.K. MMR litigation evide nce. 44 Finally , petitioners claim that the spe cial master ignor ed the limited utilit y of the labora tory notebooks from Unig enetics r elied upon by Dr. B ustin. Mot. 26, 37. Howeve r, the45Special Master Hasting s in Cedillo, where, in closely examined the results of the Uhlmann study , he found tha t in approxi mately one-third of Unig enetics' testing pr ocedur es ('runs'), the lab obtained positive results for their negative controls. Dr. Bustin testified that this result meant that c ontamination was ra mpant in the B ustin's testimony that \"the pr esenc e of contamination in one-third of your assa ys sugg ests they have -35-specia l master addr essed the note book data in her decision. See, e .g., Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *130-31. Mo reover, her discussion of the notebook data fell within her alternative analysis that combined the publicly available information conc erning Unig enetics w ith the material derive d from the U.K . MMR li tigation. See id. Thus, to the ext ent that there is error in the specia l master's a nalysis, such err or would be ha rmless bec ause he r primar y reliability holding excluded, and thus there was no re liance upon, the U.K. MMR liti gation evidenc e. r. Michael Oldstone Next, petiti oners c ontend that the spec ial master disre garded the contents of a letter authore d by Dr. Oldstone, whic h they claim supports their ca se. Mot. 35. I n fac t, Dr. Oldstone wrote the letter to counter petitioners' reliance on his research and to explain his experience with Unigenetics. Thus, petitioners' complaint lacks merit on several grounds. First, petitioners' contention that the spec ial master ig nored the letter is entire ly inacc urate , as she c learly discussed both aspec ts of Dr. Oldstone' s letter in her decision. See Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *106 (discussing r esearch), 123-24 (c ontaining a section titled \"(5) Doctor O ldstone's Experience \"). Sec ond, petitioners, throug h the use of se lective quotation, completely misrepre sent the conte nts of the letter. Petitioners re prese nt that Dr. Oldstone's letter reflects his belief in the reliability of results from U nigenetics, characterizing his view as follows: In his letter, Dr. ldstone reve aled \" [i]n the ea for PCR, found them \"to be sound.\" In addition, Dr. Oldstone stated, [Unigenetics'] test results agreed with his own in 80% of the samples he sent to the [Unigenetics] lab. Mot. 35 (citation omitted). Standing in stark c ontrast to petitioners' c haracterization are Dr. Oldstone's own wor ds. Acc ording to Dr. Oldstone, whe n he first re ceive d the re sults from Unig enetics, he \"discove tha sa mples were incorre ct as to the prese nce or absenc e of me asles.\" Sny der Resp' t Ex. AA. Ne verthe less, beca use Dr. O ldstone found the testing protocols \"to be sound,\" he sent a nother ba tch of samples to the la boratory for testing. With respec t to the second set of results, he found: In this vein, Dr. Ward testified that a n eig hty perc ent conc ordanc e rate \"would be46 unacc a research setting, a nd was wildly inappropria te for a diag nostic Sny a rgument, petitioners cha nged tac k. Rather than a rguing tha t the contents of47 Dr. Oldstone' s letter supported the ir position, they aver red tha t Dr. Oldstone must have be en the source of the twe nty perc ent ra te of misidentification. See O ral Ar gument Tr. 20 (\" Dr. Ke nnedy testified that it was just as likely that the re ason for the inconsistent results betwe en Dr .

See Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *124 (\" Although it is possible that contamination of the sa mples submitt ed occ urred in Dr. Oldstone's labor atory a position advanc ed by Dr. Ke nnedy Ward discounte that also sug gested the misidentified samples w ere probably at the low end of the detection threshold, but his explanation did not account for false positive results nor how the sa me samples could test positive initially , but neg ative whe n submitt ed a se cond time, or vice ve rsa.\" (citations omitted)). Dr. Ward' s testimony about his conver sation with Dr. Oldstone that led to Dr.48 Oldstone's pre paration of the letter similarly lacks support for this statement. See Sny der Tr althoug h unclea r, mig ht conce ivably provide support for the statement. See id. at 337A-339A ( suggesting that Dr. Oldstone ha d obtained hig h copy numbers fr om the technique he -36-The re sults of the second r ound wer e no better with ag ain appr of the samples some samples, whe unde r diffe rent c ode number s[,] from positive to neg ative or from neg ative to positive.

Thus, it is clear that the re sults from the second r ound of testing c aused D r. Oldstone to lose fa ith in the soundness and reliability of testing done by Unigenetics. 47 Most egregious is petitioners' suggestion that Dr. Oldstone's letter included statements not actually contained in the le tter. They asser t: \"Dr. Oldstone a lso indicated that there was concor dance betwee n the two labora tories on hig h copy numbers. I n other wor ds, the hig h copy numbers dete cted by the tory using its primers.\" Mo t. 35; accord id. at 40. Nothing in D r.

This exhi bit contains a brief synopsis of a pape r titled \"Development of an 'allelic discrimination' type assay to differentiate between strain petitioners indicate tha t \"the replica te the [Unige netics] lab's results with respect to high copy numbers.\" Id. at 38. Petitioners fail to cite, and the court could not find, evidence in the record that Dr. Oldstone attempted to replicate Unigenetics' test results. c. Dr. Bertus Rima Petitioners' next contentions concer n the testimony of Dr. Rima. The y first claim that the specia l master ig nored te stimony that counter ed Dr . Rima's assertion, re peate d by Dr. Gr iffin and descr ibed by the spec ial master, that the \" extremely high c opy numbers\" of measles RNA f ound in Colt en's CSF \" were not biologic ally plausible.\" Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *190. According to petitioners, Dr. Ke nnedy testified to a plausible e xplanation for the high c opy numbers with which ne ither Dr. Rima nor D r. Grif fin disag reed. Mot. 40. Howeve r, there is no question that the specia l master conside red the issue of copy numbers that we re too hig h and found the testimony of respondent's experts to be more persuasive. See, e.g., Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *190. Petitioners also claim that the spec ial master disre garded Dr. Rima's testimony concerning both measles virus replication and Unigenetics' use of imm unohistochemistry. Mot. 35-36; cf. id. a t 42 (descr ibing Dr . Griff in's lack of awareness of the alleg ed immunohistochemical testing). Once again, the special master discussed both of these topics in her de cision. See, e.g ., Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *95 (\" The mea sles virus is a single -strande d RNA virus. RN A viruses are unstable, and need to replicate constantly in order to ma intain themselves.\" ( footnote & citations omitt ed)), 95 n.299 (noting \"Dr. Rima's testimony that the virus mus t continue to replicate in order to survive\"), 106-07 (indicating that in cases of subacute sclerosing panenc (\"SSPE\"), the mea sles virus persists and re plicates for seven to ten years after infec tion), 109 n.350 (discussing enetics performed immunohistochemical testing), 117 & n.356 (discussing the Uhlmann paper and its ambig uous ref erence to immunohistochemical testing ). It does not matter that the spe cial master may not have attributed the assertions to Dr. Rima or indicated that Dr. Rima concurred with them-it is clear that she considere d the statements, or the underly ing ide as represe nted by the statements. Finally , petitioners insist that the special master ignor ed both Dr. Rima's testimony and their own \" direc t evidence \" that Unig enetics use d allelic discrimination to positively identify vaccine strain mea sles RNA in Colten's samples. Mot. 35-36, 41. Petitioners are mistaken. 49origins of measles virus de tected in intestinal tissue of childre n with ileocolonic ly hyperpla developmenta l disorder.'\" Cedillo P et'rs Ex. 130.

Cl. at 26; Sny der, 36 F about PC R tests Finally , petitioners brief ly argue that the spe cial master ignor ed evide nce r egarding proper PCR testing pr ocedur es, including the use of c ontrols, the preve ntion of contamination, and the preva lence of conta mination. Mot. 37-38. This is obviously not the case . The spec ial master carefully descr ibed how PCR testi ng is perfor med, and a ddresse d both controls and contamination extensively. See, e.g., Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *110-15 (containing a detailed se mera se Chain Reac tion,\" descr ibing how the test is perfor med, how the results are confirmed, and typical problems w ith the test), 114 (\"Contamination is frequent eve n in the most compulsively monitored labora tories.\") , 116-36 (a pplying the U nigenetics re sults). Altoge ther, ther e is no indication that the spec ial master ig nored the evidenc e cited by petitioners re garding the re liability of the test re sults from Unige netics whe n rende ring her I cite var facts about ence phalitis-i.e., inflammation of the brain-de monstrating tha t it has occurr ed as both a re sult of persistent measles infe ction and esenta tions, all of these fa cts wer e recognized by the spec ial master in her decision. See, e.g., Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *99 (\"The Vaccine Injury Table recognizes that vac c an ca use or . .\"), 104 (indicating that \"any thing that the w ild-ty pe virus ca n cause can a lso be ca used by the vac cine strain virus\") , 106-08 sles inclusion body ence phalitis). I n spite of the Petitioners also claim that the spec ial master disre garded \"the va st body of evide nce50 regarding the ef fects of merc ury on the immune sy stem, and then de clare[d] that petitioner had failed to prove that merc ury exposure can le ad to a dy sfunctional immune sy stem.\" Mot. 49. This claim is similarly flawed. The special master devoted an entire section of her decision to the ef fects of merc ury on the immune sy stem. Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, -39-special master's obvious recognition of these facts, petitioners contend, without supplying a citation, that \"it is difficult to fathom how the spec ial master c ould state that it is unproven that measles c an ca use neur oinflammation.\" Mot. 44.

To the extent that the article is re levant to the issue at ha nd, there is no question that the special master read and conside red the article . See, e.g ., Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *106 (noting Oldstone's ar ticle was \" read repe atedly into ord\" a nd that \"the eneral statements\" in the article \"har dly constitute evidenc e that the mea sles virus actua lly persists to cause autism\"). 7.

And, the special master concluded that there was no \"excess mercury in Indeed, be cause of Dr. K insbourne's position that \"ca usation in Colt en's c ase did not51 depend on a ny form of immune dy sregulation spec ial master pr operly limit ed her analy sis to any immune dysfunction ca used by the MMR vacc ine, see , e.g., id. at *185-86 (discussing Colten's alleg ed immune sy stem dy sfunction and c oncluding that \"[t] he evide nce tha t Colt en's sregulated' a fter his MMR vacc ination is unconvincing \"). As was made clear in the court's analysis, the representations made by petitioners in52 their third and fourth numbered objections were almost wholly without a factual basis. Indeed, in sever al instance s, petitioners wer e clearly attempting to mislead the court. See Mot. 31 (misrepresenting the contents of one of Dr. Griffin's articles), 34 (contending that Dr. Fujinami provided \" signific ant evidenc e\" but de scribing the evidenc e in one, g eneral sentenc e and f ailing to actually explain the significance), 35 (misrepresenting Dr. Bustin's testimony and the contents of Dr. O ldstone's letter) , 42 (misrepre senting whether Dr. Gr iffin r eviewe d the Uhlmann article ). -40-Colten's body.\" Id. at *169. None of these findings is contested by petitioners. Thus, petitioners' re liance upon the effect of the merc ury contained in the va ccine s received by Colten is mispl aced. They have no ba sis to assert that \"the me rcury contained in numer ous Mot. 46. The fla ws in petitioners' sec ond claim flow dire ctly from the f laws in their first. Petitioners did not advance a theor y of \"me rcury induced immune dy sfunction\" in Colten's ca se. See Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *183-84. Therefore, the special master had no obligation to make suc h a finding . Simi larly, beca use the spec ial master wa s not obligate d to consider a n51 argument that was not advanced by petitioners, she could not have ignored evidence related to that arg ument, as petitioners a ver in their third c laim. Moreover , the subject matter of the evidenc e desc ribed by petitioners that the spec ial master supposedly ignor ed-testimony of and literature cited by Dr. Jeffre y Brent, a medic al tox icolog ist, id. at *19-20, about the ef fect of merc ury on the immune sy stem-was g iven an in-de pth treatment by the spec ial master in her decision, despite its ultimate irrele vance . See id. at *72-76. 8. Conclusion sum, far f rom disreg arding the statements and va rious subject matter c ited by petitioners, the special master both considered them and assigned them the weight that she felt appropr iate. See Hodg es, 9 F .3d at 961 n.4 (\" Clearly the Special Ma ster eva luated petitioner' s52 evidence . . . in light of the facts of the case. That [s]he judged it to fall short of proving the case by the standar d the law r equire s is not the same as re fusing to consider it.\") . Although the y never expressly discuss the materiality of these statements, it is apparent that petitioners' grievance is Petitioners thrice re veal their true discontent in their motion for r eview-in the motion's53 introductory materia l, with respec t to testim ony that the copy numbers we re too hig h, and regarding evidence of the use of allelic discrimination. See Mot. 5 (\"[T]he Special Master[] erred by failing to give weig ht to the substantial concessions by responde nt's expert witnesses.\") , 40 (\"The specia l master, howe ver, e ither ig nored or discounted this important evidence .\" (empha sis added)) , 41 (\"I n this case the cial master added) ). -41-that the spec ial master did not is the sound discretion of the spe cial master . Lampe, 219 F.3d a t 1360; hitecotton, 81 F.3d a t 1108; Munn, 970 F.2d at 871; Hines, 940 F .2d at 1527. Because the spec ial master did not abuse her discr etion, the cour t will not di sturb those finding s. Petitioners' third and four th numbered obje ctions are rejected. E. P etitioners' Fifth Nu mbered Obj ection: Failing to Require That Dr. Rima Disclose Underlying D ata and F acts Concerning His Opini ons In their fifth numbered objection, petitioners argue that the special master improperly \"allowe d Dr. Rima's opinion testimony conce rning the re liability of the Unig enetics L abora tory without also requiring that he disclose the unde rlying facts a nd data he relied on.\" Mot. 50. Petitioners expl ain that Dr. Rima's e xpert testimony \"was informed, in larg e par t, by what he descr ibed as his re view of la boratory notebooks, log s, and data generated in the c ourse of work by Unigenetics and made available to him to exami ne in the United Kingdom,\" but that these documents and da ta wer e not disclosed to them bef ore or during Dr. Rima's testimony . Id. Petitioners make two broa d contentions: first, that the spec ial master should have applied the general framework of the rules of evidence and civil procedure to exclude Dr. Rima's testimony, and sec ond, that they did not waive their obje ction to the use of Dr . Rima's expert report a nd testimony . Id. at 51-54. As a threshold matter, the court would be remiss if it did not highlight the fatal flaw in petitioners' argument. As noted above, the special master concluded that Unigenetics' results were unre liable, re aching that conclusion using two differ ent ana lyses: the first by considering only the publicly available evidenc e and the second by adding considera tion of the evidenc e derive d from the U.K . MMR li tigation. See Sny unadmitted evidenc e that petitioners c omplain about here is only relevant to the spec ial master' s second, a lternative a nalysis; it has no bea ring on the first. B ecause petitioners ha ve not objecte d to the primary holding of unreliability , based only upon the publicly available information, any error made by the special master in not requiring the disclosure of Dr. Rima's underlying data would be har mless. Howeve r, the spec ial master did not er r. First, petitioners' re liance upon the rules of evidence and civil procedure is m isplaced. In mo st cases before the Cou rt of Federal Cla ims, parties utilizi ng expert testimony are require d to submit a wr itten report f rom the expert, along Petitioners imply that it is problematic that only \"one F ederal Circuit decision [stated]54 that special masters can use the Daubert factors to evaluate the reliability of scientific evidence in the [Vacc ine] P rogram.\" Mot. 19 n.43 (citing T erran, 195 F .3d at 1316). How ever, that \"one\" decision is binding pr ecedent. See Pre minge r v. Sec' y of Ve terans Affa irs, F.3d 1299, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (\"A prior precedential decision on a point of law by a panel of this court is binding pr ecedent and c annot be ove rruled or avoided unless or until the court sits en banc.\" ). -42-with, among other things, \"the data or other information considered by the witness in forming\" his or her opinions. RCFC 26(a) (2)(B). The e xpert may then testify to his or her opinions \"without first testify ing to the unde rlying facts or da ta, unless the cour t require s otherwise.\" Fed. R. Evid. 705. The opposing pa rty, howeve r, may seek the disclosure of the underly ing facts or data on c ross-examination. I d. Of c ourse, these rules do not apply to proce eding s in the Vac cine Prog ram. Rather , as dictate d by Congr ess in the Vac cine Ac t, \"[t] here is no discovery as a ma tter of ht,\" Vac cine Rule cial master s are not \"bound by common law or statutory rules of e vidence ,\" Va ccine this a ssert that the more formal r ules are part of the \"general fra mework\" for evalua ting a nd weig hing e xpert testimony that the spec ial master a pplied elsewhe re in he r decision. Mot. 52. They contend that be cause the spec ial master a pplied \"[Fede ral Rule of Evidence ] 702 and the body of ca se law unde r that Rule in weig hing e vidence in this case,\" she should have a lso applied RCFC 26(a)( 2)(B) and F ederal Rule of Evidenc e 705. I d.; acc ord Ora l Argument Tr. 22-24. In her de cision, the specia l master made only one dire ct reference to Fede ral Rule of Evidence 702: In courts that apply the Fe deral Rules of Evidence , it is doubt ful that some of petitioners' e xpert witnesse s would have w ithstood challeng e under Daube rt and Rule 702, based on their lack of qualifica tions to opi ne on the subjec ts at issue and the spe culative a nd unsupported natur e of the ir opinions. I n case s filed under the Vac cine Ac t, where the rules of evidenc e do not apply , Daube rt does not generally serve as a basis to exclude testimony, but rather, a framework to weigh and evaluate testimony. Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *138 (re ferring to Dauber t v. Merre ll Dow Pharmac euticals, I nc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993)). A lthough she specula ted how other courts mig ht apply Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to the evidence in this case, the special master unequivocally stated that the rule did not apply in this proceeding. That does not mean, however, that all expert testimony, regardless of its reliability, must be admitted in Vaccine Program cases. Indeed, Vaccine Rule 8(b) r equire s that the specia l master, \"[i]n receiving evidenc e, . . . must consider a ll releva nt and reliable evidenc e governe d by principles of f undamental f airne ss to both parties.\" Thus, the Federal Circuit has sanctioned the use of the Da ubert fa ctors \"a s a tool or fra mework f or conducting the inquiry into the reliability of evidence.\" Terran ex rel. Terran v. Sec'y 1316 ( Fed. Cir. 2000); see a lso Ry man, 65 Fe d. Cl. at 40 (noting that a specia l54Moreove r, the F ederal Circuit has appr ovingly cited Da ubert subseque nt to Terra n. See Andr eu, by Andre u v. Sec'y of HHS, 569 F .3d 1367, 1379 (F ed. Cir. 2009). As respondent noted at oral argument, the arguments advanced by petitioners in55 support of excluding Dr. Rima's testimony would also support the exclusion of all of the test results from Unig enetics be cause petitioners did not submit the data unde rlying the test results as part of the ir prima fa cie case. See Oral Arg ument -43-master pe rforms whe ther a particula r s expert medical testimony supporting biolog ic proba bility may be admitted or c redited or otherwise r elied upon\") . Unlike Fe deral Rule of Evidence 702, there is no analog ue in the Vaccine Rules for Federal Rule of Evidence 705 or RCFC 26(a) (2)(B). Indeed, the re is no rig ht to cross-exami nation in Vaccine Program proceedings. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(2)(D).

The spec ial master f ound Dr. Rima's opinions to be rele vant and experts explained why even U nigenetics' hig h copy number results were not a reliable indicator of measles virus in the samples reported.\"). Thus, the spec ial master' s decision not to exclude Dr. Rima's testimony for lac k of under lying da ta was not in error .55 In addition, the specia l master's f inding of waiver was we ll-supported. As noted a bove, for va rious, leg itimate rea sons, respondent wa s unable to file the e xpert re ports obtained fr om the U.K. MMR liti until jus t before the Cedillo hearing . Petitioners ag reed that additional proceedings could be conducted with respect to the material obtained from the U.K. MMR litigation at a la ter time and indica ted that they intended to re quest additional materia ls from that litigation not obtained by respondent. The three special masters and respondent agreed to join petitioners' application. Indeed, the special masters even signed a letter in support of petitioners' application. Yet, petitioners never applied to the court in the United Kingdom for the data underly ing D r. Rima's expert repor t and testimony . Acc ording ly, the spec ial master he ld: With reg ard to their ina bility to examine any evidenc e under lying . . D tory's results, petiti oners a lso waived a ny objection by their fa ilure to reque st disclosure of such ma terials fr om the U.K. cour t. As the testimony . . . makes a bundantly clear, voluminous materials wer e filed w ith the U.K. cour t regarding the labora tory's oper ations. Although U nigenetics is no longe r in business, the U.K. c ourt is. Given the amount of impassioned a rgument devoted to the pe titioners' nee d for suc h materia ls, petitioners' fa ilure to lodg e a The spec ial master de scribed the se requests. She explained that \"[d] uring the se of U.K . litigation materia l throug h third party subpoenas to Mer ck thre e years earlier,\" but, \" [a]ppare ntly ignor ing the fa ct that the U.K. c ourt controlled r elease of the U .K. litigation mater ials, petitioners rene wed a request for the court to subpoena Merc k and other manufa cture rs to obtain the re ports of all 65 experts in the U.K. litigation.\" Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *24 (footnote urther explained: Given the U.K . court's pr otective or der on w itnesses, it does not appea r that Merck could have released those materials without the consent of the U.K. court, even if order ed to do so by Special Master Hasting s.

As previously noted, the Va ccine Act provide s that \"[t] here may be no discove ry in a proce eding on a petition other than the discovery require d by the spec ial master.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(3)(B); accord Vaccine Rule 7(a) (\"There is no discovery as a matter of right.\"). In the House Report supporting the original Vaccine Act, Congress explained that because it expected a spe cial master \"to be vig orous and dilig ent in investiga ting f actua l elements nec essar y to determine the validity of the pe titioner's claim,\" discove ry would be at the \" of the specia l master. H.R. Rep. No. 99- 908, at 14-15. Subsequently , in the Confere nce Re port supporting the 1989 amendments to the Vaccine Act, Congress elaborated: \"The system is intended to allow the pr oceedings to be conducte d in what has c ome to be known a s an 'inquisitorial' format, with the maste r Rep.

It is clear from pe titioners' description that none of their pre-2007 efforts included an attempt to obtain the materials directly from the United Kingdom court.

Petitioners' sove eign agreement wher eby specia l masters have unfetter ed ac cess to all docume nts possessed by foreign tr ibunals, where ver located, e ven those filed unde r seal. This notion i s simply untrue. The specia l master explained this to petitioners at hearing: I noted that the Hague Con vention governed subpoenas in foreign jurisdictions,58 and that a subpoe na for a docume nt under sea l was not the normal method of obtaining [the information sought]. Once again, respondent's counsel offered to assist petitioners in obtaining a ny documents they soug ht, and stated that U.K . law allowed third pa rties, including private litig ants, to obtain matters filed unde r seal. The spec ial master c ommented: \"Petitioners' fa ilure to reque st to reopen to present the . . . 'new evidence' prior to the decision issuing this case says -46-Snyder, 2009 WL 332044, at *26 (footnote added). Although the special master had complete control over the discovery process in this case, such control does not extend to compelling a court in a f oreig n jurisdiction to unseal documents. Petitioners acknow ledged this fac t at oral argument before the undersigned. See Oral Argument Tr. 8 (\"[T]he special masters consistently said that they did not have the powe r on their own to obtain that infor mation from the United Kingdom jurisdiction.\"), 12 (agreeing that the special masters lacked \"the authority or the ability to move J ustice Ke ith to produce those mate rials\") . Acc ording ly, the spec ial master did not improperly shift the burden to petitioners to obtain the documents from the U.K. MMR litigation-there was no burde n to shift because the spec ial master c ould not have obtained the evidenc e soug ht by petitioners in the first instance . And, bec ause she gave pe titioners ever y opportunity to obtain those documents, and expressly supported their application, petitioners' failure to apply to the court in the United K ingdom f or the doc uments is sufficient for a finding of waiver. For all of the foregoing reasons, the court finds that the special master did not abuse her discretion in considering Dr. Rima's testimony absent the underlying data. Petitioners' fifth numbere d objection is rejec ted. F. ence In their sixth numbered objection, petitioners contend that the special master erred in deny ing the ir motion for rec onsideration, and, a ccordingly , refusing to c onsider the \" new\" evidenc e submitted with their motion, which was \"not a vailable a t the time of the hea ring in June of 2007 . . . .\" Mo t. 54-55. Specifically, they nce sig nificantly affects many critica l aspec ts of the spec ial master's decision. Given the familiarity of the special master with the science in Colten's case , and g iven the limited nature of this new evidenc e, the spe cial master should have been a ble to quickly decide if this new evidenc e is worthy of considera tion. I n light of the signific ance of the e vidence , and in light of the impact of this decision upon thousands of a utisti c childre n in the Prog ram, he r failure to do so was an a buse of discr etion. Id. at 55. The spec ial master' s Marc h 16, 2009 ruling on petitioners' motion for re considera tion contains the salient f acts. Petitioners filed their motion on Friday , Marc h 13, 2009, at 6:02 p.m. Almost all of the \"new \" evide nce submitted with the motion was published befor e she r ender ed her de cision. The de adline for filing suc h a motion, pursuant to Vac cine Rule 10(c ), wa s Marc h59volumes about the value of this evidence to any causa tion decision and spea ks loudly about the motivation for the untimely filing.\" Ruling Mot. Recons. (\" Ruling\") 2 n.2, Mar. 16, 2009. In so ruling, the specia l master re marke d: \"The untimely filing of this mot ion for60 reconsideration, on the eve of the deadline for filing a motion for review of my decision, suggests a thinly veiled ef fort by petitioners' c ounsel to obtain additional time for filing their motion for revie w, while plac ing a dditional evidence befor e the c ourt.\" Ruling 2; se e also id. at 2 n.4 (noting that if a spec ial master g rants a motion for r econside ration, he or she must withdraw the underly ing de cision, rende ring it \"void for all purpose s, including the triggering of the 30 da y period for filing a n appea l\"). For this reason, the court has disregarded all of the references and citations in61 petitioners' motion for re view to the evide nce submitted with their motion for re considera tion. See, e.g ., Mot. 35 n.52, 44, 48-49. -47-5, 2009. And, pursuant to Va ccine Rule 23, the thirty -day filing de adline for any motion for revie w fell on Monday , Marc h 16, 2009. The spec ial master de clared that petitioners' motion was untimely, that \"the last minute nature of the filing and petitioners' failure to demonstrate60 good cause for that untimely filing\" nece ssitated a denia l of the motion, and that eve n if she considere d the merits of the motion, petitioners \"f ailed to demonstrate that the intere st of justice would be ser ved by granting their motion . . . .\" Ruling 2-3. Special master s have \" wide discre tion in conducting the proce eding s in a se.\" B urns, ed. Cl. at 338- 39; Sword, 44 Fed. Cl. at 190. This discretion \"applies to petitions for reconsideration of rulings, and prof fers desig ned to supplement the fa ctual re cord a fter the record is closed.\" Sword, 44 Fed. Cl. at 190. The cour t finds no abuse of disc retion her e. The spec ial master he ld that61 petitioners failed to comply with the requirements of the Vaccine Rules, and even had they so complied, the evidence was insufficient to result in the granting of their motion. Both of these reasons for the special master's denial of petitioners' motion were well within her discretion to make. As the Court of Fe deral Claims commented in Sword: [T]hi s Court will not aid a party who seeks to present additional evidence after his initial effort prove attorney worth his or her salt would not try a case a bit differ ently once c ounsel knew w hat the fa ct-finde r found important within the Subsection (c) (1) require s, among other thing s, that the following elements be62 satisfied: (1) tha t the vacc ine in question is set forth in the Vac cine I njury Table ( \"Table\") ; (2) that the vac cine wa s received in the United States or in its t rust territorie s; (3) that the injured person e ither sustained a n injury as a r esult of the administration of a Table- desig nated va ccine for a period of more than six mon ths after the administration of the vaccine, suffered illness, disability , injury , or condition from the va ccine that resulted in inpatient hospitalization and surgical interve ntion, or died from the a dminist ration of the va ccine ; and (4) tha t the petitioner has not previously collecte d an aw ard or settlement of a c ivil action for dama ges arising fr om the alleg ed vac cine- related injury or th. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-11(c )(1). -48-body of evidence?

Prior to addressing petitioners' argument, a brie f summary of the re levant F ederal Circuit prec edent is instructive. 1. Proving Causation Un der the V accine Ac t Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(a )(1), the cour t shall awar d tion if a petitioner proves, by a pre pondera nce of evidenc e, all of the elements set f orth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa- 11(c) (1), a nd there is not a preponde rance of e vidence that the illness is not due to factors unrela ted to the administration of the va ccine . A petitioner in the Va ccine Prog ram c an re cover62 in one of two wa ys: either by proving an injury listed on the Table or by proving causa tion-in- fact. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-11(c)(1)(C), -13(a)(1). In this case, petitioners did not attempt to prove a Table injury beca use eve n though the relevant vac cines a re listed on the Ta ble, Colten's alleged injuries are not. Thus, petitioners proceeded on a causation-in-fact theory. To establish a prima f acie case when pr oceeding on a causa tion-in-fac t theory , a petitioner must \"prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the vaccine was not only a but-for c ause of the injury but also a substantial fac tor in bring ing a bout the injury .\" Shy face v.

In Althen, the Federal Circuit articulated a three-part test, based on this prior precedent, explaining what a petitioner must show to prove causation-in-fact under the Vaccine Act: [Petitioner]'s burden is to show a me dical theor y causa lly connec ting the vac cination and the injury ; (2) a log ical seque nce of cause and ef fect showing that the vac cination was the reason for the injury ; and (3) a showing of a proxi mate tempora l relationship betwee n vacc ination and injury . 418 F.3d at 1278. The first prong seeks to demonstrate whether \"'the vaccine(s) at issue cause the ty pe of ed.'\" Paffor d, 451 F.3d 1355-56 (quoting the dec ision of the specia l master a s recited by the trial cour t).

Taking petitioners' view to its logical conclusion, in order to demonstrate fundame ntal fairne ss, a spec ial master would be require d to admit and cre dit a cer tain, unspecifie d perc entag e of the evidenc e prof fered at aring . Thus, the notion of fundame ntal fairne ss would be re duced to nothing more that a n examination of perce ntage rate for the admission and acceptance of evidence, i.e., a quota. Petitioners' unsound construct is contrary to established law. A t hear ing, a specia l master must determine not only the admissibilit y of evidence, but how to w eigh and credit that evidence, even if it is offered by a properly credentialed expert witness. -51-56. They do not expand on this alleg ation to show how err or wa s committed or provide a ny citation to the portions of the dec ision containing the alleg ed misapplication. Thus, petitioners place the burde n on the cour t to divine precisely how the spec ial master' s application of Da ubert might have been imprope r. Daube rt requir es a tria l judge to perfor m \"a pr eliminary assessment of w hether the reasoning or methodology underly ing the testimony is scientifically valid and of w hether that reasoning or methodology proper ly can be applied to the fa cts in issue.\" 509 U.S. at 592-93. is, . . . a flexible one.

The spec ial master indica ted that while the testimony of petitioners' e xperts wa s often66 sincere and hea rtfelt, it was, a t times, speculative.

Her e, the spe cial master considere d all of the re levant evide nce submitt ed by both parties, using the Daube rt fac tors only to determine the reliability of that evidenc e and, he nce, the weig ht it shoul d be assig ned. I ndeed, by allowing all rele vant evidenc e to be admitted into the rec ord, re gardle ss of its reliability , the spec ial master wa s actua lly being quite generous to petitioners. As the special master noted throughout her decision, petitioners' expert witnesses compared unfavorably to respondent's expert witnesses in many respects: their credentials, their demeanor, how forthcoming they were at hearing, and the quality of their65 testimony . See, e.g ., Sny & nn.34-65 (de scribing the66 credentials, expertise, and testimony of all of the e xpert witnesse s). According ly, to the extent that petiti oners a re complaining that the spe cial master 's use of the Daube rt fac tors resulted in a f ailure to c onsider their e vidence , they are mistaken. Rather, the specia l master eva luated all of the evidenc e pre sented by both parties and de termined that the scienc e behind pe titioners' theory was lac king. Contra ry to petitioners' conte ntion that the investiga tion into t he link betwee n the MMR vacc ine, along with all thimerosal-conta ining vaccines, and a utism spectrum disorders \" is 'bere ft' of sc ience ,\" Mot. 11, the re cord demonstrates that there is an abundance of science in this area-just not science that supports petitioners' position. The spec ial master' s application of Da ubert wa s in acc ordanc e with the law. After briefing had conc luded on petitioners' motion for r eview, but pr ior to oral67 argument, the Fe deral Circuit issued its decision in Andre u, rea ffirming its prior holdings that the testimony of treating physicians is \"'quite probative' since 'treating physicians are likely to be in the best position to determine whe ther a logic al seque nce of cause and ef fect show[s ] that the vaccination was the re ason for the injury .'\" 569 F .3d at 1375 (quoting Capizz ano, 440 F .3d at 1326, and citing Althen, 418 F.3d a t 1279-80; Z atuchni v. Sec' y of HHS, 69 F ed. Cl. 612, 623 (2006)) . Howeve r, there is nothing in Andre u that mandates tha t the testimony of a tre ating physician is sacr osanct-that it must be acc epted in its entirety and ca nnot be re butted. I ndeed, the Fe deral Circuit did not di sturb its prior holdings conc erning the def erence a ccorded the specia l masters' f indings of f acts. I n any event, pe titioners did not raise Andre u's discussion of treating phy sicians at ora l argument; in fact, they do not contend in their motion for re view that the special master improperly considered the evidence from a ny of Colten's treating physicians in this case, including the sole testify ing tr eating physician-Dr. B radstre et. Acc ording ly, an analy sis of Andreu a s it relates to the testimony of trea ting phy sicians is unnece ssary here . have e stablished a prima f acie case pursuant to the three -part test set forth in Althen and that r espondent fa iled to establish an alter native ca use. I d. at 59. Their argument, in its entirety, is as follows: Has Colten satisfied the A lthen fac tors? Clearly , he has a medical theor y. His evidence is strong that the MMR vaccine is capable of causing a wide variety of brain injuries, including autism. Next, th ere was a logical sequence of cause and ef fect betwee n his MMR vaccine a nd the injury . He wa s healthy , received a n MMR vaccine , and as his tre ating physicians attest, he w as neve r again the same . There is no question that his symptoms first occurred within an appropriate time after the MMR vacc ine. This fac t is supported by Colten's medical re cords a nd by the re spondent's expert Dr. G riffin. I t is even supported by the Vac cine I njury Table tha t lists \"5-15\" days after the MMR as the appr opriate time fr ame f or the onset of sy mptoms of brain damag e. See 42 U .S.C. S ection 300aa -14. Id. Such a per functory argument require s little attention. As noted above , the spec ial master f ound under the first prong of the Althen te st that petitioners' medic al theory was not re liable. See Sny der, 2009 WL 332044, at *194-95. Unde r the sec ond prong , she found that ther e beca use unr eliability of the test re sults indi cating the pre sence of mea sles virus in Colt en's CSF a nd the absolute ne cessity of the pre sence of mea sles virus for petitioners' theor y of ca usation. I d. at *195-97. She a lso found that the medica l records and medical opinion testimony of Dr. B radstre et, one of Colten's treating physicians, wer e unsupportive of c ausative link. Id. Wit h respe ct to the third prong , the spec ial master f ound,67 based on the objective e vidence in Colt en's medic al records, that the onse t of Colten's speec h-56-problems began between the ages of seventeen and nineteen months (approximately June through August of 1998), over a month afte r his April 23, 1998 MMR vaccina tion. I d. at bec had fa iled to establish a prima fa cie case of entitlement, the burde n of proving an alter native ca use neve r shifted to re spondent. I d. at *198. The c ourt finds no err or in the spec ial master' s findings. The specia l master's c onclusion that petitioners did not present a biologica lly plausible medica l theory is clear ly supported by the record. She found that the va rious aspec ts of petitioners' theor y were not scientifica lly sound and that the ly nchpin of their the ory was wholly unreliable . See at that petitioners had not established a log ical seque nce of cause and ef fect is also supported by the re cord. A s noted above, pe titioners' theory of ca usation depende d upon, among other thing s, Colten's immune system being damag ed by the MMR vacc ine (but not thimerosal-c ontaining va ccine s), the persistenc e of the in Colten's body , Colten's development of inf lammatory bowel disease, a nd the pre sence of the mea sles virus in Colt en's br ain. The spe cial master found that petitioners had de monstrated none of these ne cessa ry elements by a pre pondera nce of the evidenc e. See id. a t *185-86 (dy sregulated virus). F urther, the specia l master's conclusion that the onset of Colten's symptoms did not occur within a biologically acceptable time period following the MMR vacc ination is supported by the re cord. She f ound that based on the medica l records, the onset of Colten's sy mptoms di d not occur at the time sug gested by petitioners. I d. at *197-98. Give n that petitioners had not esta blished any of the prong s of the test set forth in Althen, the spe cial master correctly conclude d that the burde n of proving an alterna tive cause never shifted to responde nt. See B radle y, 991 F.2d a t 1575. Petitioners' complaints with the specia l master's de cision amount to nothing more tha n dissatisfaction with the weig ht she assig ned to the evide nce. Y et, as the c ourt has re peate d throug hout this opi nion, the specia l master is ac corde d great defe rence in deter mining how much weig ht to assign to the e vidence in the rec ord. She wa s the one who r ead a ll of the medica l records, expert repor ts, and medica l literature, a nd hear d all of the testimony , placing her in the best position to ascertain whe ther pe titioners established a pr ima fac ie case of c ausation. The special master exercised her discretion appropriately here and her decision was not contrary to law. The court thus re jects petitioners' se venth numbere d objection. H. P etitioner s' Allegation of B ias The c ourt has essed a ll of petitioners' number ed objec tions, them to be without merit. Howeve r, petitioners lodg e other complaints about the spec ial master' s conduct that despite their lac k of merit, ca nnot be ig nored.

I n light of pe titioners' failure to support their bias claim in their motion for re view, they sought to provide some clarification to their allegations at oral argument, as discussed in the text to protect vaccine integrity in a very public case, chose to impose upon [petitioners] an unattainable standa rd of pr oof. To protec t the vacc ine's integ rity she re jected ll of petitioner's cr edible evide nce a nd simply accepted the c onclusions of the re spondent's nteen [petit ioners] fairne ss Vac cine Rules, ig nored Congr ess'[s] intent nd reje cted the F ederal of that intent. Id. at 19-21. F inally , at ora l argument, petitioners attempted to justify their cha rge of bia s by arguing that it was fundamentally unfair for the special master to admit the purportedly unreliable evidenc e from Dr. B ustin and Dr. Rima and, ther eafter, \" allow[] the cr edibility of those witnesses to substit ute for the reliability of those witnesses on ke y issues . . . .\" Ora the backla sh ag ainst vacc ines if she ruled in their favor-is preposterous. There is not a shred of evidence to support petitioners' claim; it rests solely on petitioners' spec ulation. Merely beca use the spec ial master f ound that70 petitioners did not car ry their burde n of proof does not diminish her integ rity or re nder he r decision unsupported. Cla ims of error by a losing party against a decision maker are hardly unusual, but should be g rounded in re ality. There is an enormous c hasm betwe en disag reement with a judicial offic er's findings of fact and conc lusions of law and the a ccusa tion that the judicial office r is, in essence , intellectually dishonest. An alleg ation of bias ra ises ethical concerns, not errors in judgment (i.e., legal or factual errors). Although petitioners appeared to understand this distinction at oral ar gument, they maintained that the spe cial master was biase d against them by unfairly \"shift[ing] the burden of disc overy \" and at 32-33. How ever, alleg ed er rors of this nature are grounded on pur portedly mistaken evidentiar y ruling s, fac tual finding s, and leg al conc lusions, not bi as. And, the c ourt has alr eady held that it identified no leg al or fa ctual er ror in the spe cial master 's dec ision. Indeed, it is abundantly clear from he r decision that the special master took great care in considering all of the e vidence in the rec ord-whe ther pre sented by petitioners or re spondent-and apply ing the appropr iate leg al standar ds in evaluating that evidenc e. As the Court of F ederal Claims st ated in Ultimo:-59-This sort of persona l attack on the [specia l master] is highly intent of Cong ress in establishing the Prog ram. The court will not condone suc h frivolous, unsubstantiated ac cusations. Acc ording ly, the cour t finds that petitioner's . . . objection is without merit. Petitioner forewarned that any repe tition of such gr oundless acc usations may cause the cour t to entertain sanctions agai nst petitioner an d petitioner's counsel pursuant to RCFC 11. 28 Fe d. Cl. at 153. III. CONCLUSION As the spec ial master' s decision makes c lear, Colten, and by extension, hi s family , have dealt with sig nificant a dversity for many years, and, like the spec ial master, the c ourt is very sympathetic to their circumstances. However, the court cannot be ruled by emotion and base its deter mination solely upon the adve rsity endure d by petitioners' fa mily. Moreove r, it is not the task of this court to deter mine whether vacc ines ca use autism or other ne urodeve lopmental disorders. Rather, the court mus t decide whether the special master, considering the record as a whole, re ndere d a dec ision that was arbitra ry, capr icious, an abuse of discre tion, or otherwise not in acc ordanc e with the law. She did not. He r dec ision was entirely rational a nd fully supported by the record. Thus, the court DENIES petitioners' motion for re view. Pursuant to Vac cine Rule 30(a) , the cler k is directed to e nter judg ment in acc ordanc e with this decision. IT IS SO ORDERED. s/ Margaret M. Sweeney MARGARET M. SW EENEY Judge "}
