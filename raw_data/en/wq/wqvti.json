Sec. 1. (1) On September 13, 2017, the joint legislative audit and review committee distributed the 17 -06 final report: Fees assessed for forest fire protection. The report identified more than twenty thousand parcels of land that do not pay the forest fire prot ection assessment or a local fire district levy but are likely still protected by the department of natural resources or a local fire district. The legislature finds that fire protection services at the state and local level are vital to the preservation o f public and personal property throughout the state. The legislature further finds that fire protection resources are very limited in carrying out the substantial duties that fire protection services are asked to perform. Therefore, properties that benefit from fire protection should be required to contribute to the operation and maintenance of such essential services. (2)(a) A local fire district may propose to annex any parcel or parcels having all boundaries of the property wholly within the external bou ndary of the requesting local fire district if such parcel or parcels are not presently being assessed a local fire district levy. (b) Prior to annexing a parcel or parcels under this section the local fire district must: (i) Verify with the county assesso r that the parcel or parcels have all boundaries of the property wholly within the external boundary of the requesting local fire district and are not presently assessed a local fire district levy; (ii) Notify the owner of record of each parcel in writing no less than sixty days prior to conducting a public hearing that the local fire district is seeking to annex the parcel; and (iii) Hold at least one public hearing on the proposed annexation. (3) Following the hearing, the local fire district must determi ne by resolution whether any parcel will be annexed. After adoption of the resolution, the local fire district must send a copy to the county legislative authority, the county assessor, and the owner of record of any parcel proposed to be annexed. The reso lution must include a list of all parcels proposed to be annexed. (4) Within thirty days of notification of the resolution, the owner of record of a parcel proposed to be annexed may appeal the proposed annexation to the county legislative authority. Issue s raised under appeal may include compliance with the process established under this section, whether the parcel is presently being assessed a local fire district levy, whether the levied amount is consistent with local fire district levy amounts, whether the local fire district actually has the resources to provide the parcel or parcels with timely service. The county legislative authority may address multiple appeals at the same hearing. The decision of the county legislative authority or its designee is not appealable. (5) If the proposed annexation is upheld or no appeal is made within thirty days of notification of the resolution, the county legislative authority must approve the proposed annexation of any parcel or parcels of land submitted under subse ction (3) of this section into the local fire district. The order must include a description of the property to be annexed and the effective date of the annexation. The order is not subject to referendum. (6) A notice of intention must be filed with the bo undary review board created under RCW 36.93.030. However, the jurisdiction of the board may not be invoked as described in RCW 36.93.100 for annexations under this section. (7) Any local fire district levy to be imposed on a parcel annexed in accordance wi th this section may not be assessed until the next tax assessment cycle following the annexation. (8) Annexations of a parcel or parcels of land under this section must be initiated by January 1, 2021. (9) For the purposes of this section, \"local fire dist rict\" means a fire district, regional fire protection service authority, city, or town. (10) The annexation process established under this section is not exclusive and does not limit annexation through other statutory authorities.\" Correct the title. and the same are herewith transmitted.

Where a person is found to be in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor o r any drug or was under the age of twenty -one at the time of the arrest and was in physical control of a motor vehicle while having alcohol in his or her system in a concentration of 0.02 or THC concentration above 0.00, the person may petition the hearing officer to apply the affirmative defense found in RCW 46.61.504(3) and 46.61.503(2). The driver has the burden to prove the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The sworn report or report under a declaration authorized by ((RCW 9A.72.08 5)) chapter 5.50 RCW submitted by a law enforcement officer is prima facie evidence that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe the person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within this state while under the influe nce of intoxicating liquor or drugs, or both, or the person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within this state while having alcohol in his or her system in a concentration of 0.02 or more, or THC in his or her system in a concentration above 0.00, and was under the age of twenty -one and that the officer complied with the requirements of this section. A hearing officer shall conduct the hearing, may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, and shall administer oaths to witnesses.

The sworn report or report under a declaration authorized by ((RCW 9A.72.085 )) chapter 5.50 RCW of the law enforcement officer and any other evidence accompanying the report shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation and the certificati ons authorized by the criminal rules for courts of limited jurisdiction shall be admissible without further evidentiary foundation. The person may be represented by counsel, may question witnesses, may present evidence, and may testify. The department shal l order that the suspension, revocation, or denial either be rescinded or sustained. (8) If the suspension, revocation, or denial is sustained after such a hearing, the person whose license, privilege, or permit is suspended, revoked, or denied has the rig ht to file a petition in the superior court of the county of arrest to review the final order of revocation by the department in the same manner as an appeal from a decision of a court of limited jurisdiction. Notice of appeal must be filed within thirty d ays after the date the final order is served or the right to appeal is waived. Notwithstanding RCW 46.20.334, RALJ 1.1, or other statutes or rules referencing de novo review, the appeal shall be limited to a review of the record of the administrative heari ng. The appellant must pay the costs associated with obtaining the record of the hearing before the hearing officer. The filing of the appeal does not stay the effective date of the suspension, revocation, or denial. A petition filed under this subsection must include the petitioner 's grounds for requesting review. Upon granting petitioner 's request for review, the court shall review the department 's final order of suspension, revocation, or denial as expeditiously as possible. The review must be limited to a determination of whether the department has committed any errors of law. The superior court shall accept those factual determinations supported by substantial evidence in the record: (a) That were expressly made by the department; or (b) that may reason ably be inferred from the final order of the department. The superior court may reverse, affirm, or modify the decision of the department or remand the case back to the department for further proceedings. The decision of the superior court must be in writi ng and filed in the clerk 's office with the other papers in the case. The court shall state the reasons for the decision. If judicial relief is sought for a stay or other temporary remedy from the department 's action, the court shall not grant such relief unless the court finds that the appellant is likely to prevail in the appeal and that without a stay the appellant will suffer irreparable injury. If the court stays the suspension, revocation, or denial it may impose conditions on such stay. (9)(a) If a p erson whose driver 's license, permit, or privilege to drive has been or will be suspended, revoked, or denied under subsection (6) of this section, other than as a result of a breath test refusal, and who has not committed an offense for which he or she wa s granted a deferred prosecution under chapter 10.05 RCW, petitions a court for a deferred prosecution on criminal charges arising out of the arrest for which action has been or will be taken under subsection (6) of this section, or notifies the department of licensing of the intent to seek such a deferred prosecution, then the license suspension or revocation shall be stayed pending entry of the deferred prosecution. The stay shall not be longer than one hundred fifty days after the date charges are filed, or two years after the date of the arrest, whichever time period is shorter. If the court stays the suspension, revocation, or denial, it may impose conditions on such stay. If the person is otherwise eligible for licensing, the department shall issue a temporary license, or extend any valid temporary license under subsection (5) of this section, for the period of the stay. If a deferred prosecution treatment plan is not recommended in the report made under RCW 10.05.050, or if treatment is rejected by the court, or if the person declines to accept an offered treatment plan, or if the person violates any condition imposed by the court, then the court shall immediately direct the department to cancel the stay and any temporary license or extension of a tempo rary license issued under this subsection. (b) A suspension, revocation, or denial imposed under this section, other than as a result of a breath test refusal, shall be stayed if the person is accepted for deferred prosecution as provided in chapter 10.05 RCW for the incident upon which the suspension, revocation, or denial is based. If the deferred prosecution is terminated, the stay shall be lifted and the suspension, revocation, or denial reinstated. If the deferred prosecution is completed, the stay sha ll be lifted and the suspension, revocation, or denial canceled. (c) The provisions of (b) of this subsection relating to a stay of a suspension, revocation, or denial and the cancellation of any suspension, revocation, or denial do not apply to the suspension, revocation, denial, or disqualification of a person 's commercial driver 's license or privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle. (10) When it has been finally determined under the procedures of this section that a nonresident 's privilege t o operate a motor vehicle in this state has been suspended, revoked, or denied, the department shall give information in writing of the action taken to the motor vehicle administrator of the state of the person 's residence and of any state in which he or s he has a license.

PRESIDENT: The House passed ENGROSSED SUBSTITUTE SENATE BILL NO. 5035 with the following amendment(s): 5035 -S.E AMH LAWS H2453.1 Strike everything after the enacting claus e and insert the following: \"NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature finds: (1) That from the shift in the 1980s from criminal to civil penalties for prevailing wage violations that the law needs some enhancements to effectively provide the department of labor and industries with the ability to utilize its civil remedies to both discourage and penalize repeat and willful violations of the law. (2) Revisions to chapter 39.12 RCW are long overdue and are necessary to appropriately address filing and reportin g procedures and penalties, which are necessary to strengthen enforcement of and deterrence from repeat and/or willful violations of the chapter. Sec. 2. RCW 39.12.010 and 1989 c 12 s 6 are each amended to read as follows: (1) The \"prevailing rate of wage \"((, for the intents and purposes of this chapter, shall be )) is the rate of hourly wage, usual benefits, and overtime paid in the locality, as hereinafter defined, to the majority of workers, laborers, or mechanics, in the same trade or occupation. In the event that there is not a majority in the same trade or occupation paid at the same rate, then the average rate of hourly wage and overtime paid to such laborers, workers, or mechanics in the same trade or occupation (( shall be )) is the prevailing rate. I f the wage paid by any contractor or subcontractor to laborers, workers, or mechanics on any public work is based on some period of time other than an hour, the hourly wage (( for the purposes of this chapter shall be )) is mathematically determined by the n umber of hours worked in such period of time. (2) The \"locality\" (( for the purposes of this chapter shall be )) is the largest city in the count qy wherein the physical work is being performed. (3) The \"usual benefits\" (( for the purposes of this chapter shall)) include s the amount of: (a) The rate of contribution irrevocably made by a contractor or subcontractor to a trustee or to a third person pursuant to a fund, plan, or program; and (b) The rate of costs to the contractor or subcontractor , which may be re asonably anticipated in providing benefits to workers, laborers, and mechanics pursuant to an enforceable commitment to carry out a financially responsible plan or program which was communicated in writing to the workers, laborers, and mechanics affected, for medical or hospital care, pensions on retirement or death, compensation for injuries or illness resulting from occupational activity, or insurance to provide any of the foregoing, for unemployment benefits, life insurance, disability and sickness insur ance, or accident insurance, for vacation and holiday pay, for defraying costs of apprenticeship or other similar programs, or for other bona fide fringe benefits, but only where the contractor or subcontractor is not required by other federal, state, or l ocal law to provide any of such benefits. 32 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE (4) An \"interested party\" (( for the purposes of this chapter shall )) include s a contractor, subcontractor, an employee of a contractor or subcontractor, an organization whose members ' wages, benefits, and condition s of employment are affected by this chapter, and the director of labor and industries or the director 's designee. (5) An \"inadvertent filing or reporting error\" is a mistake and is made notwithstanding the use of due care by the contractor, subcontractor, or employer. An inadvertent filing or reporting error includes a contractor who, in good faith, relies on a written determination provided by the department of labor and industries and pays its workers, laborers, and mechanics accordingly, but is later fo und to have not paid the proper prevailing wage rate. (6) \"Unpaid prevailing wages\" or \"unpaid wages\" means the employer fails to pay all of the prevailing rate of wages owed for any workweek by the regularly established pay day for the period in which the workweek ends. Every employer must pay all wages, other than usual benefits, owing to its employees not less than once a month. Every employer must pay all usual benefits owing to its employees by the regularly established deadline for those benefits. (7) \"Rate of contribution\" means the effective annual rate of usual benefit contributions for all hours, public and private, worked during the year by an employee (commonly referred to as \"annualization\" of benefits). The only exemption to the annualization r equirements is for defined contribution pension plans that have immediate participation and vesting. Sec. 3. RCW 39.12.050 and 2009 c 219 s 3 are each amended to read as follows: (1) Any contractor or subcontractor who files a false statement or fails to file any statement or record required to be filed or fails to post a document required to be posted under this chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter, shall, after a determination to that effect has been issued by the director after hearing under chapter 34.05 RCW, forfeit as a civil penalty the sum of five hundred dollars for each false filing or failure to file or post , and shall not be permitted to bid, or have a bid considered, on any public works contract until the penalty has been paid in fu ll to the director. The civil penalty under this subsection (( shall )) does not apply to a violation determined by the director to be an inadvertent filing or reporting error. The burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an error is inadv ertent rests with the contractor or subcontractor charged with the error. Civil penalties shall be deposited in the public works administration account. To the extent that a contractor or subcontractor has not paid wages at the rate due pursuant to RCW 39. 12.020, and a finding to that effect has been made as provided by this subsection, such unpaid wages (( shall )) constitute a lien against the bonds and retainage as provided in RCW 18.27.040, 19.28.041, 39.08.010, and 60.28.011. (2) If a contractor or subco ntractor is found to have violated the provisions of subsection (1) of this section for a second time within a five year period, the contractor or subcontractor (( shall be)) is subject to the sanctions prescribed in subsection (1) of this section and shall not be allowed to bid on any public works contract for one year. The one year period (( shall )) run s from the date of notice by the director of the determination of noncompliance. When an appeal is taken from the director 's determination, the one year peri od (( shall )) commence s from the date (( of the final determination of the appeal )) the notice of violation becomes final . The director shall issue his or her findings that a contractor or subcontractor has violated the provisions of this subsection after a hearing held subject to the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW , unless a notice of violation is not timely appealed. A notice of violation not timely appealed is final and binding, and not subject to further appeal . Sec. 4. RCW 39.12.065 and 2009 c 219 s 4 a re each amended to read as follows: (1) Upon complaint by an interested party, the director of labor and industries shall cause an investigation to be made to determine whether there has been compliance with this chapter and the rules adopted hereunder, an d if the investigation indicates that a violation may have occurred, the department of labor and industries may issue a notice of violation for unpaid wages, penalties, and interest on all wages owed at one percent per month. A hearing shall be held follow ing a timely appeal of the notice of violation in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW. The director shall issue a written determination including his or her findings after the hearing unless a notice of violation is not timely appealed. A notice of violation not timely appealed is final and binding, and not subject to further appeal . A judicial appeal from the director 's determination may be taken in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW, with the prevailing party entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorney s' fees. A complaint concerning nonpayment of the prevailing rate of wage shall be filed with the department of labor and industries no later than (( thirty )) sixty days from the acceptance date of the public works project. The department may not charge a c ontractor or subcontractor with a violation of this section when responding to a complaint filed after the sixty -day limit. The failure to timely file such a complaint (( shall )) does not prohibit the department from investigating the matter and recovering unpaid wages for the worker(s) within two years from the acceptance of the public works contract. The department may not investigate or recover unpaid wages if the complaint is filed after two years from the acceptance of a public works contract. The failu re to timely file such a complaint also does not prohibit a claimant from pursuing a private right of action against a contractor or subcontractor for unpaid prevailing wages. The remedy provided by this section is not exclusive and is concurrent with any other remedy provided by law. (2) To the extent that a contractor or subcontractor has not paid the prevailing rate of wage under a determination issued as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the director shall notify the agency awarding the public works contract of the amount of the violation found, and the awarding agency shall withhold, or in the case of a bond, the director shall proceed against the bond in accordance with the applicable statute to recover, such amount from the following sources in the following order of priority until the total of such amount is withheld: (a) The retainage or bond in lieu of retainage as provided in RCW 60.28.011; (b) If the claimant was employed by the contractor or subcontractor on the public works project, th e bond filed by the contractor or subcontractor with the department of labor and industries as provided in RCW 18.27.040 and 19.28.041; (c) A surety bond, or at the contractor 's or subcontractor 's option an escrow account, running to the director in the am ount of the violation found; and (d) That portion of the progress payments which is properly allocable to the contractor or subcontractor who is found to be in violation of this chapter. Under no circumstances shall any portion of the progress payments be withheld that are properly allocable to a contractor, subcontractor, or supplier, that is not found to be in violation of this chapter. The amount withheld shall be released to the director to distribute in accordance with the director 's determination. (3) A contractor or subcontractor that is found, in accordance JOURNAL OF THE SENATE 33 NINETY SIXTH DAY, APRIL 19, 2019 2019 REGULAR SESSION with subsection (1) of this section, to have violated the requirement to pay the prevailing rate of wage (( shall be )) is subject to a civil penalty of not less than (( one)) five thousand dollars o r an amount equal to (( twenty )) fifty percent of the total prevailing wage violation found on the contract, whichever is greater, interest on all wages owed at one percent per month, and ((shall )) is not (( be)) permitted to bid, or have a bid considered, on any public works contract until such civil penalty has been paid in full to the director.

Civil penalties shall be de posited in the public works administration account. If a previous or subsequent violation of a requirement to pay a prevailing rate of wage under federal or other state law is found against the contractor or subcontractor within five years from a violation under this section, the contractor or subcontractor shall not be allowed to bid on any public works contract for two years. The two -year period runs from the date of notice by the director of the determination of noncompliance. When an appeal is taken fro m the director 's determination, the two -year period commences from the date the notice of violation becomes final.

The civil penalty and sanctions under this subsection (( shall )) do not apply to a violation determined by the director to be an inadvertent filing or reporting error. The burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an error is inadvertent rests with the contractor or subcontractor charged with the error. To the extent that a contractor or subcontra ctor has not paid the prevailing wage rate under a determination issued as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the unpaid wages (( shall )) constitute a lien against the bonds and retainage as provided herein and in RCW 18.27.040, 19.28.041, 39.08.01 0, and 60.28.011. (4) The director may waive or reduce a penalty or additional sanction under this section including, but not limited to, when the director determines the contractor or subcontractor paid all wages and interest or there was an inadvertent f iling or reporting error. The director may not waive or reduce interest. The department of labor and industries shall submit a report of the waivers made under this section, including a justification for any waiver made, upon request of an interested party .

(6) A contractor or subcontractor may only utilize the process outlined in subsection (5) of this section if the department of labor and industries has not issued a notice of violation that resulted in final judgment under this section against that contractor or subcontractor in the last five -year period. If a contractor or subcontractor utilizes the process outlined in subsection (5) of this section for a second time within a five -year period, the contractor or subcontractor is subject to the sanctions prescribed in subsection (3) of this section and may not be allowed to bid on any public works contract for two years.

PRESIDENT: The House passed ENGROSSED SUBSTITUTE SENATE BILL NO. 5127 with the following amendment(s): 5127 -S.E AMH APP H2706.1 Strike everything after the clause and insert the following: \"Sec. 1. RCW 46.63. 110 and 2012 c 82 s 1 are each amended to read as follows: (1) A person found to have committed a traffic infraction shall be assessed a monetary penalty. No penalty may exceed two hundred and fifty dollars for each offense unless authorized by this chapte r or title. (2) The monetary penalty for a violation of (a) RCW 46.55.105(2) is two hundred fifty dollars for each offense; (b) RCW 46.61.210(1) is five hundred dollars for each offense. No penalty assessed under this subsection (2) may be reduced. (3) The supreme court shall prescribe by rule a schedule of monetary penalties for designated traffic infractions. This rule shall also specify the conditions under which local courts may exercise discretion in assessing fines and penalties for traffic infraction s. The legislature respectfully requests the supreme 38 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE court to adjust this schedule every two years for inflation. (4) There shall be a penalty of twenty -five dollars for failure to respond to a notice of traffic infraction except where the infraction relat es to parking as defined by local law, ordinance, regulation, or resolution or failure to pay a monetary penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter. A local legislative body may set a monetary penalty not to exceed twenty -five dollars for failure to respond to a notice of traffic infraction relating to parking as defined by local law, ordinance, regulation, or resolution. The local court, whether a municipal, police, or district court, shall impose the monetary penalty set by the local legislative body. (5) Monetary penalties provided for in chapter 46.70 RCW which are civil in nature and penalties which may be assessed for violations of chapter 46.44 RCW relating to size, weight, and load of motor vehicles are not subject to the limitation on the amount of m onetary penalties which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. (6) Whenever a monetary penalty, fee, cost, assessment, or other monetary obligation is imposed by a court under this chapter, it is immediately payable and is enforceable as a civil judgment under Title 6 RCW. If the court determines, in its discretion, that a person is not able to pay a monetary obligation in full, and not more than one year has passed since the later of July 1, 2005, or the date the monetary obligation initially became due and payable, the court shall enter into a payment plan with the person, unless the person has previously been granted a payment plan with respect to the same monetary obligation, or unless the person is in noncompliance of any existing or prior payment pla n, in which case the court may, at its discretion, implement a payment plan. If the court has notified the department that the person has failed to pay or comply and the person has subsequently entered into a payment plan and made an initial payment, the c ourt shall notify the department that the infraction has been adjudicated, and the department shall rescind any suspension of the person 's driver 's license or driver 's privilege based on failure to respond to that infraction. \"Payment plan,\" as used in this section, means a plan that requires reasonable payments based on the financial ability of the person to pay.

The administrative fee shall not exceed ten dollars per infraction or twenty -five dollars per payment plan, whichever is less. (d) Nothing in this section precludes a court from contracting with outside entities to administer its payment plan system. When outside entities are used for the administration of a payment plan, the court may assess the person a reasonable fee for such administrative services, which fee may be calculated on a periodic, percentage, or oth er basis. (e) If a court authorized community restitution program for offenders is available in the jurisdiction, the court may allow conversion of all or part of the monetary obligations due under this section to court authorized community restitution in lieu of time payments if the person is unable to make reasonable time payments. (7) In addition to any other penalties imposed under this section and not subject to the limitation of subsection (1) of this section, a person found to have committed a traffi c infraction shall be assessed: (a) A fee of five dollars per infraction. Under no circumstances shall this fee be reduced or waived.

The court may not reduce, waive, or suspend the additional penalty unless the court finds the offender to be indigent. If a court authorized community restitution program for offenders is ava ilable in the jurisdiction, the court shall allow offenders to offset all or a part of the penalty due under this subsection (8) by participation in the court authorized community restitution program. (b) Eight dollars and fifty cents of the additional pen alty under (a) of this subsection shall be remitted to the state treasurer.

The balance of the revenue received by the county or city treasurer under this subsection must be deposited into the county or city current expense fund. Moneys retained by the city or county under this subsection shall constitute reimbursement for any liabilities under RCW 43.135.060. (9) If a legal proceeding, such as garnishment, has commenced to collect any delinquent amount owed by the person for any penalty imposed by the court under this section, t he court may, at its discretion, enter into a payment plan.

The legislature finds that approximate ly twenty percent of the population have hearing loss, including more than six hundred fifty thousand Washington state residents who have been diagnosed with hearing loss. The number is rising; the aging baby boomer generation is increasing age - related hea ring loss exponentially, and hearing loss has increased among children and youth in the last decade. As these trends continue, telecoil technology has the potential to benefit more people, but only if consumers are made aware of the technology and its bene fits. The legislature finds that the federal Americans with disabilities act of 1990 was amended in 2010 to require assistive listening systems in places of public assembly, served by a public address system, to be hearing aid compatible. Currently, the telecoil is the only component within a consumer hearing instrument that enables this mandated compatibility. Without a telecoil -enabled hearing instrument a person cannot effectively access mandated assistive listening systems. The legislature finds that bl uetooth technology is evolving, but it is still generally not suited for long range transmission in a large venue like an auditorium. To date, hearing aid bluetooth technology does not meet compliance standards for assistive listening system requirements. Therefore, the legislature intends to increase consumer awareness of benefits and uses of the different types of hearing instruments and technologies. NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 18.35 RCW to read as follows: (1) Any person who engages in fitting and dispensing of hearing instruments shall: (a) Prior to initial fitting and purchase, notify a person seeking to purchase a hearing instrument, both orally and in writing, about the uses, benefits, and limitations of current hearing assistive technologies, as defined by the department of health in rule. (b) Provide to each person who enters into an agreement to purchase a hearing instrument a receipt, which must be signed by the purchaser at the time of the purchase, containing langua ge that verifies that prior to initial fitting and purchase the consumer was informed, both orally and in writing, about the uses, benefits, and limitations of current hearing assistive technologies, as defined by the department of health in rule. (2) The department may adopt rules to create a standard receipt form that persons required to provide notice under this section may provide to purchasers, as required in subsection (1)(a) of this section. (3) A person required to provide written notice in subsecti on (1) of this section may produce written materials, use materials produced by hearing instrument manufacturers or others, or use the materials created by the office of the deaf and hard of hearing, as required in section 3 of this act. (4) This section m ay not be construed to create a private right of action or claim against any person engaging in the fitting and dispensing of hearing instruments. (5) The department must adopt rules necessary to implement this section. The department may consider a number of factors in defining current hearing assistive technologies, but must consider whether hearing assistive technologies are compatible with assistive listening systems that are compliant with the Americans with disabilities act. NEW SECTION. Sec. 3. A new section is added to chapter 43.20A RCW to read as follows: The office of the deaf and hard of hearing shall develop educational materials to be distributed by hearing aid dispensers, including audiologists, to persons with hearing loss that explains the uses, benefits, and limitations of current hearing assistive technologies as defined by the department of health in rule.\" Correct the title. and the same are herewith transmitted.

(3) Minutes of all unit owner meetings and board meetings, excluding executive sessions, must be maintained in a record. The decision on each m atter voted upon at a board meeting or unit owner meeting must be recorded in the minutes. Sec. 211. RCW 64.90.485 and 2018 c 277 s 318 are each amended to read as follows: (1) The association has a statutory lien on each unit for any unpaid assessment against the unit from the time such assessment is due. (2) A lien under this section has priority over all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except: (a) Liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the declaration and, in a cooperative, l iens and encumbrances that the association creates, assumes, or takes subject to; (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, a security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the unpaid assessment became due or, in a cooperative, a security interest encumbering only the unit owner 's interest and perfected before the date on which the unpaid assessment became due; and (c) Liens for real estate taxes and other state or local governmental assessments or charges against the unit or cooperative. (3)(a) A lien under this section also has priority over the security interests described in subsection (2)(b) of this section to the extent of an amount equal to the following: (i) The common expense assessments, excluding any amou nts for capital improvements, based on the periodic budget adopted by the association pursuant to RCW 64.90.480(1), along with any specially allocated assessments that are properly assessable against the unit under such periodic budget, which would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding the institution of proceedings to foreclose either the association 's lien or a security interest described in subsection (2)(b) of this section; (ii) The association 's actu al costs and reasonable attorneys ' fees incurred in foreclosing its lien but incurred after the giving of the notice described in (a)(iii) of this subsection; provided, however, that the costs and reasonable attorneys ' fees that will have priority under th is subsection (3)(a)(ii) shall not exceed two thousand dollars or an amount equal to the amounts described in (a)(i) of this subsection, whichever is less; (iii) The amounts described in (a)(ii) of this subsection shall be prior only to the security intere st of the holder of a security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the unpaid assessment became due and only if the association has given that holder not less than sixty days ' prior written notice that the owner of the unit is in default in payment of an assessment. The notice shall contain: (A) Name of the borrower; (B) Recording date of the trust deed or mortgage; (C) Recording information; (D) Name of condominium, unit owner, and unit designation stated in the declaration or applicable supplemental declaration; (E) Amount of unpaid assessment; and (F) A statement that failure to, within sixty days of the written notice, submit the association payment of six months of assessments as described in (a)(i) of this subsection will result in the priority of the amounts described in (a)(ii) of this subsection; and (iv) Upon payment of the amounts described in (a)(i) and (ii) of this subsection by the holder of a security interest, the association 's lien described in this subsection (3)(a) shall thereafter be fully subordinated to the lien of such holder 's security interest on the unit. (b) For the purposes of this subsection: (i) \"Institution of proceedings\" means either: (A) The date of recording of a notice of trustee 's sale by a deed of trust beneficiary; (B) The date of commencement, pursuant to applicable court rules, of an action for judicial foreclosure either by the association or by the holder of a recorded security interest; or (C) The date of recording of a notice of intention to forfei t in a 82 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE real estate contract forfeiture proceeding by the vendor under a real estate contract. (ii) \"Capital improvements\" does not include making, in the ordinary course of management, repairs to common elements or replacements of the common elements with substantially similar items, subject to: (A) Availability of materials and products, (B) prevailing law, or (C) sound engineering and construction standards then prevailing. (c) The adoption of a periodic budget that purports to allocate to a unit any fine s, late charges, interest, attorneys ' fees and costs incurred for services unrelated to the foreclosure of the association 's lien, other collection charges, or specially allocated assessments assessed under RCW 64.90.480 (6) or (7) does not cause any such items to be included in the priority amount affecting such unit. (4) Subsections (2) and (3) of this section do not affect the priority of mechanics ' or material suppliers ' liens to the extent that law of this state other than chapter 277, Laws of 2018 giv es priority to such liens, or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association. (5) A lien under this section is not subject to chapter 6.13 RCW. (6) If the association forecloses its lien under this section nonjudicially pursuant to chapter 61.24 RCW, as provided under subsection (13) of this section, the association is not entitled to the lien priority provided for under subsection (3) of this section, and is subject to the limitations on deficiency judgments as provided in chapter 61.24 RCW. (7) Unless the declaration provides otherwise, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same property, those liens have equal priority as to each other, and any foreclosure of one such lien sh all not affect the lien of the other. (8) Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the statutory lien created under this section. Further notice or recordation of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is not re quired, but is not prohibited. (9) A lien for unpaid assessments and the personal liability for payment of those assessments are extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien or collect the debt are instituted within six years after the full amount o f the assessments sought to be recovered becomes due. (10) This section does not prohibit actions against unit owners to recover sums for which subsection (1) of this section creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosu re. (11) The association upon written request must furnish to a unit owner or a mortgagee a statement signed by an officer or authorized agent of the association setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments or the priority amount against that unit, or both. The statement must be furnished within fifteen days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the board, and every unit owner unless, and to the extent, known by the recipient to be false. The liability of a recipient who reasonab ly relies upon the statement must not exceed the amount set forth in any statement furnished pursuant to this section or RCW 64.90.640(1)(b). (12) In a cooperative, upon nonpayment of an assessment on a unit, the unit owner may be evicted in the same manne r as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed as provided under this section. (13) The association 's lien may be foreclosed in accordance with (a) and (b) of this subsection. (a) In a common interest community other than a cooperative, the association 's lien may be foreclosed judicially in accordance with chapter 61.12 RCW, subject to any rights of redemption under chapter 6.23 RCW. (b) The lien may be enforced nonjudicially in the manner set forth in chapter 61.24 RCW for nonjudicial foreclosure of deeds of trust if the declaration: Contains a grant of the common interest community in trust to a trustee qualified under RCW 61.24.010 to secure the obligations of the unit owners to the associat ion for the payment of assessments, contains a power of sale, provides in its terms that the units are not used principally for agricultural purposes, and provides that the power of sale is operative in the case of a default in the obligation to pay assess ments. The association or its authorized representative may purchase the unit at the foreclosure sale and acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, or convey the unit. Upon an express waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment in a judicial forecl osure action, the period of redemption is eight months. (c) In a cooperative in which the unit owners ' interests in the units are real estate, the association 's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real estate or by power of sale under (b) of this subsection. (d) In a cooperative in which the unit owners ' interests in the units are personal property, the association 's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a security interest under chapter 62A.9A RCW. (14) If the unit owner 's interest in a unit in a cooperative is real estate, the following requirements apply: (a) The association, upon nonpayment of assessments and compliance with this subsection, may sell that unit at a public sale or by private negotiation, and at any time and place. The association must give to the unit owner and any lessee of the unit owner reasonable notice in a record of the time, date, and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the ti me and date after which a private conveyance may be made. Such notice must also be sent to any other person that has a recorded interest in the unit that would be cut off by the sale, but only if the recorded interest was on record seven weeks before the d ate specified in the notice as the date of any public sale or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may be made. The notices required under this subsection may be sent to any address reasonable in the ci rcumstances. A sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice. The association may buy at any public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other person not related to the association, at a private sale. (b) Unless othe rwise agreed to or as stated in this section, the unit owner is liable for any deficiency in a foreclosure sale. (c) The proceeds of a foreclosure sale must be applied in the following order: (i) The reasonable expenses of sale; (ii) The reasonable expense s of securing possession before sale; the reasonable expenses of holding, maintaining, and preparing the unit for sale, including payment of taxes and other governmental charges and premiums on insurance; and, to the extent provided for by agreement betwee n the association and the unit owner, reasonable attorneys ' fees, costs, and other legal expenses incurred by the association; (iii) Satisfaction of the association 's lien; (iv) Satisfaction in the order of priority of any subordinate claim of record; and (v) Remittance of any excess to the unit owner. (d) A good -faith purchaser for value acquires the unit free of the association 's debt that gave rise to the lien under which the foreclosure sale occurred and any subordinate interest, even though the associa tion or other person conducting the sale failed to comply with this section. The person conducting the sale must execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey the JOURNAL OF THE SENATE 83 NINETY SIXTH DAY, APRIL 19, 2019 2019 REGULAR SESSION unit and stating that it is executed by the person after a foreclosure of the as sociation 's lien by power of sale and that the person was empowered to make the sale. Signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notic es required under this subsection are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of the authority to sign. Further proof of authority is not required even though the association is named as grantee in the conveyance. (e) At any time before the association h as conveyed a unit in a cooperative or entered into a contract for its conveyance under the power of sale, the unit owners or the holder of any subordinate security interest may cure the unit owner 's default and prevent sale or other conveyance by tenderin g the performance due under the security agreement, including any amounts due because of exercise of a right to accelerate, plus the reasonable expenses of proceeding to foreclosure incurred to the time of tender, including reasonable attorneys ' fees and c osts of the creditor. (15) In an action by an association to collect assessments or to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section, the court may appoint a receiver to collect all sums alleged to be due and owing to a unit owner before commencement or du ring pendency of the action. The receivership is governed under chapter 7.60 RCW. During pendency of the action, the court may order the receiver to pay sums held by the receiver to the association for any assessments against the unit. The exercise of righ ts under this subsection by the association does not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the unit. (16) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the holder of a mortgage or other purchaser of a unit who obtains the right of possession of the unit through foreclosure is not liable for assessments or installments of assessments that became due prior to such right of possession. Such unpaid assessments are deemed to be common expenses collectible from all the unit owners, including such mo rtgagee or other purchaser of the unit. Foreclosure of a mortgage does not relieve the prior unit owner of personal liability for assessments accruing against the unit prior to the date of such sale as provided in this subsection. (17) In addition to const ituting a lien on the unit, each assessment is the joint and several obligation of the unit owner of the unit to which the same are assessed as of the time the assessment is due. A unit owner may not exempt himself or herself from liability for assessments . In a voluntary conveyance other than by foreclosure, the grantee of a unit is jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments against the grantor up to the time of the grantor 's conveyance, without prejudice to the grantee 's right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee. Suit to recover a personal judgment for any delinquent assessment is maintainable in any court of competent jurisdiction without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing such sums. (18) The association may from time to time establish reasonable late charges and a rate of interest to be charged, not to exceed the maximum rate calculated under RCW 19.52.020, on all subsequent delinquent assessments or installments of assessments. If the associ ation does not establish such a rate, delinquent assessments bear interest from the date of delinquency at the maximum rate calculated under RCW 19.52.020 on the date on which the assessments became delinquent. (19) The association is entitled to recover a ny costs and reasonable attorneys ' fees incurred in connection with the collection of delinquent assessments, whether or not such collection activities result in a suit being commenced or prosecuted to judgment. The prevailing party is also entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorneys ' fees in such suits, including any appeals, if it prevails on appeal and in the enforcement of a judgment. (20) To the extent not inconsistent with this section, the declaration may provide for such additional remedies for collection of assessments as may be permitted by law. (21) An association may not commence an action to foreclose a lien on a unit under this section unless: (a) The unit owner, at the time the action is commenced, owes a sum equal to at least three mo nths of common expense assessments; and (b) The board approves commencement of a foreclosure action specifically against that unit. (22) Every aspect of a collection, foreclosure, sale, or other conveyance under this section, including the method, advertis ing, time, date, place, and terms, must be commercially reasonable. Sec. 212. RCW 64.90.610 and 2018 c 277 s 403 are each amended to read as follows: (1) A public offering statement must contain the following information: (a) The name and address of the d eclarant; (b) The name and address or location of the management company, if any;

(n) The identification of any real property not in the common interest community that unit owners have a right to use and a description of the terms of such use; (o) Any services the declarant provides or expenses that the declarant pays that are not reflected in the budget, but that the declarant expects may become at any subsequent time a common expense of the association, and the projected common expense attributable to each of those services or expenses;
