Adverse Effects Frequency Not Defined Seizure Anemia Interstitial nephritis Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis Jarisch-Herxheimer cephalosporins, imipenem Cautions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions reported; reactions likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens; before initiating therapy, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens; discontinue and institute appropriate therapy If an allergic reaction occurs Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) reported when SCAR is suspected, discontinue therapy and consider an alternative treatment The use of antibiotics may promote overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi; indwelling intravenous catheters encourage superinfections; should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken; when indicated, incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy Care should be taken to avoid intravenous or accidental intraarterial administration, or injection into or near major peripheral nerves or blood vessels, since such injections may produce neurovascular damage; particular care should be taken with IV administration because of possibility of thrombophlebitis Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Penicillin G Potassium for Injection, USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future In renal/hepatic impairment, reduce dose based on severity of impairment Clostridium difficile - Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) reported; may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis; CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use; may occur over two months after administration of antibacterial agents - If suspected or confirmed, discontinue ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile; administer appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be institute as clinically indicated Pregnancy & Lactation Pregnancy Category: B Lactation: excreted in breast milk Pregnancy Categories A: Generally acceptable. Controlled studies in pregnant women show no evidence of fetal risk.B: May be acceptable. Either animal studies show no risk but human studies not available or animal studies showed minor risks and human studies done and showed no risk. C: Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. Animal studies show risk and human studies not available or neither animal nor human studies done. D: Use in LIFE-THREATENING emergencies when no safer drug available. Positive evidence of human fetal risk. X: Do not use in pregnancy. Risks involved outweigh potential benefits. Safer alternatives exist. NA: Information not available.

Patient Handout penicillin G sodium injection PENICILLIN G - INJECTION (pen-ih-SILL-in GEE) COMMON BRAND NAME(S): Pfizerpen USES: This medication is used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. It is also used to prevent infection of the heart (bacterial endocarditis) in patients with certain heart diseases who are having surgery. This medication is known as a natural penicillin antibiotic. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria. HOW TO USE: Depending on your specific product, this medication is given by injection into a vein or into a muscle. Use exactly as directed by your doctor. The dosage is based on your medical condition and response to therapy. For children, the dosage is also based on weight.If you are giving this medication to yourself at home, learn all preparation and usage instructions from your health care professional. Before using, check this product visually for particles or discoloration. If either is present, do not use the liquid. Learn how to store and discard medical supplies safely.Give aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin) separately from this medication. Do not mix together in the same IV fluid.For the best effect, use this antibiotic at evenly spaced times. To help you remember, use this medication at the same time(s) every day.Continue to use this medication until the full prescribed amount is finished, even if symptoms disappear after a few days. Stopping the medication too early may allow bacteria to continue to grow, which may result in a return of the infection.Tell your doctor if your condition lasts or gets worse. SIDE EFFECTS: Pain/redness/swelling at injection site may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: joint/muscle pain, muscle weakness, swelling of ankles/feet, dark/cloudy urine, extreme tiredness, fast/slow/irregular heartbeat, new signs of infection (such as sore throat that doesn't go away, fever), easy bruising/bleeding, signs of kidney problems (such as change in the amount of urine), numbness/tingling of arms/legs, seizures, uncontrolled movements, confusion.If used to treat syphilis or other spirochetal infections (such as Lyme disease), this medication may cause a condition known as Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This condition may occur 1 to 2 hours after you receive the medication and can last up to 24 hours. Notify your doctor right away if you experience any of these symptoms: fever/chills, muscle pain, worsening of skin sores, fast heartbeat, fast breathing, dizziness, flushing.This medication may rarely cause a severe intestinal condition due to a bacteria called C. difficile. This condition may occur during treatment or weeks to months after treatment has stopped. Tell your doctor right away if you develop: diarrhea that doesn't stop, abdominal or stomach pain/cramping, blood/mucus in your stool.If you have these symptoms, do not use anti-diarrhea or opioid products because they may make symptoms worse.Use of this medication for prolonged or repeated periods may result in oral thrush or a new vaginal yeast infection. Contact your doctor if you notice white patches in your mouth, a change in vaginal discharge, or other new symptoms.A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.In the US -Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or at www.fda.gov/medwatch.In Canada - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to Health Canada at 1-866-234-2345.
