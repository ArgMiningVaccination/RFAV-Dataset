It is my great honor to welcome the Class A State Championship boys Nordic team to the State House today. I commend them for their dedication to their sport and their commitment to the ir fellow teammates. When you think about Nordic skiing, sometimes it can feel like a solace event, I bet, through the woods of Maine, but as a group they banded together and won the state championship and they will forever have that in their memory. It is great to have them here and I congratulate them on their accomplishments.

Representative KORNFIELD o f Bangor moved that the House ACCEPT the Majority Ought to Pass as Amended Report. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Alfred , Representative Sampson. Representative SAMPSON : Thank you, Madam Speaker and Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. So, as we launch into this debate, I would like to ask this question; what is th e problem we are trying to fix with this piece of legislation and how does this bill actually fix it? We are actually targeting 5% of our population and specifically our little people, K-12. An d these are individuals who have been previously identified because they have chosen not to consent to vaccinations. However, we need to specify what we are talking about here. This 5%, according to the CDC, and during the hearing we heard a number of physicians and the CDC themselves agree that this 5% makes up the following, and I think we need to understand this as we are deliberating this. First of all, the y can be the fully vaccinated except they're missing one booster; does that mean they're unvaccinated? They could be fully vaccinated but opting out of one vaccination, for example the chickenpox varicella; does that mean they're unvaccinated? They could be on a delayed schedule; does that mean they're unvaccinated? And then there's the smaller component of parents that have signed off on t he religious or philosophical exemption, like I did, because I was too lazy and I didn't want to spend the money to go see t he doctor to get the updated vaccination record, and because it is in law that we can check that off, I checked that off and enrolled my child in kindergarten. So, those people, we don't even know how many of them actually have vaccinations. So what I would challenge folks here, is that we are actually isolating, marginalizing, stigmatizing, and segregatin g a small portion of our population because we are concerned about the threat of the unvaccina t e d . T h i s i s a c i v i l r i g h t s violation. We are violating the civil rights of these individu als. Quite frankly, this is un-American. We are violating bodily autonomy. We are threatening and coercing people into submitting their body to be injected when they object. One of the discussions is about herd immunity. Well, the CDC tells us that herd immunity is established if we have 92- 95% compliance, full compliance with vaccination. Well, Maine is one of the highest in the nation with about 95%. Remember what I told you about that 5%; they're not included in this but we already know many of them are vaccinated, so we don't have our facts right yet. The other issue is the immunocompromised. Now, it's interesting that St. Jude's Hospital and any oncology ward, which is where the people have the most suppressed -- they're the most immunocompromised individuals, the guidelines for visitation in those locations, the hospital, St. Jude's, that e ntire organization, that entire facility, they instruct in their guid elines for visitations that if someone has had a vaccination recently, and they list a number of vaccines, they are not to come on the premises. That begs the questi on why. However, there is no mention of the unvaccinated. By the way, most of us in this chamber would fall under that category. The other issue we need to be thinking about is the psychological impact. Maine is at the top nationally with a mental health crisis in our schoo ls currently. So now we are entertaining legislation that could potentially expel 6,000 children, give or take a few t housand. How is that going to help our mental health crisis? Let's think about the fact that we are in a death spiral as a state. We need more people coming to this state. Yet young families who are looking at where the y could go to have their families, they look at all these sorts o f information -- this sort of information, along with a lot of ot her things, and I know personally in my district I have run into - just knocking on doors - five different families who have just moved here because, when I asked them, because of the freedoms you have in this state. These are young people transplanted from California and other states . This is going to slam the do or shut on that because they're no t going to be in terested in this . What about the fiscal impact? And I'd like to draw your attention to the yellow paper on your desk of the potential fis cal impact that it will have on this -- on our schools, and this is just K-12, this isn't talking about the universities, this isn't tal king about the healthcare professionals that are going to be impacted. This is talking about just K-12, students that may not be coming to our schools, and if you understand anything about per pupil allocation, this is something you could take in to consideration. So somewhere between zero dollars, which is basically what the fiscal note to this bill states, that this i s going to have insignificant impact, up to maybe $80 million impact. So we need to take that into cons ideration and you can look at your own towns in your district that would be impacted and the number of children. These are the 5% that I already talked about. Finally, I'd like to just mention that there are many, many issues here that we should be c onsidering before we issue this kind of legislation. We have not done our due diligence. We don't know the specifics about these 5%. For all we know, we could have 98% compliance in this state; we don't know and we haven't bothered to stop and think about how can we find that information out? I actua lly submitted legislation to entertain this but it was rejected. So I would like to have everyone think about this; why the sudden rush for all of this? There is no problem in this state. I've explained the issue of immunocompromised children and adults, and I would offer this; this isn't really about vaccinations, this is really abou t bad legislation and I would ask that you would oppose this measure, follow my light, vote red. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Orono , Representative Tipping. Representative TIPPING : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker, Gentlemen and W omen of the House, please imagine that we are in a boat. T hat boat is leaking and almost filled with water. It would make s ense that we would all want to grab our bail buckets and try and keep it afloat and, if after much hard work, the boat is nearly dry, you could forgive some of us for relaxing a bit. Some might even set aside the bailin g buckets but, sure enough, the leak will eventually overtake us if we become complacent. There's a reason that the Cent ers for Disease Control use this metaphor of a leaky boat to represent a community taking on the struggle of fighting infectious disease. It's a reminde r that when our foe is a dangerous, intangible entity capable of putting our children's lives at risk, we are all in this togeth er; in this room, in this building, in this state, in this country. T he actions we take as individuals affect the lives of our neighbor s. In this metaphor, the ultimate s olution is to plug the hole. I n reality, this can only happen when we work together as a JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-394 society to raise our immunity threshold to the point where a disease cannot take root and then keep it at that level until there is no source of that dis ease left to defend against. We have been successful in the past at achieving this goal, most notably with smallpox. But what we are seeing now is a rising tide of diseases that previous generations worked tirelessly to defeat and in my work on this bil l, I realized that there is a generational divide when it comes to these diseases. When I talk to my peers about whooping cough or measles, some stare blankly, some shrug, some know nothing of polio except for the pictures of FDR. But when I discuss these same topics with people who, and I'm choosing my words carefully here, have earned the wisdom that only comes with experience, I get a very different reaction. I've heard many of these stories. Like what it felt like to hold an infant unsuccessfully gasping for air while in the throes of pertussis or what it was like to tak e care of a family member paralyzed by polio. I think it's safe to say that a growing number of people despite the considerable education campaigns and widespread access to public health may not see the value in continuing to bail out our little boat . I think it's also safe to say that the risk is more dangerous tha n just simply getting our feet wet. We are seeing the news reports from across the country over the last few months, from Clark County, Washington, to New York City, measles in returning in staggering numbers. Whether it's because of misinformation, fear, or indecision, people have withdrawn from the public effort to keep our communities floating high enough within acceptable community percentages to avoid catastrophe. Madam Speaker, the bill before you is an attempt to reverse this trend and ensure that now and into the future our schools and daycares will be places where children can learn and grow without fear of serious, harmful, preventable diseases. This bill removes nonmedical exemptions to the decades' old immunization requir ements for the institutions where our children spend most of their waking hours. It also tightens the exemptions for hea lthcare workers and daycare employees. As a matter of pract icality, it grandfathers studen ts who are both currently claiming nonmedical exemptions and are enrolled in individual ized education plans. The amended version of this bill goes a little bit further. It clarifies and strengthens the medi cal exemption to ensure that physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, the people who are the primary pediatric care providers to our children, can use their best medical judgement when determining whether a medical exemption is necessary. It makes it so that no legislative committee is deciding this for them. It's not written in rules in the Maine HHS or education rules, it's up to their best medical judgement. The amendment also goes on to require more transparency; biannual reports from the Maine CDC on vaccine safety and efficacy for the current schedule. These reports wi ll go to the HHS and education committees and allow those committees to report out legislatio n in response to information . It also clarifies that any cha nges to the list o f vaccines be m ade through major substantive rulemaking, ensuring transparency and requiring legislative parti cipation. The amendment also bumps out the implementation of the removal of nonmedical exemptions a full two years fr om the effective date of this legislation should it pass, allowing parents time to use an elongated schedule to mee t the requirements. These changes are necessary if we want to prevent headlines from Washington and New York from appearing instead on the front page of the Bangor Daily News. Headlines like Governor Inslee declares state of emergency; cost of Washington measles outbreak tops $1 million, expected to climb higher; measles outbreak , one student got 21 others sick. These headlines are particularly troubling for people wh o cannot be immunized whether due to illness or age. We have heard from many people during the course of the debate on this bill including parents of young children who, like my daughter, attend daycares where the only protection between toddlers who have establish ed immune systems and infants who don't, is a half door or inches or feet apart at the lunch table. We have also h eard from parents of immunocompromised or immunosuppressed children who will never achieve the immunities needed to protect them and instead rely on their neighbors' vaccinations in order to be in school at all. I want to take a moment to say that one of the reasons we amended this bill - I proposed an amendment and the Education Committee moved forward with it - was that this decision should be made with the best interest of the child wit h all the knowledge of the primary care provider for that child, and it should be made with a physician acting in the best interest of that child to decide whether or not a medical exemption is right, and I thin k this amendment does that. Before I wrap up, I just want to emphasize one point; we are all in this together, in th is chamber, in this building, in this state. We must confront this issue as a state and not as individuals. I believe everyone who has spoken, the Representative from Alfred and everyone who will speak, does so with the best interests of t heir loved ones and their state at heart and I hope we continue to approach this subject with humility and civility. So, with that, Madam Speaker, I'll sit down. Thank you very much. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Berwi ck, Representative O'Connor. Representative O'CONNOR : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. I rise in strong opposition to this motion. This bill has been sold as a public school vaccine bill. Make no mistake; it goes far beyond public schools. This bill removes the right to opt out of even a single dose of a single vaccine for every Mainer in every school, public or private, from nursery school all the way through every college and university, trade school, and even online charter schools. Every child in daycare must be fully vaccinated with a much more extensive vaccine schedule without the option to delay vaccines if their parents want to retain the ability to go to w ork. Every Maine baby born to working parents must be vaccinated at birth with hepatitis B vacci ne, a disease that is transmitte d through sexual activity and IV drug use. Have you had the three-shot hepatitis B series? How can you possibly mandate this for newborns? At a time when we can't even fill the positions we have with the shortage of healthcare employees, this bill will force thousands of them out of their jobs. Every Christian parent who declines the vaccines made with aborted fetal DNA can no longer send them to their private religious schools. Every Jew, Muslim, and vegan who refuses even one vaccine for porcine or bovine ingredients or because they keep kosher or because they don't want liability-free projects injected into their children that contain monkey kidneys will no longer have the right to their religious or conscientious objection. Maine cannot afford to lose these valuable workers, the religious minorities targeted by this bil l or the tens of thousands of children and adults who will be banned from a lifetime of educat ion in this state. Dr. Ron Pau l was clear when he said the rise of mandatory and forced vaccination legislation should send a chill up every American's JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-395 spine. That government can for ce you to accept any kind of medicine and inject you against your will is totalitarianism at its worst. This egregious form of stat e power is metastasizing and I beg you to vote Ought Not to Pass or against this motion and I request a roll call, please, Madam Speaker. The same Representative REQUESTED a roll call on the motion to ACCEPT the Majority Ought to Pass as Amended Report. More than one-fifth of the members present expressed a desire for a roll call which was ordered. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Kennebunk , Representative Babbidge. Representative BABBIDGE : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, the question before us gives a lot of us fea r; fear for some of those that w ill happen if this is passed, fear b y others of what might happen i f it doesn't pass. I may be one of the few people in the room that have had multiple vaccinations for smallpox. When I was born, I think everybody in my generation has a badge of honor on their upper left-hand arm and that usually was good for life . However, when I was in my 20s, at Heathrow Airport in London, there was an emergency, a public health emergency, and nobody was allowed to leave the United Kingdom without an emergency vaccination. Imagine that governmental directive; no one could get ont o the plane without being forcib ly vaccinated first. It was to save lives. Even at that time, we had millions of people dying of smallpox. But four years after that event, the World Health O rganization announced that they had eradicated smallpox in the country, but in the last 100 years of smallpox, between 4 and 500 million people died. I grew up when polio was important. I had two friends who were crippled by polio. I can remember my mother not allowing me to go to the movie theater where the Portland Players now is, actually, in South Portland, because of a polio advisory. Vaccinations have changed the world. You know, as a Social Studies -- person who spent his life in a Social Studies classroom, I had the privilege of being a student of history which included everything, including the effectory of disease o n history, including the medical advancements that were made. But we know that smallpox exists in Egypt. It was instrumental in the fall of Rome, it was instrumental in the fall of the Azt ecs to the Spanish conquerors, Tinochitlan. It was instrumental in the reason that Canada is not an American territory today is because the American Army was decimated by smallpox in 1775-76 and the British command er actually had his troops inoculated. Inoculations did happen early on but, in my classroom at least, we mention the name of Edward Jenner. You know, so many people get credit for the work of those that came before them but what Jenner did in England was to scientifically approach the problem. Dairyma ids had beautiful skin in England and it was because they had cowpox. And Jenner, you know, thought this fascinating and he took the cells from a cowpox lesion and gave it to a child - imagine being that parent. The child got sick but survived, and then Jenner gave at a later time the cells to the child again and he was not affected by -- and from there came governmental actions to protect the populations. At the time in the 1700s we were losing about 400,000 people a year to smallpox. And that was with a small population. And even among -- one out of three would die and one out of three survivors were blind. So, it wa s -- and it was a -- you know, it was a, what's the word, a marking disease, people wer e left scarred for life. I leave to the medical people in the room the science in this discussion but my years in the classroom remind me of many students who had compromised immune systems. Our public health must be protected. The Maine Constitution says we have the responsibility to promote the common welfare. Article 1, Section 2, allows the people and by inference the people's representatives to make changes when our, quote, safety and happiness requires it. We are fortunate not to be living in the 18th century with Edward Jenner when they were facing the horrors of epidemic. But we have become complacent with this aspect of public health; vaccinations. Public health and those children we cherish in our public schools, are our responsibility. Their safety is our responsibility. I ask you to join me in supporting the motion in favor of the Ought to Pass Report. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: There are 15 people in the queue. The Chair recognizes the Representative from Hampden, Representative Haggan. Representative HA GGA N : Thank you, Madam Speaker and Men and Women of the House. This bill has the potential to cripple healthcare delivery as employees who will refuse to follow mandates seek employment elsewhere, creating more burden to understaffed health care facilities. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Pittst on, Representative Hanley. Representative HA NLEY : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker and Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, I rise in opposition to this because it isn't giving us anything, it is actually taking away a freedom. The freedom of a mother and a father to choose when and at what level to vaccinate their children, something they have always enjoyed in this state from the very beginning. And a question I have is the children that are unvaccinated -- excuse me, that are vaccinated and they feel that they need protection to go to a public school, what happens when they go shopping at Walmart or go to the grocery store or go to church or a public event? Are we going to have gates they have to pass through and prove your vaccination there as well? This bill simply isolates one place in society where you have to meet a government criteria, and that is a schoolroom. And you take away the rights of a mother and father to make these decisions; rights that they have always had. I ask you t o follow my light and defeat this measure. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Winthrop, Representative Hickman. Representative HICKMAN : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker, Women and Men of the House, I rise to read a letter. \"My name is Tyler and I'm writing you today to voice my concerns about the vaccine bill that has been introduced to limit the religious and medical exemption. I would like to tel l you my family's story in the hopes that you will consider us an d others like us when you vote on this bill. First, I would like to say that I am not an anti-vaxxer. I am a college educated mother of six children and I went to school for midwifery and early childhood development education and I'm working on a degree in public health. I under stand that vaccines are a simple and life-saving public health measure that has helped in conjunction with other public hea lth initiatives to save lives and protect the interests of the public. I am the daughter of an a nti- vaccinating parent. I was not vaccinated as a child but titers reveal I am immune to mumps, measles, chickenpox, and rubella. Though my mother did not vaccinate me because we are black Americans and hold clear memories of government JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-396 agencies and medical institutions harming our communities, please see the Tuskegee Experiment, the history of J. Marion Sims, the father of gynecology, and his slave, Lucy, for reference. Most of the people I know who are not vaccinating their children for philosophical or religious reasons are doing so because American history is riddled with active harm done to the unsuspecting public without our knowledge or consent. Unfortunately, mandated vacci nes without the ability to opt out reinforces their suspicion in the government by removing their agency forcibly and removing their right to fair and appropriat e public education unless they comply. This will not solve the problem of under-vaccination, it will increase the issue, lead people who were already suspicious of government entities to dig their heels in further and to go more underground, creating pockets of communities whose children lose access to healthcare, education, and potentially to appropriate intervention in dangerous situations, mental illness, and in situations where the community could provide structural supports. This unfairly and specifically targets those communities that are already struggling. Please see the backfire effect. But the backfire effect isn't the only issue. My family and I are very unique because we have a host of extremely rare genetic issues that have been formally diagnosed that raise the question of the safety of vaccines for us. The CDC has guidelines for medical exemptions as a starting point only, not as the be all and end all of a vaccine exemption. The way it is being interpreted in government, however, places it in an author ity that does not consider the unique situations of each patient i n regards to their healthcar e. The vaccine guidelines and the medical exemption guidelines were never meant to be used this way and I find myself at every doctor's appointment fighting for our appropriate exemption because the political climate surrounding vaccines has become so reactionary and polarized that doctors and medical institutions along with lawmakers are being pressured to follow the guidelines like they are a rule list. Through nothing but luck, I wasn't vaccinated, and in adulthood I was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos, which comes with immune system problems and histamine reactions and a couple of other indicators that vaccines are more risky for my family tha n the general population. In addition, 10% of the people who are vaccinated do not develop immuni ty. For some reason, people with EDS don't develop immunity as a result of a vaccination, we have issues with injectable m edication across the board but we are at risk for severe allergic reactions that can lead to death. Because this disease is so rare and not well- understood, along with the reactionary response to anti-vax movements, many of our doctors outright refuse to give us a medical exemption even though we clearly qualify for one and as a result we are forced to take a different exemption for school purposes. The last thing I would like to say is that th e mechanism in which vaccines work and the sensationalism surrounding them is being vastly misconstrued in the media. Drastic action and government mandates are not necessary. The measles is a live vaccine and 200-600 cases are expected each year. Many of the current outbreaks in New York, for example, were initially constr ued as an unvaccinated person getting measles and spreading i t that were later found out to b e a normal and expected reaction to the vaccine itself. CDC releases data about vaccine-pr eventable statistics and illnesses each year and has a table about them from the 1950s on. The maximum amount of people who have died from measles is zero to two, more often than not, and the numbers of measles are dwindling each year. Our real risk and highest rate of death is actually in hepatitis cases, which we have heard before today. Creating an environment and a state that steps in and forces a family to vaccinate does more harm than good across the board, I believe. These anti-vaccine communities should not be validated in their fear of the government, nor should their suspicions be confirmed by having their basic rights denied. The complicated situations that cause people to take an exemption are too varied for a blanket mandate and the removal of exemptions is too strong of an action for the current sit uation. Like a parent that is too strict, this creates a lack of trust between the caregiver and the child, the government will create more suspicion and distrust by forcing injections, increasing the issues we see. As I said before, I am not anti-vaccine and I approve of public health initiatives, but I have an intima te understanding of the logic that anti-vaccine communities have and I can speak on their behavior as well as accurately pr edict their actions. Instead of trying to force citizens to do as they are told, please conside r public health initiatives that are designed to build trust and bridge the gap between citizens, medical professionals, and government in the name of the public's health. Doctors and governments who respect and validate the concerns of its citizens and work to prove that they are truly working toward a child's best interest and develop an atmosphere of nonjudgement, respect and trust are the best ways to win over the people that this bill is attempting to control. Remember that anti-vaccine groups and p ublic health mandates both have the child's best interests at heart. Transparency is the only thing I have ever seen that will work in the long-term. People are watching this bill to decide whether or not they can trust their government to trust and respect them. Show them that this government is wo rking for them.\" And on that note, I give credit to the Good Representative from Orono who actually sent me this email knowing that I probably would find something in it that moved me, and I appreciate the work that the committee has done to improve the bill but I just wanted to shar e that with the floor of the House. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Augusta , Representative Fecteau. Representative FECTEAU : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise today in strong opposition to the pending motion. I am not anti-vaccine. My son has all of his vaccinations, we just chose to delay them. I see this through a constitutional lens and protecting it is my chief responsibility as a legislator an d as a combat veteran. Twelve-term congressman Ron Paul, an OB/GYN, said if the government can override parental or personal healthcare decisions, t hen what area of our lives is o ff limits to government interference? This bill will expel Maine children from their society for religiously objecting to a single vaccine. This is government overriding bodily autonomy and forcibly creates a new minority in our state. My primary interest is to protect liberty and th is minority does not consent to this i nvasive procedure. My body, my choice. The verdict is still out on our new Mainers and with the Chief Executive's welcome home campaign, we still don't know how our Muslim neighbors feel about this. Talking numbers, an estimated 7200 students could be expelled from our schools, totaling $80 million. Madam Speaker, this is an extremely odd way to get to 55% education funding. I urge my colleagues to protect liberty, property, and the freedom of association by opposing this motion. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Arundel, Representative Ingwersen. JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-397 Representative INGWERSEN : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker, Wo men and Gentlemen of the House, after listening to 15 hours of testimony, after reading at least 30 pounds of written testimony and more, I truly believe that there isn't one person who ga ve written or oral testimony who doesn't care deeply for the wellbeing of Maine's children. So, Madam Speaker, what I have had to do is look hard at the science, look hard at the m edicine, and look very hard a t the data. Are vaccines safe? Do vaccines save lives? And what I have found is an overwhelming yes. Why is this legislation needed? In 2004 and 2005, only -- just over 3% of Maine's kindergartners were unvaccinated for nonmedical reasons. In just this last year, nonmedical exemptions rose to 5.6%. In this last school year, vaccinations for measles, mumps, and rubella dropped to 93.8% statewide for kindergartners. These numbers ar e alarming becaus e they are well below the approximate threshold level needed to ensure community immunity. Community immunity is the threshold immunity level needed to keep certain diseases from spreading and affecting those few children who have no choice, their parents have no choice to get vaccinated for legitimate medical reasons; cancer, organ transplants, or immunocompromised school children. There are onl y six states, Madam Speaker, that have higher opt-out rat es than the State of Maine. Madam Speaker, this legislation is not about civil rights, it's about what is our community responsibility in a civil soci ety. We have a right and we have a choice to drive our roads freely, but we also have a community responsibility for the safety of others, hence our safe driving rules. Where there's choice, there is responsibility. We have a right in the choice to bear arms but we also have a community responsibility to operate and handle these weapons safely, hence our laws. Where there's choice, there is a responsibility. We have a rig ht in the choice to a public education but we also have a community responsibility for the health and safety of our fello w students and fellow citizens, especially for those who have no choice and cannot receive vaccinations and they depend on community immunity for their health and wellbeing. Where there's choice, there' s responsibility. Madam Speaker, let us join the Maine Primary Care Association, the Maine Hospital Association, the Maine Medical Association, the Maine Osteopathic Association, the Maine Pharmacy Association, Maine General Health, the Maine Public Health Association, the Maine Schoolboards Association, the Maine Associat ion of School Nurses, and the Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics in supporting this legislation. Madam Speaker, let us join 33 other states that do not allow philosophical exemptions and sti ll allow medical exemptions a s an option for parents. Enrollment; enrollment did not decrease in schools in other states with similar laws. For example, in 2015 Californi a passed SB 277 which eliminated nonmedical exemptions for school required vaccines. In the subsequent years, they did not see a decrease in K-12 enrollment. In fact, they saw an increase. Madam Speaker, let us join the 21st century and please support LD 798. Thank you. The SPEAKER: A reminder to Members to please direct your comments towards the rostrum. The Chair reminded all members to address their comments toward the Speaker. _________________________________ Under suspension of the rules, members were allowed to remove their jackets. _________________________________ The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Vassalbor o, Representative Bradstreet. Representative B R A D S T R E E T : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. I rise today in opposition to the pending motion. First, let me say that I, too, s ee the value in vaccinations. I had my own children vaccinated when they were young. I am a proponent of that. But I thi nk what this bill does, though, is it impugns on the constitutionally protected rights of parents, parental consent and the religious rights. There are varying views on this bill, even within the healthcare community. Do we risk violating parental rights and consent which would be a huge signature step in the wrong direction on an issue in which there is so much controversy? I won't reiterate some of the items that have already been t alked about here. What I would like to talk about just for a minute is some of the practical implications if this bill is passed. What's going to happen to the people who have voiced such strong opposition to it? And I thought reading part of the correspondence from one of my constituents says it better than I ever could, so I would like to read that, thank you. The State of Maine as a whole will be negatively impacted if this bill passes. It is a well-known joke that Mai ne's number one export is highly educated young adults. Those who utilize philosophical and religious exemptions are overwhelmingly young, highly educated parents. Do we really want to further ostracize this demographic of people at a time when we are trying hard to attract them to this state? You wil l hear testimony from many people today, this was at the hearing, explaining that they plan to move out of Maine if this passes and for each of them there are thousands more like them across the state. They have no desire to leave this state , but for people who felt compelled by principle to utilize an exemption, this bill leaves them no choice. These are highly educated people, many of whom own businesses. They own property, pay a lot in taxes, and provide jobs for many others. The State of Maine cannot afford to lose these families. My wife and I hold multiple degrees, we own multiple properties, and we own a business that employs multiple people. We pay a lot in property tax, income tax, sales tax, and all the other enormous taxes in Maine. If this bill passes, like thousands o f others we may have no choice but to leave the state we grew up in and wanted to rai se our children in. I think this is something we need to listen to. I hope we listen to this carefully and vote against the pending motion. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Houlton, Representative Swallow. Representative SWALLOW : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Members of the House. I rise in opposition to this motion and I'll be brief. No matter what one thinks about the merits of vaccination, it aims to force Mainers to submit to medical interventions to which they do not freely consent. If the Stat e can forcibly inject its citizens against their will, there is n o power which the State cannot reserve for itself no matter the impact on all of our civil liberties. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Portl and, Representative Brennan. Representative BRENNAN : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Men and Women of the House. Eighteen and a half years ago measles was declared eliminated in the United States; not that we'd made a lot of progress, it was eliminated in the United States. A 2000 declaration by the Center for JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-398 Disease Control, measles is elim inated. Yet in 2014, we had 667 cases in this country of measles. So far this year, we've had over 500 cases of measles and outbreaks stretching from New York City and Brooklyn to California. Here in Maine, children are three times less likely to be vaccinated than the national average, one of the worst in the country. One of the worst in the country. And this has happened even though the evidence is overwhelming that vaccination is safe and effective. In fact, some might argue i t's unequivocal in terms of the prudence of having vaccination as a state policy. I respect individual liberties. I support that. We debate that issue almost weekly in thi s chamber and throughout our committees. But nobody, nobody in this state has a religious exemption or a philosophical exemption that compromises the welfare or the health of childr en and families in the state. N ow, the Education Committee spent d ays, hours, working with the sponsor of this bill to come up with a prudent compromise that protects the health and safety of children and families in this state. This is a good policy fo r the state, and I hope and ask everybody in this body to s upport the pending motion. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Fairfield, Repres entative Rudnicki. Representative RUDNICKI : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to this bill. This bill is not about vacci nations. It's about bad legislation. This bill will do nothing to promote public healt h in Maine. All public health exper ts understand that mandates should only ever be entertained as a last resort. Mandates breed animosity. Let me say that again; mandates breed animosity and resentment bet ween the mandator and the mandated. And they only ever r educe all of our individual liberties and, perhaps most impor tantly, mandates are woefully ineffective public health tools. This is because good public health always starts with respect, outreach, education, and engagement. Mandates undermine all of those foundations for effective public health programs. At best, this bill would increase school vaccination ra tes by expelling unvaccinated children from the school. But t hese expelled students will not vanish, now they will simply be ostracized, more remote from any real public health system that would seek to engage them and educate them and their fa milies about the benefits of vaccination. Proponents of this bill say there is a 5% unvaccinated rate in schools, but the way things are counted, someone has had -- if someone has had all but one shot, they are considered unvaccinated. There is no available data distinguishing the child who has gotten no vaccines and the child who has gotten all but one vaccine. This lack of understanding represents atrocious health public policy which always requires comprehensive data and robust positive engagement with any populati on that is thought to be influenced in a positive health direction. This bill will not advance public health in Maine, quite the contrary. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Gray, R epresentative Austin. Representative A U S T I N : Good afternoon, Madam Speaker, Men and Women of the House. I rise today in opposition of the pe nding motion not becau se I didn't choose to vaccinate my four children, not because my 12 grandchildren haven't had their vaccinations, but because we had a choice, both myself and all of my children for their children. And choice really is the operative word, folks. The elimination of the philosophical and religious exemption in this bill will for ce many Maine parents to make very difficult decisions. A choice between a medical intervention that they are morally opposed to for their children and losing the right to educate their chi ldren in a school setting. In my opinion, the threat of expulsion from school is the very bluntest of coercion, intended to override Mainers' body autonomy. Those that claim to prioritize body autonomy and freedom of choice are shockingly silent about the implications of this bill on those very principles. This is a power policy. If this bill passes, it will be a sad day in Maine for many, many parents, and actually for public education. Children are a gif t, a reward from the Lord. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Biddefor d, Representative Fecteau. Representative FECTEAU : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, I rise in support of the pending motion. This afternoon I had the privilege of sharing the words of my grandmother, and first I'd like to share that my grandmother is a life-long Republican, I thi nk I'm the only Democrat she's ever voted for, and sometimes in the midst of friendly debate a t home I question whether even that's the case. In all seriousness, I'm thankful that I've had the chance to learn fro m her experiences. I've long heard her share disbelief at news reports regarding the resurgence of diseases that were supposedly history. When she heard about this b ill, she submitted testimony for the first time in her life. Sometimes she's afraid to even go t o t h e d el i co un t e r , s o i t w as p r e t ty s u rp r i s in g w hen sh e w as interested in speaking up in support of this legislation. And here's what she had to say. I support the requirement that children get immunizations in order to attend school. I'm 78 years old. For those in my gen eration, we understand the importance of vaccinations. We all got vaccinated. I thought diseases like measles and polio would be gone forever. I had friends, a brother and sister, who both contracted polio. From the time that I knew them, they had to use crutches and probably did so for the rest of their lives. Seeing friends contract diseases like this rea lly puts things into perspective . That's why for those in my generation we cherish the science and advances to inoculate agains t these diseases. Today, for whatever reason, parents are not having their children vaccinated at the same rates and some of these diseases are coming back. I would hate to see future generations inflicted with the diseases of the past and ones that might even be far worse. I urge support of this bill. What my grandmother saw growing up, Madam Speaker, I hope to never see. And I'm thankful that I had the opportuni ty today to create some change, hopefully, at her behest. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative fr om Chester, Repres entative Javner. Representative JA VN ER : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Men and Women of the House. I rise in categorical opposition to the pending motion. The only guaranteed immunity is the immunity that vaccine manufacturers enjoy in not being sued. As long as this is the case, parents and individuals must be in charge of their medical decisions. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Weld, Representative Skolfield. Representative SKOLFIELD : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. I rise again -- I rise also in opposi tion to this bill. JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-399 This bill will create great financial loss to our colleges and universities. It will deny many first-time -- first generation seekers -- education seekers an opportunity to pursue their goals and thus negatively impacting their lives long-term. I believe this is a matter of the State stepping in to deny personal liberty and personal choice. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Lisbon , Representative Mason. Representative M A S O N : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. I stand in strong opposition of this pending motion. There isn't a day goes by when I don't get these pink slips on my desk, not to mention emails, the phone calls that I get i n strong opposition. And even when I'm out and about in the great town of Lisbon, I have pa rents come to me, the mothers with tears in their eyes, asking me how can the State make us do this to our children. If this bill passes, thousands of Mainers from all walks of life will leave the state. Fac ed with their children being expelled from school, many will see no alternative in leaving our state and I've spoken to several people in my town that are threatening to do this. These are not just idle words that I a m saying. They will become refugees of odious law aiming to control what goes into their and their children's bodies. If t his bill passes, many thousands more, young couples or parents who value personal liberty and vaccine choice will never move to Maine. They simply won't come. Among those who stay in Maine but are forced to homeschool, many families will lose their income of the homeschooling parent. This would create real financial hardships for many families and more likely need more state assistance. This bill will be a financial disaster in our state that can hardly afford s uch an enforced error. The consequences of this bill becoming law will be profoundly negative to our state. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Milford, R epresentative Drinkwater. Representative DRINKWATER : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I want to thank you for your patience. I'm on the Education Committee with some great people and this bill has tortured us all. I personally believe in vaccinations. My children are vaccinated and all my grandchildren are vaccinated. But when I stood t here and I heard stories from like Senator Foley losing his child after being vaccinated at a young age, and then I heard stor ies of other parents that their child has been injur ed because of vaccina tions, and then I read where pharmaceuticals are exempt, obviously for such reasons. They've spent over $4 billion settling suits because the government has set up a fund to protect the pharmaceutical companies. So, to me, this came down to civil rights. And, you know, every morning that I'm in this House, and it's an honor to be i n this House, I pledge allegiance t o that flag and it's to the Republic. And in my Republic, we protect the rights of the minority. And then you think about okay, so we're going to deny them an education but yet we're going to allow them to play Little League, we're going to allow them on the soccer fields. So can we expect legislation to stop them from participating in outside activities? We're already at a 95% vaccination rate. Do we all wish it would be better? Absolutely. But I asked some of the people that testified what about adults? We are the biggest ones with the biggest problem because after so many years, unless you've had the measles and have a lifetime immunity, you need to get revaccinated. When I went into the military, we got every shot known to man and we had to keep redoing it because there's a reason that it has to be updated. So are we going to deny parents the right to go into a school unless they show vaccination records? So, for that reason, Madam Speaker, I look at this as a civil rights issue and I'm sorry I'm going to have to stick up for the minority. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from South Port land, Representative Reckitt. Representative RECKITT : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise hesitantly to speak today but I feel I must. As a biolo gist in my early 20s, I taught microbiology for a time. I studied viruses for a whole year in graduate school and, trust me, I worry that if -- that viruses c hange, they mutate. We may thin k we've solved a problem, we may not have. But more to the point of this bill, before my birth and before the development of the polio vaccine, my favorite aunt, who fortunately lived through the event, spent the better part of a year in an iron lung at Mass General Hospital. My grandmother went every day to see her. My mother and fa ther were both afflicted with polio. My father had one arm and one leg smaller than the other, my mother had a permanently deformed foot. So when the polio vaccine was developed, the year after we -- of the polio epidemic that kept me in Maine for longer that summer, like many other people who lived in, you should pardon the expression, Massachusetts, we stayed in Maine longer to be safe. I couldn't go back to school because it wasn't safe. Th at experience scared me, scared my parents. The polio vaccine came out shortly thereafter. I had every blessed polio vaccine that ever was. I had shots, I had sugar cubes, I had liquids, I had every polio vaccine. My parents were terrified that I woul d suffer as they and my aunt had done. I'm old enough, I'm scared to find out that I'm nearly the same age as Ryan Fecteau's grandmother, but -- and I had measles prior to the measles vaccine being developed. I had measles inside and out, on my tonsils which had to be removed, I went blind for two weeks, I could not see. Fortunately, I recovered, but afte r a month in a darkened room. Most of you know because I speak about it periodically, I have MS, and I was barred for a time from having the flu vaccine when it was first developed because of that. And then a few years later, I was allowed to be vaccinated again and I chose to do so and have every year since. In the recent months and years, I've had pneumonia vaccines, I've had shingles vaccines, I've had a TDAP booster in my 70s, but I struggle because I have three unvaccinated grandchildren. I love them and I fear for them and for their health. I also fear that the y will leave school on account of this bill. My hope is that before September of 2021 when this bill would go into effect that my daughter will consult her children's medical providers for clar ity and concerning possible medical examples that may be appropriate if she feels they ought be exempted. So I struggled with this decision, but as a loving grandmother and the biologist in my psyche, I feel required to vote yes today. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair will remind Members when referring to another Member of the Body to refer to them as the Member from and to not refer to them by name. Thank you. The Chair reminded all Members when referring to another Member of the Body to refer to them as the Member from and to not refer to them by name. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Alfred, Representative Sampson. Representative SAMPSON : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. Sorry for JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-400 standing up again. I've gotten a couple of notes asking me for a little clarification. So, when I mentioned that I checked off religious and philosophical exemption, it's because I had the opportunity to. It was not that my child was un vaccinated, I was just too lazy to go to the doctor's, pay for the doctor visit to then get the vaccination records. So, I just want to make that clear just i n case some people were interested. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from East Machi as, Representative Tuell. Representative T U E L L : Good afternoon, Madam Speaker. I rise in opposition to t he motion before us and rath er than do a filibuster, as the Repr esentative from Guilford has often accused me of doing, I'm going to rely on the wisdom of another school superintendent today, one whom you have met several times as we've chatted about education policy over the past few years, and one whom I respect greatly for leading me down the right path as far as education goes, more often than not. The following is from Scott Porter, who is Superintendent of Schools for 11 towns in the Machias area. Mr. Porter writes; I am responsible for eight schools with a population of a thousand students. It is my job to ensure th at all students in the towns I serve have access to a high-quality education that complies with all state and federal laws. That means all students in the towns I serve as well as all students in Maine have the right to come to a public school to be educated. If this bill becomes law, there will be students eve n in my rural part of Maine that will not be allowed to attend school, even though many of them have been attending school with their classmates for years . This type of law will complet ely disrupt the education of thousands of students from across the state. Families with limited res ources that value the educatio n their children are currently receiving will be required to remo ve their children from public schools and find alternatives for educating these children, their children. Many of their parent s readily admit they don't have the skills or the resources necessary to educate their children apart from the public school system. Who will, then, educate them? These children will be put at great risk if LD 798 becomes law. The current immunization law that is in place in our schools is working well. A high percentage of our students are immunized, with a small percent age of students opting out due to medical, religious, or philosophical reasons. There are some families that have been able to obtain medical exemptions but others have s incerely held religious or philosophical beliefs. Currently, the deeply held conviction o f these children in their families are being honored by our great state, but LD 798 will change the tolerance that currently exis ts for differences in our belief systems. Keeping children out of public school because of deeply held spiritual or philosophical beliefs is just wrong, and flie s in the face of the liberties our country is known for around the world. This type of law would discriminate against a populatio n of children that deserves to be educated like all other childre n in Maine, and I happened, Madam Speaker, when Mr. Porter was speaking that day in Education, I happened to walk by one of the rooms where people were sitting waiting for their turn t o speak and I heard his speech, and he was being asked about what might happen practically if this law was to pass. And he - - some of the things he said, well, these kids they're still go ing to be able to go to peewee basketball games and other functions that happen on school property. How are we then going to deal with that issue? Are our schools essentially going to have to hire extra people to make sure that these children aren't mixed in with those that are vaccinated? Any - - it's concerts, it's a whole bunch of other things. So, that is one aspect of this whole thing that I find hasn't really gotten the attention it deserves, and that's why I'll be voting against th e pending motion. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Orono , Representative Tipping. Representative TIPPING : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I apologize for rising a second time. I just wanted to clarify t he amendment language around the medical exemption. I'm just going to read it straight. The parent of the child provides written statement from a licens ed physician, nurse practitioner , or physician assistant that in t he licensed physician's, nurse practitioner's or physician assistant's professional judgement, immunization against one or more of the diseases may be medically inadvisable. And it f urther goes on to say under rules, these rules must not include any provision governing medical exemptions. The point of this was to make sure that in the issue from the Representative from Winthr op and others have brought up, the judgement of that medical professional who knows that child, who has worked with that child at well-child visits mont h after month is in a position to m ake that decision using their medical judgement, not a legislative subcommittee, not a rulemaking body somewhere else in the State. That's what the committee reads and I think that's what it should be in Maine law. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes -- and the Chair will point out that there are five more people in the queue. T he Chair recognizes the Representative from Dexter, Representative Foster. Representative F O S T E R : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Hous e. I rise in opposition to thi s motion because I believe it's a matter of parental and guardian rights that we're addressing her e today. No other issue that has come before this body has caused more input from constituents in my district than this particular bill, most of which were in opposition. When I first received a wave of such contacts, emails and phone calls, I turned to my wife. My wife was 18 years a school nurse. She served as schoo l nurse in our home district and also in two neighboring distri cts during that time. I also contacted the current school nur se in our district, actually tw o of them, one who has only been there for a couple of years and the other who was there following my wife's transfer to another district. One of these ladies had contacted me in favo r of this bill. Now, all three of these registered nurses suppor t vaccinations, vaccines for children. My wife made sure that our children were vaccinated and now that there are more vaccines that are required, my daughter and my daughter-in- law contacted her when the time came for them to make that decision. And in all cases, she recommended tha t they receive the vaccinations, although she did discuss some of the ramifications that mi ght come from that. When I discussed this with my wife and the other two school nurses, I asked them how has the current requirement affected your particular time as a school nurse? How many times have you had to deal with this issue? And in our distric t, looking back almost 30 years, and the other two districts while my wife was there, there were three or four instances and, again, this is in Centra l Maine, I understan d it could be diffe rent in other areas, but there were three or four instances where unvaccinated children had to be dealt with when a particular issue came up, whether it was pertussis, the measles, whatever. And in the majority of those cases, the parents, having followed the same path as my good friend from Alfred, JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-401 the Representative from Alfred, had made the decision that they would not vaccinate their children based on a reluctance to take them to the doctor, not f or philosophical, religious, o r medical reasons, and they comp lied. Each of them felt that this was a very minor portion of what they deal with as school nurses and for those instances where it came up during that 30-year span in the school district in Dexter it was somewhat inconsequential. I understand the importance of vaccinations and I support them myself, but I believe that we are infringing on the rights of our citizens when we mandate this. And I will leave you with this; all three of those school nurses allowed that if we could pass a bill that would outlaw headlice, they would have a lot better time at their job and it would give them back a lot of t heir time as opposed to vaccinations. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Penobscot, Representative Hutchins. Representative HUTCHINS : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I think we may be addressing a little bit the wrong way on some of this today. We protect the people that make vaccines, they can't be sued, now we're looking at a way to make sure that we buy even more vaccines, where what we should be doing is requiring them to do a better job making vaccines. And that way, the benef its that come from vaccines, which are tremendous, I don't think people in the whole are going to argue that, but there are enough families that worry enough about this, and I assure you it's a lot of families that worry about this, that the way to bring them on board is to persuade the people that build the vaccines and make the vaccines and do all of the experiments to do a better job of it , so that more of us will want to have the vaccines. Thank you very much. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Stonington, Representative McDonald. Representative M c D O N A L D : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. I rise before you today in support of LD 798. Immunizations are effective. Immunizations protect public health and prevent the reintroduction of infectious diseases. Immunizations protect our most vulnerable citizens and assure our children attend safe schools and live in safe communities. 16.7%, 22.2, 28.6, 42.9; these are just some of the concerning nonmedical exemption rates being claimed in public schools in Hancock County. Similar nonmedical exemption rates can be found in Sagadahoc, Somerset, Waldo, and Knox Counties. With nonmedical exemption rates this high in Maine's schools, it's not a question of will an outbreak occur, it's a question of when. Compulsory immunization as a requirement to attend school is not a new idea. All 50 states have laws to this effe ct. These vaccine programs have saved millions of lives and prevented a countless number of people from suffering the debilitating effe cts of preventable disease. In 1855, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state to pass a law mandating vaccination for school children. In 1905, in Jacobsen v. Massachusetts, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of mandatory vaccination programs to preserve public health. In 1922, mandatory vaccination was upheld again when the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a writ of error seeking exemption from compulsory immunization for school attendants under the 14th amendment. In the 1950s, the nation celebrated when the vaccine for polio was developed. The vaccine became mandatory for school attendants and polio originating in the United States was declared eradicated in 1979. In 2000, the federal government declared measles eradicated . In 2019, the World Health Organization declared vaccine hesitancy a threat to global health and as of April 19th t here have been 626 confirmed cases of measles in t he United States. Maine is vulnerable not only to measles but to the reintroduction of numerous preventable dangerous infectious diseases. This proposed legislation isn't forcing anything except a choice; a choice that parents who choose not to vaccinate already make. The choi ce is still theirs. But their choice is not without ramifications because their choice does not impact only their child. Their choice not to immunize also puts our most vulnerable citizens at risk; the very young, the elderly, the infirm, and those who are not medically able to be immunized. These citizens should be able to depend on safe schools and safe communities. I support eliminating philosophical and religious immunization exemptions as a mean of protecting public health and keeping our children and our schools safe from the reintroduction of dangerous preventable disease. I urge you to please join me in support of LD 798. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Oxford , Representative Dillingham. Representative DILLINGHAM : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. I first want to make it clear this issue is not a partisan issue, and nor shoul d it be. For many, it's not about the importance to vaccinate or not to vaccinate. I believe the majority here agree to the importance of vaccinations. It is about our civil liberties an d governance over our own bodies. Do we want to give government the ability to mandate what is injected into our children's bodies or do we want to retain our choice? Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Fairfield, Repres entative Rudnicki. Representative RUDNICKI : Thank you, Madam Speaker. As I've sat here and listened to the debate today, the one thin g that I haven't heard much of, or haven't heard anything of that we need to take into account in this particular bill is the nur ses. This bill requires that nurses be vaccinated, that hospital personnel be vaccinated. During the work session, I asked a representative from Nor thern Lights Hospital what will happen to the staff that refuse to be vaccinated and she said to us th ey would be educated on the benefits of being vaccinated. I said yes, but what if they still don' t want to be vaccinated. She s aid we will help them move into another position. And I said and i f you can't? I basically got to the point where they would be fired if they are not vaccinated. So what this comes down to i s we already have a nursing shortage in this state. We talk about it all the time. This will just make that worse. So, tha nk you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from York, Representative Hymanson. Representative HYMANSON : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I wasn't going to stand up and speak but I did want to talk about the process of a medical exemption because I've dealt with that with my caree r. So, as a neurologist, people would come in with multiple sclerosis and oftentimes their medications would be new, and it was unclear if they should be vaccinated or not. So we would have a discussion about it. It was completely within my discussion with the patient and the decision between the two of us that we would come to a decision, yes or no, based on the best available science and data and their feelings around vaccines. So I never ever felt I was pushed one way or the other by a guideline, a policy, it was really all within a shared decision-making, so I just wante d JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-402 to make that clear. I'd also remind people that measles causes brain swelling, death, pneum onia; smallpox, deafness and sterility and death; and polio, par alysis. My mother's sister at four died in 1918 of the fl u. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: A roll call has been ordered. The pending question before the House is Acceptance of the Majority Ought to Pass as Amended Report.

Representative M A R T I N : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Good morning to my fellow House Members; well, afternoon, now. I am honored to have had the opportunity to serve in both the Senate and the House. I've worked hard to approach my work with thoughtfulness and integrity. I am speaking to you today regarding LD 944, \"An Act to Ban Native American Mascots in Public Schools\". I am urging both my Democratic and Republican colleagues to vote in favor of L D 944, banning Native American mascots. This piece of legislati on has been brought before thi s body and it is our duty to cast our vote responsibly. My fello w colleagues, I urge you to support the will o f each tribal leade r in this state, all of whom have made it clear they support the banning of Native American mascots. This issue is deeply personal for me. I am the husband to a Passamaquoddy woman and a father to an indigenous son. Through my wife and son's life experiences, I witness and feel the pain caused by bias, stereotypes and racism. However, the pain I experience does not begin to compare to the pain many native people feel on a regular basis. The people who are in favor of their offensive mascots saying they are honoring their heritage and hi story. Let me describe to yo u what I have learned from my wife about honoring her heritage and people. Honoring translates into a commitment, a deep commitment to her people that r esults in positive action to make change. I watch my wife work before the sun rises and often far after the sun sets, working to change the conditions for native people in this state. This is honor. My wife teach es our son about their culture and language, building pride in his growing body. We want to be -- we want our son to be proud for being native. His identity is important, his pride is important, his mental health is important. So I ask you to join me. Please vote in favor of LD 944. We the Republican party, prides itself as the party of liberty and family values. Native people continue to fight for their liberty here in Maine and United States. It is time to d o what is right. The party of family values; who's family, I ask y o u ? A l l f a m i l i e s , m y f a m i l y ; i t i s t i m e t o d o w h a t i s r i g h t . Indian mascots are one of the many ways non-native people have tried to empower themselves w ith all that they envy about tribal culture while at the same time ignoring persistent disparities native people face in education, health status, employment, and income. Embracing a stereotype robs everyone of their humanity. Understanding and respecting native people for all of who they are and have been, and who they are becoming and understanding and respecting ourselves as non-native -- as who we are becoming. That is where our mutual power lies, in the ability of all of us to def ine who we are for ourselves. Let's do better for ourselves and especially for the native people in this state. Vote in f avor of LD 944, \"An Act to Ban Native American Mascots in Maine Public Schools\". Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Alfred , Representative Sampson. Representative SAMPSON : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. This is an issue where we agree that the nation feel very disrespected and dishonored and that is something important to recognize and acknowledge. However, we also are a representative government and that, therefore, is an invitation to become engaged. If we want to change things at the local level, folks can get involved. Obviously, we've all chosen to get involved on a state level. The issue here of the Native American mascots has been successfully addressed in every other school district that's ha d this issue throughout the state. Skowhegan is the last one to be dealing with this and they have recently successfully voted to remove the Native American mascot. The local schoolboards have the authority to develop these policies and so we should let them do the work that they have been given the authority to do, and I don't see that we as a State need to intervene on this. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Skowhegan, Representative Austin. Representative AUSTIN : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise today in opposition to the pending motion. I want to see people of every background, culture, community -- and community honored for who they are. However, Madam Speaker, this is a bill directly targeting my community of Skowhegan and the surrounding towns. The mascot debate is a local issue and it should remain up to our schoolboard and district to decide what to do. This bill only divides our community further at a time when our focus should be on coming together and healing. For that reason, I will be voting no on LD 944. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Canaan , Representative Stetkis. Representative STETKIS : Good afternoon, Madam Speaker. I stand in strong opposition to this bill. It seems a rather modest bill on the surface but in my mind -- in my eyes, could be one of the most impactful votes any of us will ever take as representatives of the people. For anybody that has not read it, the bill reads a public school may not have or ado pt a name, a symbol, or an image that depicts or refers to a Native American tribe, individual, custom, or tradition and tha t is used as a mascot, nickname, logo, letterhead, or team name of the school. Let's think about this for a moment; may not have a name, symbol, or image. We're talking about many hundreds of words, expressions, and images that we could outlaw today. Is today that day that we as a government begin outlawing the free use of words or expression? The American Civil Liberties Union, a champion of free speech since 1920, tells us that freedom of expression comes at a price. It means putting up with people, ideas, and argum ents that you may not like. In this room of 151 Representatives, each one of us have words or phrases or images in our own lives and in our own experiences that truly sicken us. Are we the 129th Legislature willing to gather together and assemble a list of words that we find offensive to ban as well? Why stop at just a few hundred words with this bill? If being offensive is all that is requir ed to banish words, why don't we just go after all of them and be done with it? JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-404 Everyone who serves in this chamber has sworn to uphold the constitutions of Maine and the United States of America. Maybe we should be asking ourselves today if we even have the power to outlaw one or all of these words or images that some may find offensive. As a member of this body, if you disagree with suppression of speech, you must vote nay. As the great-grandson of a family of Lithuanian immigrants whose country was invaded by the Nazis and who murdered nearly a quarter million Lithuanians, you can just imagine how I might feel about t he Nazi flag, a march, or a ral ly allowed on the very streets that so many escaped over the last century. In America, in a free country, we must protect even these groups' rights to assemble regardless of how repulsive we may find that they have -- what they have to say. We need not have to agree or support what they believe, but these right s must apply to even them if these rights are to be preserved for everyone else. As a member of this body, if you support everyone's rights to assemble, you must vote nay on the motion on the floor. Madam Speaker, as a U.S. Air Force veteran and the son of a Navy veteran who served in Vietnam, I am infuriated with the burning of our flag and to this day disgusted by the treatment of our Vietnam veterans and what they had to endure. But we as Americans, we have not stricken the words baby killers or images of the mi streatment of our military men and women from the public school libraries or classrooms. Instead, we teach history and learn from it. By protecting others' rights in burning our flag, it guarantees that each individual Mainer can fly whatever flag they choose to express their beliefs. As a Christian, the symbol that the image of a crucifix submerged in a jar of urine is beyond words; beyond offensive. But we have and must continue -- The SPEAKER: The Representat ive will defer. The Chair will remind the Represent ative and members of the body to please keep your comments directed toward the bill and the report at hand. The Chair reminded all members to stay as close as possible to the pending question. The SPEAKER: The Represen tative may proceed. Representative STETKIS : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Today we are debating banning symbols and images and words. What I'm referring to is a symbol and an image. What we have and must continue to as a free society protect the freedom of expression which is the very first amendment in our Bill of Rights, and we'r e required to do that. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote in one of his opinions freedom of expression is the matrix, the indispensable condition of n early every other form of freedom. Madam Speaker, our public schools are not First Amendment free zones. These ri ghts have been reinforced by t h e U . S . S u p r e m e C o u r t m a n y t i m e s . O n e e x a m p l e w a s i n 1969, the case of Tinker v. Des Moines, teenagers John Tinker, Mary Beth Tinker, and Christopher Eckhardt decided to wear armbands to protest the Vietnam War. The principals of the Des Moines school district asked the students to take the armbands off. They refused to do so and they were suspended from school. The students took this case all the way to the Supreme Court where they won seven to two because the Supreme Court thought it was violating their freedom of expression. An armband; a symbol of their expression in a public school was found constitutional even though it was offensive to others. By no means am I suggesting that the use of the words like Warriors or Indians or Braves rise anywhere near the level of the clearly hateful speech or actions of the Westboro Baptis t church members whose rights have been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court more than once. But isn't that the point? All expression is protected. With th is bill, we are clearly treadi ng on dangerous ground. Is today the day that a totalitarian, heavy-handed state government will impose itself on a school district that uses a word that some disagree with? Madam Speaker, if this bill was to become law and some rebellious community decides t o violate this government's edict, what is the penalty? W ill the funding to the school district be withheld? Will a schoolboard member, a superintendent, or a parent be jailed? Not very likely. So wh at is the purpose of a law that has no penalty for breaking it? Not only is this a freedom of expression discussion, it is also a local control issue, a s the Department of Education testified on this bill. As well as a letter sent to the SAD 54 schoolboard in Skowhegan by former Attorney General Mills on December 6, 2018 st ating that this is a local decision. Madam Speaker, just last week this body voted down a bill to ban non-constitutionally protected cellphones 112 to 26 largely based on a local control over public schools and here we are this week, considering banning constitutionally protected words and free expression from our public schools. I would hope the support for local c ontrol would stay consistent. Madam Speaker, if we are also to support a local control, we must also vote nay on this motion. I'm not sure that here in Maine we want to be the first starting to ban words and outlawing citizens' free expression, no matter how well-in tentioned some may feel this bill is. Men and Women of the 129th Le gislature, please support freedom of expression for everyone and vote nay on the motion before us. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Fort Fair field, Representative McCrea. Representative McCREA : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Men and Women of the House. I'm on the Education Committee with 12 other good mem bers of this body, or of both bodies, sorry. And we listened and we listened long and hard about -- on testimony about thi s bill. We listened to strong, sometimes emotional, heartfelt and sincere testimony on both sides of the issue. Madam Speaker, most of us in this body have strong allegiances to our high schools and their names and their mascots. In my opinion, if a group claims to honor a particula r group and that particular group says in no uncertain terms that they do not, repeat, do not feel honored, then it is not an hon or and, in my humble opinion, that s hould be the end of it. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Pittst on, Representative Hanley. Representative HA NLEY : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, I rise in strong opposition to this measure. This is a clear constitutional issue. The freedom to speak, write, print, whatever you want to call it; this is the number one foundation of our society. This is how we work. And no one is protected from f eeling bad. I'm an Irish -- of I rish descent and Irishmen are constantly portrayed as little drunk leprechauns. Well, okay; I don't like it but would I promote a ny legislation to forbid that kind of character? Not at all, not at all. I'm also a devout Catholic. I can't tell you the number of tim es I've seen irreligious articles and pictures and ideas. Much as they disgust me, I would never introduce legislation to silence JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-405 voices I don't like, because my voice is next. This is a terri ble piece of legisla tion and I ask you to defeat it. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Portl and, Representative Brennan. Representative BRENNAN : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Men and Women of the House. Some might argue this is a local contro l issue. I don't agree. This issue is so important, we can't leave it to individual communities to decide what they want to use for Native American imagery or mascots. It's incredibly important and it' s a significant issue for the State to step forward and say that that type of activity, that type of imagery is not acceptable. That's what this bill does. It's not an infringement of local control, it's a statement of wh at the State finds acceptable or unacceptable in terms of Native American imagery. Secondly, this is a civil rights issue. Every child in this state, every child, should be able to go to school and not have their heritage trivialized or mo cked. That's what this bill do es. And, lastly, it's not the most significant part of the bill and probably won't be debated too much here, but the bill also goes one step further and says that the university and community colleges cannot use imagery or symbols, or have mascots that reflect Native Amer ican heritage. I think that's an important step for the State, I think that's an important statement by the Stat e, and I hope everybody will join me in supporting this resoluti on and the pen ding motion. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Fairfield, Repres entative Rudnicki. Representative RUDNICKI : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise in opposition of this bill. It's about local control and freedom of expression. This bill is too expansive. If this b ill passes, many school names will have to be changed, like the Indian Islands School, whose mascot is an Indian, Skowhegan High School, those are just a few that I was able to pull up really quickly. I want to leave you with an email that I received and it says a lot. I'm going to quote it completely. \"My name is Bet ty Lepage. I've been a resident of Skowhegan for 35 years. I am a full-blooded Passamaquoddy. You've heard from my oldest daughter, Katherine Labron a few times about how we both feel. I want you to know that I'm not against or offended by t he name or imagery. I would like you to keep the name Skowhegan Indians. I am proud to be from Skowhegan, as I am proud to be Passamaquoddy. The history of this town, the name Skowhegan, the wooden statue, the Skowhegan Indian name all go together. My mother, Pauline Stevens, really liked that when -- really liked that we were Skowhegan Indians when we moved here in 1983. My three daughters all attended school here and graduated, went to college or trade schools. They all have careers and are successful; one daughter's a hairdresser, one daughter designs websites and works for L.L. Bean, and one daughter is a d ental hygienist. My four grandchildren attended school here also; three graduated from Skowhegan, one from Carrabec. My granddaughter has three girls and is a real estate a gent in Tennessee. My oldest grandson was in the Air Force for six years and now works for Northrop Grumman, is currently taking classes at Embry- Riddle Aeronautical University and has DOT top security clearance, and works on B-2 bombers in Missouri. My other grandson builds ships in Florida. My father, George Stevens, was in the Army and served in World War II. He was also a deacon of the Catholic church. M y brother, Nogny, was in the Marines. My brother, Richard, was also in the military and served as a tribal governor and was a game warden until he retired. I have a nephew who is in the Navy also and is now a cop in New Orleans. And I hav e many other brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews, who are successful and are Passamaquoddy. I am telling you this all because it was brought to my attention that nativ e children in a study do wors e and have been negatively affected by mascot imagery. My children and grandchildren were not affected at all and as they attended Skowhegan school. Mostly all of my family is doing well. Some kids and adults take a wrong path, it doesn't matter what your culture or your background is. Now, as you know, myself, my mother are all still -- my mother is still ali ve and my daughter, Kathy, my granddaughter, two grandsons, who are Passamaquoddy and are on the census who want you to keep the Indian name and imagery. That should say something. Please vote against this bill. It's too expansive. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Monmout h, Representative Ackley. Representative A C K L E Y : Thank you, Madam Speaker, my Friends of the House. Proponents and opponents of this bill profess to show respect of Maine's indigenous people. Now, whether you're for it or against it, that's what everyone is saying. We've heard quite clearly from Maine's tribal nations that they do want our respect and when we've asked them about using high school mascots as a form of that respect, Maine's indigenous folks have told us that they're offended. This basic contradiction here is that one cannot show respect by doing something that is interpreted as disrespectful. We shouldn't have to make a law that tells a community in Maine that they shouldn't be using an educational institution, an institution that's supposed to be a place intended to teach kid s, to inspire learning, a place to build relationships with others , we shouldn't have to make a law to tell them not to use this institution that will intentionally offend. Judging from the long debate on this issue, apparently we do. For when you contemplate using a mascot that you know is offensive, you're excluding people. I think the Good Representative from Milford earlie r today said it accurately; t his is a civil rights issue where we should be standing up for the minority. Using offensive mascots in school is not what we should be teaching our kids and so let's make it a law. Let's make it clear that in Maine, we choose to include rather than exclude. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Windham, Representative Corey. Representative COREY : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I went to high school in a tiny town in Massachusetts with an Indian mascot. I don't personally like any of that, but I'd li ke to ask a question through the Speaker as I'm still struggling with this bill. The SPEAKER: The Representat ive may proceed with his question. Representative C O R E Y : The bill includes a school having a name that depicts or refers to a Native American individual. I noticed that Orono is named after a Penobscot Indian Chief. Would Orono High School have to change its name? The SPEAKER: The Representat ive from Windham has posed a question to any Member who might be able to answer. The Chair recognizes the Representative from Bangor, Representative Kornfield. Representative KORNFIELD : No. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Gardiner, Repr esentative Harnett. JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-406 Representative HARNETT : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. I did not intend to speak to this issue, although I strongl y support the bill that we are debating. However, I have been spurred to speak because of some of the things I just heard. First of all, this is not about the government regulating an individual speech. This is abo ut the government saying what is acceptable in government sp eech. The Good Representative from Canaan talked about his defense of somebody marching down Main Street with the Nazi flag and I agree with that; that 's a First Amendment right. I do not think that we would be having a school fly the Nazi flag as a symbol of its place of education. We are not talking about individual freedom. The United States Department of Justice has historically investigated cases of native mascots at schools as an interference with the educatio nal rights of all students. Ther e was a case in South Carolina of a school that called their women's teams, their girl's teams the Squaws and they had a \"scalp them\" chant. They were sued by the federal government, there was no fr ee speech defense, and the nickname was changed. Similarly, in 2001, a school in Illinois faced the same issue with their native mascot, the Redskins. They were sued by the United St ates Department of Justice, they did not raise a successful First Amendment defense, and the name was changed. This, to me, is a rather simple principle; no person should be made a mascot and no person's heritage should be defamed at a place of edu cation. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Portland, Representative Collings. Representative COLLINGS : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. So, I just want to clarify a few things here very briefly. The language in thi s bill unequivocally s tates about mascots . It will do no such th ing as make a community remove their town name, such as Nokomis, Madawaska; that will not happen. This is specific to Native American mascots. And it is correct what's been said before, this is a civil rights i ssue which supersedes a local control issue. If that wasn't the case in this country, you co uld have schools in different parts of this country segregate schools. So this is definitely a civil rights issue and as the Good Representative from Gardi ner said, we are not limiting individual's speech. Governm ent's speech can be limited by government, which includes schoo ls. Otherwise, students and teachers could be very superfluous in manner of stating things that would be very derogatory. Talking more about civil rights issues and how it affects Native Americans, the tribes in this state overall has communities, and a great majority of their members, do not want to be a mascot. They are not mascots; they are people that have been here for 12,000 y ears. It is deeply offensive t o them. I think the least we could do is listen to them and respect how they wan t to be recognized. It's not just the tribes in Maine. Other states have implemented these laws, as well as the National Congress of American Indians which represents over 500 tribes in this country has asked for no mascots, associations of pediatrician psychologists have said this is harmful to students. Our job a s legislators is to look at ever y student in this state, and if t here is something that st udents feel are racist or derogatory to them, we need to make sure that does not exist. That is one of our biggest roles is protecti ng children in this state. Finally, I will say that when I went to witness some of this debate that's gone on for years, t o t a k e i t b a c k , e v e r y s i n g l e town currently in the State of M aine has gotten rid of offensiv e Native American mascots. The last one was just about a month ago or so. Almost every other community, ten or 12 of them in the past few years, immediately spoke with tribal representatives, agreed it was offensive, got rid of the names, which included where I grew up in Fort Kent, we were the Fort Kent Warriors. They immediately got rid of the mascot and they took a positive spin off of it and got the students involv ed, chose a new mascot, and empowered the children. So this could be an educati onal experience. The purpose of this bill is for the state leaders and the whole state to confirm what every single community in the state has said is that they do not want offensive mascots. If we don't do this, other communities will try to reverse local decisions which will make the process drag on which is detrimental to not only Native A merican children that find it offensive and has been found to be detrimental by psychologists, it also has an impact on students in the schools that have these mascots that are non-natives. Our job is to protect the students, not alu mni that want to keep their traditions going from when they were in high school. I know change is hard, I know that ma scots sometimes can be part of your identity growing up, but i n my case, where I grew up, we changed the mascot immediately, the sky didn't fall, everything went on as normal, the students were fine, the students were happy, and that's what it's abou t; it's about the students. We are here to protect the students . We are not here to have an alumni group try to keep these glory days going through a mascot. Skowhegan and all the surrounding towns are great communities, I have many friends there, this is nothing personal against them. This is about something that's been found to be offensive, unequivoc ally, by medical experts and Native Americans across this country. I think this is the righ t thing to do and I ask you all to v ote for this bill. Thank you . The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Camden, Representative Doudera. Representative DOUDERA : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise in support of this measure as well and I want to share that I, too, like the Repr esentative from Windham, went to a high school in Massachusetts. We were King Phillip Regional High School and we were the King Phillip Warriors. And out of curiosity, I reached out to the principal of the sch ool there now to ask how they are dealing with this issue and she shared that they have been working very, very hard to rebrand and change their logo and that they are trying to be more inclusive and respectful. She did say, personally, I can say f or this process and for the other changes that we have made to be more open and inclusive, we wish we would've had the power of legislation behind us t o combat the hate that rises from such efforts. It's very easy for a community to target a school leader for destroying tradition rather than commending them for staying true to the value of inclusivity. I commend y ou for your work and I am happy that you in Maine are tackling this. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Rumford, Repres entative Dolloff. Representative DOLLOFF : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I'd like to pose a questi on through the Chair. The SPEAKER: The Represen tative may proceed. Representative DOLLOFF : I was just sitting here wondering, listening to all the testimony, if somebody could answer the question; do we have any schools left that are using any part of the Native American name/mascots otherwise? The SPEAKER: The Representative from Rumford has posed a question through the Chair to anyone who is able to JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-407 answer. The Chair recognizes the Representative from Bangor, Representative Kornfield. Representative KORNFIELD : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Yes, just one; Skowhegan. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Yarmout h, Representative Cooper. Representative COOPER : Thank you, Madam Speaker. As beloved as the First Amendment is to all Americans and all Mainers, we have to remember that its reach is limited. The Bill of Rights pertains only to state action. It does not appl y to what you say to your neighbors or at a public meeting or to the person sitting next to you in this body. It is only when the s tate itself, that is to say government, raises the words, uses words that are protected or not that w e turn to the First Amendment. And so I think that the fear that our First Amendment rights wi ll be undermined by this measure are overrated and should not be a barrier to enactment o f this bill. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Weld, Representative Skolfield. Representative SKOLFIELD : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. It seems to me that the people of the State of Maine have spoken. They've done it in their communities, they've done it at the local leve l, and I see no reason for us to be involved in that. I think tha t you'll please follow my light in opposit ion to this bill. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Rumford, Repres entative Dolloff. Representative DOLLOFF : Thank you, Madam Speaker. For -- ongoing now, it is my understanding that Skowhegan has resolved the issue, so we do not have any schools in the State of Maine that this would apply to so I see no need for th is bill. Thank you. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Fairfield, Repres entative Rudnicki. Representative RUDNICKI : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Just to answer the question from the Good Representative from Rumford, Indian Island school, if you look at their websit e, is still one as well. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Monmout h, Representative Ackley. Representative A C K L E Y : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I request permission to ask a ques tion through the Chair. The SPEAKER: The Represen tative may proceed. Representative A C K L E Y : Sure. Is any Member in this chamber aware of communities considering naming their schools that would be offensive according to this bill? The SPEAKER: The Representative from Monmouth has posed a question to anybody in the chamber who wishes to answer. The Chair recognizes the Representative from Portland, Representative Talbot Ross. Representative TALBOT ROSS : Thank you, Madam Speaker and distinguished Members of the House. I agree with my good colleague from Canaan that this will be one of the most impactful bills that we will vote on. I rise today in support of this motion and want to bring forth the words of three people I hold in high regard and add their voices to this critical discussion. The testimony of Sherri Mitchell, Esquire, Penobscot Nation citizen. For nearly half a century, comprehensive socia l science research has supported that Native American mascots are harmful. Rather than honoring native peoples, Native American mascots perpetrate negative stereotypes and contribute to a disregard for the personhood of native peoples. Research shows that derogatory Indian sports mascots have serious psychological, social, and cultural consequences for Native Americans, especially nat ive youth. Most concerning is considering negative stereotypes of native people are the alarming -- help make the alarming high rates of hate crimes against native people. Accordin g to the Department of Justice statistics, American Indians are more likely than people of other races to experience violence at the hands of someone of a different race. Many of us hav e certainly been threatened with violence by those in this state who are fighting for an entitled right to misconstrue our identity through the use of r a c i s t m a s c o t s . W h i l e I w a s i n S k o w h e g a n l i s t e n i n g t o testimony on the use of their harmful mascot, a young man proudly stated that the history of their mascot dated back to t he 1920s. During the 1920s, the assimilation policies of the United States were forcing native peoples towards disaster. By the end of World War I, native peoples were suffering from short life expectancy, disease, malnutrition, a diminishing lan d base, the forced removal of their children, and the devastation of Indian boarding schools. This period was followed by the termination era which included a series of laws and policies designed to assimilate native peoples and eliminate their political and legal status. The remnants of that time are stil l being felt throughout Indian country and families are still grappling with the generational trauma caused by those actions. As Skowhegan was pr oudly adopting the identity of our people as their mascot and allowing their children to play Indian, our children were being taken and horribly abused for actually being Indian. Now, near ly 100 years later, we are sti ll discussing the right of non-native peoples to adopt and misuse our identity for sport while our people live with the violent consequences that these st ereotypes place on us. Barry Dana, former Penobscot Nation Tribal Chief states Maine needs to lead the nation in this effort. We can do this beginning in this chamber with your vote to pass this bill. I speak on behalf of Wabanaki people of Maine who through their respective governments have officially requested the removal of offensive nicknames, mascots, and imagery. Maine's own Department of Education reports because our schools must provide safe inclusive and respectful learning environments and because schools teach many lessons by example, the department urges schools to refrain from using mascots and logo that depict Native American tribes, individuals, customs, and traditions. The department also cite s the American Psychological Association's report. This report states stereotypical representations undermine the ability of native people to accurately portray themselves and showed a consistent negative reaction t hat lowers the self-esteem of native youth. Would you all her e be okay with schools allowing harmful behavior that lowered students' self-esteem? You may also hear from opposition to this bill that the name \"Indians\" honors the heritage of the native people that once lived here. It is now their heritage. No, it is my heritage as a direct descendant of the people who did once live here. And why do they no longer live here? In 1724, they were massacred by the British Army. Their scalps were then sold for bounty. Men, women, and children. Genocide is the colonial settlers' heritage. You may know in a way that it feels odd to be asking the legislature to ban offensive nicknames when this is 2019, when no other race is used in su ch a disrespectfu l manner. No teams are named the blacks, t he Jews, because it's wrong to do so, but we of a nation should've never used my people as mascots. Natives should be the o nes deciding what's offensive and what is appropriate. No non-natives should dictate to native people what honors us. Mascots and Indian nicknames honor no one. They are offensive. On behalf of a healthy educational learning environment for all Maine students, JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-408 please consider helping Maine eradicate all offensive mascots, nicknames, and imagery, and pass a law that bans their future use. Let's remember that Chi ef Executive Mills has also weighed in on this i ssue. I quote from her letter to SAD 54 -- The SPEAKER: The Representative will defer. We will not refer to the actions of the Chief Executive during the cour se of debate. The Representative m ay proceed. Still, even if it is in a letter, that is st ill the case. Thank you. The Chair reminded Representative TALBOT ROSS of Portland to refer to the Chief Ex ecutive as the Chief Executive . Representative TALBOT ROSS : Thank you, Madam Speaker. The name Indians has become a source of pain and anguish. Changing your mascot does not change you as a people. Maulian Dana, Ambassador, Penobscot Nation. Let's start with the facts. You may hear many opinions on this today and some of them will try to discredit the factual evidence we can provide. It is a fact that Indian mascot use is harmful an d adds to the intergenerational tr auma of indigeno us people. It is a fact that we have the highest rates of suicide of any group. It is a fact that children as young as eight have suicidal ideatio ns in our community. It is a fact that we suffer high rates of alcoholism, drug abuse, mental health struggles, and poverty. It is a fact that the societal acceptance of Indian mascots increases the impact of all of these plagues on our people. When people see us as less than human, they treat us as such. When people steal and mis use our identity, they render us in totality of the indigenous heritage and experience invisible. When you think you can call yourself an Indian because it is your high school mascot, it is a fact you are carrying out racism and privilege against those of us who are actual Indians and have requested that you stop your behavior. It is also a fact that under Maine law it is a crime to identif y as a tribal nation when you are not one. It is a fact that many scholarly studies have agreed on this and all of them have called for the end of the Indian mascot use because of the harm it causes to indigenous students and to all students. It is a disservice to the people of Maine to allow a harmful practice in the schools. The SPEAKER: The Representativ e will defer. I just debated for the past 30 seconds whether or not to ask you to defer and I recognize that you are reading a letter from the Ambassador to the Penobscot Nation, but it is skirting dangerously close to questioning the motives of members in this body in a way that I cannot allow. And so I'm going to as k you to proceed, I can be specific about the particular line in question if needed, but I'm going to ask you to proceed and please be judicious in making sure that the comments that you are reading on behalf of others do not question the motives of others who are debating on another side of this bill. Thank you. The Chair reminded Representative TALBOT ROSS of Portland that it was inappropriate to question the motives of other members of the House. The SPEAKER: The Represen tative may proceed. Representative TALBOT ROSS : Thank you, Madam Speaker. On a personal note, giv en what you've just stated, on a personal note, I just want to recall as a child, when my father served in this body and unfortunately had to put forth a bill to remove the derogatory term of nigger from all of the place names in this state. I remember as a child him having to plead with his colleagues to not allow this horrible legacy of racism to live on during his children's lives. He did it in or der to protect all Maine children. And so I rise again and ask that w e not simply treat this as words but that we understand we have an opportunity here to take a stand. We have an opportunity here to end the legacy of racism. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Passamaqu oddy Nation, Representative Newell. Representative NEWELL : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I've chosen to rise. Good afternoon to the Members of the good people of this House. I thank you for the opportunity to have listened to both sides of this, whether in support or against. I waited, as you can see, towards the end of this debate. I question whether this really is a necessary debate. I am seated here in this House amongst you as a Passamaquoddy tribal indigenous woman representing Indian township and Pleasant Point. I rise to ask you if I may reread the testimony that I provided to the committee. If I can get i t to work correctly. I stand before you -- prior to that, I want to say this; I stand here not to offend you. I have sat here listening to the debate, again either for or agai nst. While I can appreciate th e balance of the conversation, I again question whether this is a debatable issue. If you would, please, take a look at me. I mentioned earlier I am a Passamaquoddy citizen. I am a representative member to this b o d y . I p r o v i d e d t o t h e committee in the same m anner not to stand o r not to offer to be offensive yet only to offer the following as a tribal citizen a nd an elected tribal representative of the Passamaquoddy tribe. As you listen to the conversation today either for or against, I call upon each of you to humbly - to have humbly listened with an open mind and an open spirit and please recognize the importance of this day. I ask yo u to exact the charge of votin g in favor of LD 944 so as to no longer support the misrepresentation of identity of a unique culture belonging onl y to the indigenous people of this land. The time is now to ban Native American mascots in all public schools. Let us replace instead by promoting cultural diversity and awareness in place of any continuance of social in justices towards one another. For today there is much diversity within this great state of Maine, of which I am proud to be part of. And it is our collective responsibility to the next generations to promote each other as equals, as individuals, and more importantly as neighbors. Wela'lin; I thank you, Madam Speaker, and the Members of this House for the opportunity to stand here and speak. I d o not hold a vote here. I did not have to sit here through this conversation. I could have excus ed myself. I sat here and I listened to both sides and I ask you once again just to be open in your mind, in your spirit. This is not an issue of whether you are a Democrat or whether or not you are Republican. This is an issue to improve the relationships with the tribes that live here with you, amongst with you, work with you. Let us walk together. The time has come. I do not wish to have to stand i n defense of who I am. Please take a look at me. I am not, I am not as you have been hearing. I'm going to tell you who I am. I am, just as you are, a human that works, that studies, that raises a family, that takes care of the children and my grandchildren. I am no different than you are only I belong to a different culture of which I am most proud of and that is the Passamaquoddy tribal culture, made up of the Wabanaki nations of the Maliseet and the Micmac and the Penobscots. This is my heritage. I am not, p lease, I am not a mascot. I thank you and I thank each of you for allowing me to speak and I ask you once again vo te to what is in your heart, t o what is right to this issue. Let us work together, let us walk together, let us be neighbors. Let us help one another. We JOURNAL AND LEGISLATIVE RECO RD - HOUSE, April 23, 2019 H-409 are not going anywhere, neither are you going anywhere, so let's just work together. T hank you so much. Thank you.

Representative HA NLEY : Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gent lemen of the House, we get a second bite of the apple. A few months ago, or maybe not that long ago, we passed the bill that got rid of gross meterin g and the Governor -- excuse me, the Chief Executive signed the legislation into law. This bill that is before us that is the minority is actually the bill that should've been passed at tha t time because with the elimination of gross metering you only did half the job. The other half is to solve the problem of ho w we pay for solar that is produced on a panel. And this bill would've corrected that because it would reduce the payments finally to the wholesale rate instead of the above-market rate that we pay now, and that's what drives cost of electricity for all the other people in this state that do not have solar panels an d never will. This bill would get rid of gross metering, it would price at wholesale rates the compensation for power generated. It would keep in place all the contracts that are in place now; every solar facility in place now would be grandfathered in for the next 15 years. The only solar systems that would be affected would be any systems that would be installed after January 1st of the next year. This bill could and would pass -- would solve all the solar issues in this state, just take the solar issue off the table. We wouldn't have to keep coming back to this. And I think that a lot of people misunderstand me that I don't have anything against solar at all. Panels are not the problem, it's policy that is the problem. And the policy we have in place costs the citizens who do not have solar panels a lot more money for their electricity. I ask you to defeat the pending motion and to observe the second motion. That would be my hope. Thank you, Madam Speaker. The SPEAKER: The Chair recognizes the Representative from Berwi ck, Representative O'Connor. Representative O'CONNOR : Thank you, Madam Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. This was long but I'm going to cut it down and make it really short. "}
