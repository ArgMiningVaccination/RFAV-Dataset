Not only is she highly knowledgeable about Sedona on historical, geological, and spiritual levels, but she is also uniquely gifted with intuition and creativity to customize your tour for the optimal journey, especially to explore the Land and align with your life path. She is the type of person who will still go on a four-hour tour with you despite cold, rain, and wind - and it will still be the most remarkable part of your trip! You will learn so much about who and where you are in life. Please do yourself a favor and gift yourself a memorable journey with CrystalStarrWeaver! - merryminnow00Grateful for Crystal and this experience!Crystal Starr Weaver gave us an uplifting and enlightening tour. She poured her energy into caring for our spiritual needs. She loves people. She loves sharing her knowledge of the land and the magic within. She taught us the geography, geology, botany, and history of the vortex areas. She is a caring, and a most amazing guide. She gave us positive guidance. We enjoyed being with her very much. - TTTNYC00THAT SEDONA MAGICI did a day trip to Sedona and had a lovely time with Crystal Starr Weaver. She had a calming peaceful energy about her and literally helped part the clouds for us that day. It was snowing really hard and there was such low visibility you couldn't see much, but after positive manifestation and trusting Mother Nature, and simply going with the vortex flow, the skies cleared and we got sunshine for the rest of our time together. A magical trip and we will return to see her again!!! - P1475YPtracyp00incredible experienceUnexpectedly received an uncommon tour-- ecological and informational and spiritual. I highly recommend this to anyone thinking about it. Unforgettable. - Clara G00AwakeningOur tour with Crystal was amazing. She merged her information with both the scientific and spiritual. Most importantly, she addressed our questions. Since this was our first visit we learned about Sedona. - Wanderer3605133493300Where the magic happensMy husband and I came seeking a vortex tour that provided guidance and wisdom! This tour was uplifting and fulfilling. The mediation and connections made will be rooted for us! We left feeling rejuvenated and recharged. Crystal Star Weaver shared her gifts with enlightenment. I can't wait to come back to recharge as needed! Magic happens here - P1475YPtracyp00Complete tour with intuition and information!!Crystal StarWeaver was outstanding. She is incredibly intuitive and took us to the perfect places for our highest best. We learned about the lore, the geology, the ecology, the biodiversity, and the history of Sedona. We visited Thunder Mountain and she talked about the fact that it is the site for the throat chakra. She facilitated a healing of that chakra for me, using words specific to my situation. It was uncanny! I keep wanting to write adjectives like 'amazing' and 'outstanding' and 'incredible' but know that those words are inferior to how I felt. She even gave a ride to a hiker who was 2 miles away from her car because she came out of the trails in the wrong place!! - Christine D00Amazing experience!Amazing experience! Crystal took us to so many places and was extremely knowledgeable. We only had 1 full day in Sedona and so thankful we took this tour. We learned so much. Highly recommend!!! - 751draganak00Amazing experienceI am so glad I did this tour. My guide was amazing. I learned so much that I would never learn if I didn't take Spiritual Vortex tour. Thank you so much Crystal Star River!! - I3627ZQjoycec00Amazing, healing, transformative, beautifulHad the most special day with Chrystal. I could have set on that rock for days more talking and meditating. Was a truly transformative experience. I Wish this for everyone. If you go to Sedona, BOOK WITH CHRYSTAL!! - G1286ZAvalerieb00Incredible tour with an incredible guideOur tour with Crystal was incredible. She gave us insights to the land, the history and the stories of the places she showed us. We learned about the plants and about the damage being done to the earth, we saw ancient trees and we felt like we were connected to the earth in this beautiful place through Crystal. She also nudged us towards our own awareness of what we could be working on in our lives and how we can connect on a more universal level personally. We returned feeling centered, at peace and having learned so much from this wonderful woman. I cannot wait to return to this place I have fallen in love with. (Thank you Crystal, and just so you know, I have not said \"sorry\" much at all lately and it has been easy.) Val and Alise - John M00Great experience in SedonaCrystal was extremely knowledgeable about the area and brought us to places and showed us things we never would have found on our own. It was a great experience! - alissah51900More Than Just A TourCrystal personalized the experience for each of the four members in our group.

You will be forever changed.If you are looking for a tour with someone who has a deep understanding of energy, the land, nature, this is the trip for you ! The wealth of knowledge and the ease with which Crystal shared her wisdom made the experience great for the entire family. It will open your mind and your heart ! - Douglasv196300Craig and Doug's Sedona Experience With CrystalCrystal was kind, knowledgeable and accommodating from the moment we placed a phone call to schedule a tour up through and including the tour. She has so much wisdom to share and her knowledge of Sedona is unsurpassed. She really listens carefully to what you want to see and experience while you are in Sedona. She gave us so much information that we feel we can leave Sedona knowing a lot more than when we came. We strongly recommend booking Crystal above all other tour companies. Her private journeys are a once in a lifetime experience!

Jun 2021 Family Crystal was phenomenal with the entire family!! She was so knowledgeable, in tune with each individual person and really personalized the entire experience. She certainly was all about us getting something out of the experience- she's a great teacher and listener -making you more aware of your inner self and guiding each person on how to move forward and believe in yourself. As awesome as this tour was she's also a lifesaver and came through at the last minute for us when our original tour needed to cancel due to the forest being shut down. Crystal really knows her stuff - spiritually, Sedona in itself and how to connect and relate to people. We were a family of four and even both teenage kids truly enjoyed it!!! Crystal had a way of bringing everyone together and even getting the teens to share in their own way. A Sedona experience we will never forget! Life changing! Thank You, Crystal! We are grateful to have had our paths cross. Written June 28, 2021 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

StarrWeaverSJJ Synchronicity is Amazing! I am grateful we were able to meet and I really enjoyed your family. The Medicine Wheel is also unique where it opens awareness to know who you are and clearing things from your blocks and paths. You came at the prefect time to experience a transmutational shift.

Crystal StarrWeaver Written July 3, 2021 This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Dec 2020 I have heard about the amazing vortex energies of Sedona for years, and I finally had the opportunity to travel there to experience them for myself. Not knowing exactly where to go led me to search for a guide. Among the many to choose from, I came across Sedona Spirit Journeys and felt this was the right one for me. Crystal took my mom and me on an amazing journey to several of the beautiful sites in Sedona. She was the perfect guide for what I wanted to experience. Her knowledge and obvious love for the area gave me more insight into the magic of Sedona than I could have ever gotten on my own. The history I learned from Crystal in the short 4 hours we spent together really made me fall in love with Sedona, and I cannot wait to return. It also sparked an interest in independent study about the area. Her peaceful energy felt like a physical projection of the energy of Sedona, and I would highly recommend booking her as your guide if you plan to visit the area. Be sure to ask about Crystal's shop in Sedona...my mom and I found many wonderful crystals, and other gifts there!

I highly recommend this private and very individualized tour. You'll get so much more by keeping an open mind and heart. We did this and by the end of our 4 hours together we felt very tired, but in a good way as so much inner-growth was processed and released Thank you!
