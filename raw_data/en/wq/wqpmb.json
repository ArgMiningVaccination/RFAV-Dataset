Churchill Livingstone, 2003 Usage in Australia Medication & professional services use by Australian pharmacy customers Survey of 1131 pharmacy customers attending 60 community pharmacies (Vic, NSW, Qld) In the previous 12 months : 61% used prescription medicines 93% visited a medical doctor 72% used a health supplement 39% saw a CM practitioner ( no.1 naturopaths)CM supplement users women > men reported having taken a CM product in the previous 12 months (76% vs. 58%; p<0.0001). Age comparisons of < 50 yrsvs > 50 yrs > 50 yrssignificantly more people took glucosamine (33% vs. 10%; p<0.0001) or fish oil supplements (41% vs. 28%; p<0.0001) compared to people under 50 years of age. Location and socioeconomic comparisons no significant differences in frequency of CMs use between customers living in metropolitan Melbourne or regional NSW No significant association between use and income or marital status.

Takes into account traditional evidence for traditional medicines Considers what is known and makes allowances for what is not known (where relevant) Benefits of regulation -Quality assurance Increasing consumer safety Increasing consumer confidence Optimising therapeutic benefits Challenges -Herbal medicine evidence Many types of evidence and different challenges compared to pharma drugs Overall, more complex picture than for pharma drugs Herbal medicines are chemically complex Some have known mechanisms of action from a biomedical perspective, others from different paradigms ( egChinese med) Many have traditions of use and/or been part of the food -chain Many contain phytochemicals with pharmacological actions + nutrients e.g. garlic, valerian Challenges -Herbal medicine evidence Evidence comes from epidemiological studies, traditional resources and scientific investigation Some scientific evidence is poorly reported making interpretation difficult e.g. description of herbal extract tested, extraction solvent Some scientific studies are poorly conducted E.g. was presence of key actives confirmed? Traditional evidence challenges Quick, positive responses most likely to be detected Acute, adverse reactions most likely to be detected Benefits or adverse reactions due to long-term use harder to identify Harder to identify rare adverse reactions Traditional evidence may consist of an 'oral history' with little written words Herb may be described in non -biomedical terms - how do we understand this ? Challenges for CM supplement regulation Evidence Poor funding means less opportunity to undertake quality research Little industry incentive to fund research -no patent protection Scientific evidence not always available (e.g. safety in pregnancy) Generic evidence generally relates to single ingredients Herbal meds often used in combinations Evidence requirements that is relevant to low risk ingredients & take into account what is possible & important to produce Challenges for CM supplement regulation Registration and listing -industry perspectives Relatively easy to 'list' new ingredients with high hurdle to registration Disincentive to industry to apply for registration, even if holding sufficient evidence as no 'data protection', costly, high risk & time consuming Do consumers 'care' anyway ? Little incentive for innovation and listing new ingredients as competitors can copy products in as little as 6 weeksCMs available in Australia Blackmores has biggest market share in Australia & Malaysia Consistently wins 'Most trusted brand' in Readers Digest surveys Over 200 different products sold in Australia Over 20 million bottles sold per year TGA has no restrictions on herbs + nutrients in one product Popular Blackmores products : Multivitamins -typically nutritionals + herbals or fruit + vegetable powder concentrates Fish oils -various EPA/DHA ratios Single nutritionals e.g. Coenzyme Q10 Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Gold - nutritional combination Cold and flu combinations -Echinacea + nutritionals (vitamins A,C,E zinc)OA support -glucosamine and ( egvalerian, lemon balm, magnesium ) Stress products - Executive B stress formula (B complex + herbs passionflower + oats) Single herbals -e.g. + fruit + vegetable powder concentrates Fish oils -various EPA/DHA ratios Single nutritionals e.g. Coenzyme Q10 Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Gold - nutritional combination Cold and flu combinations -Echinacea + nutritionals (vitamins A,C,E zinc)OA support -glucosamine and ( egvalerian, lemon balm, magnesium ) Stress products - Executive B stress formula (B complex + herbs passionflower + oats) Single herbals -e.g. Evening primrose oil, andrographis , echinaceaBlackmores Institute Advisory team 30,000 + contacts per year Provides ready access for the public and health care professionals to free advice & adverse reaction reporting Most common queries relate to safety Drug interactions and safety in pregnancy Also, information about excipients eglactose, gluten Survey showed 99% of users would use the service again Who are our callers ?

Factors which increase risk Key determinants of risk -not just the medicine Medicine Inherent toxicity Side effect profile Quality Administration form Therapeutic margin Pharmacodynamic sThe Individual General health Comorbidities Ability to self administer, self monitor, communicate clearly Predisposition Pharmacokinetics Persons Situation Community living Hospital setting Access to HCPs Access to quality products & services Access to information Polypharmacy & other drugs used Interactions Main types of interactions Physicochemical and chemical Pharmacodynamic Pharmacokinetic Main clinical outcomes Increased therapeutic or adverse effects Decreased therapeutic or adverse effects Unique effect Often, exact outcome unknown but theoretically predictable Evidence about interactions Strength Limitation Test tube studies Fast, low cost Dose may be clinically irrelevant Agent may have poor bioavailability In vivo Faster than RCTs Some bioavailability issues resolved Dose clinically relevant ? Species differences Clinical trial More accurate Costly and takes time Wont have RCTs for everything Case report Suggestive Uncontrolled Often poor reporting Confounders often missed Problems extrapolating evidence e.g. In vitro & tests w animal models show both CYP induction and inhibition for ginkgo biloba In contrast, 4 clinical studies did NOT identify a clinical significant effect on a variety of cytochromes e.g. in vitro tests show saw palmetto inhibits CYP3A4 & CYP2D6 In contrast, 2 clinical studies did NOT identify a significant effect on CYP3A4 or CYP2D6Review of in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies Herbs with clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction potential Black pepper and tetracyclines 2.Reduced absorption resulting in decreased bioavailability E.gPPI drugs and magnesium 3.Altered systemic disposition E.g. Changing tissue distribution or concentration at target site Vitamin K and warfarin 4.Altered elimination E.g. Impaired renal or enterohepatic elimination ACE inhibitors and ARBs affecting zinc nutritionZinc and BP meds People taking ACE -inhibitors, ARBs or thiazides long term are at risk of Zn deficiency Due to increased renal excretion Possible alteration to Zn absorption Vitamin C increases iron, aluminium and chromium absorption and decreases copper absorption Vitamin D increases calcium and phosphate absorption Vitamin E decreases vitamin A and vitamin K activity Folate decreases zinc absorption Calcium decreases iron, magnesium and zinc absorptionVitamin/mineral interactions Iron decreases zinc absorption and vice versa Magnesium decreases zinc absorption Phosphate decreases iron and magnesium absorption Zinc and iron decrease copper absorption Zinc increases vitamin A activity and decreases calcium absorption Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University. http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/ (accessed July 2005) Dietary Reference Intakes.
