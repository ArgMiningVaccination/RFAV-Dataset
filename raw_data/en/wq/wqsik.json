Because of anatomic differences between species, CPR\u2014or cardiopulmonary resuscitation\u2014is different when used for dogs instead of humans. So using techniques developed for people won't necessarily save the lives of our furry friends. Most dogs are solid swimmers, but even they can get caught in currents or trapped in pools. So supervise your dog closely when you're near water. If your dog begins to struggle while swimming, make sure you're safe before attempting a rescue. Then get your pooch to dry land and keep him warm. If he's nonresponsive, you may be able to drain water from his chest by placing his head below his lungs and thumping his sides. But don't delay\u2014get help as soon as possible. Even if mosquitoes seem few and far between where you live, don't be fooled into thinking your pet does not need heartworm preventative. Heartworm disease requires only one animal with infected blood and a hungry mosquito to pass that infection on to your furry friend. For example, many coyotes carry young heartworms in their bloodstream. The same can be true of animals that come from other parts of the country where heartworm disease is a big problem. Mosquitoes usually don't travel more than a quarter of a mile during their lifetimes, especially if they're near standing water. Once they draw blood from a nearby infected animal and fly over to bite your dog, cat or ferret, heartworm infection is a done deal. So don't rely on the odds being in your favor. Cover your bets and use heartworm preventative for your pets year-round. As you get to know your newly adopted pooch, you'll have some surprises in store. One of those may be your buddy's fear of the veterinary clinic. If your dog turns into a quaking pool of JELL-O the first time you have an appointment, it could be that clinic smells and sounds recall anxious times at the shelter. So make it your goal to show your pooch how fun the visit can be. First, let the veterinary team know that the two of you will be stopping in just to say hello. If your buddy starts shaking before you even arrive, stop right there. Put him at ease with treats and pats then go back home. Each time you travel back to the clinic, use treats and praise to coax your pooch a little further along. Eventually you'll make it into an exam room where a veterinary technician can offer encouragement too. These steps will help your pup become a vet visit pro. Tetanus has killed horses for hundreds of years, and it remains a threat today. The big difference is that nowadays horses can be protected against tetanus by a safe and effective vaccine. The bacteria responsible for tetanus produce a toxin that attacks nerves. Because these bacteria can survive indefinitely in the environment, horses\u2014and people\u2014are always at risk of infection. Tetanus isn't contagious\u2014that is, it can't spread from horse to horse. Instead, it's caused by environmental contamination of wounds. In horses, the most vulnerable sites are punctures\u2014especially in the feet or deep muscles\u2014cuts and surgical incisions. Other tissues at risk are the umbilicus in foals or reproductive tissues in mares. Once tetanus strikes, horses very rarely recover. That's why protection by vaccination is the obvious choice. Even with the most tuned-in cat parents, cats tend to communicate on a totally different wavelength. In contrast to their chatty humans, they rely mainly on nonverbal signals. The quintessential 'meow' isn't something that cats respond to\u2014they use it to get our attention. That said, there are ways to commune with your cat. Cats don't use many facial expressions themselves, but they can learn what ours mean\u2014that is, if we matter to them. They don't seem to react to intense expressions on strangers' faces. Sometimes when trying to send a message, it's best to follow a cat's lead. For example, a very slow blink, versus a direct stare, is a way to let your cat know that everything's fine. Likewise, you can make a soft \"brrrip\" sound [roll your tongue when making this sound] Of course after you've said it all, petting may still be the best way to let your cat feel the love. Nobody like fleas or ticks\u2014and not just because they're annoying. They can spread dangerous diseases as well. But knowing which flea and tick preventative is safe for your pet is important, because these medicines can have serious health consequences. Start by asking your veterinarian to recommend a safe and effective product instead of choosing one on your own. Then discuss administration details before applying any product to your pet's skin\u2014particularly if your four-legged friend is very young or old, pregnant, or nursing, or is taking other medications. Never ever use a dog product on a cat, because some ingredients are toxic to cats. And make sure you use the dose per weight as recommended on the package. After you've administered the product, be sure to watch your pet for any side effects. If you notice anything unusual, contact your veterinarian right away. Over the past decade, a canine lifeline has grown from the southern to the northern United States. It began after Hurricane Katrina when shelter workers rescued pets and found them homes in the North. Folks then realized the same process might work to save dogs from overcrowded southern shelters. In general, there are fewer shelters in southern than in northern states. Couple that with the reluctance of many pet parents in the South to have their dogs spayed or neutered, and you can see why southern shelters are overwhelmed. In the North, most dogs have to be spayed or neutered per local regulations. Those regulations, combined with the sad fact that some strays don't survive northern winters, result in fewer adoptable dogs. This lifeline of care has saved thousands of dogs. And until another solution can be found, it's likely to save many more. Have you noticed that when humans who are down on their luck help challenged animals, it's usually a win-win situation? Every two months at a state correctional institution in Pennsylvania, six dogs are brought in from a local shelter and assigned to a pair of inmates. Most of the dogs have behavior problems that interfere with their adoption\u2014and that's where the prisoners come in. As the inmates train the dogs, many find themselves healing as well. Just as most of these shelter dogs were abandoned, so some inmates feel they were rejected by family or society. But as the prisoners bring out the best in their canine soulmates, many find their better selves at the same time. Of the 122 dogs trained over the past five years, only one has not been adopted. Those are great odds for so-called misfit animals\u2014and their caring humans. More than four hundred thousand children in the United States are treated for dog bites each year. Most bites happen during the course of day-to-day activities\u2014and are inflicted by dogs the children know. So how can we keep our kids safe around dogs? First of all, young children should always be supervised with dogs and should learn early on how to be gentle and patient with their canine companions. They need to be taught that dogs shouldn't be tugged on, ridden or dressed up. Similarly, they should learn not to tease a dog, take his toys or food or approach him in his crate or other rest areas. Children should always stay away from lone dogs they don't know. If a calm dog is with its owner, an older child might be able to approach\u2014but only after asking the owner first. When it comes to dogs and kids, safety always comes first. It can be tough to check for oral tumors in our pets when they won't say \"ahhh\" on command. But in our canine companions, anyway, we can use their panting on warm summer days to get a look inside their mouth. If your pet has an oral tumor, you may notice intensely bad breath\u2014the kind that permeates a room\u2014or signs of blood around her mouth or on her toys. She may also be reluctant to bite down on anything or might drop food while eating. If you can examine your pet's mouth, look for lumps or swelling inside the cheeks or on the gums. If you find something, it's not necessarily an aggressive cancer. But have it evaluated by your veterinarian as soon as possible. Many masses can be surgically removed if treatment is not delayed, so checking for oral masses is just one more good reason to schedule regular veterinary visits. "}
