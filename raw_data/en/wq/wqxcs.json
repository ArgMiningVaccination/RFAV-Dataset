It embodies a different paradigm, a different way of looking at the human body, at illness and the healing process. Naturopathy allows that the human body is always working toward a healthy state, that illness is brought on by a disturbance in the natural balance. Healing is accomplished by ridding the disturbance and supporting the body's own healing mechanisms. These ideas can be seen in our guiding principles. Naturopathic Principles - First do no harm / Premum Non Nocere - The healing power of nature/The Vis Medicatrix Naturae - Identify and treat the cause / Tolle Causam - Doctor as teacher / Docere - Treat the whole person / Holism - Prevention Individual Medicine We are as different inside as we are outside. Some people make more digestive enzymes. Some people naturally detox faster or different. Some people metabolize faster. "}
