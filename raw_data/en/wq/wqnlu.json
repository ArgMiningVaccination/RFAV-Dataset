There are simply too many studies, too many data points, and too many facets of disease and wellness. It is impossible for one person to parse and make sense of all this information. Yet we don't want you to trust us just because we tell you to. Trust is earned. We aim to earn your trust by emphasizing objectivity and transparency. Our content is rigorously referenced, and not in the common Internet fashion of citing only the papers that support a given argument. Rather, we cite both sides of important topics, and don't go beyond what studies actually report (in other words, we don't overinterpret findings to support a particular viewpoint). We're able to do this because all of our research staff is required to have no connections to supplement or food companies, and staff members regularly meet to discuss research ethics and study interpretation. We are not gurus, and we don't pretend to have all the answers. Nobody does - that's why science is so fun! 100% independent When it comes to Examine, what you see is what you get. Our fundamental truth is that we are 100% independent. Nobody working at Examine has any conflict of interest - no questionable funding, no suspect affiliations, and no relationships with manufacturers. All the content is generated by our staff, not outsiders. We are the Switzerland of health and nutrition. Full Disclosure Examine is an unbiased nutrition and supplement resource. We are not influenced by commercial interests, product manufacturers, or any other organization, and we do not advertise or promote products or brands. Examine does not accept donations, third-party funding, or sponsorship of any kind. One hundred percent of our revenue is generated through our three information guides and subscriptions - you can see the full list under [How is Examine funded?](#how-is-examine-funded?) And that's what makes Examine so unique and reliable: we only sell information. It doesn't benefit us to hype up any supplement\u2014that's not what we're selling. We're selling you evidence-based analysis. Nothing more, nothing less. 100% transparent and referenced Every statement we make is fully referenced\u2014often many times over. The Examine website is comprised of millions of published words, and with over 60,000 unique references, every single claim is cited. We are not gurus One of the biggest issues online is that a single person may be thought to have the solutions to everything about your health. A cult of personality is formed around these gurus. The reality is that your health is incredibly complex; humans are in fact most complex machines on Earth. It is outright impossible for one person to know and have all the solutions. This is why we have a team of diverse backgrounds - to ensure that we traverse the full breadth and depth of health to help you get the truth. Science is difficult; we don't pretend we have all the answers If there's one thing that sets us apart from gurus it's that we rarely have universal answers. This can, admittedly, be frustrating. But science is incredibly nuanced. Most studies are done on very specific subsets of populations - for example, 20 post-menopausal women who have arthritis. The issue is - how do you take a conclusion from such a group and apply it to the population? This is what makes us reliable - we don't claim to have the single solution for you. Instead, we simply offer you what the science tells us, and help you make the best decision for you.
