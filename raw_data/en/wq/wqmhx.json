If you answered yes to any of these questions, you are not alone\u2014some 75% of Americans are living with uncomfortable digestive symptoms like gas, bloat, loose stools, or abdominal distress.2 In the West, belching, bloat, and indigestion are treated by avoiding carbonated drinks, chewing gum, and swallowing air, as well as using antacids to snuff out stomach acid.1 From the Western perspective, burping, bloat, and indigestion are thought to be caused by issues in the stomach.

There is nothing wrong with an occasional burp, but excessive burping leads to belly bloat, acidity, distension, and abdominal discomfort. An adequate supply of healthy bile from the liver and [gallbladder](https://lifespa.com/best-herbs-for-liver-gallbladder-health/) is required to allow food and stomach acid to be released from the stomach into the small intestine in a timely manner. An adequate amount of bile is also needed to buffer stomach acids, which are used to break down tough proteins. If bile production is compromised, stomach acid and ingested foods will linger in the stomach. This is called gastroparesis in Western medicine and udvarta in Ayurveda. If this problem persist for longer periods of time, belching, bloat and acidity can turn into more concerning food intolerances. The stomach will hold onto the food contents as long as possible while waiting for the green light indicating it's okay to empty the stomach into the small intestine. If that light never goes on, acid build-up in the stomach can eventually force the stomach to produce less acid as a way of protecting its mucosal lining. This results in a more complex situation with low stomach acid and low bile flow, and further levels of bloat, belching, discomfort, and food sensitivity.
