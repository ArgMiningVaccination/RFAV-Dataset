Across many cultures, this time is synonymous with the belief that the veil that separates the earthly plane from the spiritual world thins, making it easier for spirits to cross over and walk amongst the living. Ghosts and spirits have their role in Traditional Chinese Medicine as well. Its origins were rooted in the belief that illness was caused by evil spirits and medical treatments were therefore a means to calm unhappy ancestors. Today, treatment with TCM embodies a holistic approach centered on the mind, body and spirit uniquely working together as one collective network, encompassing our total human experience. Therefore, all of our ailments, symptoms, diseases and behaviors are a result of the connection between the ethereal (heavenly) and the material (earth) nature we exist in. This connection between the body and spirit resonates with the understanding in Western medicine that the brain functions through information received by our internal organs. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, each organ has its own physical, spiritual and mental aspect - minds that branch off from a person's central spirit called \"The Shen.\" The five \"Shen\" or spirits are: Hun, Po, Zhi, Yi and Shen of the Heart and are stored within one of the 5 Yin organs, possessing unique roles and characteristics that assert themselves when either contented or disturbed. When the Five Shen are in balance, they vibrate harmoniously. If our bodies are in spiritual disharmony, the effects can manifest both physically and emotionally. The Five SpiritS (Shen) Ethereal (Hun) of the Liver The Hun or Ethereal Soul is very similar to the Western concept of the soul, which tethers to us at birth but survives the body after death. Located in the liver, the Hun has its own consciousness and must be able to connect and disengage with the mind as it pleases. Our mind is the rational part of us, in charge of processing information while our Ethereal Soul is in charge of bringing the inner world and dreams into awareness or fruition. Hun is linked to our dreams - those we have while we sleep, our aspirations, our human relationships, our creativity and our imagination. It encourages us to think outside the box in order to fulfill our potential. It is the intermediary between our waking and sleeping states. Balanced Hun: Moves freely; our innermost thoughts, dreams, creative aspirations are brought to life Unbalanced Hun: Depression Lack of motivation Difficulty regulating emotions Manic state Disrupted sleep (sleepwalking, intense dreaming, dreamless nights) Corporeal (Po) of the Lungs Po is the spirit-mind stored by our lungs - our most exterior organ and that which represents the structure of the body and our immune system. The lungs are most significantly associated with our sense of survival; our breathing, (the inhalation and exhalation of oxygen) representative of involuntary, life giving functions. As such, Po integrates with us at our first breath and disintegrates at the end of our life when breathing ceases. Spiritually, Po relates to our \"knee jerk\" reactions - our instincts and impulses. Balanced Po: Clear speech Ability to stay connected to the moment through deep breaths Assertive and fair judgment Unbalanced Po: Weak respiratory function Lethargy Sorrow Grief Inability to move forward from the past Will (Zhi) of the Kidneys Stored in our kidneys, the spirit-mind Zhi relates to our will power - the essence of what makes us human. It stores the part of our consciousness that constantly strives to move forward, grow and evolve. It gives us courage to move through fear in order to do something that scares us, pushing past uncertainty in taking a risk. It allows us to adapt through stress, rather than be crippled by it. Zhi involves trust, faith, and acceptance of a future we can't control. Balanced Zhi: Confidence; belief in yourself, no fear of the unknown Unbalanced Zhi: Running away from or ignoring opportunities Lack of drive Depression Memory loss Fatigue Thinking (Yi) of the Spleen The spleen is a major organ for digestion. It separates and transforms useful nutrients from waste. The spirit-mind Yi, which is stored in our spleen, helps us think, study, memorize, focus, concentrate and generate thoughts. Physically, if our spleen isn't functioning as it should, we experience poor digestion. Similarly, a weak Yi poorly digests our thoughts because quite literally, our middle body is \"knotted.\" Balanced Yi: Clear thoughts and actions Routine, structured life Attainable goal setting Faithful and loyal actions Unbalanced Yi: Congested thoughts Overthinking Lacking in intention Heart-Mind (little Shen) of the Heart In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the heart is what governs blood flow, vessels and the function of all internal organs. For this reason, it's referred to as the Monarch - the supreme ruler of our organs and our mind. The \"little\" Shen resides directly in our heart, rooted in and moved by blood and therefore connected to our relationships, allowing us to be loved and to love others and plays a key role in how we process our interactions with others and external stimuli. It's also linked to our sense of identity, consciousness, insight and memory, allowing us to fully be in touch with who we are. As such, when we experience trauma, it damages our little Shen; it's the place we physically feel emotional pain. Balanced Little Shen: Clear speech and vision Self awareness Good sleep patterns Confident self expression Compassion Empathy Flowing ideas Unbalanced Little Shen Cloudy thinking Lack of eye contact, confidence Paranoia Apathy Trouble relating to others, socially awkward Traditional Chinese Medicine tunes into the presence of the Five Spirits. Assessing the state of each spirit is part of the diagnostic process. Acupuncture is not just for either physical ailments or supporting mental health - treating the spirit is intertwined with an individual's healing and overall well being. Treatments intentionally select points that nourish these spirits and tether them to their associated organ systems, making the patient feel more grounded, clear, safe and fully integrated. It's a medicine that blends physicality and energy in order to clear blockages and create space so that you can fully inhabit and express your most vibrant and authentic self.
