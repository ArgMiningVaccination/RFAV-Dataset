Methods: Nine electronic databases were searched from inception to May 2022. Two reviewers screened studies, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias independently. The meta-analysis was performed using the Stata 12.0 software. Results: Eighty-four RCTs that explored the efficacy of 69 kinds of Chinese herbal formulas with various dosage forms (decoction, granule, oral liquid, pill, ointment, capsule, and herbal porridge), involving 6,944 participants were identified. This meta-analysis showed that the application of CHM for CFS can decrease Fatigue Scale scores (WMD: -1.77; 95%CI: -1.96 to -1.57; -15.75; 95%CI: -26.89 to -4.61; p < mental state scores (WMD: -9.72; 95%CI:-12.26 to -6.82 -5.37; 95%CI: -6.13 (RR = 1.41; 95%CI: 1.33-1.49; p < 0.001). However, natural killer cell levels did not change significantly. The included studies did not report any serious adverse events. In addition, the methodology quality of the included RCTs was generally not high. Conclusion: Our study showed that CHM seems to be effective and safe in the treatment of CFS. However, given the poor quality of reports from these studies, the results should be interpreted cautiously. More international multi-centered, double-blinded, well-designed, randomized controlled trials are needed in future research. Systematic Review Registration: [ [https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022319680](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022319680)], identifier [CRD42022319680]. Introduction Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a medically unexplained and debilitating mental and physical condition characterized by persistent fatigue (lasting for at least 6 months) and several other symptoms, including sleep disorders, lengthy malaise after exertion, sore throat, muscle pain, multi-joint pain, tender lymph nodes, headache, impairment of concentration or short-term memory, anxiety, and depression, which lead to severe disability and suffering in patients. Studies have shown that the prevalence of CFS is 0.006%-3% in the general population ( [Cleare et al., 2015](#B15)), and 836,000-2.5 million people suffer from CFS in the US alone ( [Clayton, 2015](#B14)). In addition, a meta-analysis showed that the overall incidence of CFS is 0.77% and 0.76% in Korea and Japan, respectively ( [Lim and Son, 2021](#B54)). If there is no effective treatment, CFS will cause a decline in multi-system function and cause systemic diseases such as immune system, circulatory system, nervous system, digestive system, and visceral dysfunction, thus posing a serious threat to human health. Although the cause of CFS remains uncertain, popular hypotheses include triggers (viral infections, physical trauma, physical and mental stress, vaccinations, and environmental toxins), microbiome disruption, dysregulated immune response, inflammation, neuroendocrine dysfunction, et al., 2019](#B31); [Noor et al., 2021](#B76)). These factors can also interact to promote the occurrence and development of CFS. Some studies have suggested that infectious triggers can trigger systemic inflammation by activating the antiviral immune response ( [Kennedy et al., 2010](#B42); [Maes [Cortes Rivera et al., 2019](#B16)). The composition of gut microbes is altered in CFS patients, which might lead to increased intestinal permeability that allows bacterial translocation into the bloodstream, thus increasing systemic inflammation ( [Deumer et al., 2021](#B17)). The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is impaired in patients with CFS, which may result in neuroendocrine abnormalities and metabolic and inflammatory changes ( [Deumer et al., 2021](#B17)). In addition, genetic predisposition is associated with autoimmunity ( [Deumer et al., 2021](#B17)). Currently, the treatment of CFS remains suboptimal because there is a lack of an adequate understanding of the mechanisms and etiology of the disease. Current recommendations for the treatment of CFS include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), graded exercise therapy (GET), western conventional medicine (WCM), complementary or alternative medicine, and nutritional support therapy. CBT challenges patients' thoughts to relieve patients' psychological stress, and this may provide short-term benefits but does not permanently reduce symptoms ( [Fernie et al., 2016](#B23); [Geraghty and Blease, 2018](#B26)). Exercise therapy, including aerobic exercises (e.g., walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling) and anaerobic exercises (e.g., strength and stability exercises), could improve physical function and reduce fatigue ( [Marques et al., 2015](#B69); [Larun et al., 2017](#B45)). However, some patients have expressed disappointment with GET because it can interfere with the outcome of alternative treatments and may indirectly exacerbate symptoms in patients ( [Goudsmit and Howes, 2017](#B30); [Geraghty and such as immune modulators, antivirals, antidepressants, antibiotics, and medications to treat specific symptoms that are used for treating CFS have insufficient evidence for their efficacy and may cause serious adverse effects ( [M\u00fccke et al., 2015](#B73); [Smith et al., 2015](#B90); [Yang et al., 2017](#B116)). In addition, alternative medicine (e.g., meditation and relaxation response, warm baths, massages, stretching, acupuncture, hydrotherapy, chiropractic, yoga, and Tai Chi), nutritional support therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, physiotherapy, and nerve blocks have all been proposed, but the evidence regarding these treatments is limited and their efficacy is uncertain ( [Bested and Marshall, 2015](#B2); [Noor et al., 2021](#B76)). Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been widely used to treat CFS in China and other parts of the world, such as South Korea and Japan ( [Wang et al., 2014](#B104); [Joung et al., 2019](#B41); [Shin et al., 2021](#B88)). First, according to the dialectical treatment theory of traditional Chinese medicine, specific formulas consisting of different Chinese herbs are used to treat CFS patients with different symptoms. Such treatment tailored to the patient's specific needs is urgently needed given the obvious heterogeneity in CFS symptoms. The pathogenesis of CFS in traditional Chinese medicine is the deficiency of qi, blood, and yin and yang, accompanied by the stagnation of qi, fire, phlegm, and blood. The treatment is focused on tonifying deficiencies and relieving bruising. CHM such can deficiency and improve fatigue and lengthy malaise after exertion in CFS patients, whereas Bupleurum falcatum L. and Citrus \u00d7 aurantium L., among others, can resolve stagnation and relieve pain, insomnia, swollen lymph nodes, and other symptoms. Therefore, CHM can not only improve the main symptoms, but also relieve the accompanying symptoms in CFS. Second, modern pharmacological research has demonstrated that the modern use of CHM in treating CFS mainly focuses on adjusting immune dysfunction, acting as an antioxidant, improving the energy metabolism disorder, and regulating abnormal activity in the HPA axis ( [Chen Yangrong decoction can regulate the immune function of patients with CFS and relieve fatigue symptoms ( [Ogawa et al., et Epimedium brevicornum Maxim., can improve energy metabolism and can regulate the abnormal activity of the HPA axis ( [Chi et al., 2016](#B12); [Chi et al., 2017](#B11)). Additionally, multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported that CHM significantly improves fatigue, insomnia, and other concomitant symptoms; reduces negative emotions such as anxiety and depression; and clearly improves treatment effectiveness and quality of life compared to exercise therapy and alternative therapy ( [Wang et al., 2011](#B103); and meta-analyses comparing CHM with western medicine also confirmed the above views ( [Peng et al., 2013](#B80); [Wang et al., 2014](#B104)). These studies demonstrate the remarkable efficacy and comprehensiveness of CHM for CFS, which is consistent with treatment guidelines emphasizing a holistic, patient-centered approach that considers the patient's physical, mental, and social well-being ( [Baker and Shaw, 2007](#B1)). Finally, CHM has no serious side effects and is relatively safe to treat CFS. A previous meta-analysis and another systematic review indicated the beneficial role of CHM as a complementary approach for CFS ( [Peng et al., 2013](#B80); [Wang et al., 2014](#B104)). However, those studies were limited in terms of sample size and outcome indicators because the systematic review only assessed 10 RCTs (including 919 patients), and the meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (including 1,049 patients) only assessed clinical efficacy rates and lacked sufficient evidence. In addition, nearly 50 new trials assessing the effects of CHM for CFS have been published since the previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses were published. Therefore, we conducted a larger systematic review and meta-analysis including more outcome indicators (FS-14, FAI, SCL-90, SAS, SDS, clinical symptom scores, IGA, IGG, IGM, NK cell levels, effective rate, and adverse events) to provide a comprehensive update of previously published studies and stronger evidence for the effectiveness of CHM for CFS. Methods Protocol and registration This meta-analysis was reported in compliance with the PRISMA statement, and the protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022319680). [ [https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022319680](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022319680)]. The full details of the protocol are available on request. Search strategy Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, Chinese VIP Database, the US Clinical Trials Registry, and the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry were systematically searched from their inception to May 2022. There was no restriction on language. The search terms used included \"Fatigue The full details of the search strategy are available (Additional file [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7059303/)). In addition, we performed manual searches in the reference lists of previously published systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the subject to further look for potentially eligible studies. The search was conducted independently by two authors (YZ and WS). Eligibility criteria Types of studies RCTs assessing the efficacy and safety of CHM in the treatment of CFS were included in our review. We only extracted data from the CHM and control groups when we found relevant studies with three treatment groups. Types of participants Trials of participants over the age of 16 were included regardless of gender, culture, or setting. CFS was diagnosed using the Center for Disease Control criteria (1987, 1994, or 1998), the Guiding Principles for Clinical Research of New Chinese Medicines (2002), Chinese medicine internal disease diagnosis and treatment routines, the clinical research guidelines for new Chinese medicines for CFS, Chinese internal medicine diagnoses, or the diagnostic efficacy criteria for Chinese medical evidence. All patients had the primary symptom of unexplained fatigue that lasted at least 6 months accompanied by four or more of the following symptoms: unrefreshing sleep, lengthy malaise after exertion, impairment of concentration or short-term memory, sore throat, tender lymph nodes, multi-joint pain, and headaches. Types of interventions The formulations of CHM were included. CHM is defined as medicinal raw materials derived from medicinal plants, minerals, and animal sources, according to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia edited in 2020 ( [Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2020](#B13)). A formulation of CHM is usually made up of two or more herbs to produce a synergistic effect on specific illnesses. These materials are prescribed by doctors based on the individual characteristics of the patient according to the dialectical treatment theory of traditional Chinese medicine ( [Xiong et al., 2019](#B110); [Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2020](#B13)). Participants were treated with CHM alone or combined with WCM, GET, or health guidance. We did not place any limits on the formulation of CHM or the duration of treatment, but CHM was required to be taken orally. We did not include experiments combining Chinese herbal medicine with other traditional Chinese medicine treatments. Types of controls Patients in the control group used WCM, GET, health guidance, or placebo, with no limit on the duration of treatment. We did not include experiments combining any Chinese medicine therapy. Types of outcome measures The primary outcome measures were Fatigue Scale (FS-14) and Fatigue Assessment Instrument (FAI) scores. The secondary outcome measures were Self-Rating Scale of mental state (SCL-90) scores, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores, Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores, clinical symptom scores, immunological indicators (IGA, IGG, IGM, and NK cell levels), effective rate, and adverse events. The clinical symptom scores are used to assess the severity of fatigue. The main symptoms and other symptoms of CFS are scored according to their severity, and a higher cumulative score of all symptoms indicates more severe fatigue symptoms. The effective rate is a measure to assess clinical efficacy. It is assessed at the end of treatment using four grades: clinical cure (the patients' clinical symptoms were basically cured, and they could live and work normally), markedly effective (the cure rate for major and concomitant clinical symptoms up to 2/3), effective (the cure rate for major and concomitant clinical symptoms is 1/3 to 2/3), and invalid (the cure rate for major and concomitant clinical symptoms <1/3). Study selection Study selection was performed independently by two authors (YZ and FJ) according to the inclusion criteria. After eliminating duplicates, they independently scanned the title/abstract and full text to identify eligible studies. Any disagreements were settled by a discussion with a third evaluator (WS). Data extraction Two investigators (YZ and XW) independently reviewed and extracted the following information: general information (first author, year of publication, region, and types), characteristics of the participants (sample size, age, gender, and course of disease), details of the intervention and the comparison (type of intervention and duration), and outcomes. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussions or adjudication by a third reviewer (YP). Quality assessment The risk of bias in the included studies was evaluated independently by two authors (XW and FJ) using the Cochrane collaboration tool with the following seven domains: random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), and other bias. Each domain can be classified as \"low-risk,\" \"high-risk,\" or \"uncertain risk.\" Any differences were resolved by discussion with a third evaluator. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the Stata software (version 12.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX). The weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous variables and the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (Cl) were used. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q test and the I2 statistic. When p 0.10 and I2 50%, the fixed-effect model was used; otherwise, the random effects model was used. p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and Egger's test if the number of trials was sufficient. When heterogeneity was detected, the sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the stability of the results by excluding individual studies one by one. Subgroup analysis was performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity according to treatment method (CHM vs. WCM, CHM plus WCM vs. WCM, CHM vs. GET, CHM plus GET vs. GET, CHM vs. health guidance, and CHM vs. placebo) and duration of the intervention (30 days vs. 31-60 days vs. > 60 days) based on different treatment methods. Results Literature search We identified 1,829 articles in the original screening. After eliminating duplicates, 1,039 remained, 894 of which were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria after scanning the titles and abstracts. Moreover, we reviewed the full text of the remaining 145 articles and deleted 61 articles due to the following reasons: 1) non-RCTs, 2) Chinese medicine therapy used in the control group, 3) non-Chinese herbal compounds used, 4) published using repeated data, and 5) missing data. Finally, 84 articles were included in the meta-analysis ( [Figure 1](#F1)). Study characteristics and quality assessment A total of 84 RCTs were included, published from 2002 to 2022, and all studies were conducted in China. The sample sizes in the studies varied from 38 to 230 patients, with a total sample size of 3,552 patients in the treatment groups and 3,392 patients in the control groups. The duration of diseases lasted from 0.5 to 24.27 years. Of the 84 studies, five trials ( [Liu [Sheng et compared CHM with placebo, whereas comparisons of CHM alone vs. WCM were performed in 63 studies ( [Ning and Li, [Yang et 2011](#B62); 2011](#B122); [Zhang Z. X. et L. [Guo et al., [Jie and 2018](#B57); [Li et al., 2021](#B47)); CHM was compared in one study ( [Wang, 2021](#B101)); CHM plus GET vs. GET was compared two studies ( [Wang et al., 2011](#B103); [Kong, 2012](#B43)); and CHM vs. guidance was compared in one study ( [Ye, 2017](#B118)). The course of treatment ranged from 7 to 120 days. In the outcome indicators, 26 studies ( [Jie and Wang, 2009](#B40); [Chen et 2011](#B62); 2011](#B122); et et and ( 2009](#B126); [Zhang et et 2019](#B34)) reported the of IGA, IGG, three studies ( [Zhang et al., 2022](#B84)) NK cell 79 studies and Z. 2012](#B121); [Wang, 2021](#B101)) reported effective rate. The occurrence of adverse effects was reported in 14 studies ( [Liu and Cai, 2018](#B57)). The basic characteristics of the included studies are summarized in [Table 1](#T1), and components of CHM used in the included studies are presented in [Table 2](#T2). The quality assessment of the included studies is listed in [Table 3](#T3). The Cochrane score ranged from 3 to 7, and three studies ( [Liu J. et al., 2019](#B58); [Liu et al., 2021](#B59); Z. X. et al., 2012](#B127); [Zhang L. 2012](#B121); got 3 points. All of the included studies reported random allocation, and 44 studies ( [Fang et al., 2007](#B21); al., 2022](#B84)) described the method of random sequence generation, whereas the remaining 40 studies ( [Ning and Li, 2002](#B74); [Yang et Z. X. et al., 2012](#B127); [Zhang L. 2012](#B121); 2018](#B107); al., al., 2022](#B84)) mentioned Three trials J. et 2019](#B58); [Liu et al., 2021](#B59); [Sheng et al., 2022](#B84)) reported double blinding of patients and physicians, and ( [Li, 2021](#B59); [Sheng et al., 2022](#B84)) described blinding of participants. All studies met the criterion of incomplete outcome data as drop-out data, or no drop-out patients were reported specifically. Pre-designed outcomes were reported in all studies, detecting a low risk of reporting bias, and other biases were not found in all included studies. Results of meta-analysis Primary outcomes FS-14 scores Pooled data from the 26 studies ( [Jie and Wang, 2009](#B40); [Chen et 2011](#B62); 2011](#B122); et et and reporting the FS-14 scores showed that CHM clearly decreased the FS-14 scores as an adjuvant or monotherapy for CFS compared with the contrast group (WMD: -1.77; = results ( [Table 4](#T4)). FAI scores Meta-analysis of the nine et al., et reporting the FAI scores showed that the treatment group had significantly decreased FAI scores compared to the control group (WMD: -15.75; 95%CI: -26.89 = = 87.7%) between CHM and WCM groups when the duration of intervention >60 days, whereas the relationship between the CHM treatment group and lower FAI scores remained constant in the other subgroups ( [Table 4](#T4)). Secondary outcomes SCL-90 scores The SCL-90 scores were reported in five studies ( [Zhang et al., 2009](#B126); [Zhang Z. X. et et [Niu et al., 2015](#B75); [Sheng et al., 2022](#B84)). The pooled results suggested that SCL-90 scores were significantly lower in the CHM group compared to the contrast group (WMD: -9.72; 95%CI: -12.26 to I2 = 7.2%; [Figure analysis showed similar results ( [Table 4](#T4)). SAS scores Seven studies SAS scores, and meta-analysis indicated that CHM therapy clearly decreased SAS scores compared to the contrast group (WMD: -7.07; 95%CI: -9.96 = 94.6%; [Figure 5](#F5)), and subgroup that the results remained constant ( [Table 4](#T4)). SDS scores Meta-analysis of six RCTs SDS scores ( [Jie and Wang, [Zhang, 2021](#B120)) showed that the experimental group had significantly reduced SDS scores compared to the contrast group (WMD: -5.45; 95%CI: -6.82 = 84.1%; [Figure 6](#F6)). the results remained constant ( [Table 4](#T4)). Clinical symptom scores The summary data of 24 studies ( [Zhang et al., 2004](#B123); [Yao and CHM, as an adjuvant or monotherapy, significantly decreased the clinical symptom scores compared with the control group (WMD: -5.37; 95%CI: -6.13 = 96.6%; [Figure 7](#F7)). Subgroup analysis was performed, showing that the conclusion that CHM is relatively effective in treating CFS remained unchanged in each subgroup ( [Table 4](#T4)). Immunological indicators We identified eight RCTs that reported the IGA, IGG, and IGM levels ( 71.4%; [Figure to Three studies [Zhang et al., 2009](#B126); [Wu et al., 2012](#B108); [Sheng et al., 2022](#B84)) reported the NK cell levels, and the meta-analysis indicated no significant difference between the experimental and control groups (WMD: 2.30; 95%CI: -0.47 to I2 = 64.3%; [Figure 8D](#F8)). Subgroup analyses of the IGG no significant difference (WMD: 0.21; 95%CI: = 89.1%, respectively) between the CHM and WCM groups when the duration of intervention >60 days, and the subgroup analysis of the IGM showed no statistical significance (WMD: 0.02; 95%CI: -0.10 to 0.15; between the CHM and WCM groups when the duration of intervention 30 days. The rest of the results indicated that the conclusion that CHM can elevate IGA, IGG, and IGM remained constant ( [Table 4](#T4)). The subgroup analysis of the NK cell no statistical significance (WMD: 0.94; 95%CI: -1.14 I2 = 0.0%) between the CHM and WCM groups, whereas one study comparing CHM with placebo showed that CHM significantly elevated the NK cell levels 4](#T4)). Effective rate The effective rate was evaluated in 79 trials ( [Ning and Li, 2002](#B74); [Yang et Z. 2012](#B121); [Wang, 2021](#B101)), and the pooled results showed that it was higher in the treatment group compared to the control group (RR = 1.41; 95%CI: 1.33-1.49; p (RR: 1.13; 95%CI: 0.99 to 1.28; p 0.234; 31.1%) in CHM plus WCM compared with WCM when 30 days < intervention time 60 days, and only one study compared CHM and GET, showing similar results (RR: 1.16; 95%CI: 0.98-1.38; p = 0.093; no heterogeneity), whereas the rest of the results revealed that effectiveness of CHM for CFS remained constant ( [Table 4](#T4)). Adverse events Adverse events ( [Sun et al., 2007](#B93); [Wang, 2017](#B102)) reported that no adverse events occurred. The rest of the studies did not report the presence or absence of adverse events. The adverse events in the CHM group included mild nausea, dry mouth, indigestion, constipation, and fever. The majority of adverse events were mild, and serious adverse events or deaths were not found in the included studies, which suggests that CHM is relatively safe in patients with CFS. Sensitivity analysis We conducted a sensitivity analysis on FS-14, FAI, SAS, SDS, clinical symptom scores, IGA, IGG, IGM, NK cell levels, and effective rate. After we excluded each study one by one, the pooled WMD or RR for the rest of the RCTs did not change significantly, indicating that the result data were robust (Additional file 2). Publication bias The funnel plot showed a symmetric distribution of trials on either side of the funnel, and Egger's test (p = 0.795) was consistent with the funnel plot, indicating that no significant publication bias existed in this meta-analysis (Additional file 3). Description of the CHM Our study evaluated 69 kinds of Chinese herbal formulas, including 54 decoctions, five granules, three oral liquids, three pills, two ointments, one capsule, and one herbal porridge. The most frequently used herbs in all formulations contained Chai Hu (Bupleurum falcatum L.); 5](#T5)). Discussion fatigue, including idiopathic chronic fatigue and CFS, is an unexplained adverse condition characterized by fatigue accompanied by behavioral, emotional, social, and cognitive imbalances. Approximately 10% of the general population suffers from chronic fatigue, which significantly reduces their quality of life and their ability to work. This is an important health care issue, presenting major challenges for its sufferers and health services. At present, a clear therapeutic approach is still lacking, but the use of CHM in patients with chronic fatigue is receiving increasing attention from physicians. Summary of the evidence A total of 84 RCTs, including 6,944 individuals, were identified for analysis. The findings demonstrated that CHM as adjuvant therapy or monotherapy for CFS could decrease the FS-14, FAI, SCL-90, SAS, SDS, and clinical symptom scores and improve IGA, IGG, IGM, and the effective rate. Two internationally recognized scales were used to quantitatively assess fatigue. The FS-14 developed by Trudie Chalde et al. in 1993 consists of 14 items, each of which is a fatigue-related question, and it mainly reflects the changes in fatigue symptoms from two different perspectives (physical fatigue and mental fatigue), thus reflecting the real level of fatigue of patients in a more comprehensive way. The FAI includes 27 fatigue-related questions. Subjects rate each item based on their own performance over the previous 2 weeks, which can accurately and quantitatively evaluate the degree and characteristics of fatigue. In this study, CHM treatment significantly reduced FS-14 and FAI scores, indicating that it improved fatigue symptoms. Patients with CFS commonly suffer from negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, paranoia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The degree of negative emotions is mainly assessed by professional mental status assessment scales such as SCL-90, SAS, and SDS. The present meta-analysis shows that CHM treatment can relatively improve negative emotions in patients with chronic fatigue. The clinical effective rate and clinical symptom scores were used to evaluate the efficacy of CHM in the treatment of CFS because the severity of clinical symptoms is used to determine whether the disease is in remission. The clinical efficiency rate in patients treated with CHM alone or with CHM plus other treatments (e.g., WCM, GET, or health guidance) was 90% (2,961/3,308). The clinical efficiency rate in patients treated only with WCM, GET, health guidance, or placebo was 62% (1,956/3,149). Thus, CHM treatment clearly increased the efficiency rate and reduced the clinical symptom scores compared to WCM, GET, health guidance, or placebo, thus showing that CHM is effective to some extent for CFS. Numerous studies have revealed that CFS is associated with immune system dysfunction ( [Matsuda et al., 2009](#B70); [Guenther et 2017](#B72); [Sotzny et al., 2018](#B91)). Most CFS patients are prone to physical weakness and fatigue due to low immune function. Moreover, when the body tissue is in a state of fatigue for a long time, it will consume and destroy the immune system, which will eventually lead to low immune function. Immunoglobulins (IGA, IGG, and IGM) are important parts of humoral immunity. A study found that IGA, IGG, and IGM levels are significantly lower in patients with CFS than in healthy subjects ( [Hou et al., 2015](#B36)). Our meta-analysis showed that the treatment group had elevated IGA, IGG, and IGM levels compared to the control group. In addition, immunological indicators also include NK cells and T lymphocyte CD8+, cell activity, CD4+, and CD8+ were all significantly reduced in CFS patients ( [Hou et al., 2015](#B36)). The results of our meta-analysis did not find any obvious effects of CHM on NK cell activity in CFS patients. However, three trials ( [Zhang et al., 2009](#B126); [Wu et 2022](#B84)) suggested that CFS patients' NK cell activity was higher in the CHM treatment group. We cannot reject the positive effect of CHM on the NK cell activity of CFS patients based on the negative results of this meta-analysis, which may be due to the lack of appropriate courses of treatment and limited sample sizes. Furthermore, a study showed that CHM dramatically improved NK cell activities, T cell proliferation, CD4 +/CD8 + ratio, and CD4 + counts in CFS rats, suggesting that CHM can improve the immune function of patients with CFS ( [Chi et al., 2015](#B10)). Taken together, CHM may prevent CFS by modulating immune function, but further research is needed to confirm this. Furthermore, only 14 studies referred to minor adverse reactions, and there were no serious adverse events, showing that CHM generally appears safe and effective for treating CFS. Thus, the present evidence supports that CHM can potentially be recommended for use in CFS patients. Strengths and limitations Our study included a large number of RCTs and large sample sizes (84 RCTs with 6,944 patients) and used more internationally recognized outcome measures to assess the effectiveness of CHM for CFS from different aspects. These outcome indicators included not only subjective indicators (FS-14, FAI, SCL-90, SAS, SDS, clinical symptom scores, and effective rate), but also the objective immune indicators IGA, IGG, IGM, NK cell levels, and adverse events. In addition, we included many new trials that were not included in the previous reviews and meta-analyses to provide a comprehensive update. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results of the current meta-analysis are relatively robust, and we found no evidence of publication bias in this meta-analysis by funnel plot and Egger's test. Some limitations must be considered. First, although we included RCTs, some methodological limitations still existed in most studies. Specifically, 44 trials supplied sufficient information on the randomization process, only five RCTs described allocation concealment, only three trials reported double blinding of patients and physicians, and only eight trials described blinding of participants. These methodological flaws might generate bias, so our results should be interpreted cautiously. Second, there is significant clinical heterogeneity due to the variations in composition and dosage of CHM and different dosage forms of CHM (e.g., decoction, granule, oral liquid, pill, ointment, and capsule). Finally, all trials were conducted in China, which may limit the generalizability of the findings presented here. Therefore, further international multicenter RCTs are needed to popularize the results globally. Furthermore, we conducted subgroup analyses to explore the sources of heterogeneity based on the different intervention duration and measures. The result showed that the heterogeneity was lower after grouping according to the results of subgroup analyses, indicating that differences in intervention duration and measures may also be the underlying source of heterogeneity. Implications for research Based on the above limitations, some recommendations are suggested for further studies. First, further rigorously designed trials with high methodological quality are urgently needed. We advise designing and reporting RCTs of CFS strictly according to the CONSORT 2010 statement ( [Schulz et al., 2010](#B82)) and the CONSORT Extension for Chinese Herbal Medicine Formulas 2017 ( [Cheng et al., 2017](#B8)). Random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding should all be strictly implemented in future studies. Second, an efficacy evaluation system in line with the characteristics of CHM should be set up, and sensitive and practical indicators of CHM should be explored. Third, adverse effects were not reported in many studies. Therefore, the presence or absence of adverse events should be reported in future studies based on the standard format of adverse reactions established by [Bian et al. (2010](#B3)), and clinical trials and studies with longer follow-up times should be conducted to confirm the long-term safety of CHM for CFS. Implications for practice The evidence available from our study suggested the effectiveness and safety of CHM therapy for CFS. The most commonly used herbs This list can facilitate further exploration of the therapeutic principles of these drugs for CFS in order to further develop herbal prescriptions to improve the efficacy and safety of the treatment of CFS. In addition, the efficacy of CHM depends on the accurate dialectical treatment, and the prescription of CHM should be based on the precise dialectical diagnosis of CFS. Thus, individualized herbal prescriptions can be implemented in future clinical practice by selecting appropriate drugs among the frequently used drugs. The possible mechanisms of CHM for CFS are as follows. 1) Adjusting the immune dysfunction: a study found that Young Yum Pill, a proprietary herbal drug, could improve immune organ (thymus and spleen) indices, the mitogenic response of lymphocytes, and decoction can ameliorate lower NK cell activity, and extracts of Ginseng can also boost natural killer cell function and the cellular immunity of patients with CFS ( [Ogawa et major components of the antioxidative system, and their function is to detoxify ( Ginkgo L. have also reported to possess beneficial antioxidants for CFS ( [Logan and metabolic dysfunction: Chi al.'s study confirmed that SCP treatment affects metabolic pathways, including the TCA cycle and and energy supply and ameliorate the CFS-weakened immunity ( [Miao et al., 2022](#B71)). In addition, HEP2-a increased the creatine level to improve the arginine and proline metabolism ( [Chi et al., 2017](#B11)). 4) Regulating the abnormal activity of the HPA axis: Chi inferred that HEP2-a indirectly affected the HPA axis abnormality of CFS by increasing the noradrenaline level ( [Chi et al., 2017](#B11)). Conclusion In conclusion, the current evidence suggests that CHM, either as adjuvant therapy or monotherapy, decreases FS-14, FAI, SCL-90, SAS, SDS, and clinical symptom scores and enhances IGA, IGG, IGM, and effective rate. However, NK cell levels did not change significantly. In addition, the included studies did not report serious adverse events, suggesting that CHM is relatively safe in patients with CFS. Our findings on commonly used CHM may help investigate their value and further clinical application for CFS. Our study suggests that CHM seems to be effective and safe in the treatment of CFS. However, given the poor quality of the included studies, more international multi-centered, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, well-designed clinical trials are needed in future research.
