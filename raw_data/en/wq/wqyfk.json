Washington State Page 95 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 5 PAYMENT AND SANCTIONS Rates/Premiums Subject to the Sanctions provisions of this Section, HCA shall pay a monthly premium for each Medicaid Enrollee in full consideration of the work to be performed by the Contractor under this Contract. HCA will only pay monthly premium payments for Medicaid E nrollees in the eligible client groups detailed in Subsection 4.3 of this Contract. HCA shall pay the Contrac tor, on or before the fifteenth calendar day of the month based on HCA list of Enrollees whose enrollment is ongoing or effective on the first day of said calendar month. Such payment will be denied for new Enrollee s when, and for so long as, payment for those Enrollee s is denied by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.726(b) or 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.730(e). Monthly Premium Payment Calculation The capitation rates are identified and developed, and payment is made in accordanc e with 42 C .F.R. \u00a7 438.3(c). Supporting rate documentation demonstrates that the rate development process meets the requirements of 42 C.F.R. Part 438 and generally accepted actuarial principles and practices. The monthly premium payment for each AH -IMC Enrollee will be calculated as follows: Premium Payment = Capitation Rate (at the region, program, age/gender cell level) x Risk Adjustment Factor x Withhold Factor The BHSO Enrollee s will be divided into the following categories for calculation of the monthly premium payment: Non-Disabled Child ; Disabled Child ; Non-Disabled Adult ; Disabled Adult ; and Newly Eligible . Additional premium payments include Delivery Case Rate Payments , Wraparound with Intensive Services (WISe), and New Journeys as described in the Delivery Case Rate Payment, WISe Payment, and New Journeys subsections in this Contract. The premium payment formula is established by HCA and will vary between the Apple Health (AH) Family Adult, AH Family Child , Apple Health S tate Children's Health Insurance Program (S CHIP), Apple Health Blind Disabled (AHBD) , Apple Health C ommunity Options Program Entry System (COPES) , Developmental Disability Administration (DDA), and Apple Health Adult Coverage - (AHAC ) populations. The base rates will initially be the same for all Contractors, but may vary based on risk adjustment factors . The Risk Adjustment Factors will be establis hed by HCA 's designated actuary for the AH Family Adult, AH Family Child , SCHIP, AHBD , COPES, DDA, AHAC, and BHSO populations to reflect differences in the relative health status of the Washington State Page 96 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 populations enrolled with the Contractors , separately for physical and behavioral health capitation rates . The Risk Adjustment Factors are calculated by geographical region and by Contractor. HCA's designated actuary creates risk adjustment factors with Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System (CDPS) and MedicaidRx. There are separate risk adjustment factors for the physical health and behavioral health rate components. The behavioral health risk adjustment factors are calculated under a custom methodology, by stratifying members into behavioral health acuity cohorts by rate cell, aid category and region, assigning an average cost risk weight and comparing the implied MCO averages to develop relative risk factors. HCA's designated actuary will perform the calculations and will generate initial methodology and final risk adjustment reports. The risk adjustment factors are developed to be budget neutral at a region and aid category level. Additional information regarding risk adjustments can be found in the rate certification developed by the designated actuary for the cont ract period. The Withhold Factor is intended to hold back a percentage amount, as identified in Exhibit D , Value- Based Purchasing, of the capitation payments excluding any administrative, WSHIP, Safety Net , PAP, or FQHC/RHC/IHS encounter enhancement funding. A calculated portion of the amount withheld from the monthly premium payment will be released upon demonstrated improvement towards the quality measure benchmarks and physician incentive agreements defined in Exhibit D , Value- Based Pur chasing. HCA shall automatically generate newborn premiums upon enrollment of the newborn. For newborns whose premiums HCA does not automatically generate, the Contractor shall submit a premium payment request to HCA within 365 calendar days of the date of birth. HCA shall pay within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of the premium payment request. HCA shall make a full monthly payment to the Contractor for the month in which an Enrollee's enrollment is terminated except as otherwise provided in this Contract. The Contractor shall be responsible for contracted services provided to the Enrollee in any month for which HCA paid the Contractor for the Enrollee 's care under the terms of this Contract. Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) Report In accordance with 42 C.F.R . \u00a7 438.8 and Exhibit F, Instructions for Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) Reporting of this Contract , MCOs must report a Medical Loss Ratio calculation to HCA annually on May 31. The MLR Reporting template and instructions are available via MC -Track. Audited Financial Report In accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.3(m), the Contractor shall submit an Audited Annual Financial Report to HCA that is specific to this Contract. The Contractor shall submit the report to HCA via MC -Track no later than June 5 of each year. The first report is due June 5, 2023, for the previous calendar year. The report shall utilize filing instructions from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner and shall adhere to generally accepted accounting principles or, statutory accounting principles and generally accepted auditing standards. Washington State Page 97 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 Risk Corridor Calculation MCOs must report MLR experience calculated in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.8. Any settlements which r esult from the risk corridor calculation will be limited such that the Contractor's minimum MLR will not be less than 85 percent when the settlement amount is included in the MLR calculation. HCA performs a two -sided Risk Corridor calculation on an annual basis which includes downside protection for excess medical cost losses incurred by the Contractor. HCA will perform Risk Corridor calculations for the Integrated Managed Care (AH -IMC) AH Family Adult, AH Family , AHAC , and BH SO populations. Separate calculations of gain or loss will be done for each population due to differences in assumed administrative loads included in the rates for each program. Upon completion of the separate calculations, the results for the seven populations will be aggregated to determine any net gain or loss. The Risk Corridor is calculated separately for each Contractor. The following methods will be used to calculate r isk corridor components: Total Revenue is the sum of all Pre-Tax Capitation Rates including the results of the HIRP settlement in Subsection 5.8 below , Delivery Case Rate Payments . Total revenue should include administrative costs. Total Revenue also assumes full recovery by the Contractor of the withheld funds as described in Exhibit D, Value- Based Purchasing, regardless of whether those funds were actually recovered under the capitation withhold arrangement described in Exhibit D. Pre-tax capitation rates means that the B&O Tax, and Premium Tax related revenue will be excluded from this risk corridor computation. Total Net Revenue is equal to Total Revenue, net of the following components of capitation revenue: any Safety Net, WSHIP , or other state -directed payments that are not included in base experience data incorporated in the base capitation rate development process . Revenue for Health Care Expenses is defined as the Total Net Revenue less an assumed administrative load, consistent with the administrative load assumptions applied and documented in the actuarial rate certification . [(Total Net Revenue) x (1- administrative load)] Actual administrative expenses will not be included in the computation. The administrative load varies by population and rate period. The assumed administrative load is shown on Exhibit A. Net Health Care Expenses will be based on the actual medical service expenses incurred during the contract year less any reimbursements from third-party reimbursements (including, but not limited , to pharmacy rebates, pricing guarantee payments from pharmacies and PBM, Overpayment or audit recoveries from providers, net reinsurance costs or third-party liability offsets) and less provider pass -through or directed payments that are not minimum fee schedules plus activit ies that improve health care quality as defined in 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 158.150, excluding any overhead allocations. Reduction must also be made for claims costs represented by encounters that are rejected by ProviderOne. Washington State Page 98 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 Subcontractor expenses will be handled in accordance with the most recent CMS MLR guidance; current guidance can be found in CIB051519. Upon request by HCA, the Contractor will report its health care expenses for the year with any adjustments and run out claims as specified in the request from HCA . The template for providing the data and due date for the report will be included in the request from HCA . If the Contractor has a material recovery after the final Risk Corridor calculation has been completed by the designated actuary for items which include, but are not limited to, pharmacy rebates, pricing guarantee payments from pharmacies and PBM, Overpayment or audit recoveries from providers, net reinsurance costs or third-party liability offsets, then the material recovery may be remitted to HCA in full by the Contractor . HCA will make the determination of whether the material recovery is remitted to HCA in full by the Contractor . For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'material recovery' means a recovery for which the Contractor's calculated gain would exceed the minimum threshold of the Risk Corridor when the gain is adjusted to reflect any such recovery. Contractor's Gain/Loss will be calculated for each population using the following formula: Revenue for Health Care Expenses - Net Heal th Care Expenses (based on the actual incurred expenses for health care) = Net Gain/Loss (for the health care services provided by population). The N et Gain/Loss divided by the Total Net Revenue will provide a percentage of the gain/ loss, which will be co mpared to the appropriate gain sharing/risk corridor thresholds established by HCA. Under the Risk Corridor, HCA will share in both gain and loss as defined in subsection 5.5.5 of this Contract. Six (6) months following the end of the calendar year, using the financial reports provided by the Contractor, a simple profit and loss statement will be developed for the health services portion for each of the applicable populations. For the Risk Corridor, after aggregating the results for all populations, if the Contractor experiences gain exceeding 1 percent, HCA will share equally in the gain between 1 percent and 2 percent. HCA will recover all gains exceeding 2 percent. The Contractor will only be required to reimburse HCA if it experiences an actual gain above 1 percent. If the Contractor experiences loss exceeding 3 percent, HCA will share equally in all losses exceeding 3 percent. The Contractor will only receive reimbursement from HCA if it experiences an actual loss exceeding 3 percent. Following the completion of the final Risk Corridor calculations, HCA will share the report from HCA's designated actuaries and supporting information with the Contractor via email. Additional Contractor -specific data files in support of the calculations will be provided to the Contractor via HCA Managed File Transfer (MFT) sites. An Invoice Voucher form (A-19) will be provided to each Contractor indicating the amount due to, or due from, the Contractor. Washington State Page 99 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 To convey agreement with the final calculations, the Contractor shall sign and return an electronic copy of the Invoice Voucher (A -19) form within fifteen ( 15) calendar days of receipt of the final Risk Corridor documentation. To convey disagreement with the final calculations, the Contractor may request a dispute resolution conference by submitting a written request to HCA within fifteen ( 15) calendar days of receipt of the final Risk Corridor documentation, in accordance with Subsection 2.10 of this Contract . If HCA owes reimbursement to the Contractor, payment will be initiated via a gross adjustment in ProviderOne within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the signed Invoice Voucher (A-19). If the Contractor owes a remittance to HCA, they can choose to either send payment via wire transfer or ask HCA to recoup the amount due via a gross adjustment in ProviderOne. Contractors that owe a remittance amount shall indicate the method of payment to HCA when they return the signed Invoice Voucher (A-19). If the Contractor chooses to pay via wire transfer, HCA financial services staff will provide the correct coding to use for the transfer of funds. Payment of the remittance amount owed is due within thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of the signed Invoice Voucher (A-19) form. Recoupments Unless mutually agreed by the parties in writing, HCA shall only recoup premium payments and retroactively terminate enrollment for an individual Enrollee: With Duplicate Coverage as defined in this Contract . Who is deceased prior to the month of enrollment. Premium payments shall be recouped effective the first day of the month following the Enrollee's date of death. Who retroactively has their enrollment terminated consistent with this Contract. Who has been found ineligible for enrollment with the Contractor, provided HCA has notified the Contractor before the first day of the month for which the premium was paid. Who is an inmate at a correctional facility in any full month of enrollment. Who is residing in an Institute for Mental Disease (IMD) for sixty (60) or more consecutive calendar days , and whose primary admission is not SUD. When an audit or review determines that payment or enrollment was Washington State Page 100 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 made in error. When HCA recoups premium payments and retroactively terminates enrollment for an individual Enrollee, the Contractor's submitted encounter record(s) for the terminated Enrollee for the affected member month(s) are no longer valid. When this occurs, the Contractor: Shall void the invalid encounters; May recoup payments made to providers. If the Contractor recoups said payments : The Contractor must issue proper notice to the provider indicating the reason for the recoupment . T he Contractor's issuance of the notice must be in a timely manner to ensure the provider has the ability to bill the recouped claim(s) to another payer or government entity, if appropriate. The Contractor's providers may submit appropriate claims for payment to HCA through its FFS program, with the Contractor's notice of recoupment, if the Enrollee was eligible for covered services. Retroactive recoupments are determined on an individual Enrollee basis, and not on a family basis. Recouping premiums for one family member does not necessarily mean there will be recoupments taken for other family members . Delivery Case Rate Payment A one- time payment shall be made to the Contractor for labor and delivery expenses for AH Family , SCHIP and AHAC Enrollee s enrolled with the Contractor during the month of delivery. The Delivery Case Ra te shall only be paid to the Contractor if the Contractor has incurred and paid direct costs for labor and delivery based on encounter data received and accepted by H CA. AHBD, DDA and COPES Enrollees are not eligible for these payments. Delivery includes both live and stillbirths, but does not include miscarriage, induced abortion, or other fetal demise not requiring labor and deliv ery to terminate the pregnancy. HCA shall not pay the Delivery Case Rate payment for Enrollees who have comparable Third Party Insurance coverage. High -Cost Infant Risk Pool (HIRP) High-cost infant hospital claims for AH Family Child Enrollees will be included in a High -Cost Infant Risk Pool (HIRP) effective January 1, 2020. HIRP Funding Development. Base experience data used in the development of the monthly managed care capitation rates for the AH - IMC program will include HIRP cases. HIRP Washington State Page 101 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 experience will remain in the monthly capitation rate benefit cost and paid to Contractor. Total funding included in HIRP will be based on a per - member per -month (PMPM) amount, developed as a subset of the monthly capitation rates for AH Family Child infants under age 1, multiplied by infant member months within these rate cells. The HIRP will be developed and distri buted on a statewide basis, however the PMPM will vary by region based on historical experience. Using the identification criteria outlined below, a PMPM amount for qualifying high- cost infant cases will be developed as part of the annual capitation rate development analysis. For the HIRP, the PMPM amount will use the same base period experience data as was used for rate development with adjustments applied to project for the contract year . HIRP Experience Identification. Qualifying infant hospital costs w ill be identified based on the following criteria. Infants must be enrolled in the Integrated Managed Care Medicaid program in the AH Family Child eligibility category effective the date of birth or in the month within which the hospital admission occurred in order for hospital claims to be considered in the HIRP distribution. Infants who incur hospital claims but do not become enrolled in AH Family Child Integrated Managed Care under the terms of this Contract will not qualify for inclusion in HIRP, even if their claims are covered by Medicaid. Infant hospital claims must be tied to an enrolled infant Client ID meeting the covered population criteria and must be accepted as a complete encounter into HCA's ProviderOne, meeting the treatment identification rules below. Professional or ancillary claims, defined as any service billed separately from the inpatient stay, will be excluded from the HIRP or settlement calculation. For experience periods beginning January 1, 2022, the HIRP methodology, including technical specifications for identifying qualifying encounters, will be included in a HIRP policy memorandum from HCA's designated actuary. The criteria used for developing the projected HIRP PMPM and the actual HIRP experience to calculate the settlement will be applied consistently to each data period. HIRP Settlement. Distribution of the HIRP funding will be calculated concurrent with the annual Risk Corridor calculation, in the final quarter of the calendar year following the Contract year, with data submitt ed and into ProviderOne by June 30 of the calculation year. Actuarial adjustments to encounter experience may be made to account for incurred but not reported (IBNR) based on generally accepted Washington State Page 102 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 actuarial practices and principles. Additional adjustment may be included at the discretion of HCA and its designated actuary for encounter data submitted into but rejected by ProviderOne. The funding within the HIRP will be distributed to each AH-IMC contracted MCO based upon a percentage of the pool attributed to each MCO that will be determined by repricing all eligible encounters to HCA's FFS reimbursement rates. Using the repriced claims data, the percentage of the HIRP attributed to each MCO will be the total repriced claim cost for each MCO as a percentage of the total repriced claims across all MCOs during the year. These percentages will be applied to the total HIRP amount, as described in the HIRP Development Section, above. WISe payment A separate monthly case rate payment will be made through ProviderOne for Enrollees in the WISe program as defined in this Contract and further described in Subsection 17.1 of this Contract . A single monthly case rate payment will be paid to the Contractor only for months with qualifying encounters that meet the criteria as outlined in the Encounter Data Reporting Guide. New Journeys A separate case rate payment will be made monthly through Provider One for Enrollees in the New Jou rneys program , which includes certain mental health Outpatient services under the rehabilitation services section of the State Plan. The actual services delivered to New Journeys client(s) will vary depending upon their individual needs and treatment plan. The case rate paid to the Contractor will vary depending on the length of the enrollment in the program . A single monthly case rate payment will be paid to the Contractor only for months with qualifying encounters that meet the criteria as outlined in the Encounter Data Reporting Guide. Targeted Service Enhancements The per -member , per-month premium amounts established by HCA will include additional funding for targeted services for the Hospital Safety Net (Safety Net). The Provider Access Payment (PAP) and the Outpatient Directed Payment (ODP) are directed payment s. PAP Program and ODP Program - State Directed Payment methodology . The PAP and ODP program s were developed to provide additional funding to critical professional and outpatient providers , respectively . HCA will base the proposed minimum fee schedule payments on the Average Commercial Rate (ACR), with appropriate trending factors . On a quarterly basis, HCA will do a retros pective review of the providers ' accepted professional and outpatient encounter data to compare managed care payments versus the ACR at the service line level. Washington State Page 103 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 HCA will aggregate, by provider, the total difference between the managed care payment and the ACR. HCA will pay the Contractor the total amount of the total difference for the PAP and ODP eligible providers. On a quarterly basis, the Contractor shall pay the participating providers the specific directed payment amounts as provided by HCA based on the provider 's individual utilization , within thirty (30) calendar days of the Contractor's receipt of the enhancement payment from HCA . On a yearly basi s, PAP and ODP payments for the calendar year will be reconciled with mature encounter data to ensure participating providers PAP and ODP payments do not exceed the respective programs allowable amounts. HCA will calculate and provide to the Contractor , the specific directed payment amounts to be provided to the PAP and ODP participating providers. On a yearly basis, the Contractor will pay the participating providers, the yearly reconciliation- specific di rected payment amounts per provider as provided by HCA , within thirty (30) calendar days of the Contractor's receipt of the enhancement payment from HCA . Hospital Safety Net (Safety Net) The Safety Net is an assessment on certain Washington hospitals, which will be used to augment funding from all other sources and thereby support additional payment to hospitals for Medicaid services specified in chapter 74.60 RCW. Managed care capitation payments for each fiscal year shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with federal contracting requirements to the Contractor by an amount at least equal to the amount available from the fund after deducting disbursements authorized by RCW 74.60.020(4)(c) through (f) and payments required by RCW 74.60.080 through 74.60.120. These Safety Net payments are a per-member -per-month add on to the monthly capitation payment paid by HCA. If the federal government determines that total payments to the Contractor exceeds what is permitted under applicable Medicaid laws and regulations, payments must be reduced to levels that meet such requirements. In the event that the Contractor is legally obligated to Washington State Page 104 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 repay amounts distributed to hospitals to the state or federal government, the Contractor may recoup the amount it is obligated to repay under the Medicaid program from individual hospitals by not more than the amount of O verpayment each hospital received from the Contractor. Payments to the MCOs shall be determined by HCA based on each organization's enrollment relative to the anticipated total enrollment in each program for the fiscal year in question, the anticipated utilization of hospital service s by an organizations Medicaid Enrollees, and such other factors as are reasonable and appropriate. These payments are a per-member -per-month add on to the monthly capitation payment paid by HCA. HCA will calculate the per member premium based on the estimated funding to be collected and the estimated member month premiums to be paid over the contracted period. Safety Net payments, under RCW 74.60.130, do not reduce the amounts that otherwise would be paid to the Contractor , provided that such payments are consistent with actuarial soundness certification and enrollment. On a monthly basis, for each MCO, HCA will calculate, and communicate, the Safety Net amounts to be paid, aggregated by participating provider. Before making payments, HCA requires Medicaid MCOs to comply with the following requirements: All payments to MCOs must be expended for hospital services provided by Washington hospitals, which includes psychiatric and rehabilitation hospitals, in a manner consistent with the purposes and provisions of chapter 74.60 RCW , and must be equal to all increased capitation payments under chapter 74.60.130 RCW received by the MCO, consistent with actuarial certification and enrollment, less an allowance for any estimated premium taxes the organization is required to pay under Title 48 RCW associated with the payments under RCW 74.60. MCOs shall expend the increased capitation payments in a manner consistent with the purposes of chapter 74.60 RCW , with the expenditures by the MCOs to be made before the end of the quarter in which the funds are received from HCA. No hospital or MCO may use the payments under RCW 74.60.130 to gain advantage in negotiations. No hospital has a claim or cause of action against a managed care organization for monetary compensation based on the amount of Washington State Page 105 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 payments under RCW 74.60.130(5). If funds cannot be used to pay for services in accordance with chapter 74.60 RCW , the MCOs must return the funds to HCA which shall return them to the Safety Net assessment fund.

Readmission deemed not medically necessary shall not be reimbursed. The Contractor shall conduct post-pay review of inpatient admissions that occur within fourteen (14) calendar days of a prior inpatient admission to determine if that readmission was potentially Washington State Page 115 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 preventable. The readmission must be clinically related to the prior admission and avoidable. The Contractor shall consider a readmission to be avoidable if there is a reasonable expectation it could have been prevented by the provider through one or more of the following actions: Providing quality care in the prior admission. A specific quality concern, identified and documented during the first admission which then resulted in the readmission, must be identified; Completing adequate discharge planning with the prior admission; Implementing adequate post -discharge follow- up of the prior admission; or Coordinating between inpatient and outpatient health care teams to provide required care post discharge of the prior admission. The Contractor shall not classify a readmission as avoidable or within the provider's ability to affect, if the readmission is: At a Critical Access Hospital (CAH); Unrelated to conditions or care from the prior admission; A planned readmission or necessary for repetitive treatments such as cancer chemotherapy, transfusions for chronic anemia, burn therapy, dialysis , or other planned inpatient treatment documented in the record or as indicted using patient discharge status \"81\" -planned readmission; A planned therapeutic or procedural admissions following diagnostic admissions, when the therapeutic treatment clinically could not occur during the same case; A same -day planned admission to a different hospital unit for continuing care (can include mental health/ SUD transfers, rehab transfers, etc. which may be technically coded as discharge/admission for billing reasons); An admission for required treatments for cancer including treatment -related toxicities, or care for advanced- stage cancer; End of life and hospice care; Obstetrical readmissions for birth after an antepartum admission; Washington State Page 116 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 Admissions with a primary diagnosis of mental health or SUD issue; Neonatal readmissions; Transplant readmissions within 180 days of transplant; Readmissions when the index admission occurred in a different hospital system; To complete care for an Enrollee who left Against Medical Advice from a prior admission; Due to Enrollee non-adherence despite appropriate discharge planning and supports. This also includes cases where the recommended discharge plan was refused by the Enrollee, and a less appropriate alternative plan was made to accommodate Enrollee preferences; this must be cl early documented in the record; or Because the Contractor did not fulfill its responsibility for post discharge services that would have prevented the readmission. The Contractor shall work with its providers to assure they understand their role and take the following actions to prevent the occurrence of a readmission within fourteen (14) calendar days of a prior admission: Create a discharge summary including summary of diagnoses, care provided, medication list, and follow up plan; Determine the Enrollee's needs to support a safe discharge and write orders accordingly; Ensure the discharge summary is sent to the PCP or follow- up provider; Provide all required prescriptions and educat e the Enrollee about appropriate use of the medication(s); Provide written discharge instructions, accompanied by an explanation, to the Client and family/guardian; Provide appropriate contact telephone numbers to Enrollee or family/guardian to call for discharge related questions ; and Document clearly in a readable format the content of discussion with the Contractor (call, fax, etc.). The Contractor shall share responsibility with its providers to successfully manage the discharge to prevent a readmission. The Contractor shall coordinate with the provider to remove any barriers the provider may face in implementing the discharge plan and the elements of care.

If a readmission occurs because of the Contractor's failure to fulfill its responsibilities, or a component of its shared responsibilities, the Contractor shall not deny payment for the readmission. The Contracto r shall use the template letters created with HCA to support this program. The Contractor must provide a first and second level re-review to the hospital or physician if the Contractor has deemed the provider failed to provide the level of care described above and was responsible for the readmission. After exhausting the Contractor's first and second level re -review process, the hospital may request HCA to conduct a review if a dispute between the Contractor and the provider still exists about payment and assignment of responsibility. The Contractor shall appeal to HCA for a \"Potentially Preventable\" case review when the Contractor and the hospital or attending physician are unable to agree on assignation of responsibility for the readmission and the provider continues to dispute the Contractor's determination. Washington State Page 118 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 The Contractor and the hospital or attending physician will each present a written summary of their position and supporting clinical documentation to HCA.

The Contractor shall submit a quarterly report, due thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter (January, April, July, and October) and a comprehensive annual report for the previous year, by January 31 of each year. The report must include: Total number of patients readmitted to any hospital within fourteen (14) days of discharge from a prior hospitalization (regardless of preventability); Number of readmissions reviewed by the Contractor for Readmission hospital; in subsection 5.21.3.11.3 above: Recouped amount; Hospital; Primary and secondary diagnosis of admission; and Rationale for denial (brief narrative description of what criteria were used to determine that the readmission was preventable and how the case met these criteria). Number of cases contested by hospitals, how these were handled, and outcome of dispute; and Estimated Contractor staffing time for PPPR process. Treatment of Inpatient Hospital Claims for Certified Public Expenditure (CPE) Hospitals. Because HCA can leverage additional federal funds for FFS inpatient claims at CPE facilities, these expenditures were carved out of the premium payments for the blind and disabled populations Washington State Page 119 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 moved from FFS to Apple Health Managed Care beginning July 1, 2012. HCA will separately identify the Enrollees subject to the carve- out. If an Enrollee's eligibility category changes to AHBD while he or she is an inpatient at a CPE hospital: The Contractor is responsible for the claim when the AHBD eligibility does not cover the entire hospitalization. HCA is responsible for the inpatient claim when the Enrollee's AHBD eligibility covers the entire hospitalization. While premiums are net of CPE inpatient hospital claims, the Contractor does remain at risk for these FFS claims if they exceed expectations. CPE inpatient hospital expenditure benchmarks will be computed on a per-member -per month (PMPM) basis, and will vary by category, age, gender and region. After the end of each calendar year, HCA will compute aggregate CPE hospital FFS expenditures attributable to the Contractor, based upon actual enrollment. Actual CPE hospital expenditures for all Contractor enrolled member months will be compared to the Contractor specific benchmarks that take into account changes in utilization and risk. If actual expenditures exceed the established benchmarks, the Contr actor will reimburse HCA for the amount of the excess. HCA will not make payments to any MCO if expenditures are below benchmark amounts. The following is a list of CPE Hospitals: University of Washington Medical Center ; Harborview Medical Center ; Cascade Valley Hospital ; Evergreen Hospital and Medical Center; Olympic Medical Center ; Samaritan Hospital - Moses Lake ; Skagit County Hospital District #2 - Island ; Skagit Valley Hospital ; Valley General Hospital - Monroe; and Valley Medical Center - Renton.

HCA will consider the Contractor 's failure in this regard as default. Contractor will be in default, and HCA may impose reasonable sanctions. Sanctions are distinct from liquidated damages and are not mutually exclusive. Sanctions are intended as a penalty for a default, whereas liquida ted damages are intended as a remedy for noncompliance.

Payment to FQHCs/RHCs Each FQHC and RHC is entitled to its full cost- based encounter rate for each qualifying encounter as outlined in the Medicaid State Plan and in accordance with Section 1902(bb) of the Social Security Act (42 U .S.C. \u00a7 1396a(bb)). The full encounter rate shall be at least equal to the Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate specific to each FQHC and RHC and applies to clinics reimbursed under either the APM or the PPS rate methodology. At no time will the Contractor be at risk for or have any claim to FQHC/RHC enhancements or the T1015 differential portions of RHC Service Based Enhancement (SBE) payments. HCA will publish encounter and enhancement rates for each FQHC/RHC at least quarterly. The rate files will be published cording to the following schedule: January 1, April 1, Washington State Page 125 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 July 1, and October 1. Any rate changes that occur during the quart er will be included in the next publication and will specify the rate effective date HCA will pay the Contractor a lump sum monthly amount intended to provide funding to supplement the Contractor's payment to each of its contracted FQHC, and those RHCs not receiving their full encounter rate through MCOs. The lump sum monthly amount paid to the Contractor ensure s that each FQHC/RHC receives its entire, specific encounter rate for each qualifying encounter. This monthly amount paid to the Contractor in a lump sum and subsequently disbursed to each FQHC/RHC as directed by HCA is called an enhancement payment. The lump sum payment to the Contractor for its contracted FQHC/RHCs will continue to be based on the prior month's client assignments. The total amount of the enhancement payment to be made to each Contractor will be based on the Contractor's correct and timely reporting and submission of client assignment roster files to HCA on a monthl y basis. For purposes of this Section, the \"client assignment roster file\" is the electronic file submitted monthly to MC- Track by the Contractor to HCA . The client assignment roster file is intended to identify the FQHC/RHC to which a Managed Care Enrollee has been assigned by the Contractor. This file is specific to client assignment and the resulting per-client enhancement payment only, and is a separate and distinct process from encounter claim submission. It is this per-client enhancement payment that is aggregated by FQHC/RHC and paid to the Contractor for disbursement to the individual FQHC/RHC. The amount due to each FQHC/RHC will be provided to the Contractor by HCA. The Contractor shall submit its Enrollee assignment roster files for the current month of enrollments, and any retroactive enrollments and/or disenrollments, to HCA no later than the 10th of the month for the current month . HCA will pay to the Contractor a lump sum enhancement payment in the following month. Rejected rosters resulting in errors from the Enrollee assignment roster files will be sent by HCA to the Contractor by the 15th of the month in which the roster was submitted. Corrections will be submitted by the Contractor to MC -Track no later than the 20th of the same month. Any Enrollee assignment roster file data received after the 20th of the month will be included in the next payment cycle for HCA's payment to the Contractor. Using correctly submitted client assignment roster files and corrected error files , HCA will base the total enhancement payment due to the Contractor on the number of successfully loaded client records multiplied by the specific enhancement rate of each contracted FQHC/RHC. Thus, payment due to each Contractor will be the aggregated amount of all Washington State Page 126 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 enhancement payments for each contracted FQHC/RHC. For the previous calendar year, t he Contractor shall submi t a final roster submission, including any retroactive adjustments, by June 10 of the current year. This file shall not include rosters which have been successfully submitted by the Contractor and accepted by HCA in previously submitted client assignment roster files. HCA will provide the Contractor with the monthly enhancement payment funds separately from the monthly premium payments. These supplemental payments will include the load for the 2 percent premium tax as shown on Exhibit A , Rates, AHFQHC and A -AHRHC of this contract. The premium tax is retained by the Contractor and is not paid to the FQHC/RHC. The enhancement payments will be calculated separately and apart from the risk -based capitation payments made to the Contractor by HCA and at no time will the Contractor be at risk for or have any claim to the enhancement payments. To ensure that each FQHC/RHC receives its entire encounter rate for each qualifying encounter, the Contractor shall pay each contracted FQHC/RHC in one of the following ways : The Contractor shall pay the specific monthly enhancement payment amount provided by HCA to the FQHC/RHC, in addition to payment of claims for services made at standard rates and/or capitations to the FQHC/RHC by the Contractor. The Contractor shall ensure the entire amount of the enhancement payment is paid to each FQHC/RHC as prescribed by HCA within thirty (30) calendar days of the Contractor's receipt of the enhancement payment from HCA .

For all RHCs receiving their encounter rate through MCOs, the Contractor must ensure the full RHC encounter rate is paid for all encounter -eligible services as defined in HCA's \"Rural Health Clinic Billing Guide.\" RHC billing NPIs and encounter rates are published at least quarterly in the \"Rural Health Clinic Rate Sheet\", will notify the Contractor of adjustments to the RHC encounter rates. The Contractor must reimburse the RHC(s) at the adjusted encounter rate, retroactive to the new rate effective date, within thirty (30) calendar days of Washington State Page 127 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 HCA's notification.

This SBE payment will be generated through ProviderOne after the Contractor submits claims for eligible encounters. To generate SBE payments, the Contractor shall require that all RHC encounter eligible claims be billed with the RHC billing taxonomy (261QR1300X), as outlined in the RHC Billing Guide. The Contractor shall make changes or corrections to any systems or processes, as needed, to comply with HCA 's guidelines for billing RHC encounter claims.

HCA may require modifications to payment arrangements between the Contractor and RHCs if they are found to be out of compliance with state or federal statutes or rules. For all RHCs receiving their full encounter rate through MCOs, HCA will perform an annual claim review with the Contractor. Annual claim reviews will ensure that each participating RHC received its full encounter rate for each qualifying claim and that MCOs are not put at risk for, or have any right to, the T1015 SBE portion of the claim. HCA will notify the Contractor of any discrepancies found in the annual claim review. Claims included in the RHC annual claim review between the Contractor and HCA will include: An eligible RHC encounter service as outlined in the A certified RHC Billing NPI (participating NPIs will be shared by HCA with MCOs at least annually).

Washington State Page 350 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 18 Third Party Liability Definitions. For the purposes of this Section: \"Coor dination of Benefits Agreement\" or \"COBA\" means the national model contract which standardized the way the eligibility and Medicare Claims payment information within a claims crossover context is exchanged to all ow plans that provide health or prescription coverage for a person with Medicare to determine their respective payment responsibilities when an individual is covered by more than one plan. \"Cost Avoidance\" means a method used by HCA to avoid payment when other primary insurance resources are available to the Enrollee. When claims are submitted on behalf of Enrollees who have other primary insurance on file, payment will be denied and claims returned to the providers, who are then required to bill and collect payment from any liable third parties. (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.139(b)). \"Cost Re covery\" (also known as \"pay and chase\") means that the payer pays providers for submitted claims and then attempts to recover payments from liable third parties. Payers pay and chase claims for two primary reasons: post - payment identification of primary t hird party resources and Social Security Act exceptions to cost avoidance that require States to pay and chase claims instead of using cost avoidance. This is required when(1) the service is preventive pediatric care, (2) the service is covered under EPSDT, or (3) coverage is through a parent whose obligation to pay support is enforced by the states' child enforcement agency. (Social Security Act \u00a7\u00a7 1902(a)(25)(E) and (F), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \"Post Payme nt Recovery\" means seeking reimbursement from third parties whenever claims have been paid for which there is Third Party Liability (TPL). \"Cost Recovery\", \"Post Payment Recovery\" may \"pay and chase\". \"Third Party Liability\" means the legal obligation of third parties (e.g., certain individuals, entities, insurers, or programs) to pay part or all of the expenditures for medical assistance furnished under a Medicaid State Plan. General Provisions HCA authorizes the Contractor to obtain TPL reimbursement by any lawful means in accord with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.139, and to coordinate benefits for Enrollees. The Contractor shall take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services available under the Medicaid State Plan. The Contractor shall assume full assignment rights as applicable and shall be responsible for making every reasonable effort to determine the liability of third parties to pay for servic es provided to Enrollees under this Contract. The Contractor also shall be responsible for identifying existing TPL resources, undertaking cost avoidance, and recovering any liability from the third party. The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and procedures to meet its obligations regarding TPL including but not limited to: Implementation of Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA) with CMS and the Federal Benefits Coordination and Recovery Center (BCRC) by July 1, 2018 to allow for automate d crossover claims Washington State Page 351 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 processing for dual-eligible clients. For Enrollees who have primary health insurance, the Contractor shall coordinate benefits in accordance with the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25) and other applicable law. RCW 41.05A.005. Coordination of Benefits includes paying any applicable cost -sharing on behalf of an Enrollee, up to the Medicaid allowed amount. Nothing in this Section negates any of the Contractor's responsibilities under this Contract, including, but not limited to, the requirement desc ribed in the Prohibition on Enrollee Charges for Contracted Services provisions of the Enrollee Rights and Protections section of this Contract. The Contractor shall: Identify third party resources consistent with the Contractor's policies and procedures; Not refuse or reduce services provided under this Contract solely due to the existence of similar benefits provided under any other health care contracts; Attempt to recover any third-party resources available to Enrollees (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433 Subpart D) and shall make all records pertaining to coordination of benefits collections for Enrollees available for audit and review under Subsection 12.10 of this Contract; Pay preventive pediatric care, and services covered under EPSDT, including Applied Behavior Analy sis treatment services and medically intensive children's program services, and then seek reimbursement from third parties (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.139(b)(3)); Pay claims for contracted services when probable third party liability has not been established or the third party benefits are not available to pay a claim at the time it is filed (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.139(c)); Coordinate with out-of-network providers with respect to payment to ensure the cost to Enrollees is no greater than it would be if the services were furnished within the network; Communicate the requirements of this Section to subcontractors that provide services under the terms of this Contract, and assure compliance with them; Deny claims the primary payer denied because the provider or the Enrollee did not follow the payer's payment or adjudication rules; (e.g., claims submission without required prior authorization or untimely claims filing); and Make its own independent decisions about approving claims for payment that have been denied by the primary payer if either (a) the primary payer does not cover the service and the Contractor does, or (b) the service was denied as not medically necessary and the provider followed the dispute resolution and/or appeal process of the primary carrier and the denial was upheld. Washington State Page 352 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 If the Contractor's allowed amount for a service exceeds the primary insurer's paid amount, the Contractor shall pay the subcontractor or provider only the amount, if any, by which the subcontractor's or provider's allowable claim exceeds the amount paid by the primary insurer. The Contractor shall have policies and procedures in place to investigate potential TPL resources related to trauma or accident and pursue recoveries. Provider Agreements All provider agreements executed by the Contractor and all provider agreements executed by subcontracting entities or organizations shall define the provider's responsibilities regarding TPL, including the provider's obligation to identify TPL coverage and, except as otherwise provided in this Con tract, to seek such third party payment before submitting claims to the Contractor. Cost Avoidance The Contractor shall ensure coverage by all potential third- party payers is exhausted before the Contractor makes a payment for covered services, by directin g subcontracted providers to submit a claim and receive final determination from the identified Third Party payer before billing the Contractor for services. The Contractor shall use a Cost Avoidance procedure for all claims or services subject to third- party payment to the extent permitted by state and federal law. If the Contractor has established the probable existence of TPL at the time the provider submits a claim, the Contractor shall deny the claim and provide information about the Third Party payer to the billing provider. The Contractor shall not require an EOB from a provider when an Enrollee has Medicare primary coverage and the service being billed is known to not be covered by Medicare. In these situations, the Contractor will become primary payer and disregard the Medicare coverage. The Contractor shall not require an EOB from provider types that are unable to enroll as a Medicare provider when the Enrollee has primary Medicare coverage. In these situations, the Contractor shall pay claims from these provider types as primary payer and disregard the Medicare coverage. Post -Payment Recoveries The Contractor shall recover funds post payment in cases where the Contractor was not aware of third -party coverage at the time services were rendered or paid for, or the Contractor was not able to use a Cost Avoidance procedure. The Contractor shall identify and pursue all potential TPL payments. Potentially liable third party coverage sources include, but are not limited to: Third party liability insurance (for example, group health plans including medical, pharmacy); Self-insured plans; Managed care organizations; Pharmacy benefit managers; Union and other fraternal organizations; and Washington State Page 353 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 Certain other state or federal programs. Cost Benefit. (1) The Contractor's Post Payment Recovery processes shall not require the Contractor to spend more on an individual claim basis than the threshold limits established by the Medicaid State Plan. (2) The Contractor shall use Cost Avoidance procedures to avoid payment on any claim where TPL i s on file, other than those in S ubsection 18.10 below. Contractor must attempt to recover any third party resources available to Enrollees (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433 Subpart D) and will make all records pertaining to coordination of benefits collections for Enrollees available for audit and review under subsection 12.10 of this Contract. Contractor must pay and chase if the claim is for a service provided to an Enrollee on whose behalf child support enforcement is being carried out if, 1) the third party coverage is through an absent parent; and 2) the Provider certifies that, if the Provider has billed a third party the provider has waited one hundred (100) calendar days from the date of billing without receiving payment before billing Medicaid (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.139(b)(3)(ii). Retention of Recoveries. The Contractor is entitled to retain any amounts recovered through its efforts. Distributions of recoveries will be made to the Contractor, in an amount equal to the Contractor's expenditures for the individual on whose behalf the collection was based, and to the beneficiary, any remaining amount. Unsuccessful Effort. If the Contractor is unsuccessful in its efforts to obtain necessary cooperation from an Enrollee to identif y potential third -party resources after a period of sixty (60) calendar days of such efforts, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 433.145 and 433.147, the Contractor must inform HCA in a format to be determined by HCA that its efforts have been unsuccessful. Data HCA shall include information about known TPL resources on the daily 834 enrollment files. Any new TPL resources learned of by HCA through its contractor(s) are added to the next available enrollment file. The Contractor shall: Proactively identify those Enro llees with other primary health insurance including their enrollment and disenrollment dates, and provide this information to HCA on the Enrollees with Othe r Health Insurance (OHI) report; Cooperate with HCA in any manner necessary to ensure collection of this information; Include all third party payments by Enrollee in its regular encounter data submissions ; and Provide TPL data to any contracted provider having a claim denied by the Contractor based on the third party coverage. Washington State Page 354 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 Reports The Contractor shall submit a quarterly Recovery and Cost Avoidance Report that includes any recoveries for third party resources as well as claims that the Contractor denies due to TPL coverage.

This report shall be submitted on the template provided in MC -Track . HCA will continue to terminate enrollment for clients who become eligible for Medicare. Compliance HCA may determine whether the Contractor is in compliance with the requirements in this Section by inspecting source documents for: Appropriateness of recovery attempt; Timeliness of billing; Accounting for third party payments; Settlement of claims; and Other monitoring deemed necessary by HCA. The Contractor shall demonstrate, upon request, to HCA that reasonable efforts have been made to seek, collect and/or report third party recoveries. HCA shall have the sole responsibility for determining whether reasonable efforts have been demonstrated. In making its determination, HCA shall (a) take into account reasonable industry standards and practices and (b) have the right to inspect the Contractor's books and records in accordance with S ubsection 12.10. Subrogation of Rights and Third Party Liability For the purposes of this subsection: \"Injured person\" means an Enrollee who sustai ns bodily injury. Washington State Page 355 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 \"Contractor's health care expense\" means the expense incurred by the Contractor for the care or treatment of the injury sustained, computed in accord with the Contractor's FFS schedule. If an Enrollee requires health care services from the Contractor as a result of an alleged act or omission by a third- party giving rise to a claim of legal liability against the third- party, the Contractor shall have the right to obtain recovery of its cost of providing benefits to the injured person from t he third- party. HCA specifically assigns to the Contractor HCA's rights to such third party payments for health care provided to an Enrollee on behalf of HCA, which the Enrollee assigned to HCA as provided in WAC 182- 503-0540. HCA also assigns to the Contr actor its statutory lien under RCW 41.05A.070. The Contractor shall be subrogated to HCA's rights and remedies under RCW 74.09.180(2) and 41.05A.050 through 41.05A.080 with respect to covered services provided to Enrollees on behalf of HCA under chapter 74.09 RCW. The Contractor may obtain a signed agreement from the Enrollee in which the Enrollee agrees to fully cooperate in effecting collection from persons causing the injury. The agreement may provide that if an injured party settles a claim without prot ecting the Contractor's interest, the injured party shall be liable to the Contractor for the full cost of medical services provided by the Contractor. The Contractor shall notify HCA of the name, address, and other identifying information of any Enrollee and the Enrollee's attorney: Who settles a claim without protecting the Contractor's interest in contravention of RCW 41.05A.060; or When a claim has been identified as having potential TPL. Good Cause Exemption from Billing Third Party Insurance The Contr actor must have a policy to allow Enrollees the right to be exempt from billing third party insurance due to good cause. This includes a procedure that allows for the good cause process to apply on an individual claim basis and a means to flag the E nrollee's account so that the need for additional privacy and precaution can be easily seen. \"Good cause\" means that the use of the third-party coverage would violate an Enrollee's confidentiality because the third party: Routinely sends verification of services to the third-party subscriber and that subscriber is someone other than the Enrollee; Requires the Enrollee to use a primary care provider who is likely to report the Enrollee's request for family planning services to the subscriber; The Enrollee has a reasonable belief that cooperating with the Contractor in identifying TPL coverage could result in serious physical or emotional harm to the Enrollee, a child in his or her care, or a child related to him or her; or The Enrollee is incapacitated without the ability to cooperate with the Contractor. Washington State Page 356 of 357 Contract #_______ Health Care Authority Apple Health - Integrated Managed Care 7/1/23 A description of this process, including any steps the Enrollee must take to seek exemption based on good cause, must be included in every notice the Contractor provides to Enrollees regarding Third Party billing or seeking cooperation with such billing. The notices must include that reasons such as fear of domestic violence or other harm are included in good cause.

HCA's designated third -party contractor will validate the Contractor's reported actual Positive Incentives and Negative Incentives to network providers. 2.11. Provider Incentives should be reported in the period in which they apply to the effective contracts in the Contractor's financial statements. Positive Incentives Earned and Negative Incentives Incurred should be reported in the period in which they are paid or accrue in the Contractor's financial statements, using a consistent method of reporting should be consistent to ensure that amounts are no t double -counted from year to year. 2.12. HCA will use the data supplied by the C ontractor to calculate the total Provider Incentives for the Withhold Performance Year as a percent of total Assessed Payments for the Contractor Withhold Performance Year . 2.12.1. If the percent calculated is less than the Provider Incentives Threshold for the Withhold Performance Year in Table 1 , then the percentage calculated under subsection 2.12 of this Exhibit will be recalculated as a percentage of t he Provider Incentives Thre shold for the Withhold Performance Year . The resulting Provider Incentives \"Partial Earn -Back Percentage\" will then be the percentage of the Provider Incentives Portion of the Withhold that the Contractor is eligible to earn back. 2.12.2. The results of the calcul ations are rounded to the nearest hundredth value. If the thousandths place of a decimal is four or less, it is dropped and does not change. If the thousandths place of a decimal is five or higher, the hundredth value increases by one. For example, roundin g 0.857 to the nearest hundredth would give 0.86 , or 86 percent. 2.13. For the Contractor to earn back the Provider Incentive s Portion of the Withhold in full, the total Provider Incentives for the Withhold Performance Year must equal at least Provider Incentives Threshold percent of Assessed Payments made during the Withhold Performance Yea .

HCA' s designated third party contractor shall validate the Contractor 's reporting of the total amounts and categorization of the reported Payments in a Value -Based Payment Arrangement and an Advanced Value -Based Payment Arrangement . 3.10. HCA will use the data supplied by the C ontractor to calculate the total Payments in a Value -Based Payment Arrangement as a percent of total Assessed Payments for the Contractor for the Withhold Performance Year, except that in Withhold Performance Year 2018, HCA calculate d the total Payments in a Value -Based Payment Arrangement for the Evaluation Period as a percent of total Assessed Payments for the Contractor for the Evaluation period . 3.10.1. If for the Withhold Performance Year the percentage calculated under subsection 3.10 of this Exhibit is less than the VBP Payments Threshold for the Withhold Performance Year, then the percentage calculated under sub section 3.10 of this Exhibit will be recalculate d as a percentage of the VBP Payments Threshold for the Withhold Performance Year. The resulting VBP Payments \"Partial Earn -Back Percentage\" will then be the percentage of the VBP Page 9 of 15 IMC Exhibit D -6, Value- Based Purchasing Rev. 11-28-22 Payments Portion of the Withhold that the Contractor is eligible to earn back. 3.10.2. The result s of the calculation made in subsection s 3.10 and 3.10.1 of this Exhibit are rounded to the nearest hundredth value. If the thousandths place of a decimal is four or less, it is dropped and does not change. If the thousandths place of a decimal is five or higher, the hundredth value increases by one. For example, rounding 0.857 to the nearest hundredth would give 0.86 , or 86 percent. 3.11. For the Contractor to earn back the VBP Payments Portion of the Withhold in full, the total Payments in a Value -Based Payment Arrange ment for the Withhold Performance Year must equal at least the VBP Payments Threshold Percent of Assessed Payments made during the Withhold Performance Year . The VBP Payments Threshold for each Withhold Performance Year is set out in Table 1. 3.12. HCA will use the data supplied by the Contractor to calculate the total Payments in an Advanced Value - Based Payment Arrangement as a percent of total Assessed Payments for the Contractor for the Withhold Performance Year. 3.12.1. If for the Withhold Performance Year the pe rcentage calculated under subsection 3.12 of this Exhibit is less than the Advanced VBP Payments Threshold for the Withhold Performance Year, then the percentage calculated under subsection 3.12 of this Exhibit will be recalculated as a percentage of the A dvanced VBP Payments Threshold for the Withhold Performance Year. The resulting Advanced VBP Payments \"Partial Earn -Back Percentage\" will then be the percentage of the Advanced VBP Payments Portion of the Withhold that the Contractor is eligible to earn ba ck. 3.12.2. The results of the calculation made in subsections 3.12 and 3.12.1 of this Exhibit are rounded to the nearest hundredth value. If the thousandths place of a decimal is four or less, it is dropped and does not change. If the thousandths place of a decim al is five or higher, the hundredth value increases by one. For example, rounding 0.857 to the nearest hundredth would give 0.86, or 86 percent. 3.13. For the Contractor to earn back the Advanced VBP Payments Portion of the Withhold in full, the total Payments i n an Advanced Value -Based Payment Arrangement for the Withhold Performance Year must equal at least the Advanced VBP Payments Threshold Percent of Assessed Payments made during the Withhold Performance Year. The Advanced VBP Payments Threshold for each Wit hhold Performance Year is set out in Table 1. 4. Quality Improvement Score Calculation - (\"QIS Portion\" of the Withhold) 4.1. The QIS Portion of the Withhold shall be 75 percent of the total Withhold. The QIS Portion may be earned back in whole or in part by achieving quality improvement and attainment targets on the basis of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ( HEDIS\u00ae ) scores and non -HEDIS scores , and by satisfying the additional requirements set out in this S ection. 4.2. The Contractor shall report HEDIS \u00ae measures in accordance with the Performance Measures subsection of this C ontract. HCA will produce the non -HEDIS scores in accordance with the Performance Measures subsection of this C ontract . Specific measures will be evaluated to determine the share of the QIS P ortion of the Withhold that the Contractor is eligible to earn back and are identified in Table s 5, 6 and 7 . Failure to meet the requirements of this paragraph, or failure to pass the HEDIS audit or performance measure validation may result in loss of the amount withheld . 4.2.1. The share of the QIS Portion of the Withhold is rounded to the nearest hundredth value. If the thousan dths place of a decimal is four or less, it is dropped and does not change. If the Page 10 of 15 IMC Exhibit D -6, Value- Based Purchasing Rev. 11-28-22 thousandths place of a decimal is five or higher, the hundredth value increases by one. For example, rounding 0.857 to the nearest hundredth would give 0.86, or 86 percent. 4.3. If the value for one or more measures is missing or not available, the HCA Chief Medical Officer (CMO), in his or her sole discretion, will determine the values to be used in place of the missing values using publicly available sources. If the value is missing or not available , using publicly available sources , the HCA CMO will either determine an alternative measure or exclude the measure from the calculation. 4.4. The values in Table 5 shall apply for Withhold Performance Year 2020 , the values in Table 6 shall apply for Withhold Performance Year 2021, and the values in Table 7 shall apply for Withhold Performance Year 2022. 4.5. The comparison values used for HEDIS \u00ae performance are NCQA Quality Compass Medicaid HMO Values in the year set out in Table 1 . 4.6. Section 211(50)(a) of Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1109 (2019 session) and Section 211(31)(a) of Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5092 (2021 session) require HCA to annually select performance measures after an analysis by the contracted External Qualit y Improvement Organization (EQRO). After the contracted EQRO evaluates the change in performance for the selected measures, HCA will then return the Withhold according to the Contractor's performance when compared to the top national Medicaid quartile ; or if it is determined by the EQRO that the change represents a statistically significant improvement . The performance measures identified in Table s 5, 6, and 7 were selected by HCA for the Contractor's Withhold Performance Year after EQRO analysis and recomm endation. Performance measures are marked according to legislative direction as Common Measures, which are shared quality measures for all AH -IMC Contractors, and MCO -Specific Measures, chosen for individual Contractors. The QIS evaluation will occur in th e year following the Withhold Performance Year according to legislation as set out in this Section . 4.7. The QIS rewards performance for Quality Measures for which the Contractor in the Withhold Performance Year achieves top national Medicaid quartile from the Benchmark Comparison Performance Year , or demonstrates statically significant improvement relative to the Improvement Baseline Performance Year as listed in Table 1 . 4.7.1. The QIS = equals the number of measures with either performance in the top quart ile or statistically significant improvement , divided by the total number of measures . Measure s with sub measures will incorporate sub -measure performance according to the measure weights in Table s 5, 6, and 7. 4.7.2.

The Evaluating Entity (EQRO) will determine annually if the following criteria are met for each measure. If either are met, the Contractor is allowed the proportion of the W ithhold for that measure. 4.8.2. The EQRO will determine if each of the HEDIS scores is equal to or above the 75th national Page 14 of 15 IMC Exhibit D -6, Value- Based Purchasing Rev. 11-28-22 Medicaid percentile benchmark for the year designated in Table 1. The EQRO will determine if each of the RD A behavioral health statewide measures is equal to or above the HCA - determined benchmark for the year designated in Table 1. 4.8.2.1. For the RDA measures, the HCA -determined benchmark for the Withhold Performance Year is the score of the second -best performing MCO for the Benchmark Comparison Year as designated in Table 1. This establishes the 75th percentile standard for the RDA behavioral health statewide measures. VBP thresholds for RDA measures are established using the quarter four (Q4) data for the Benchmark Comparison Year, at the time of initial release of that data by RDA. 4.8.3. If the above achievement is not met, the Evaluating Entity will compare t he Contractor's performance year score with the C ontractor's prior year score and determine whether statistically significant improvement occurred by assessing whether an improvement occurred over the previous score for each measure . 4.8.4. Note that for those specific measures where a lower score indicates better performance, the current performance score must be below the previous year performance to show statistically significant improvement. 5. Payment 5.1. On or before November 30 of the year following the Withhold Performance Year, HCA will provide the Contractor with a completed Value -Based Purchasing Withhol d Calculation Summary Form provided in Attachment C , signed by the HCA Chief Financial Officer, or his or her designee, outlining the percent withhold recovered through Provider Incentive Portion, The VBP Payments Portion, and the QIS Portion to notify the Contractor in writing of its percentage of Withhold earned back based on the calculations described this Exhibit . 5.2. The Contractor will have 20 calendar days from the date the Contractor is notified of its percentage Withhold earned back to review and sign the Value -Based Purchasing Withhold Calculation Summary Form provided in Attachment C and return to HCA, in writing, any alleged discrepancies with the calculations. 5.3. If the Contractor submits in writing any alleged discrepancies with the calculations, HCA will respond in writing to the Contractor within 10 calendar days following HCA's receipt . 5.4. HCA will schedule payment for the percentage of the Withhold earned back no later than December 31 of the year following the Withhold Performance Year. 6. VBP Data Dashboard 6.1. HCA will create and maintain a VBP performance dashboard on its public website that will include data collected from the Contractor pursuant to Exhibit D, as well as similar data from all other peer Managed Care contractors. The dashboard will present data statewide and for each of the regional service areas and each of the Managed Care contractors. The dashboard will not include proprietary data. For example, HCA anticipates that the dashboard will present (a) the percentage of the Contractor's payments to providers made as positive and negative incentives under a value -based purchasing arrangement as described in Section 2 of this exhibit, (b) the percentage of the Contractor's payments to providers made through value -based purchasing arrangements as descr ibed in Section 3 of this exhibit, and (c) Managed Care Contractors' quality measure performance scores as describe d in Sections 4 of this exhibit.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Executive Summary The Health Care Payment Learning & A ction Network (LAN) was created to drive alignment in payment approaches across the public and private sectors of the U.S. health care system. The CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare (CAMH), the federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) operated by the MITRE Corporation, was asked by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to convene this large national initiative. To advance the goal of aligning payment approaches, the Alternative Payment Model Framework and Progress Tracking Work Group (the \"Work Group\") was charged with creating an alternative payment model (APM) Framework (the \"APM Framework\") that could be used to track progress toward payment reform. Composed of diverse health care stakeholders, the Work Group deliberated and reached consensus on many critical issues related to the classification of APMs, resulting in a rationale and a pathway for payment reform capable of supporting the delivery of person-centered care. The Work Group published the APM Framework White Paper i n January 2016. Subsequently, a multi -stakeholder Advisory Group was convened to update the APM Framework and its principles based on developments that occurred since the original publication. This White Paper reflects that updated APM Framework. Although not part of the Work Group's explicit charge, this White Paper advances a working definition of person-centered care because it treats payment reform as one means to accomplish the larger goal of person-centered care. This working definition rests on three pillars: quality, efficiency, and patient engagement. For the purposes of this White Paper, person -centered care is nominally defined as follows: care in which patients and their care teams form partnerships around high-quality , accessible care , which is both evidence -based and delivered in an efficient manner, and in which patient s' and caregivers' individual preferences, needs, and values are paramount . Transitioning the U.S. health care system away from fee for service (FFS) and toward shared risk and population -based payment is necessary, though not sufficient, to achieve a value -based health care system. Financial incentives to increase the volume of services provided are inherent in FFS payments, Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network To achieve the goal s of better care, smarter spending, and healthier people, the U.S. health care system must substantially reform its payment structure to incentivize quality, health outcomes, and value over volume. Such alignment requires a fundamental change in how health care is organized and delivered, and requires the participation of the entire health care ecosystem. To enable these reforms, the Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network (LAN) was established as a collaborative network of public and private stakehold ers, including health plans, providers, patients, employers, consumers, states, federal agencies, and other partners within the health care community. By making a commitment to changing payment models, by establishing a common framework and align ing approa ches to payment innovation, and by sharing information about successful models and encouraging use of best practices, the LAN can help to reduce barriers and accelerate the adoption of alternative payment models (APMs).

This is not conducive to the delivery of person -centered care because it does not reward high-quality, individualized, and efficient care. By contrast, in many cases, population -based payments (including bundled payments for clinical episodes of ca re) can offer providers the flexibility to strategically invest delivery system resources in areas with the greatest return, to treat patients holistically, and to facilitate care coordination. Shared -risk payments, population -based payments, and other pay ment mechanisms are better suited than FFS payments to support the care delivery that patients value and incentivize the outcomes that matter to them. Therefore, the health care system should transition toward shared -risk and population -based models. In th is context, the updated APM Framework will be useful to establish a common nomenclature and pathway upon which progress can be measured and successful models shared. The updated APM Framework rests on eight principles which can be summarized as follows: 1. Changing providers' financial incentives is not sufficient to achieve person -centered care, so it will be essential to empower patients to be partners in health care transformation. * 2. Reformed payment mechanisms will only be as successful as the delivery sys tem capabilities and innovations they support .* 3. The goal for payment reform is to transition health care payment s from FFS to APMs. While Category 2C APMs can be the payment model for some providers, most national spending should continue moving into Categor ies 3 and 4 .* 4. Value-based incentives should ideally reach care teams who deliver care. 5. Payment models that do not take quality into account are not considered APMs in the APM Framework , and do not count as progress toward payment reform. 6. Value-based inc entives should be intense enough to motivate providers to invest in and adopt new approaches to care delivery , without subjecting providers to financial and clinical risk they cannot manage. * 7. APMs will be classified according to the dominant form of paymen t when using more than one type of payment. 8. Centers of excellence, accountable care organizations, and patient -centered medical homes are examples , rather than Categories, in the APM Framework because they are delivery systems that can be applied to and supported by a variety of payment models. * - indicates revised or new principle With these principles in place, the Work Group began with the payment model classification s cheme originally put forward by CMS, and subsequently reached a consensus on a variety of modifications and refinements. The resulting Framework is subdivided into four Categories and eight subcategories, as illustrated in the figure below ( Figure 1). Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Figure 1: The Updated APM Framework Overview and Introduction to the 2017 APM Framework Refresh A LAN Guiding Committee was established in Ma y 2015 as the collaborative body charged with advancing the alignment of payment approaches across and within the public and private sectors of the U.S. health care system . This alignment will accelerate the adoption and dissemination of meaningful financi al incentives to reward providers that deliver higher -quality and more affordable care. The LAN's mission is to accelerate the health care system's transition to alternative payment models (APMs) by combining the innovation, power, and reach of the public and private sectors . Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 4 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED In July 2015, t he Guiding Committee convened the Alternative Payment Models Framework and Progress Tracking (APM FPT) Work Group and charged it with creating a Framework for categorizing APMs and establishing a s tandardized and national ly accepted method to measure progress in the adoption of APMs across the U.S. health care system (the \"APM Framework\") . The Work Group brought together public and private stakeholders to assess APMs already in use across the nation, and to define terms and concepts essential for understanding, categorizing, and measuring APMs. ( A roster of Work Group members , representing the diverse constituencies convened by the LAN, is provided in Appendix C.)1 Building o n work initially done by CMS, the Work Group sought to create a clear and understandable APM Framework , provide a deeper understanding of payment models and how those models can enhance health and health care , and provide examples of how public and private payment models are organized . Since the original APM Framework White Paper was released in January 2016, it has become the foundation for implementing APMs and evaluating progress toward health care payment reform. Payers, providers, and purchasers have all used the APM Framework to better understand the payment reform landscape and to set goals for participation in APMs, and health care stakeholders have used the APM Framework to identify common goals for transforming the nation's health care system. Overall, the APM Framework's classification system has been adopted by the health care ecosystem. Significant and fast -moving developments have occurred since the original APM Framework White Paper was published. For example, in November 2016, CMS published t he final rule on the Merit -based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and Advanced Alternative Payment Models (Advanced APMs) under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA). The final rule established the criteria for determining which A PMs are considered Advanced APMs under MACRA and thus offer participants an opportunity for a bonus payment. Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) released its annual report to Congress, which cataloged more than one hundred APMs in its portfolio, and it released a flagship, multi- payer primary care payment model (Comprehensive Primary Care Plus, or CPC+). Additionally, t he Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC) has convened and begun recommending APMs for limited scale testing . Moreover, the LAN published 10 White Papers, recommending approaches for implementing population -based, clinical episode, and primary care payment models. The LAN Guiding Committee recognizes the impact of these developments and market forces in aligning the financing and delivery of health care and in continuing the consolidation and integration of providers. As such, the Guiding Committee believed it was important to revisit the original APM Framework to ensure that it rema ins an indispensable tool for payment reform. To achieve this, the Guiding Committee convened a multi -stakeholder Advisory Group to reach key positions on revisions to the original APM Framework White Paper. ( A roster of Advisory Group members , representing the diverse constituencies convened by the LAN, is provided in Appendix B .) 2 Specifically, the Guiding Committee asked the Advisory Group to do the following: 1 Please note that opinions expressed within the White Paper are those of the Work Group Members , not of the organizations with which they are affiliated. 2 Please note that opinions expressed within the White Paper are those of the Advisory Group Members , not of the organizations with which they are affiliated.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Clarify relationships between Advanced APMs under MACRA a nd categories in the LAN APM Framework (see discussion of Category 3 and Appendix A ); Identify opportunities for small, rural , and safety net providers to increase APM adoption (see Principles 3 and 6) ; Consider a new framework category for the growing sector of integrated finance and delivery organizations (see discussion of Category 4); and Identify opportunities to modify the APM F ramework in ways that expedite and simplify the progress -tracking effort (see discussion of Category 2). Overview of Changes to the APM Framework and Its Supporting Principles The Advisory Group's deliberations tackled both foundational principles and APM classification conventions. With respect to foundational principles, the Advisory G roup focused on the importance of viewing payment as a vehicle for driving delivery system transformation, and it closely reviewed key statements in the original White Paper to be sure they did not imply that payment reform was a goal unto itself. These di scussions culminated in a new Principle 2, which articulates that payment reforms are only as successful as the delivery transformations they support. Advisory Group discussions also resulted in changes to the original Principles 2 and 5. First, they clari fied that Category 2 APMs can be an endpoint for certain types of providers in specific markets. They also clarified that the strength of incentives should balance the potential for delivery system transformation against the risk of physicians taking on gr eater financial and insurance risk than they can manage. Figure 3, which illustrates the LAN's national goals for payment reform, has been updated to reflect greater p arity in clinical outcomes and cost management in Category 3 and Category 4 APMs. The Advisory Group believes that these changes address challenges that many small, rural, and safety net providers face when participating in APMs. The Advisory Group also ca refully considered classification conventions used in the original APM Framework. Some of these discussions involved relatively minor modifications that would simplify and improve the LAN's Progress Tracking efforts, such as the decision to consolidate Cat egories 2C and 2D into a single Category 2C for \"Pay -for-Performance.\" Other considerations included the need for additional patient protections in APMs with cost accountability. Accordingly, the Advisory Group decided to make \"appropriate care\" measures a requirement for Categor y 3 and 4 APMs in order to give providers strong incentives to focus on eliminating care that does not help (and may harm) patients. 3 The past several years have witnessed a considerable expansion of integrated finance and delivery systems - i.e., joint ventures between insurance companies and health systems, insurance companies that own provider groups, and provider organizations that o ffer insurance products. Notable examples include not only Kaiser Permanente and Geisinger Health System , but also Vivity (a joint venture between Anthem and seven provider groups), the Allegheny Health Network (a joint venture between Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield and the West Penn sylvania Allegheny Health System ), the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Intermountain Healthcare, and the Henry Ford Health System. Integrated finance and delivery system s are also expanding rapidly in the Medicare Adva ntage (MA) market, where 3 In this context, appropriate care measures cover topics such as unnecessary imaging, preventable hospitalizations, and adherence to clinical guidelines. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 6 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED roughly 60% of new MA plans are provider-sponsored.4 In light of this growth and the potential for these arrangements to better coordinate care, the Advisory Group thought it important to consider a new Category to track payments i n these systems. Upon consulting with organizations that are making investments in these areas, the Advisory Group determined that integrated finance and delivery systems have the potential to help build organizational culture and investment strategies aro und population health management; support investments in key delivery infrastructure, such as care management, and health information technology; advance linkages to community organizations/community health; and promote alignment of value-based financial i ncentives among plans and providers. The Advisory Group therefore created a new Category 4C , which will enable further assessment of the effectiveness of these organizations in increasing the value of care through these more highly integrated arrangements. The APM Framework and MACRA are aligned in the goal of moving payments away from FFS and into APMs that reduce the total cost of care (TCOC) and improve the quality of care. Both MACRA and the APM Framework establish designations for APMs that consider th e extent to which payments are based on value (as opposed to volume). For MACRA, Advanced APMs receive special consideration, and for the APM Framework, Categories 3 and 4 mark the goal for national payment reform. MACRA and the APM Framework also both asp ire to take provider variability into account when making these designations, to ensure they are responsive to the manifold settings in which health care is delivered nationwide. Therefore, comparisons between the two systems for designating level of APM a dvancement, and the identification of potential incongruities, offer an opportunity to properly designate payment arrangements for particular providers that are specially designed to reward high-value care. With one exception, all Advanced APMs under MACRA were classified in Categories 3 and 4 according to the original APM Framework. However, the two designation systems inconsistently classified the flagship CMS CPC+ Track 1 program, which fell into Category 2 in the original APM Framework. The Advisory Gro up therefore considered new conventions for Category 3, which highlighted opportunities for the LAN to adopt more nuanced criteria that better reflect the lessons CMS learned about implementing primary care APMs for the Medicare population. Specifically, C PC+ Track 1 showed that utilization measures can be expected to establish shared-savings arrangements without a formal financial benchmark when smaller primary care providers are unable to bear much financial risk. This type of arrangement may not be appro priate in all settings or market segments, and it will be important to evaluate whether it achieves its intended results for smaller primary care practices. However, the Advisory Group decided that CPC+ Track 1's utility for introducing cost accountability to primary care physicians taking care of the Medicare population warranted its inclusion in Category 3. Although there will be differences in the specific criteria that MACRA and the APM Framework use to categorize APMs, 5 this modification will achieve c omplete alignment between designations made by MACRA and the LAN 4 Avalere.

For instance, MACRA highlights the intensity of risk as a distinguishing factor between APMs and Advanced APMs by quantifying a \"more than nominal\" amount of financial risk. Under the APM Framework, risk differentiates APMs (i.e., between a 3A and 3B classification), but the precise magnitude of risk is not specified. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

Taken together, these changes to the original APM Framework reflect experiences and de velopments that have occurred since the original White Paper was released. The updates will help ensure that the APM Framework remains fundamental for payment and delivery reform. Changes are embedded in this refreshed White Paper in order to maintain a single source for the LAN's perspectives on APM classification and goals for payment reform. The Advisory Group has incorporated public comments that it received, and it thanks all commenters for providing input on this work. The Case for Reforming the Healt h Care Payment System Like many health care stakeholders, t he LAN is committed to driving payment approaches that improve the quality and safety of care, and the overall performance and sustainability of the U.S. health system. Collectively, we believe tha t making a positive impact on patient care and health should be the ultimate goal of payment reform, and we envision a health care system that provides person -centered care. For the purposes of this paper, and recognizing that the term may encompass additi onal characteristics that are not captured below, person-centered care means patients and their care teams form partnerships around high- quality , accessible care , which is both evidence -based and delivered in an efficient manner, and in which patient s' and caregivers' individual preferences, needs, and values are paramount . Person - centered care, so defined, rests upon three pillars: Quality : This term indicates that patients receive appropriate and timely care that is consistent with evidence -based guidelines and patient goals, and that results in optimal patient outcomes and patient experience . Measures of performance and impact should be meaningful, actionable, and transparent to consumers, patients, family caregivers, and other stakeholders. Ideally, quality should be evaluated using a harmonized set of appropriately adjusted process measures , outcome measures , patient -reported outcome meas ures , and patient experience measures that together provide an accurate and comprehensive assessment of clinical and behavioral health. Measure scores should also be meaningfully accessed, understood, and used by patients and consumers. Efficiency: Eliminating waste and delivering a ffordab le, appropriate health care services , are vital for ensuring that the nation can support investments in education, housing, and other social determinants that can independently improve population health . Efficiency indica tes the degree to which services, care delivery models, and payment arrangements achieve the core outcome goals of patients, providers, payers, and purchasers in relation to their costs. Care that is less expensive than expected but that results in poor cl inical outcomes is not considered efficient . Conversely, care that is unavoidably costly but results in dramatic improvements in patient outcomes is considered efficient . For purchasers , efficiency (and, therefore, value) might mean comprehensive care serv ices that support the health and productivity of their workforces . For payers , efficiency might mean adjusting reimbursements to incentivize the delivery of care that achieves outcomes that matter to patients, thereby improving adherence to care plans, dec reasing acute episodes that require emergency room visits or hospitalization, and lowering overall costs by reducing utilization of services that do not achieve desired outcomes. For providers , efficiency might mean aligning payment rates and incentives to reinforce best practices and remove undesirable incentives for low-value care that does little to achieve patients' goals. And lastly, for patients , efficiency is about achieving the outcomes that matter to them in a manner that is affordable and accessible . Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Collaborative Patient Engagement : This term encompasses the important aspects of care that improve patient experience, enhance shared decision making, and ensure that patients and consumers achieve their health goals. Patient engagement should occur at a ll levels of care delivery: with patients and caregivers serving as partners when setting treatment plans and goals at the point of care; when designing and redesigning delivery and payment models; on governance boards and decision making bodies ; and when identifying and establishing connections to social support services. Collaborative engagement involves partnering with patients and consumers so they can be informed of their health status and share in their own care; easily access appointments and clinical opinions; seek care at the appropriate site; possess the information they need to identify high- value providers and to tailor treatment plans to individual health goals; provide ongoing feedback that providers can use to improve patient experi ence; obtain transparent price information from their health plan about services and evidence of their value for patients and consumers based on individualized characteristics and goals ; and move seamlessly among providers that are engaged in different asp ects of their care. Routine communication with family caregivers and other support members is also a critical part of comprehensive, person -cent ered care. As evidenced by the LAN itself, there is an emerging consensus among providers, payers, patients and consumers, purchasers, and other stakeholders that efforts to deliver person -centered care have been stymied, to a large degree, by a payment system that is oriented toward paying for volume, as opposed to value for patients and caregivers. These stakehold ers agree that reconfiguring payments to incentivize value, and ensuring that valuable activities (e.g., care coordination) are compensated appropriately, will better enable providers to invest in care delivery systems that are more focused on patient need s and goals. In other words, changes in payment are necessary (though insufficient on their own) to drive delivery system transformations, which ensure that health care costs reflect appropriate and necessary spending for individuals, government, employers , and other payers. Shifting from traditional FFS payments (i.e., claims -based payments that are not linked to quality or value) to population-based payments (in which all or much of a person's overall care or care for related conditions is encompassed wit hin a single payment), is a particularly promising approach to creating and sustaining delivery systems that value quality, cost effectiveness, and patient engagement. Such payments should therefore include accountability for the quality of care delivered to patients, rather than incentivizing providers to increase the volume of services they provide. Although it is not yet possible to reach a definitive, evidence -based conclusion about the impact of population -based payments on patient care, there is a wid espread belief that these types of payment models hold substantial promise. This is because population -based payments give providers more flexibility to coordinate and optimally manage care for individuals and populations. In combination with substantially reduced incentives to increase volume, and stronger incentives to provide services that are currently undervalued in traditional FFS, there is a consensus that this flexibility will expedite fruitful innovations in care delivery, particularly for individu als with chronic, complex, or costly illnesses. At present, traditional FFS payments are ill suited for initiating investments and sustaining population health management innovations, such as information technology, clinical decision support tools, patient engagement and care coordination functions, and additional opportunities to increase access to care (e.g., payments for telehealth, home visits, group visits, and additional office hours). This is because traditional FFS's price per unit of service system incentivizes providers to produce revenue by increasing Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

Population -based payments may enable providers to develop more innovative approaches to person -centered health care delivery because such payments reward providers that successfully manage all or much of an individual's care. Innovative approaches to health care delivery stand to benefit patients and society alike, with patients coming to expect a more coordinated, more accessible, and more eff ective health care system, and the nation benefiting from reductions in national health care expenditures thanks to a healthier, more productive population. New payment models require providers to make fundamental changes in the way they provide care, and the transition away from FFS may be costly and administratively difficult even though new payment models will be more efficient over the long term. Participation in shared-risk and population -based payment models involves financial risk for providers, and not all provider organizations currently possess the capacity to successfully operate in these payment models. Such providers will need assistance to develop additional capabilities. To smooth and accelerate this transition, a critical mass of public and private payers must adopt aligned approaches and send a clear and consistent message that payers are committed to a person -centered health system that delivers the best health care possible. If providers were able to participate in APMs that were consistent ly deployed across multiple payer networks, the administrative burden of making the transition would be reduced and investments could be applied to all patient populations, independent of payer. Aligned payment approaches and performance metrics from a cri tical mass of payers would enable providers to establish an infrastructure that would increase the likelihood of success for innovative delivery systems over the long term. The adoption and diffusion of these innovative delivery systems should ultimately improve the quality, efficiency, safety, and experience of patient care, while becoming sustainable business models for providers that are eager to take a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to health care delivery. Safeguards will be needed to ensu re that quality and patient engagement are not sacrificed to reduce costs, and that the care delivered is state of the art and takes advantage of valuable advances in science and technology. It will also be important to take into account the time physician s spend on administrative tasks. Physicians already spend as much time doing \"desktop medicine\" as they do interacting face -to-face with patients. 6 Given the weight of the current administrative burden, particularly in primary care, it will be important to design APMs in a way that minimizes the time providers spend on administrative tasks, and restores this to time spent interacting with patients. In order to mitigate the possibility of increased administrative tasks and other unintended consequences, it will be essential to monitor the impact of population -based payment systems on patient outcomes, affordability, and other indicators of significance to patients and other stakeholders in the health care system . This shift to person -centered, population-based payment should properly be viewed as a course -correcting feedback loop between innovation, implementation, and evaluation. However, the LAN firmly believes that a shift to person -centered, population-based payments will, in concert with significant delivery system reforms, result in an acceleration of high -value care in the United States . As discussed in the next section, the APM Framework will provide a valuable tool in accelerating this process. 6 Ming T.S. et al. (2017).

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Purpose of the White Paper To accelerate the transformations described above, the LAN created an APM Framework through which to describe and measure progress toward payment reform. In addition to providing a roadmap to measure progress, the APM Framework helps establish a common nomenclature and a sh ared set of conventions that can facilitate discussions among stakeholders and expedite the generation of an evidence base for evaluating the capabilities and results of APMs. This White Paper begins by describing the approach used to develop the APM Framework, followed by the principles upon which the APM Framework is based. With these principles in mind, the White Paper differentiates categories with in the APM Framework by explaining how they are defined and where their boundaries lie. The White Paper con cludes with a summary of key findings and recommendations, as well as recommendations for how various stakeholders can use the APM Framework to accelerate payment reform. To further clarify the classification of individual APMs, the Work Group has separately released a collection of APMs that are currently in use as of January 2016. Approach When developing the APM Framework , the Work Group began with the payment model classificati on scheme that CMS originally advanced7 and expanded it by introducing r efinements that are described in more detail below . As illustrated in Figure 2, the CMS Framework assigns payments from payers to health care providers to four Categories , such that movement from Category 1 to Category 4 involves increasing provider accountability for both quality and TCOC, with a greater focus on population health management (as opposed to payment for specific services ). 7 Rajkumar R ., Conway P .H., and Tavenner M.

Key Principles for the APM Framework The APM Framework is predicated on several key principles. To provide context for understanding the Framework and recommendations, these principles are delineated and explained below. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 12 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Principle 1: Changing payment to providers is only one way to stimulate and sustain innovative approaches to the delivery of person-centered care. In the future, it will be important to engage patient representatives in aspects of model design, and moni tor progress in initiatives that empower patients to seek care from high-value providers (via performance metrics, financial incentives, and other means) and to encourage patients to become more active participants in shared decision-making. Although it wa s necessary to focus on financial incentives for providers as a critical first step, additional efforts to engage patients and consumers will be needed to achieve a high -value, coordinated health care system. As more providers begin to participate in payment models that are divorced from traditional FFS, all stakeholders will need to collaborate on approaches to empower patients to become active partners as they strive to achieve their health goals. This includes engaging patients in ways that match their n eeds, capacities , and preferences . Such approaches may include strategies to clearly and meaningfully communicate, to patients and consumers, information about provider and health plan performance on clinical and patient experience measures; provide financial rewards for patients and cons umers who select high -value providers and manage chronic disease with interventions that achieve outcomes that matter to patients; and enlist patients and caregivers as partners in setting health goals and developing treatment plans. This includes giving patients direct access to evidence -based tools that allow them to better understand their condition, preferences, and treatment options, as well as the benefits , risks , and out -of-pocket costs for each. Consumers , patients, families , and their advocates should be collaboratively engaged in aspects of design, implementation, and evaluation of payment and care models, and they should be engaged as partners in their own care. As models become more advance d in value-based payment, the corresponding care models s hould more comprehensively reflect the delivery of true person -centered care and meaningful partnership with patients and families. To avoid unintended consequences associated with APMs, it is essential for payment models to include safeguards to prevent selection against individuals with more complex illnesses or greater need for social support, and patients and consumers should be informed of providers' financial incentives in APMs. Additional activities and monitoring will also be needed to ensure th at the expansion of population -based payments does not lead to inequities in health outcomes or to a decline in access to care. APMs should therefore collect data that allows for assessment of differential impacts on, and the identification and redress of, dis parities in health, health outcomes, care experience, access, and affordability. Principle 2: Reformed payment mechanisms will only be as successful as the delivery system capabilities and innovations they support. APMs therefore need to be predicated o n knowledge about how specific payment mechanisms drive new models and improvements in care delivery. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 13 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Payment reform is necessary , but not sufficient on its own, for transforming the current volume-based health care system into a system that rewards provi ders for delivering value -based, person -centered care. This is because the relationship between APMs and the value they are intended to generate is neither deterministic nor universally applicable across provider types and patient populations. For example, payment mechanisms that are appropriate for advanced, highly integrated health systems may have different outcomes in safety -net hospitals or small primary care practices serving rural communities. The characteristics of the patient population can also be an important factor in the success of a given payment model. For example, social determinants and social needs have a much higher impact on some populations, so payments that often effectively address these needs may not work as well in different populati ons. For these and other reasons, it is important to base APM design on the best available evidence and information about how to optimize care delivery, and to identify payment mechanisms that are capable of stimulating infrastructure investments that maxi mize value (i.e., deliver the best possible quality and experience of care within the constraints of available resources) in specific clinical settings. Ultimately, positive impact on patient care and health should be paramount . Because delivery system improvements drive the production of value in the health care system, it is important to identify evidence-based best practices for delivery components that have been demonstrated to improve care. Empirical evidence on the effectiveness of particular delivery components and competencies is still emerging, but several compendiums of best practices and essential components are beginning to be understood. For example, the Peterson Center on Healthcare and Stanford University's Clinical Excellence Research Center identified 10 characteristics of high -value primary care providers, based on their analysis of 11 practices that provide \"exceptionally high -value care.\" Among other activities, these practices increase accessibility through after -hours calls and same - day appointments, provide the most support to patients who need it, refer patients to a selective list of specialists who share their commitment to value, and employ multidisciplinary care teams that work \"at the top of their licenses.\" 8 Similarly, the Accountable Care Learning Collaborative (ACLC) identified competencies that are essential for the success of accountable care organizations (ACOs), based on their review of the evaluation literature. 9 Broken into seven categories (i.e., gov ernance and culture, financial readiness, health IT, patient risk assessment, care coordination, quality, and patient -centeredness), ACLC's proposed list of competencies include: Align quality improvement initiatives with ethical obligations ; Measure share d savings and cost sharing between providers and payers; Present useful and usable decision support at the point of care; Offer access to and integrate with behavioral health services ; and Invest in health IT that optimizes your quality improvement and saf ety efforts .10 8 Peterson Center on Healthcare.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Payment mechanisms should be selected based on assumptions of how APMs will catalyze the development of essential delivery components and competencies for specific patient populations and provider organizations. Given the relative lack of national experience with APMs, and the time it takes to obtain results from rigorous evaluation studies, there is not at present a large volume of evidence on the relationship between specific payment mechanisms and their impact on delivery system design. However, CMMI has published a helpful list of factors that model designers should take into account (such as alignment with goals for delivery -system reform and extent of clinical transformation in model design) when selecting payment mechanisms. 11 Additionally, typologies of payment mechanisms can provide useful insights into the economic incentives inherent in particular payment approaches.12 In addition to obtaining in formation about others' experience implementing APMs, such as through the LAN's Action Collaboratives and other multi-stakeholder networks, model designers can draw on these conceptual resources as results from program evaluations emerge. Principle 3: The goal is to effectively transition health care payments from fee for service toward payment mechanisms that are better designed to promote the triple aim of healthier people, better care, and smarter spending, and this can include Category 2C APMs in ce rtain cases. However, in order to achieve improvements in care coordination and support high-quality, evidence -based care, the majority of national spending should continue moving into Category 3 and 4 shared-risk and population- based payment models. The overarching objective of the LAN is to encourage multi -payer alignment between and within the public and private sectors, as the health care system moves away from traditional FFS payment and into payment and delivery approaches that are better suited fo r promoting high -quality, effective care. It is useful to view this transition as a journey with origins, way stations, and destinations, both for individual providers and for national spending as a whole. Providers at the early stages of the journey may benefit from infrastructure payments to support investments in delivery components that are needed to successfully manage population health and spending. For example, primary care practices may need dedicated care managers, care coordinators, community liai sons, and practice managers, while improving health information technology and data analytic capabilities and offering additional ways to access care around the clock. Although infrastructure investments to support these sorts of activities can be consider able, providers can obtain 11 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED funding from a variety of sources, including per -member -per-month payments from insurers, their own cash reserves, capital markets, and investment funding from companies that give providers tools and resources to engage in popula tion health management. Irrespective of their source, these initial infrastructure payments should be designed to enable early-stage providers to move into and succeed in Category 2C arrangements (pay -for-performance) by providing high quality health care for their patients. For example, CMS' Multi -Payer Advanced Primary Care Practice model provides Category 2A infrastructure payments for primary care practices to transform into patient -centered medical homes (PCMHs). Similarly, Aetna's PCMH Recognition Pro gram provides a per -member -per-month fee to support investments in care coordination and quality of care.13 Certain types of providers face structural constraints and will require extensive technical and financial support to move into and beyond Category 2C arrangements. For example, some providers have difficulty accessing debt markets, cash reserves, and other sources of infrastructure funding needed to initiate the transition to APMs. Other providers lack experience with population health management, face geographic barriers to care integration and coordination, or do not care for enough patients to adequately manage clinical risk. In general, providers who face structural constraints tend to be physicians in solo and small group practices, small and mediu m-sized primary care practices, rural providers, and safety net providers. Some providers facing structural constraints will be able to undergo this transformation on their own, in a way that meets their needs and the needs of their patients. New organiza tions are emerging which provide management services capabilities to some of these clinical practices. There are many options for practices to come together and form partnerships that support shared infrastructural investment and financial risk, which will improve care and enable success in Category 2C and more advanced payment arrangements. For example, providers can form regional collaboratives to share delivery infrastructure and launch joint care coordination and quality improvement initiatives. Providers can also enter into gain -sharing arrangement s with companies that specialize and invest in population health management. In addition to providing practices with investment capital for infrastructure development, these types of companies provide practice management support, in the form of data analyt ics, assistance with practice transformation, and resources to improve care integration and coordination. In return for investments and technical assistance, these companies share in the financial gains the practices produce, which further aligns payers an d purchasers around value -based (as opposed to volume -based) incentives for care delivery. Furthermore, smaller provider organizations can join together to achieve panel sizes large enough to allow providers to assume clinical risk they are able to manage. This can be accomplished by entering into contracts with population health management organizations, and in the future it could be accomplished through the formation of \"virtual groups,\" such as those that will be available in CMS' Merit -Based Payment Sys tem and CareFirst's PCMH program. Both of these options provide a path way for small groups to aggregate and receive collective score accountability ( even though they may not share in the management of a common group of patients) . Irrespective of how it is accomplished, moving structurally constrained providers (especially safety net providers) into Category 3 and 4 APMs 13 ASPE. (2016).

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED will be critical for achieving the transformations necessary to bend the cost curve and meet the triple aim. Therefore, it will be important to address barriers that today may seem insurmountable. In addition to steps providers can take on their own, impactful reforms to the fee schedule would go a long way toward accelerating the pace of payment and delivery reform. Assigning values to servi ces (particularly primary care services) that are based on a true indication of their impact over the long term would considerably benefit structurally constrained providers. In particular, primary care plays a critical role in achieving efficiencies for t he health care system as a whole, but is undervalued in current FFS; this problem will not be solved by simply adding more codes for services such as chronic care management or behavioral health. Reforming fee schedules is important because FFS is a vital component of many APMs, which would also benefit from a reformed fee schedule. For some structurally constrained providers (i.e., providers facing the structural constraints described above), Category 2C arrangements may support continuous delivery system improvement and therefore constitute an ultimate payment reform destination. For example, Category 2C payments may be ideally suited for driving increases in underutilized preventive services. However, f or providers who do not face structural constraints, Category 2C should be a way station on the path to Category 3 and 4 arrangements, which offer additional opportunities to improve the management of population health and target spending on care that patients value . The Work Group believes these structural constraints are not pervasive and therefore will not constitute a barrier for the majority of providers to eventual ly move into Categories 3 and 4, as illustrated below in Figure 3.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Figure 3: Payment Reform Goals * Note: The values presented in the above \"current state\" graphic are based on available data on private plans from Catalyst for Payment Reform and Medicare FFS all ocations. This graphic is meant to represent recommendations for how the health care system should change, and it account s for the likely impact of Medicare's Quality Payment Program and private initiatives . Values displayed in the graphic are not precise, and will depend on delivery capabilities, as described elsewhere in this document. The size of the various circles represents spending across various types of payment models. Payments are expected to shift over time from Categories 1 and 2 into Categories 3 and 4. Additionally and over time, APMs within a particular category will increase the extent to which payments are linked to provider accountability, enable more innovation in care, make a greater impact on quality and cost performance, increase coordi nation in delivery systems, and result in more value- based care. Moving national spending into Categories 3 and 4 is critical for several reasons. First, given the already negative impact ineffective health care spending is having on businesses and the nat ional economy, purchasers cannot be expected to indefinitely subsidize infrastructure without a return on investment in the form of improved cost and quality performance. Second, a bsent accountability for cost, utilization, and appropriate care, FFS is inc ompatible wit h person -centered care delivery . Category 2C payments do not incentivize providers either to efficiently distribute resources to the patients for whom improved care can lead to significant cost savings or to adopt measures to reduce the use of low-value care. Third, FFS is not conducive to the pursuit of care delivery innovations that are capable of better addressing complex issues, such as social determinants of health and care management for patients with multiple chronic conditions . This is because solutions to these types of issues require considerable coordination beyond the walls of the clinic or hospital, which cannot realistically be itemized on a fee schedule. By supporting successful initiatives to address social determinants and chronic comorbidities, value -based payments can improve, but not completely remediate, outcomes related to patients' complexities. As illustrated in Figure 3, Category 4 A PMs have the potential to give providers additional opportunities and flexibility when establishing and maintaining delivery system components that improve the value of Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 18 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED care (compared to Category 3 APMs). This is because Category 4 APMs provide stronger in centives to decrease costs while using quality and appropriateness -of-care measures to hold providers accountable for maintaining or improving quality standards. Category 4 APMs can also be more administratively efficient to pay providers prospectively, instead of reimbursing each individual claim and undergoing an extensive retrospective reconciliation at the end of the performance period. However, individual providers should not feel compelled to enter Category 4 arrangements if they believe doing so could adversely impact practices and patients. As discussed in Principle 6, providers should only assume as much risk as needed to maximize the value of care delivered, which means Category 3 will serve as an ultimate destination for some providers. Above all, the systemic imperative to move payments into Categories 3 and 4 will need to be balanced against individual providers' readiness to change payment and delivery models. Striking the proper balance between these potentially conflicting priorities will requ ire considera ble trust amongst all stakeholder groups, in order to move at the best pace for patients and consumers. Principle 4: To the greatest extent possible, value -based incentives should reach providers across the care team that directly delivers care. Payment reforms for quality improvement and cost reduction are most effective when they directly impact payments for clinicians who are principally responsible for providing care to patients. These incentives are effective because providers deliverin g patient care are best positioned to develop processes and practices, which drive well-coordinated , and high -value care that ultimately leads to better outcomes. For example, an ACO that is at risk for cost and quality would ideally design financial incen tives for physicians and their care teams and hospitals that achieve outcomes that matter to patients. I t may not always be possible to measure accurately the degree to which incentive payments reach front -line providers . Nevertheless, this should become a best practice, because making population -based payment s to provider organization s that, in turn, pay care teams on an FFS basis will not harness the full potential of the incentives in the APM. This is particularly important in light of the recent growth in physician employment, because employed physicians often do not receive performance feedback directly . 14 The question of how far incentive payments should reach, and whether it is appropriate for individual clinicians to receive incentive payments, raises difficult and complicated issues. On one hand, it is essential to reward clinicians who deliver high -value, person -centered care, because they are the ones who work directly with patients to achieve positive outcomes. On the other hand, risk-adjustment methodologies and illness severity scales do not always sufficiently account for patient complexity, so rewarding individual providers could unintentionally encourage adverse selection against patients with complex medical needs. Additionally, when compared to financial incentives for practices or physician groups, financial incentives for individuals may not be reinvested as much in improvements to care delivery. Therefore, APMs need to carefully evaluate incentive structures for provider groups and 14 See, for example: Farmer S., Darling M.A., George M., Casale P.N., Hagan E., and McClellan M.B. (2017).

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED individu al clinicians to ensure that there are sufficient protections for complex patients, that individual clinicians are fairly compensated for delivering exemplary care, and that incentive payments are used to sustain delivery system transformations. Additional patient protections , such as independent oversight and robust venues for voicing patient concerns , may also be needed during the transition from FFS to population -based payment. Principle 5: Payment models that do not take quality and value into account will not be designated as value -based. They will not be considered APMs for the purposes of tracking progress toward payment reform. As illustrated in Figure 4, the APM Framework represents a continuum of payment approaches across four C ategories . Category 1 represents FFS payment not linked to quality incentives. Categories 2 through 4 advance succ essively beyond traditional FFS payment. There is limited merit in moving toward population -based payments if the resulting payment models do not include incentives to deliver quality care based on current clinical evidence on how to achieve outcomes that matter to patients. Although specific recommendations about what constitutes meaningful quality measurement is beyond the scope of this paper, several general elements are critical. APMs should use harmonized measure sets that include measures of process, clinical outcomes, patient -reported outcomes, and patient experience of care. Quality measures should be appropriately adjusted for patient mix, and whenever possible the measures used should be nationally vetted and endorsed by professional organizations, the National Quality Forum, the Core Quality Measures Collaborative, and others involved in developing consensus on measure specifications and core sets. Measure sets should also be robust enough to provide a comprehensive portrait of a population's clini cal and behavioral health. Measure sets should address the full spectrum of care, care continuity , and overall performance of specific models, but individual measures should be granular enough to enable patients to make informed decisions about providers and treatments. Payment models that represent some movement away from traditional FFS, but do not take quality and appropriateness into account, will be placed under the corresponding payment category and marked with an \"N\" to indicate \"No Quality\" consider ations (e.g., population -based payments not linked to value will fall into Category 4N). Accordingly, such models will not be considered to represent progress toward true payment reform, and are not tracked as part of measuring the achievement of the LAN's goals. Principle 6 : In order to maximize the value of care that providers deliver and to reach the LAN's goals for payment reform, value -based incentives should be sufficiently meaningful for providers to invest in and implement delivery reforms, withou t subjecting providers to risk that is beyond their financial means and/or clinical scope of care. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 20 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED When considering approaches to making value- based incentives meaningful for providers, it is useful to distinguish between two kinds of risk even though they are difficult to separate in practice (for further discussion, please see the description of Category 4 APMs below): management risk and insurance risk . There is widespread agreement on three different principles about how risk should be deployed in APMs. First, individual providers should not be placed in the position of assuming insurance risk, because payers and large health systems are specifically designed to perform this function. Second, APMs can be effective stimuli for delivery system change because providers will develop and sustain innovative approaches to care delivery when they are subjected to certain levels of management risk. Third, excessive levels of management risk can lead to perverse consequences, such as the delivery of inappropriately intensive care (either too much or too little), and potential access problems if critical provider groups are forced out of business. Therefore, value- based incentives should avoid imposing insurance risk on providers, while seeking to find the optimal degree of management risk to maximize beneficial drivers of health care transformation and simultaneously minimizing counterproductive drawbacks. When striking this balance, the overarching objective should be to maximiz e the value of care for patients and consumers: levels of management risk should not be based on goals for payment reform that are dissociated from goals for improving care delivery. When considering levels of management risk, it is important to consider attributes of the providers who will assume that risk. For example, compared to small providers, large providers are better equipped to manage financial risk by making service adjustments. Therefore, management risk will need to be higher for large provide rs to make meaningful transitions to value-based care delivery. Similarly, factors such as practice size, availability of cash reserves, provider readiness, scope of practice, and geography can all impact the amount of financial risk that providers are abl e to bear. Safety -net providers experience considerable volatility in their financial margins and typically have to operate without substantial cash reserves. These factors make it difficult and potentially counterproductive for safety -net providers to take on significant amounts of performance and financial risk. Practices with a large scope and diversity of care will have greater influence over the total costs of care for its population, which means they are able to assume more financial risk than practices that provide a narrower scope of care. Small and rural practices face similar constraints, in addition to the challenges associated with establishing coordinated networks of care over large geographical regions, which means they also may only be able to assume limited amounts of financial risk. 15 As discussed above in the context of Principle 3, these types of 15 Certain approaches to operationalizing financial risk may also impede providers' ability to assume it, irrespective of particular provider characteristics. For example, recouping savings from efficient providers too quickly can Types of risk for providers in APMs Management or clinical risk : Potential monetary losses or gains for providers, based on quality and cost performance that providers can reasonably manage with the proper safeguards in place (e.g., risk adjustment, stop loss , and other mechanisms).

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED providers may be able to contract with population health management companies and take other steps to increase the amount of performance and financ ial risk they are able to assume. Irrespective of which mechanism is used, it is essential for providers to have as much flexibility as possible to determine the amount of financial risk they can assume. Contract negotiation between providers and private payers offers a suitable mechanism for flexibly selecting appropriate levels of risk for specific provider organizations. For public payers, the statutorily mandated use of rulemaking to select risk levels for all providers participating in a given payment model somewhat reduces this flexibility. However, this standardized approach is offset considerably by the wide variety of Medicare APMs that are available, which allows providers to select APMs with risk levels that are appropriate for them. In both the public and private markets, model transparency is critical, because p roviders cannot tailor financial risk without knowing the financial characteristics of the models in which they participate. As providers obtain greater experience in advancing quality wh ile managing costs, and as infrastructure investments begin to generate cost savings, it may be desirable to increase performance and financial risk. However, decisions to do so should be based on the performance and stability of health care delivery syste ms, and not dictated solely by economic imperatives to decrease costs. Categories in the APM Framework are drawn around qualitatively different approaches to risk, and provider risk increases from one category to the next. Nevertheless, the Framework does not consider the precise, quantitative level of risk within each qualitative approach because there is not a \"right\" level of risk or reward that will maximize value for all providers. For example , a 10% shared -savings arrangement is classified the same as a 2% shared -savings arrangement . Principle 7: For tracking purposes, when health plans adopt hybrid payment models that incorporate multiple APMs, the payment dollars will count toward the category of the most dominant APM. This will avoid double counting payments through APMs. A particular payment model may utilize several APMs concurrently, especially as the model is evolving. For example, an ACO may utilize a shared -savings model in years one and two along with nominal pay for performance incentives, and then transition to a s hared -risk model in year three. To track progress in such hybrid cases, the entire payment model will be placed in the category that best captures the \"dominant\" APM (in this case, shared savings for years one and two, and shared risk in year three). It is also possible that bundled payments may be used within upside/downside risk and population -based payment models, and that a PCMH may be supported by FFS -based care coordination fees, pay for performance, and shared savings. In these and other scenarios, p ayment dollars will count toward the most dominant APM in use, meaning the APM to which the greatest amount of incentive payments are directed. In classifying APMs on the basis of their constituent payments, it is important to note that disincentivize efforts to generate such savings. Similarly, short contract cycles can have the effect of disincentivizing long term investments in preventative care, which can yield significant improvements in health outcomes and cost savings over the course of decades. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 22 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED when incentive payments are linked to a n FFS architecture (e.g., bonuses of quality in Category 2C or shared savings payments in Category 3A), the most advanced incentive payment and FFS payment are considered together to determine which payment is dominant. For example, if 40% of payments in an APM entail FFS with a link to quality, and 60% of the payments are population -based, then the APM would be classified in Category 4. Similarly, an APM that includes a shared -savings component will be considered 3A, even if the shared-savings payment is less than the payment for quality. Principle 8: Centers of excellence, patient-centered medical homes, and accountable care organizations are delivery models, not payment models. In many instances, these delivery models have an infrast ructure to support care coordination and have succeeded in advancing quality. They enable APMs and need the support of APMs, but none of them are synonymous with a specific APM. Accordingly, they appear in multiple categories of the APM Framework, depen ding on the underlying payment model that supports them. Consistent with the mission of the LAN, the scope the APM Framework is limited to payment models, as opposed to delivery models. Because centers of e xcellence (COEs) , PCMHs, and ACOs are delivery models that can accommodate a wide variety of payment arrangements, they are listed in the APM Framework according to their underlying payment arrangement. For example, a PCMH that participates in a shared -savings/risk model will be classified in Category 3, but a PCMH that receives population- based payments linked to value will be classified in Category 4. Although PCMHs and ACOs are commonly understood to be associated with risk-sharing payment models , clear distinction s should be maintained between concept s that describe payment models and those that describe delivery models. At the same time, these delivery models have been developed with the goal of driving care coordination and delivery improvements , and will enable more advanced payment models while at the same time requiring more advanced payment models to succeed . The APM Framework The APM Framework is depicted in Figure 4. The Framework represents payments from public and private payers to provider organizations (including payments between the payment and delivery arms of highly integrated health systems). It is designed to accommodate payments in multiple categories that are made by a single payer, as well as single provider organizations that receive payments in different categories \u2014potentially from the same payer. Although payments will be classified in disc rete categories, the Framework captures a continuum of clinical and financial risk for provider organizations. The following discussion identifies the organizing principles that serve as the foundation for each Category, explains how the Categories are dif ferentiated, and highlights examples of APMs in each Category.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Fee for Service with N o Link to Quality & Value (Category 1 ): Payment models classified in Category 1 utilize traditional FFS payments (i.e., payments made for units of service) that are adjusted to account for neither infrastructure investments, nor provider reporting of quality data , nor provider performance on cost and quality metrics. Additionally, it is important to note that diagnosis related groups ( DRGs ) that are not linked to quality and value are classified in Category 1 . This is because DRGs are used to reimburse a group of services delivered within a hospitalization , and while DRGs drive efficiencies in inpatient care, hospitals typically bill DRGs in much the same way physicians bill services that are paid on a fee schedule . In both instances, the provider's incentive may be to bill for additional services because they are paid more for more volume. Payments in Category 1 are distinguished from those in Category 2 in that the latter incentivizes infrastructure investments and/or involves some method of reporting or assessing the quality of the care delivered. Unlike payments made in Category 1, payments made in Category 2 are influenced by whether a provider invests in infrastructure, reports quality data, or achieves quality targets. Fee for Service Linked to Quality & Value (Category 2) : Payment models classified in Category 2 utilize traditional FFS payments (i.e., payments made for units of service), but these payments are subsequently adjusted based on infrastructure investments to improve care or clinical services, whether providers report quality data, or how well providers perform on cos t and quality metrics. In addition to their capacity to stimulate and focus quality improvement initiatives, investments in quality performance assessment are also valuable because they can drive the development and expansion of health information technolo gy (HIT). 16 In certain cases, such as vaccinations and colonoscopies, FFS appropriately incentivizes increased utilization of important services. In these cases, linking FFS payments to quality indicators (e.g., measures that reinforce the right care at the right time ) can be an ideal arrangement. However, for the majority of services, Category 2 should be used to smooth the transition into Category 3 and 4 APMs, and spur the delivery system improvements these payments enable. The Work Group has split Category 2 into subcategories A, B, and C, as outlined below: Payments placed in to Category 2A involve payment s for infrastructure investments that can improve the quality of patient care, even though payment rates are not adjusted in accordance with performance on quality metrics. For example, payments designated for staffing a care coordination nurse or upgrading to electronic health records would fall under Category 2A. Because investments in these and similar delivery enhancements will likely improve patient experience and quality of care, these types of FFS or per -member -per-month (PMPM) payments are consider ed an important \u2014though preliminary \u2014step toward payment reform. 16 Although the Work Group was not tasked with developing specific recommendations on HIT or data sharing, it believes that providers should invest in interoperable systems; that administrative reporting requirements should be minimized as much as possible; that patients and caregivers should have free and ready access to patient records; and that HIT should be used to maintain patient registries and contribute to the development of clinical measures and guidelines. For additional guidance on how to approach data sharing in population -based payment models, see: LAN (2016). Accelerating and Aligning Population- Based Payment Models: Data Sharing. Available at https://hcp- lan.org/groups/pbp/ds -final-whitepaper/ . Approved Number 17-2546 25 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Payments placed into Category 2B provide positive or negative incentives to report quality data to the health plan and \u2014preferably \u2014to the public. Providers may have initial difficulties reporting clinical data accurately. Participation in a pay -for-reporting program therefore gives providers an opportunity to familiarize themselves with performance metrics, build internal resources to collect data , and better navigate a health plan's reporting syst em. Because pay -for-reporting does not link payment to quality performance, participation in Category 2B payment models should be time limited and will typically evolve into subsequent categories . Payments are placed into Category 2 C if they reward provide rs that perf orm well on quality metrics and/or penalize providers that do not perform well, thus providing a significant linkage between payment and quality. For example, providers may receive higher or lower updates to their FFS baseline, or they may rece ive a percent reduction or increase on all claims paid, depending on whether they meet quality goals. In some instances, these programs have an extensive set of performance measures that assess clinical outcomes, such as a reduction in emergency room visit s for individuals with chronic illnesses or a reduction in hospital -acquired infections. Payments in this subcategory are not subject to rewards or penalties for provider performance against aggregate cost targets, but may account for performance on a more limited set of utilization measures. As the evaluation literature demonstrates, Category 2A and 2B payments, for HIT and other infrastructure needed to assess and improve quality performance, are often insufficient on their own to catalyze significant del ivery transformations. 17 Providers should therefore use Category 2A and 2B payments as an \"on ramp\" to participation in subsequent categories. Providers will transition into Category 2C in different ways. In the private sector, few payment plans support pay -for-reporting arrangements, and providers often move directly into pay -for-performance models. By contrast, Medicare pay -for-reporting programs typically precede and serve as the foundation for pay -for- performance programs in the same facility setting. Ir respective of how the transition occurs, it is important for providers to move quickly into Category 2C arrangements. Payments that fall under Category 2 are distinguished from those that fall under Category 3 in two respects. First, Category 2 payments do not involve arrangements in which providers are rewarded for providing appropriate care or penalized for insufficiently reducing low -value care (e.g., shared savings or shared losses based on established cost targets). Second, FFS -based payments in Catego ry 3 reflect, to a greater degree, care provided longitudinally, such that multiple providers are responsible for the cost and quality associated with a particular set of procedures or services. By contrast, Category 2 payments are typically limited to spe cific providers. APMs Built on Fee-for-Service Architecture (Category 3) : Payment models classified in Category 3 are based on an FFS architecture, while providing mechanisms for the effective management of a set of procedures, an episode of care, or all health services provided for individuals. To accomplish this, Category 3 pa yments are based on cost (and occasionally utilization) performance against a target, irrespective of how the financial or utilization benchmark is established, updated, or adjusted. Additionally, payments in Category 3 are structured to encourage provider s to deliver effective and efficient care. Episode -based and other types of bundled payments encourage care coordination because they cover a complete set of related services for a procedure that may be 17 See, for example: Mendelson A., et al. (2017). The Effects of Pay -for-Performance Programs on Health, Health Care Use, and Processes of Care: A Systematic Review . Annals of Internal Medicine, 166, 341- 354. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 26 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED delivered by multiple providers. Clinical episode payments fall into Category 3 if they are tied to specific procedures, such as hip replacement or back surgery. Due to the potential that providers may curtail necessary care to meet explicit cost and/or utilization targets in Category 3 APMs, it is essential for these APMs to includ e safeguards that go beyond the standard types of quality measures used in Category 2 APMs. Accordingly, Category 3 APMs must hold providers financially accountable for performance on available measures of \"appropriate care.\" In this context, appropriate care is delivered when patients receive the right care at the right time, in the right place, and at the right intensity. Appropriate care adheres to evidence -based guidelines and comparative effectiveness research; it avoids unnecessarily costly, harmful, and unnecessary procedures; its intensity is commensurate with patients' goals, prognoses, and needs; and it reflects the outcome of shared decision-making among patients, their caregivers, and their clinicians. Several organizations and initiatives, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Choosing Wisely campaign , the National Academy of Medicine, and AcademyHealth working with the American Board of Internal Medicine, have further developed this concept of appropriate care by compiling lists of low -value procedures and \"never events,\" by investigating the root causes of low -value care, by designing decision-support tools to promote appropriate care, and by designing measures to assess rates of low - and no -value care. Some of the many topics used to measure appropriate care include preventable hospital admissions, unnecessary imaging, documentation of shared -decision-making and patient goals for end of life care, adherence to clinical guidelines for pre- term labor and delivery, appropriate use of medications, and rates of never events. Although cost (and/or occasionally utilization) performance is the distinguishing component of Category 3 APMs, Category 3 payments hold providers accou ntable for this wider range of activities and outcomes. This is consistent with the notion that cost saving on its own is not an appropriate goal for health care reform; rather, the goal is to generate cost savings by reducing the utilization of care that provides little to no value for patients. All Category 3 payments evaluate providers against financial benchmarks and, occasionally, utilization targets . The Category is further subdivided as follows:18 In Category 3A , providers have the opportunity to share in a portion of the savings they generate against a cost target or by meeting utilization targets, if quality targets are met. However, providers 18 Please note that this definition of a Category 3 APM has been revised in the 2017 APM Framework Refresh. Please see Appendix A for additional details. Measures of \"Appropriate Care\" Appropriate care avoids wasteful tests and procedures that provide no benefit to patients, involves a high degree of care coordination to ensure efficient delivery, and encompasses everything patients need to achieve their personal health-related goals. Measures of appropriate care are essential for Categor ies 3 and 4 APMs to ensure that providers are incentivized t o reduce/eliminate only care that is wasteful and potentially harmful for patients. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 27 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED do not need to compensate payers for a portion of the losses that result when cost or utilization targets are not met. In Category 3B , providers have the opportunity to share in a portion of the savings they generate against a cost target or by meeting utilization targets, if quality targets are met. Additionally, payers recoup from providers a portion of the losses that result when cost or utilization targets are not met. Most ACO arrangements today can be placed in to either Category 3A (most often) or Category 3B, depending on whether the underlying risk arrangement inclu des only upside shared savings or both upside shared savings and downside risk for providers . These and other Category 3 arrangements will advance clinical integration and affordability to a greater extent than payments in Category 2 , because accountabilit y for reductions in low value care provides stronger incentives to manage health care costs and improve care coordination across the span of care . The most important distinction between Category 3 and Category 4 payments is that the latter involve a single, predominantly prospective payment that encompasses a broad array of services, whereas providers participating in Category 3 models continue to be paid on a n FFS basis with retrospective reconciliation after the period of performance. Additional condition s must be met before a payment model can be placed into Category 4. Specifically, Category 4 payments reflect the TCOC for treating a primary (typically chronic) condition (e.g., diabetes or cancer), a more limited set of specialty services (e.g., primary care or behavioral health), or comprehensive care for an entire population. By contrast, payments for a more limited set of services o r procedures (e.g., knee and hip replacement) are classified as Category 3, even if they are population-based and patient -centered (e.g., paid for prospectively and include accountability for patient -reported outcomes) . For example, a prospective, population -based primary care model would be classified in Category 4A, but a population -based bundled payment for maternity care would be classified as a Category 3B because it only addresses one aspect of a person's care and health. Similarly, population-based clinical episode and bundled payments that are tied to conditions (e.g., diabetes or cancer) fall under Category 4 , whereas clinical episode payments tied to procedures (e.g., hip replacement or back surgery) fall under Category 3, even if they are paid prospectively. As such, Category 4 payments are more person -focused, insofar as they include stronger incentives to promote h ealth and wellness throughout the care continuum. Population -Based Payment (Category 4 ): Payment models classified as Category 4 involve prospective, population-based payments, structured in a manner that encourages providers to deliver well -coordinated, high -quality, person -centered care within either a defined scope of practice (4A), a comprehensive collection of care (4B), or a highly integrated finance and delivery system (4C). For the same reasons as Category 3, Category 4 APMs require accountability for measures of appropriate care to provide additional safeguards against incentives to limit necessary care. Absent this accountability, APMs that use prospective, population- based payments will be classified in Category 4N. Payments within Category 4 ca n be used to cover a wide range of preventive health, care coordination, and wellness services, in addition to standard medical procedures typically paid through claims, and this flexibility makes it easier for providers to invest in foundational and innov ative delivery system components. Additionally, replacing the volume-based incentives of FFS with prospective, population-based payments creates stronger incentives for providers to maximize quality within a budget. Taken Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 28 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED together, these mutually reinforcing characteristics of Category 4 payments - both the freedom to practice medicine without having to rearrange care delivery to meet strict reimbursement requirements, and the incentives to maximize the quality and efficiency of care delivery - hold special promise for providers and patients who are able and willing to participate in them. Despite the promise of Category 4 APMs, it is important to recognize that it is very difficult to limit providers' exposure to insurance risk in these payment arrangements. When designing Category 4 APMs, it is therefore essential to recognize that providers outside of integrated finance and delivery systems are unlikely to have the administrative capabilities or risk -based capital to assume insurance risk. Certain safeguards can be taken to minimize the introduction of insurance risk into population - based payment models. First, these models will need to be carefully risk-adjusted to account for patient case -mix. Second, the models will need to \"carve out\" payments for essential yet extraordinarily expensive or random events, which should not be attributed to the accountable provider (e.g., in the case of patients needing a heart transplant soon after they are attributed to a provider organization). Third, stop -loss mechanisms should be put into place in order to protect providers against unexpected cost increases for warranted care (e.g., the recent entry of expensive but effective pharmaceuticals), as well as other catastrophic, unpredictable events (e.g., epidemics of infectious disease). Category 4 is subdivided into subcategories A, B, and C, as outlined below: Category 4A includes bundled payments for the comprehensive treatment of specific conditions. For example, bundled payments for cancer care fall under C ategory 4A if providers are responsible for the total cost and quality of care for a patient, rather than covering , for example, only chemotherapy payments . Additionally, prospective payments are classified in Category 4A if they are prospective and popula tion-based, and also cover all care delivered by particular types of clinicians (e.g., primary care and orthopedics). Payments in Category 4B are prospective and population -based , and they cover all an individual's health care needs. Category 4B encompas ses a broad range of financing and delivery system arrangements , in which payers and providers are organizationally distinct. Payments in Category 4 C also cov er comprehensive care, but unlike Category 4B payments, they move from the financing arm to the delivery arm of the same, highly integrated finance and delivery organization. In some cases, these integrated arrangements consist of insurance companies that own provider networks, while in other cases they consist of delivery systems that offer their own insurance products. To be effective, the finance and delivery arms will need to work in tandem to ensure that effective delivery investments are being made and that incentives and strategies within the organization are properly aligned. Additionally, it is important to note that when integrated lines of business comprise a portion of a company's portfolio, only the integrated payments count toward Category 4C. Integrated Finance and Delivery Systems Integrated finance and delivery systems bring together insurance plans and delivery systems within the same organization. These systems may include joint ventures between insurance companies and provider groups, insurance companies that own provider groups, or provider groups that offer insurance products.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Category 4A may be an appropriate endpoint when smaller provider organizations with targeted skill sets deliver patient care that revolve s around the management of chronic conditions, such as cancer or heart disease. Nevertheless, in many instances it is preferable to compensate providers for maintain ing health and ma naging illness for an entire population, rather than compartmentalizing and subdividing payments into distinct condition s. Additionally, condition -specific payments should, in time, become part of a comprehensive approach to improving health and reducing costs for an entire population, such that Category 4A arrangements evolve into Category 4B arrangements. Based on interviews with companies involved in integrated finance and delivery arrangemen ts, it appears that Category 4C payments have the potential to carry significant advantages. For example, these arrangements can expedite investments in crucial care delivery infrastructure, such as population health management support, programs to improve care coordination and care transitions, HIT, and community health initiatives. Additionally, highly integrated arrangements can provide important foundations for organizational cultures and strategies directed toward population health management, and they can create stronger alignments between physician groups and hospitals. On the other hand, widespread growth of integrated finance and delivery systems could potentially result in market consolidation, which could , in turn , lead to decreased choices and lack of access for patients, as well as increased costs. Evidence on the effectiveness of highly integrated systems is still in its early stages, and preliminary results are inconclusive. Therefore, Category 4B and 4C APMs sh ould be considered equally effective vehicles for increasing the value of care through delivery system improvements. Taken together, Categories 4A, 4B, and 4C represent the furthest departure from traditional FFS payments, while they simultaneously ensur e that providers possess the strongest possible incentives to deliver high- quality and efficient care. Nevertheless, as discussed above, Category 4 payments are not necessarily appropriate for all providers and markets. To be successful, providers will neces sarily travel at different paces and along different trajectories in the collective journey of health payment and delivery reform. But over time, Category 4 APMs will offer an appealing destination for more and more providers and other stakeholders in the health care system. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Conclusion As set forth in this document, transitioning from FFS to population-based payments is critical for health care transformation. Keeping in mind the underlying principles, the APM Framework provides a high -level mapping of payment approaches, as well as a pathway for payment reform and a foundation for measuring progress. These tools should be useful and endurin g for all stakeholders as they navigate the health care ecosystem. Although the Framework identifies and encompasses all models of payment reform, new developments in the health care sector may result in a need for further refinement in future years. Nevertheless, the Framework should be robust enough to accommodate foreseeable changes and become the overarching framework for discussing and evaluating payments in the U.S. health care system. The LAN intends to continue compiling and periodically releasing c ase studies of payment models. (See APM Framework White Paper Addendum .) This is important because it will disseminate lessons learned and provide the nation with models to consider as public and private plans align around common payment approaches. Stakeholders and the APM Framework Patient Advocacy Groups can use the APM Framework to understand the context behind plan and benefit design so they can identify and communicate desirable elements and participate in decisions about how to design payment plans and delivery systems. Providers can use the APM Framework to appreciate the types of payment reforms underway; to achieve a better understanding of where they are situated; to begin to conceive of where they might like to end up; and, most importantly, to plan for the future. Payers can use the APM Framework to drive payment and contracting models and as a financial tool to track spending and the distribution of members/beneficiaries and providers. This is crucially important because adopting a common classification scheme represent s a first step toward the alignment of payment approaches . Purchasers can use the APM Framework to engage and educate their employees about the health insurance landscape and to share information for population -based plans, along with the information on the safeguards and benefits that would motivate them toward enrolling in such plans.

ALL RIGHTS Appendix A: Category 3 \"Incentive- at-Risk\" APMs Because MACRA and the LAN APM Framework share the goal of transitioning away from FFS and into APMs that achieve better outcomes at lowe r costs, comparisons between the two systems for designating APM advancement can illuminate alternative ways to effectively tether payment to value, and take better account of variation among providers. Given that CPC+ Track 1 was the only Advanced APM (by MACRA standards) that was not classified as a Category 3 or 4 in the original framework, the Advisory Group closely examined how it used payment to hold providers accountable for quality and cost. As a result of these discussions, the Advisory Group deter mined that payments in CPC+ Track 1 drive value in a manner that is functionally equivalent to shared-savings arrangements in Category 3A. The Advisory Group therefore decided to classify CPC+ Track 1 and other \"incentive-at -risk\" APMs in Category 3A. Ince ntive -at-risk APMs give providers the opportunity to share in a portion of the savings they generate as a direct result of meeting utilization targets. These APMs possess two important characteristics. First, utilization measures that provide very strong p roxies for TCOC take the place of formal financial benchmarks. Second, incentive payments for performance on utilization measures are used to reallocate derived savings (if any) between payers and providers. Because incentive payments (as opposed to paymen ts made through the FFS architecture) are at risk for utilization performance, incentive -at-risk APMs are classified in Category 3A (as opposed to Category 3B). These incentive -at-risk APMs are particularly appropriate for smaller practices and other situa tions in which upfront investment might be necessary to provide adequate resources for providers to undertake care transformation, and in which it is not ideal to hold providers directly accountable for meeting benchmarks based on TCOC. Primary care in the Medicare population involves a unique set of circumstances that make incentive-at - risk APMs effective vehicles for improving quality while decreasing costs. First, a greater proportion of TCOC for the Medicare population is driven by fewer categories of h ealth care utilization. Emergency department usage and inpatient stays account for roughly 40% of TCOC in the Medicare population, while these categories account for only about 20 -25% of TCOC in the population covered by commercial insurance. This means th at inpatient utilization measures provide more robust proxies for TCOC with fewer utilization targets for practices to track and work to achieve. Primary care practices also have the capability to focus on and influence these measures to a much greater degree than some other cost drivers under an expansive TCOC benchmark. CPC+ practices may also improve utilization performance by partnering with value-oriented specialty providers who appropriately use tests and interventions . Primary care providers also tend to practice in small groups, and their patient panels are typically too small to manage the financial risk of outlier patients' disproportionate impact on TCOC. Additionally, Medicare's previous experience with its Comprehensive Primary Care Classic mode l suggested that although the formation of \"virtual groups\" achieved panel sizes large enough to mitigate this risk and allowed for cost accountability, pooling patients across providers in a region appeared to dampen the driving force for cost savings. Th is may have been attributable to the diffusion of responsibility among multiple practices within a virtual group. Additionally, behavioral economics research strongly supports the notion that receiving an uncertain amount of incentive payments after a peri od of performance Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 32 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED would be less motivational than providing defined payments up front and reconciling them after the fact, because providers are more likely to be motivated by potential losses than potential gains.19 Track 1 of Medicare's CPC+ model takes these unique factors into consideration in the design of a Category 3A arrangement that generates cost savings by tying incentive payments to reductions in utilization. In addition to payments made through Medicare's standard fee schedule, primary care practices receive prospective care management fees (Category 2A), as well as prospective performance - based incentive payments (Category 2C). Fifty percent of the incentive payment is based on providers' performance on two utilization measures : inpatient hospi talization utilization per 1,000 attributed beneficiaries and emergency department utilization per 1,000 attributed beneficiaries . This means providers are able to share in a significant proportion of Medicare's savings from reduced hospital utilization as a result of improved care coordination or greater availability of office visits, telephone, or telemedicine consultation. Conversely, providers who perform poorly on these two utilization measures risk paying back Medicare some or all of the utilization p ortion of the incentive payment. Cumulatively, these payments and risk place CPC+ Track 1 in Category 3A. Figure 5 illustrates the expected payment implications in CP C+ Track 1 when a provider maintains utilization at average levels, reduces utilization significantly more than average, or increases utilization slightly more than average. 19Please note: So long as incentive payments for performance on key utilization measures effectively create a shared -savings arrangement they will be classified in Category 3A, irrespective of whether they are made prospectively or retrospectively.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Appendix D : Other LAN Content The LAN has written a suite of papers to help align payment reform efforts. The papers referred to in this appendix include recommendations on the design of population -based payments and clinical episode payments, as well as a toolkit on data sharing for alternative payment models. These recommendations are the result of input from a wide variety of persons and organizations that have either direct experience implementing payment reform or deep experience in the health care field. CAMH convened two Work Groups, the Population -Based Payment (PBP) Work Group and the Clinical Episode Payment (CEP) Work Group, to develop recommendations for the implementation of these types of payment models. Their recommendations focus on specific design elements, many of which overlap and upon which there was much common agreement even as the Work Groups deliberated separately. Each of the four PBP White Papers described below focuses on a separate design element (financial benchmarking, patient attribution, performance measurement, and data sharing) in a PBP context. In a PBP arra ngement, an accountable entity takes responsibility for the care for a defined population over a specified period of time (typically a year) for the full continuum of care. These design elements should be considered as a whole for effective PBP implementat ion as they interact considerably. The CEP Work Group also divided their recommendations into design elements, but included several operational considerations along with 10 design elements. The recommendations were organized in chapters in the comprehensive White Paper and applied to three clinical areas where clinical episode payment models would be most effective: elective joint replacement, maternity care, and coronary artery disease (CAD). While the clinical focus is more targeted here, the underlying concepts for setting the episode price (including the level and type of risk), defining the population and services included in the episode, patient engagement and quality metrics, and the data infrastructure are similar to those of the four PBP White Papers. The LAN convened the Data Sharing Requirements Initiative (DSRI) to gather information on recent approaches and experiences building data -sharing capacity. The DSRI leadership team incorporated input from interviews with organizations engaged in data sharing in support of APMs, and reviewed material on critical developments in technology and policy. The resulting toolkit is meant to be of practical value for those planning and developing future data sharing activities. Below are the links and a brief overview of each of the papers written by the LAN Work Groups. By reading the full suite of products, readers will be better able to make decisions about the most effective payment model(s) to implement and the key issues to consider when designing those models.

Population -Based Payment (PBP) Models: Accelerating and Aligning Population- Based Payment (PBP): Patien t Attribution The Patient Attribution White Paper describes the method by which patient populations are assigned to providers who are accountable for total cost of care and quality outcomes for their designated populations in a PBP model. The paper recommends that active, intentional identification , or self - reporting by patients , should be considered first. The paper also outlines nine additional Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 40 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED recommendations that payers and providers can use when making decisions on attribution in their PBP model s. Accelerating and Aligning Population- Based Payment (PBP): Financial Benchmarking The Financial Benchmarking White Paper describes approaches for setting an initial benchmark and upda tes over time , as well as addresses risk -adjustment considerations. The White Paper discusses the need to balance voluntary participation with the movement toward convergence in a market with providers at different starting points. Accelerating and Aligning Population- Based Payment (PBP): Data Sharing The Data Sharing White Paper offers several guiding principles and recommendations that highlight the future development of data sharing arrangements in PBP models. The paper also outlines use cases which describe particular types of data sharing arrangements in both their current and aspirational states. The goal is to create an environment where data follows the patient and is available to stakeholders (patients, providers, purchasers, and payers) in a timely manner. Accelerating and Aligning Population- Based Payment (PBP): Performance Measurement The Performance Measurement White Paper offers both short -term action recommendations and a long-term vision for accelerating alignment around APM s. The paper offers a way forward that could lead to radical change in how performance is measured across the board in order to enable the implementation of effective population- based payments. The White Paper describes how to evolve from granular measurement systems of the full continuum of care, which focus on narrow and specific care processes, to more macro -level measurement systems oriented on outcomes. The paper also makes strong recommendations for immediate action steps by describing four key perfor mance measurement principles and seven recommendations for building and sustaining a performance measurement system that supports and encourages collaboration among stakeholders. Clinical Episode Payment (CEP) Models: Accelerating and Aligning Selected Clinical Episode Payment (CEP) Models This paper provides high -level recommendations for designing clinical episode payment models. A clinical episode payment is a bundled payment fo r a set of services that occur over time and across settings. The paper outlines design elements and operational considerations for three selected clinical areas: elective joint replacement, maternity care, and coronary artery disease. Recommendations are organized according to design elements and operational considerations. Design elements address questions stakeholders must consider when designing an episode payment model, including the definition, the duration of the episode, what services are to be incl uded, and others. Operational considerations relate to implementing an episode payment model, including the roles and perspectives of stakeholders, data infrastructure issues, and the regulatory environment in which APMs must operate. Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 41 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Several key principles drove the development of the recommendations across all three episodes: 1) incentivizing person -centered care ; 2) improving patient outcomes through effective care coordination; 3) rewarding high value care by incentivizing providers and patients, together with their family caregivers, to discuss the appropriateness of procedures; and 4) r educing unnecessary costs to the patient and the health care system. The recommendations are designed to speak to a multi -stakeholder audience with the goal of supporting broad clinical episode payment adoption. Elective Joint Replacement The elective joint replacement recommendations emphasize using functional status assessments (both pre- and post -procedure) and shared decision -making tools to determine whether a joint replacement is the appropriate treatment for a given patient. Maternity Care The maternity care recommendations emphasize the need for patient engagement, education, and parenting support services (in addition to clinical maternity care) to achieve a number of critical goals . These include increasing the percentage of full -term births and the percentage of vaginal births, while decreasing the percentage of pre -term and early elective births, complications, and mortality. Coronary Artery Disease The coronary artery disease (CAD) recommendations are based on a CAD condition -level episode, which includes a \"nested\" bundle for procedures like percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypas s graft (CABG). The recommendations emphasize overall condition management designed to reduce the need for procedures, and strong coordination and communication between the surgeons who perform cardiac procedures and the providers who deliver follow -up and long-term cardiac care. Primary Care Payment Models (P CPM ): Accelerating and Aligning Primary Care Payment Models Primary care is a critical link in health care delivery. Often patients' first point of contact with the health care system, primary care practitioners make decisions that broadly impact both patient health and total health care spending. The Primary Care Payment Model (PCPM) White Paper views primary care teams as uniquely positioned to serve as catalysts for innovative care as well as effective stewards of health care resources. The paper offers principles and recommendations for implementing PCPMs that c an help overcome the barriers to effective primary care tied to traditional FFS payments based on the volume of services provided rather than the quality and value of care. Data Sharing Requirements Initiative (DSRI): Collaborative Approaches to Advance Data Sharing Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 42 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED One of the key insights from the DSRI findings is the essential role, in developing data sharing capacity, of collaboration, shared goals, and shared solutions to enable sustainable APM success. Unlike FFS payment models that largely limit accountability t o a single setting (such as hospital or physician's office), APMs require providers to understand and/or be accountable for patients across the medical neighborhood and over time. While t he toolkit is not a \"how to\" guide, as the specifics for each organiz ation and region di ffer, it will be helpful in the strategic planning process to identify the APM functions that require data sharing, to assess current capacity and barriers, and to consider strategies within and across organizations to fill gaps in necessary data sharing functionality.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Appendix E : Principles for Patient - and Family -Centered Payment The following principles, produced by the LAN's Consumer and Patient Affinity Group, are intended to help guide the development of new payment strategi es. They provide guidance and aspirational direction to ensure that we address the needs and priorities of patients and families as we transition to value -based payment. The principles rest on the conviction that consumers, patients, and families are essential partners in every aspect of transforming health care and improving health. Consumers, patients, families, and their advocates should be collaboratively engaged in all aspects of design, implementation, and evaluation of payment and care models, and th ey should be engaged as partners in their own care. The collaboration in design of payment and care models should include oversight, governance, and interface with the communities where care is delivered. At the point of care, patients and families should be engaged in ways that match their needs, capacities, and preferences. Collaborative care should be aligned with patient goals, values, and preferences (including language), and should reflect shared care planning and decision -making throughout the care continuum. Positive impact on patient care and health should be paramount. The central consideration in all payment design should be improving patient health outcomes, experience of care, and health equity, while also ensuring the most effective use of he alth care resources. Measures of performance and impact should be meaningful, actionable, and transparent to consumers, patients, and family caregivers. New payment models should be assessed using measures that are meaningful to patients and families. They should prioritize the use of measures derived from patient -generated data that address both care experience and outcomes. Measures should also address the full spectrum of care, care continuity, and overall performance of specific models. Measures should be granular enough to enable patients to make informed decisions about providers and treatments. Primary care services are foundational and must be effectively coordinated with all other aspects of care. Payment models should foster this coordination, p articularly between primary and specialty care, in order to promote: optimal coordination, communication , and continuity of care; trusted relationships between clinicians and patients/families; concordance with patient goals, values, and preferences; integ ration of non -clinical factors and community supports; and coordination of services delivered through non -traditional settings and modalities that meet patient needs. Effective delivery and coordination of primary care services should promote better care e xperience, optimal patient engagement, better health outcomes, and increased health equity. Health equity and care for high -need populations must be improved. New payment models should foster health equity, including access to innovative approaches to ca re and preventing any discrimination in care. They should collect data that allow for assessment of differential Approved for Public Release; Distribution Unlimited. Case Number 17-2546 44 \u00a9 2017 The MITRE Corporation. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED impacts and the identification and redress of disparities in health, health outcomes, care experience, access, and affordability. Patient and family engagement and activation should be supported by technology. New payment models should promote use of information technology that enables patients and their designated caregivers to easily access their health information in a meaningful format that enables them to use the information to better manage and coordinate their care. The technology should also enable patients to contribute information and communicate with their providers, and it should foster the patient -clinician partnership in ongoing mo nitoring and management of health and care. Financial incentives used in all models should be transparent and promote better quality as well as lower costs. Financial incentives for providers and patients should be fully disclosed so that patients and co nsumers understand how new payment approaches differ from traditional FFS models, and how certain incentives may impact the care providers recommend or provide. Financial incentives should be developed in partnership with patients and consumers in order to reflect how patients define value, and to reduce financial barriers to needed care and ensure that patients are not steered to lower -cost care without regard for quality.

Page 8 of 9 Exhibit F, IMC Instructions for MLR Reporting Rev. 102422 MLR Calculation This worksheet takes the prior amounts and summarizes them into subtotals and calculates the unadjust ed MLR. There are also inputs fo r member months and credibility adjustments if applicable. T he Contractor may add a cr edibility adjustment to a calculated MLR if the MLR r eporting year experience is par tially credible but the Contractor may not add a credibility adjus tment to a calculated MLR if the MLR reporting year experience is fully credible. If the Contractor's experi ence is non-credible, it is presumed to meet or exc eed the MLR calculation standards. The MCO should enter the number of memb er months in the appropriate cell. The State has elected a minimum MLR of 85% Expense Allocation Certain expenses may not be attributable to one line of business. Describe methods used to allocate these expenses and how they factor into the MLR calculated for this report. A description can be included in the wo rkbook or a reference can be made to an attached document: See \u00a7 438.8(g) Each expense must be included under only one type of expense, unless a portion of the expense fits under the definition of, or criteria for, one type of expense and the remainder fits into a different type of expens e, in which case the expense must be pro- rated between types of expenses. Expenditures that benefit multiple contracts or populations, or contracts other than those being reported, mu st be reported on pro rata basis. Expense allocation must be based on a generally accepted accounting method that is expected to yield the most accurate resu lts and shared expenses, including expenses under the terms of a management contrac t, must be apportioned pro rata to the contract incurring the expense. Expenses that relate solely to the operation of a reporting entity, such as per sonnel costs associated with the adjusting and paying of claims, must be borne solely by the reporti ng entity and are not to be apportioned to the other entities. Remittance Calculation Remittance of amounts owed to the Stat e will be calculated as described in Risk Corridor Program section of the FIMC contract.

ATTACHMENT 3 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Page 1 of 2 Attachment 4-A Oral H ealth Connections Pilot Project IMC/IFC Contract - Rev. 9/19/21 Attachment 4-A Oral Health Connections Pilot Project Beginning in 2017, the Legislature directed HCA and Arcora (formerly known as the Washington Dental Foundation) to implement the Oral Health Connections Pilot Project (the Pilot Project), which is modeled after the Access to Baby and Child Dentistry program. See Section 213(1)(nn) of the Substitute Senate Bill (SSB) 5883 HCA and Arcora must work jointly on the Pilot Project from inception to completion. The Pilot Project began on January 1, 2019. In Section 211(50); ESSB 5092 (2021),Legislative directed HCA to extend the time period of the Pilot Project , and it now will last until December 31, 2023 . The purpose of the Pilot Project 's is to integrate oral -systemic health care in two predetermined populations, in three select counties in anticipation of influencing health outcomes and controlling chronic disease. Adults with diabetes and pregnant women (not including Dual - Eligible Clients) , located in Cowlitz, Thurston, or Spokane counties are the target populations . Arcora is responsible for: Financing and developing, in partnership with the University of Washington (UW), a training module and exam for participating dental providers; Providing the exam , in partnership with UW; Notifying HCA, within 5 business days, of su ccessful course completion by participating dental providers; Developing tools and systems to assist medical providers with oral assessments; Developing referral and patient care coordination tools; Developing systems and processes to facilitate shared car e between medical and dental providers; Developing systems and processes to assist dental provider offices in scheduling and keeping appointments; Recruiting dental providers to participate in the program; Attending local and statewide dental provider association meetings; Educating providers about the pilot, including background, duration, enhanced fees, and indicators; Recruiting and educating of medical providers on demographics of the Pilot Project 's target popul ations; Training medical providers about oral systemic link between oral health and diabetes and/or pregnancy, including how to address oral health in medical settings while reinforcing the importance of medical and dental collaboration; and Developing and implementing a Pilot Project evaluation tool. Both medical and dental Pilot Project providers use a referral tool developed by Arcora, called DentistLink, to connect C lients to dental providers in the following ways: Medical provider s refer Clients who are pregnant or who have been diagnosed with diabetes to a trained dental provider participating in the Pilot Project through DentistLink; Page 2 of 2 Attachment 4-A Oral H ealth Connections Pilot Project IMC/IFC Contract - Rev. 9/19/21 Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) refer E nrollees, with flagged qualifying diagnosis(es), through care coordination and DentistLink; Dental providers coordinate with medical providers through DentistLink to receive referrals for patients who are in the target populations . Dental providers are educated in the specifics of intervention and training for those populations. Th e Pilot Project also test s the effects of an enhanced dental benefit has on access to dental care, health care outcomes, and related medical costs. Trained, participating dental providers are eligible for e nhanced reimbursement rates for specific CDT codes in accordance with Pilot Project guidelines. Periodontal health , in particular , will be the target of the enhancements . Medicaid pay s enhanced fees for codes D0150 (Comprehensive Oral Exam), D0120 (Periodi c exam), D0210 more teeth), D4342 (Periodontal Scaling and Root Planing 3 or more teeth per quadrant), D4910 (Periodontal maintenance). The Client is eligible to receive up to three (3) additional D4910 (periodontal maintenance) per twelve- month period . The success of the Pilot Project will be determined through measures evaluating access, cost, and health outcomes. Page 1 of 1 IMC/IFC Contract Attachment 5-C, ABCD Program Rev. 4-4-22 Attachment 5-C Access to Baby and Child Den tistry ( ABCD) Program The Access to Baby and Child Dentistry ( ABCD ) Program was established to increase access to dental services for all Apple Health- eligible clients through age 5 . The ABCD Program will be extended to Apple Health- eligible clients through age 12 with a disability who are enrolled in the Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA) waiver program and possess a DDA indicator on their Medicaid file, effective January 1, 2022. The Program's goal is to ensure positive dental experiences in early childhood will lead to lifelong practices of good oral health. The ABCD Program is a partnership between the public and private sectors , such as the Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA) , the Washington State Department of Health, the University of Washington School of Dentistry (UW) , Arcora, the Washington State Dental Association, local dental societies , and local health jurisdictions. The design of the ABCD Program is to develop competency in dental practices to deliver dental services to children and, in primary medical care practices , to provide oral health education, oral assessments and treatments, or refer rals for treatment. HCA has c ontracted with UW to provide technical and procedural consultation, develop training curriculum and materials, and train dental providers to become ABCD Dental Champions . UW also issues and tracks all certifications for dental providers, and dental champions. UW also provides the Interim Therapeutic Restoration (ITR) certification. The UW sends a list of ABCD -certified providers to HCA and HCA places an indicator on the provider's ProviderOne profile, which allows HCA to identify these providers as eligible for the enhanced ABCD rates. HCA contracts with 26 Coordinators to perform community outreach, including identification and referral of eligible children to ABCD providers . These C oordinators are either a local health jurisdiction or a community agency . Each Coordinator has one or more Dental Champions. who work s to recruit, and train, local general dentists to become ABCD -certified providers . HCA also contracts with Arcora to provide centralized management of the ABCD Program. Arcora also trains , and issues and tracks all certifications for, medical PCPs through in- office continuing education (1.5 hours) by Arcora . This program for medical PCPs is now known as MouthMatters - the medical extension of the ABCD program. MouthMatters will be covered under either Medicaid managed care or fee-for-service, depending on the program in which the client is enrolled. Arcora is also responsible for sending confirmation of certification to HCA to ensure an indicator is placed on the PCP's ProviderOne profile. This indicator will continue to be ABCD and no new indicator will be created at this time. The training educates providers on delivery of the following preventive services: Links bet ween oral health and total health; Oral health screening and risk assessment; Providing oral health education and anticipatory guidance to clients and families; Application of topical fluoride; Billing; and Referrals for dental care.
