Morone, MD, MS Background OPTIMUM, a pragmatic clinical trial, is an evidence based, non-pharmacological eight-week clinical group- based telehealth chronic pain management program modeled on Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP). It is delivered out of the primary care office. There will be 450 people randomized to either the OPTIMUM intervention or Usual Care. The concept of mindfulness is often misunderstood. The term mindfulness can be defined as increasing awar eness of moment-to-moment thoughts, sensations and emotions without judgment. It can be promoted by certain practices or activities, such as meditation, but it is not equivalent to or synonymous with them. Mindfulness Meditation Program All mindfulness practices can be a form of meditation. The body scan meditation is one of the guided meditation methods taught in the OPTIMUM study. The purpose of this type of mindfulness meditation is to br ing increased awareness to body sensations, as well as any thoughts or emotions that arise while focusing on each part of the body. As the person tunes in to the body it provides the opportunity to disconnect or let go of surroundings and reconnect to the physical self by noticing sensations, thoughts and emotions without judgement. Body Scan Getting comfortable Closing the eyes and focusing on breath sensations Bringing awareness to a specific part of the body. Starting with the feet Spending some time noticing sensations Spending time noticing thoughts or emotions Releasing the focus on that part of the body Moving to the next part of the body and continuing If thoughts wander, gently bringing awareness back At end, inviting awareness of the entire body Releasing the focus and returning attention to surroundings Participants Quotes Well, in general I realized that meditation really helps with my back pain in general. Not just the low back pain, I have other back pain, neck pain and it's really interesting how it works you know. I am happy because now I am trying to do meditation every day, sometimes I can't but I am trying to do meditation before going to bed. And it's working for me. It's working for me. So I went in with an open mind and understanding that we are gonna learn how to meditate to cope up with pain. And when I got out of it, it was more than just the pain. We learnt to using it in life in general. Which is very good. It's not as bad as it was before because of the meditation, which is good. So that's why I made sure that I make this a part of my everyday life. Conclusion The body scan meditation is one of the mindfulness meditation methods taught in the OPTIMUM study that focuses on body sensations from the feet to the top of the head, as well as any thoughts or emotions that arise in relation to the section of body being focused on. It has the potential to increase awareness of maladaptive coping behaviors around pain which can lead to changes that decrease the experience of chronic low back pain.
