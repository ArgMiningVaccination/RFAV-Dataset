The time thatpeople wait for treatment is, however, the public's top concern about the NHSand the number waiting is a key performance indicator. 2 The total time a patient waits for treatment potentially comprises three main elements: Ioutpatients list: the time a patient waits from seeing the General Practitioner until they are seen at an outpatient clinic by a consultant orother health professional. At 31 March 2001, 284,000 patients had beenwaiting thirteen weeks or more for a first outpatient consultation; Iestablishing whether treatment is required: in some cases a consultant might require tests or diagnostic procedures to be carried out beforedetermining what treatment, if any, is required. Such tests may beconducted on the same day the patient attends the outpatient clinic, or maytake substantially longer; Iinpatients list: the time a patient waits from being placed on the inpatient waiting list for treatment until they are admitted to hospital as daycases orordinary admissions. At 31 March 2001, some 1,007,000 were waiting tobe admitted to hospital for treatment. Why we examined waiting lists 3 We examined waiting lists because: Iwaiting list and times statistics are a key measure of performance; Ithere has been considerable debate about the adequacy of waiting lists and times as a measure, the impact of initiatives to reduce waiting lists and whatwaiting list statistics actually indicate; and Iour examination provided an opportunity to identify good practice inwaiting list management. 4 The NHS Plan, published in July 2000, set challenging new targets for waiting times; and in June 2001 the Department re-emphasised that, building on thereduction in waiting lists, the NHS will move to cut waiting times for treatment.The Department recognises that, as part of achieving lower waiting times, itremains important that underlying waiting lists are accurate and managedeffectively and that the analyses and recommendations in the report continueto be relevant. The Department is currently considering a range of options,including how future waiting list data should be published.2summary and recommendationsINPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT WAITING IN THE NHS Conclusions What waiting lists include 5 There are some misconceptions about what is included in waiting list statistics: Ithere is no full, published outpatients waiting list. The published data include those patients who have been referred by a General Practitioner andhave been waiting more than 13 weeks to see a consultant for the first time.The list does not include second or subsequent outpatient appointments forthe same condition. If, for example, a patient is referred on to anotherconsultant, their wait is not counted. In 2000-01, second or subsequentattendances represented 72 per cent of all outpatient attendances. Ithe inpatient waiting list reports the number of patients awaiting a first admission for an elective procedure under the care of a consultant. As such, thereported figures have always excluded accidents and emergencies andpregnancies. Also never included were second and subsequent operations thatare part of a planned programme of treatment (such as the second of two hipreplacement operations) and operations carried out by staff other thanconsultants or carried out in outpatient clinics. In addition, the inpatient waitinglist has never included patients suspended temporarily from the list for personalreasons or on medical grounds. At 31 March 2001, this figure stood at 77,000. 6 In any event, to the patient, waiting time is more important than the numbers on the waiting list and the NHS Plan recognises this by placing a clear focus onhow long people wait to see a consultant or to be admitted for treatment. TheDepartment of Health has now set targets for the total waiting time from referralto treatment for cancer patients, and arrangements for monitoring total time arebeing put in place. The NHS does not calculate or monitor the total time thatother patients wait from seeing their General Practitioner to being treated. Inparticular, diagnostic tests may be required following an outpatientappointment before a decision can be taken on whether a patient requiresfurther treatment, but the time this takes is not currently covered in any of thepublished statistics. Although the base information is held on PatientAdministration Systems, the systems do not presently calculate and report forindividual patients or in aggregate how long the total wait is. Accuracy of national waiting lists 7 The system used to compile waiting list data aggregates information from trusts' Patient Administration Systems but we found that trusts are not completelyconsistent in what they include on waiting lists. At many trusts there was anabsence of, or variation in, effective validation procedures which meant thatthe data on the system could be out of date, and two trusts that we sampledused estimated data on their returns to the Department in one case becausetheir Patient Administration System had crashed. 8 The inherent risks and lack of complete reliability in the systems and procedures mean that we cannot assure ourselves as to the complete accuracyof NHS waiting lists. But the main problems we identified, in particulardeficiencies in validation procedures, lead us to the view that publishednumbers are likely to be overstated, specifically because validation tends toidentify significant numbers of people who should no longer be included onwaiting lists. These include people who have moved, died or no longer wanttreatment. The Department's main targets are now set in terms of waiting timesrather than numbers on the list. It is, therefore, questionable how muchresource should be devoted to making the waiting list more accurate. 3summary and recommendationsINPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT WAITING IN THE NHS Improving the management of NHS waiting lists 9 The Department regards waiting lists and waiting times as too long for many patients. At 31 March 2001, 246,000 people had been on the inpatient waitinglist for longer than 6 months and, of these, 42,000 had been on the list for morethan 12 months. In addition, there are large geographic inequalities. Forexample, in Dorset Health Authority 1.2 per cent of Trauma and Orthopaedicspatients had been on the waiting list six months or longer at 31 March 2001,compared to 52 per cent in Croydon Health Authority. 10 The Department of Health has made, and is making, concerted efforts to reduce waiting lists and waiting times ( Figure 1 ) and the Government is allocating significant resources to addressing the problem. Since March 1999 the inpatientlist has reduced by 66,000 and the outpatients over 13 week waiters by 172,000. 11 Building on this the NHS Plan (July 2000) set challenging targets to be met by the end of 2005, in particular a maximum waiting time for inpatients of sixmonths and outpatients a maximum wait of three months. Some of thedifficulties include, overcoming years of under investment, introducing newways of working so that various groups such as General Practitioners andconsultants work better together and with agencies outside the NHS, beingmore aligned to the needs of patients and better management of unpredictableevents, such as emergencies, to minimise any disruption to the electivetreatments planned for the same day. Against this background, the NHS Planrecognised that it will take fundamental and comprehensive reform to tacklethe problem of waiting for treatment. 12 Our report sets out some of the innovative ways in which trusts and others are working to tackle waiting lists and waiting times, including initiatives that helpGeneral Practitioners refer appropriate patients to consultants, ensure thatoutpatient clinics operate to optimal capacity, optimise the use of operatingtheatres, improve discharge arrangements and manage the process as a whole.Taken together with the additional funding allocated to the NHS, wider use ofthese initiatives could further improve the management of NHS waiting listsand times significantly. 13 One of the key difficulties in managing waiting lists is ensuring that, in accordance with NHS guidance, patients are treated in accordance withclinical need. Consultants decide the priority of each patient on the inpatientwaiting list, and what mix of cases to include in each theatre session. Forpractical reasons there needs to be some flexibility in the order in whichpatients are treated but it is inappropriate to operate on routine patients inpreference to those who require relatively more urgent treatment solely to meetwaiting list targets. The Department of Health has reinforced this message on anumber of occasions, including through guidance. 20 per cent of consultantsin our sample of three specialties told us, however, that in 1999-2000 theyfrequently treated patients in a different order to their clinical priority in orderto reduce their waiting list or to avoid patients waiting for more than the 18-month target. Initiatives to reduce waiting lists and times Iadditional funding for NHS trusts to reduce waiting lists, such as \u00a3737 million from 1998-99 to 2000-2001 Ia revised Patients' Charter in December 1998 which recognised the importance ofidentifying and responding to patients' needs Ithe publication of a range of guidance and best practice documents Ispecial teams such as the National Patients Access Team and the Waiting ListAction Team, and now the Task Force that visit trusts to identify solutions to waitinglist issues and spread best practice1 4summary and recommendationsINPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT WAITING IN THE NHS Keeping patients informed 14 The Department of Health recognises the importance of keeping patients informed about the time they can expect to spend on a waiting list, and iscommitted to introducing a booking system for all inpatient and outpatientappointments - the National Booked Admissions Programme which is aimingfor 100 per cent coverage by 2005. In the meantime there is more that theDepartment can do to ensure patients are kept informed about likely waitingtimes. 15 Other countries have introduced or are introducing initiatives to ensure that patients on waiting lists are kept well informed about waiting times. Forexample in Denmark, waiting times for each hospital for 25 common medicalproblems are available on the internet, including maximum waiting times forpatients on both the outpatient and inpatient waiting list. In Norway, patientscan review on the internet waiting times for selective surgery at each hospitalbefore deciding where to be treated. From January 2001 patients have had freechoice of hospital, and the Norwegian Patient Register is developing an internetinformation system which will show waiting times at individual hospitals forspecific treatments. The Department intends that NHS hospitals should alsoproduce and publish this type of information. Recommendations The Department of Health should: i In addition to focusing more on the time inpatients and outpatients wait for treatment, consider whether trusts should monitor and manage the total timepatients wait from seeing their General Practitioner to being admitted fortreatment as is now happening for cancer services. ii Ensure that all NHS trusts validate their inpatient and outpatient lists at least every six months and give trusts guidance and advice on how to resolveinconsistencies as to what treatments and categories of patients are included onwaiting lists. iii Conduct research into why different health authorities have different waiting times. iv Take action through the National Patients Access Team and the Access Task Force to encourage trusts to implement the best practices identified in Part 3 sothat waiting times and the likelihood of conflicts between clinical priorities andwaiting time targets can be reduced. v Review options for keeping patients better informed regarding the time that they can expect to wait, building on the improvements that will derive from thebooked admissions programme. Trust management should: vi Fully involve consultants and other healthcare professionals in formulating policy, setting waiting list targets and managing the workload to ensure that inthe vast majority of cases, patients are treated in accordance with their clinicalneed and within the waiting time targets set in the NHS Plan.
