Contracting & Non-Contracting Emergency Service Providers & Post-Stabilization Care Services for the MCE Population A. Emergency Services: Contractor must provide coverage of Emergency Services provided in hospital emergency rooms for Emergency Medical Conditions, and/or required Post-stabilization Care Services, regardless of whether the provider that furnishes the services is within the LIHP network for the MCE population. Contractor may not deny payment for treatment obtained when an MCE Enrollee had an Emergency Medical Condition, manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in any of the outcomes specified in 42 CFR 438.114 (a) of the definition of Emergency Medical Condition. Further, Contractor may not deny payment for treatment obtained when a representative of Contractor instructs the MCE Enrollee to seek Emergency Services. The attending emergency physician, or the provider actually treating the Enrollee, is responsible for determining when the Enrollee is sufficiently stabilized for transfer or discharge, and that determination is binding for coverage and payment. Contractor may not limit what constitutes an Emergency Medical Condition, using the prudent layperson standard on the basis of lists of diagnoses, or symptoms or refuse to cover Emergency Services that meet such standard. Out- of-network providers must, as a condition for receiving payment for Emergency Services, notify the LIHP program within 24 hours of registering/admitting the patient into the emergency room. Contractor Alameda County Health Care Services Agency Contract No. 11-15909- AL-01 Exhibit A, Attachment 8 PROVIDER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS Page 30 of 140 may pay for Emergency Services provided by out- of-network providers at 30 percent of the applicable regulatory fee-for-service rate under the State Plan (excluding any supplemental payments), except that, with respect to inpatient hospital services, Contractor may pay 30 percent of the applicable regional unweighted average of per diem rates paid to SPCP - contracted hospitals. The out- of-network provider must accept LIHP program payments made in accordance with this section as payment in full for services rendered, and the LIHP recipient may not be held liable for payment. B. Post-Stabilization Care Services: Post stabilization care services are covered and paid for in accordance with provisions set forth in STC 63 (f) Contractor may pay for Post-stabilization Care Services provided by out-of -network providers at 30 percent of the applicable regulatory fee-for- service rate under the State Plan (excluding any supplemental payments), except that, with respect to inpatient hospital services, Contractor may pay 30 percent of the applicable regional unweighted average of per diem rates paid to SPCP- contracted hospitals. The out- of-network provider must accept LIHP program payments made in accordance with this Provision as payment in full for services rendered, and the LIHP recipient may not be held liable for payment. Out- of-network providers must, as a condition for receiving payment for Post-stabilization Care Services, meet the approval protocols established by the LIHP program, which are subject to DHCS review. Contractor is financially responsible for Post-stabilization Care Services obtained within or outside the entity that are not pre-approved by a LIHP provider or other entity representative, but administered to maintain the Enrollee's stabilized condition within 1 hour of a request for p re- approval of further Post-stabilization Care Service, or under the following conditions: 1) The organization does not respond to a request for pre-approval within 1 hour; 2) The organization cannot be contacted; or 3) The organization representative and the treating physician cannot reach an agreement concerning the Enrollee's care and a LIHP physician is not available for consultation. In this situation, the organization must give the treating physician the opportunity to consult with a LIHP physician and the treating physician may continue with care of the patient until a physician is reached, or the following criteria is met: Alameda County Health Care Services Agency Contract No. 11-15909- AL-01 Exhibit A, Attachment 8 PROVIDER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS Page 31 of 140 a. A LIHP physician with privileges at the treating hospital assumes responsibility for the Enrollee's care; b. A LIHP physician assumes responsibility for the Enrollee's care through transfer; c. An organization representative and the treating physician reach an agreement concerning the Enrollee's care; or d. The Enrollee is discharged. Contractor may impose procedural requirements related to out-of-network providers' submission of claims and/or invoices (such as time limits) for out-of-network emergency and Post-stabilization Care Services. Such procedural requirements are subject to DHCS approval. Contractor must limit charges to Enrollees for Post-stabilization Care Services to an amount no greater than what the Contractor would charge the Enrollee if he or she had obtained services through the contracted network.

B. Enrollment - General Contractor has developed income eligibility standards which can be adjusted with a written notice pursuant to Exhibit A, Attachment 14, Enrollment and Disenrollment, Provision 1(C) and STC 58, and methodologies and procedures for making eligibility determinations and enrolling eligible individuals in the MCE and/or HCCI program as applicable.

Contractor is not required to determine an applicant's eligibility prior to placing the individual on a wait list. 1) If the Contractor employs a wait list for enrollment into an HCCI and/or MCE program, it must ensure outreach is conducted for those individuals on a wait list, for at least 6 months, to afford those individuals the opportunity to sign up for other programs if they are Alameda County Health Care Services Agency Contract No. 11-15909- AL-01 Exhibit A, Attachment 14 ENROLLMENT AND DISENROLLMENT Page 67 of 140 still seeking coverage.
