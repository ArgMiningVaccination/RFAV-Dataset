You might be wondering, how can we be sure that the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) will be safe? To start, this isn't the first time we've made a [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations). There are currently over 50 [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) covering 26 diseases used within the United States alone. Many of the candidate [COVID-19 vaccines](/learn/COVID-19_vaccines:_What_healthcare_providers_need_to_know) being tested right now are based on the ideas and technology used to make [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) that are already approved. This is how in the span of just a few months we've had so many [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) enter preclinical and clinical trials. Researchers are not starting from scratch. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (also called the FDA) in the United States has given specific guidelines to researchers on how to develop [COVID-19 vaccines](/learn/COVID-19_vaccines:_What_healthcare_providers_need_to_know). Once we have a candidate [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations), researchers subject that [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) to a gauntlet of animal and clinical trial tests, to ensure that it's both safe and effective. Researchers initially test candidate [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) on animals first in preclinical trials, and if testing goes well, the candidate [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) can begin human clinical trials, starting with Phase I, then Phase II, and finally Phase III. With each phase, more and more participants are recruited to be [vaccinated](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity) with the candidate [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations). Researchers want to test the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) in a large and diverse group of people, to make sure that it's safe and effective for the whole population. Researchers need to test the candidate [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) in people who differ in age, sex, race, and exisiting health status, like people who have [asthma](/learn/Asthma) or are pregnant. If a candidate [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) successfully passes Phase III clinical trials, that means researchers are very confident the [vaccine](/learn/Vaccinations) will be effective for everyone. As of October 1st, 2020, there are 10 [COVID-19 vaccines](/learn/COVID-19_vaccines:_What_healthcare_providers_need_to_know) currently in [Phase III trials](/learn/Development_of_the_COVID-19_vaccine), 13 in Phase II, 17 in Phase I, and 151 in preclinical trials. The [COVID-19 vaccines](/learn/COVID-19_vaccines:_What_healthcare_providers_need_to_know) have undergone extensive testing in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants. Candidate [vaccines](/learn/Vaccinations) have to go through both animal trials, and several human clinical trials before they are FDA-approved for [distribution](/learn/Pharmacodynamics:_Nursing_Pharmacology). The trials have shown that the vaccines are safe and effective at preventing [COVID-19](/learn/COVID-19:_Nursing). Common mild side effects of the vaccines include pain and swelling at the injection site, fever, fatigue, and [headache](/answers/covid-headache). Serious side effects are rare but have been reported in a very small number of people. The benefits of getting [vaccinated](/learn/Vaccination_and_herd_immunity) to protect against COVID-19 outweigh the potential risks of side effects.
