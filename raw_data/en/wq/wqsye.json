Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences (CUSOM MSBS) Program. I am delighted you are interested in our program and hope the information you find within our academic bullet in will help paint a picture of what we have to offer. Complet ing the CUSOM MSBS curriculum in a two -year period is a challenging experience; we are ready to guide you through the journey to enhance your application for health professional school. This path will not be easy, if you embrace the challenge you will be awarded with a Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences degree and most important, a valuable network. Your network will consist of faculty, staff, fellow students, MSBS alumni and those that enter the program after you. This network will support you thr oughout your professional career. It is up to you to make the most of this opportunity. As the full -time Program Director with over 10 years of experience helping pre -health students prepare for and succeed in the application process to professional school, I will be available to support you throughout the program and your application process. The MSBS program gives you the opportunity to enhance your application beyond letter grades. There are a variety of volunteer and shadowing opportunities, mission trips (foreign and domestic) and community service projects available to you. If you asked our students and staff to name one of the strongest characteristics of our program, you would hear one overwhelmingly popular response: family atmosphere. This does not only refer to the diversity or our student body but the experience of our outstanding staff and faculty. Our small class size allows you to receive personal attention from our staff and faculty members. The MSBS program is housed in the Leon Levine H all of Medical Sciences located on the Health Sciences Campus. The state of art Simulation Center, Anatomy Lab and Medical Library facility (also located in Leon Levine Hall) will ensure you receive hands on learning and access to thousands of medical jou rnals and full -text databases. We encourage you to maintain a healthy life balance while attending our program. As a MSBS student you will have access to all Campbell University recreational facilities, healthy dining options and school sponsored events. We look forward to helping you achieve your goals in our program that supports, academically prepares and provides you opportunities to gain the experience you need to be competitive for the future. I look forward to meeting you.

Ba ckground checks revealing prior O ffenses, even charges whi ch may h ave be en dismiss ed by the courts, could still result in c onsequences affecting accept ance into professional programs or employment oppor tuniti es. If a student is un able to pass background check r equirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements. In a ddition, and as such, they will be referred to the APPS commit tee for possible s anctions, up to, and including, dismiss al from the program. A stud ent with a ny Of fenses is encourag ed to contact the licensure boa rds in the state of inte nded pra ctice to e nsure the aforemention ed Offense will not inhibit the ability to obta in a m edical lic ense upon gra duation. All current or for mer students returning f rom an approve d extend ed period away from CUSOM, su ch as a Le ave of A bsence or an offer to r epeat an academic year, must notify CUSOM in wri ting of a ny Offens es, including d eferred adjudi cations, at least sixty (60) days prior to the a nticip ated return dat e.

Depending on the recommendation of the ad hoc committee, the student's acceptance may be rescinded. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy.

S hadowing experiences can be extremely valuable , and students may choos e to include these ex periences in their Curriculum Vitae or personal statement. Shadowing experiences can occur with CUSOM -appointe d clinical faculty memb ers or physicians not a ffiliate d with C USOM . Shadowing experiences do not occur as part of the stude nt's required CUSOM MSBS curriculum and d efined stru cture, supe rvision, feedback mechanisms, and medi cal-legal protections provide d by formal clinical training . Students choosing to engage in a shadowi ng experience ackno wledge they will do so while a dhering to the following principles: 1. Shadowing experiences are meant to be observational only and if any hands -on activity occurs with patients, this should be limited to patient examination only, approved by the patient and supervising physician, and MUST be repeated by the physician. To protect patients and students, students are not to perform any invasive procedures while on shadowing experiences, including but not limited to suturing, endotracheal intubation, performing arterial blood gas testing, or placing IV's, Foley catheters, or central lines or perform exams of the pelvic, breast, rectal and genitourinary systems. Students should not perform any osteopathic manipulation while on shadowing experiences. 33 2. Students are not protected by malp ractice insurance provided by Campbe ll Un iversity, Incorpora ted while engaged in physician shadowing experiences unless the experience is with a CUSOM- appointed faculty memb er. S tudents are required to let non- CUSOM ap pointed physicians they are shadowing know that th ey are not covered by malp ractice insurance provide d by Campbell University, Incorpor ated. 3. Students must follow all hospital system, facility, and ambul atory policies when engaging in any type of shadowing experience. Individual physicians chosen to shadow with may not be familiar with their facility or healthcare system pol icies so it is the student's respons ibility to make sure they review and compl y with any applicable pol icies. 4. Indivi dual physicians may not know the student's level of training and it is the refore the student's e thical and pr ofessional dut y to fully explain their lev el of tr aining. Shadowing with CUSOM Cl inical F aculty M embers 1. Students who desire to shadow CUS OM clinical faculty must arrange the e xperience on their own. 2. Students shadowing with CUSOM clinical faculty memb ers should wear their CUSOM n ame badge and proper attire as directed othe rwise by the clinician . 3. Students wishing to schedule a shadowing experience with a CUSOM clinical faculty memb er must submit the Shadowing Agreement Form , (available from the Office of Clinical Affairs) c ompleted in its entirety, to the Office of Clinical Affairs. 4. Students m ust sign the f orm a nd initial all required attestations. 5. The completed form must be submi tted to the Office of Clinical Affairs for review and approval at least two (2) weeks prior to the start of the requested shadowing e xperience. Shad owing with non-CUSOM Clinicians 1. Students who desire to shadow non-CUS OM clinicians must arrange the experience on their own. 2. These are non-CUSOM sanctioned experiences thus: a. CUSOM will not obta in affiliation agreements with the si tes in order to provide shadowing experiences. b. CUSOM will n ot provide the c linician or si te with any student records including, but not limited to, results of drug screens and backgro und checks, i mmuniz ation records, acade mic performance information or letters of recommendation. c. Students may not wear their CUSOM name tag. d. Students or the physician they are shadowi ng are not protected by malpractice insurance through Campbell University, Incorporated . 34 e. Students acknowl edge tha t Campbell Univ ersity, Incorpora ted will not be li able for a ny medi cal care or expenses if they a re injured or become ill during the clinical shadowing experience. They also release Campbell Univ ersity, In corpor ated f rom any li ability from any injury or illness which occ urs during the sha dowing e xperience. 3. Even if engaging in shadowing experiences with non-CUSOM clinicians or clinical sites, students must abide by all general guidelines noted previous ly in this doc ument. Violation of any conditions of this Shad owing Policy is handled as a professionalism issue and may be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion an d Standards (APPS) Committee. 5.2 Years 1 and 2 Curriculum The CUSOM MSBS curriculum focuses on students learning the fundamental principles of biomedical science during the first year and expanding upon this knowledge during the second year.

Academic Policies and Procedures 6.1 Advising and Tutoring 6.1.1 Advising and Faculty Access CUSOM believes strong academic counseling should provide students with excellent longitudinal guidance and support starting during the pre - matriculation phase and continuing through graduation. CUSOM's comprehensive academic counseling process includes a series of academic transition support activities, long -term, consistent mentorship from academic advisors, standardized exam preparation , the training and allocation of peer - tutors, learning enrichment programs, and targeted individual and group workshops through its Academic Center of Excellence (CUSOM ACE). Organizational Structure of the Academic Center of Excellence ( ACE ) CUSOM ACE, under the directorship of the two Assistant Deans for Academic Success and the support of an Executive Assistant, is responsible for the overall success of CUSOM MSBS students. CUSOM ACE manages academic support programs and learning services including, but not limited to peer -tutor program, study skill deve lopment workshops, behavioral counseling, individual academic coaching, faculty advising support, and an on-line student forum. The CUSOM ACE Blackboard community provide s additional platforms for disseminating information as well as promoting collaborati ve academic interactions. Academic Transition Activities CUSOM ACE lead s activities and programs designed to assist matriculating students develop study skills and techniques, which will assist them in achieving academic success. During Orientation and Semester 1, two study skill workshops discuss growth mindset, metacognition, spaced practice, interleaving learning, test-taking skills, and how to utilize an exam debrief for refining study skills. Additional academic skill refinement is followed up by individual consultation upon requests. Long- term, Consistent Mentorship from Academic Advisors The academic Advisor -Advisee relationship is one of an institutional representative providing insight or direction to a student about academic, professional, s cholarly, and career planning issues. The nature of this direction may be to inform, suggest, counsel, discipline, coach, mentor, or even teach. The CUSOM MSBS advising process ensures faculty are involved in student advising and establishing relationshi ps which create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue. The Advisor/Advisee 41 relationship will ensure consistent feedback regarding academic performance and direct the student to additional resources within the institution as needed. All advisors play an important role in identifying students experiencing academic, personal or behavioral health problems and providing them with referrals to CUSOM ACE for individual study skill coaching or to Behavioral Health Services for assessment and appropriate treatment. The Assistant Academic Officer for the MSBS program assign s academic advisors, with input and approval by the Academic Officer for the MSBS program , to each incoming CUSOM MSBS student. Such mentorship is typically carried out through both mandatory group and individual meetings. The frequency of meetings between students and their advisors during years 1 and 2 is as follows: During Semester 1 of Years 1 and 2, students meet with their academic advisors at least once individually, and once i n a group setting before and after Fall Break (4 meetings total). The purpose of these meetings is to provide the academic support to the students as they adjust to graduate school and prepare for professional programs . During Semester 2 , students are required to meet with their advisors at least once in a group setting. Additional individual meetings can be arranged based on needs. During each semester of Years 1 and 2, students will also have a Personalized Evaluation of Professional P rograms Candidacy (PEPPC) meeting with the Director of the MSBS Program , Assistant Director of the MSBS Program , Academic Officer s of the MSBS Program , and Faculty Advisor to provide additional support and counsel on applications to professional programs a nd assessment of candidate competitiveness and readiness for professional programs. In lieu of a PEPPC meeting, a Pre -Professional Committee Interview may be scheduled pending approval from the Director of the MSBS program . In addition to their role as specifically assigned academic advisors, faculty also meet with non -assigned students to provide additional help with course work. Faculty offer office hours individually and are available to students for any additional assistance. Scheduling may be done either directly with faculty, or through the appropriate administrative assistant. By matriculating into CUSOM MSBS , students agree that their grades will be shared with their faculty advisors in an effort to facilitate effective advising. 42 Enrichment and Intervention Support from the Academic Center of Excellence (ACE) Through collaboration with the Department of Behavioral Health, CUSOM ACE assists students, directly and indirectly, to achieve academic excellence. The two Assistant Deans for Academi c Success lead CUSOM ACE and provide counseling services for study skills, time management, test-taking skills, etc. directly to students in group settings or during one - on-one meetings. Individual meetings are scheduled based on need or according to the recommendation of Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee or the Dean's office. Students who receive a grade of 75% or less on any integrated exam are recommended to contact their academic advisor or CUSOM ACE for an individual mee ting. Meeting frequency is tailored to individual student needs based on academic performance, student requests, or recommendations of the ACE, faculty advisors, or the APPS Committee. Students who desire individual advising sessions can schedule additio nal meetings with their academic advisor or ACE at any time regardless of their academic performance. These meetings can be one -time only, weekly, or bi -weekly, whichever the students and CUSOM ACE directors deem appropriate. Recommendation to seek addit ional support from Behavioral Health when necessary is also an integral part of this process. To maximize the effectiveness of faculty academic advisor s, CUSOM ACE also organizes o r participates in faculty development sessions to facilitate discussion, share best practices, and offer useful tools for mentoring students. 6.1.2 CUSOM Peer- Tutor Program CUSOM ACE develops and manages additional academic support services through the CUSOM Peer -Tutor. The CUSOM Peer -Tutor program is designed to assist students requesting tutoring service to become more proficient in subject -specific materials and more effi cient and effective independent learners across a broad range of courses. Peer tutoring is intended to enhance, not replace, lecture attendance and personal study time. Tutors also act as facilitators for student learning, assisting with clarification of lecture and lab objectives, discussions, readings, or other assignments. CUSOM ACE identifies, trains, and appoints course -specific tutors. To become a certified tutor, students must meet the minimal academic requirements (ranking the top 25% of a speci fic course and maintaining a cumulative GPA 3.3), complete a Tutor Training Workshop provided by the ACE, and be approved by the Course Director(s). CUSOM MS BS-1 and MS BS-2 students who wish to receive peer - tutoring support place their requests by logging onto the Blackboard Class Community and complet ing a request form provided via a Wufoo link. The Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) will identify available certified peer -43 tutors who will then contact the tutees directly to arrange session(s) on a short - or long -term basis. The goal of tutoring sessions is to clarify and review concepts, explain processes, and assist in problem solving. The interactions between tutor and tutee are required to adhere to the rules of academic professionalism, confidentia lity, and honesty according to the CUSOM Honor Code. The most updated CUSOM Peer -Tutor Program manual is published on the ACE Blackboard Community page. As a student -centered institution, all CUSOM administrators are accessible to students when needed and based on availability. Administrative leadership also strives to conduct informal meetings with students on a regular basis, such as \"Coffee with the Dean\", meeting s of student small groups with the Dean and Associate Deans. In summary, academic advi sors, CUSOM Behavioral Health, the Academic Center for Excellence, faculty, Deans, and staff are available to discuss personal and academic problems that may arise throughout the four years of medical school, and provide guidance and/or referrals to other resources as necessary. 6.1.3 Academic Freedom Policy Faculty are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of his/her other academic duties; but research for pecuniary return must be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution in advance of the acceptance of employment. Faculty are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing his/her subject, but he/she should be careful not to introduce into his /her teaching controversial matter which has no relation to the subject. Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment. The University faculty member is a citizen, a member of a learned profession, and an officer of an educational institution. His/her primary loyalty is to his/her institution, his/her profession, and his/her growth and development as a scholar, a person, and a teacher. He/She possesses the right, as a citizen, to speak and write, subject to special obligations arising from his/her position as an employee of the University; to be accurate, to exercise proper restraint, to show respect for the opinions of others, and to make every effort to indicate that in his/her role as a citizen he/she is not an institutional spokesman. Moreover, he/she should allow for the fact that many members of the general public will find it difficult to disassociate his/her utterances as a citizen from his/her institutional identification. He/ She should not use official university stationery, logos, watermarks or his/her institutional title in issuing public statements which he/she makes purely in his/her role as a citizen. 44 Students and faculty may not represent themselves verbally, in print, or electronically (including use of Campbell University and/or CUSOM logos, titles, letterhead, or stationery) as representing Campbell University or CUSOM without the express written permission of the Dean. Failure to compl y may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 6.2 Assessment 6.2.1 Global Assessment Throughout the CUSOM MSBS curriculum, examinations and other assessments are administered to assess student knowledge and performance. Students are assessed to gauge satisfactory individual academic progress on the basis of performance on written and practical examinations, assig nments and projects . The Executive Director of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education, the Office of Clinical Affairs, the Office of Academic Affairs (including the Registrar), as well as the Office of the Dean, work collaboratively with the Acad emic Performance, Promotion, and Standards Committee (APPS) Committee to determine each individual student's eligibility for promotion or graduation, consider the results of the student assessments and reports concerning attendance, and monitor conduct and potential professionalism issues. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress are addressed through the processes described in this Academic Bulletin. For example, under certain circumstances, students may be brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee for disciplinary action or academic review, with recommendations made to the Dean for final adjudication. Assessment Outcome objectives have been mapped to the courses in which they are covered, and evaluation strategies are utilized to ensure that all CUSOM MSBS graduates achieve the intended learning outcomes. Assessment of knowledge is conducted by multiple -choice ex aminations and quizzes administered at scheduled intervals. 6.2.2 Credits, Grading, and Grade Point Average (GPA) Credit Assignment Process The Office of Academic Affairs is charged with ensuring the appropriateness of credit assignments within the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. Corresponding credits are assigned to all courses in the curriculum based on contact hours. 45 Credit assignments are reviewed as described below, and the credit assignments are consistent with the definition of a credit hour as provided in the glossary of the Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic of the CUSOM Dean's Council ), the CUSOM MSBS Curriculum Committee, and the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC) have reviewed the credit assignment process and CUSOM MSBS curriculum a s part of the institutional accreditation process. Campbell University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award associate, baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees. Contact the Southern Associ ation of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033- 4097 or call ( 404)-679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of Campbell University. Campbell University was awarded Level VI accreditation by the SACSCOC on May 29, 2013, at which time SACSCOC approved the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree program of CUSOM. The SACSCOC approval reads: \"The Boar d of Trustees of the Southern Asso ciation of Colleg es and Schools C ommission on Colleg es revie wed the materials seeking approval of the Do ctor of Osteopathic Med icine degree program. It was the decision of the Boa rd to appr ove the program and include it in the s cope of the curren t accreditation and to advance the institution to L evel VI.\" Campbell University is one of only four private universities in North Carolina to be awarded Level VI accreditation status by SACSCOC. CUSOM's integrated curricular approach utilizes biomedical science and clinical faculty to explain concepts and prepare students in a logical sequence to prepare students for the rigor and pace of a wide range of health professions programs . CUSOM MSBS C redit Cal culation The CUSOM MSBS curriculum utilizes a process by which course grades are determined per Semester of study with a designated number of weeks per Semester . For the first year of the curriculum, there are two semesters of study each of seventeen ( 17) weeks duration. For the sec ond year of the curriculum, there are two semesters of study, one of seventeen (17) weeks and one of sixteen (16) weeks duration. 46 CUSOM assigns grades to all credit -bearing courses, and credits for each course are determined based on contact hours utilizing 0.5 credit increments. A minimum number of contact hours per credit is delineated, and a course with contact hours not reaching the requirement for the next higher credit value is reported at the next lower credit value. For example, a 1.0 credit course requires 15 contact hours so a course of 10 contact hours would be assig ned a value of 0.5 credit, not 1.0 credit. This credit hour calculation is consistent with US Department of Education standards. Credit Re view Pr ocess CUSOM assigns the amount of credit awarded for student work, and the criteria utilized in this process conform to commonly accepted practices of higher education. CUSOM awards credits to course offerings based on delivery method and duration, utilizing standards endorsed by the American Association of Collegiate Registrar's and Admission Officers (AACRAO) , as well as the minimum Federal Financial Aid regulations. Review of the curriculum, including credits, is through the CUSOM MSBS Curriculum Committee, as well as the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC), as necessary. To ensure appropriateness and consistency, CUSOM reviews credit assignments for the curriculum periodically as part of the curricular design review process. The process includes, but is not limited to, review of current standards of higher education, precedent established by other Colleges/Schools of Osteopathic Medicine, and consistency with the CUSOM Mission . The records of review of the credit assignment as part of the overall curriculum review are maint ained in the Office of Academic Affairs. All proposed curricular changes, including minor and substantive changes, are brought to the Initial Review Committee (IRC), a subset of the Dean's Council , and also the full Curriculum Committee for review, consideration, discussion and approval. Minor changes include such matters as the addition/elimination of a course, modifications to an existing course, or minor changes to existing program requirements. Substantive changes are those that involve extensi ve new patterns of requirements for existing students, or those that have a significant impact on other programs within the University. For proposed non -substantive curricular changes in years 1 and 2, with minimal impact on other programs or on student r equirements, approval is required first through the Assistant Academic Officer and Course Directors, in consultation with the Assistant Dean for Curriculum, Associate Dean for 47 Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration, or the Vice Dean fo r Academic Affairs as necessary, the IRC, and finally by the MSBS Curriculum Committee. Upon approval at all levels, the proposed changes are then presented to the Dean for review and final approval. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) is the regional body for the accreditation of degree - granting higher education institutions in the Southern states. As such, any proposed CUSOM substantive changes also would be reported to SACSCOC per their requirements and in a timely manner. Grading CUSOM has developed and publicized a grading system, in keeping with the CUSOM Mission , to assess the progress of each student toward acquiring the competencies essential to professional in the healthcare field . Throughout both two years of the CUSOM MSBS curri culum, students must complete all required coursework with passing grades as published in this Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review. Additionally, CUSOM maintains longitudinal records marking the career tracks, choices, and achievements of graduates in a comprehensive assessment system. 48 CUSOM MSBS has adopted the following schema for determining letter grades: Grading Scale MSBS-1 and MSBS-2 Cours es Quality Points Other Grades A 90-100a 4.0 IC Incomplete B 80-89 3.0 W Withdraw C 70-79 2.0 C*b 70 2.0 F < 70 0.0 P 70 4.0 P*b 70 2.0 a The maximum percentage cannot ex ceed 100. Pe rcentage grades are rounded to t he tenth from 0.50 upw ards, th erefore 82.50 -82.99 = 83, while 82.49 = 82. b Denotes course was passed after successful r emediation of an initial failing grade. Incomplete (IC) and Withdrew (W) do not carry any quality points. Grade Point Average (GPA) , Quality Points and Class R ank A student's grade point average (GPA) is determined by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of graded hours attempted. Note that for purposes of GPA calculations, a grade of \"W\" is not included in \"graded hours attempted\". If a student has earned 227 quality points on 61 gra ded hours attempted, the grade point average would be 227/61 = 3.721. NOTE: \"F\" grades. A student who earned a grade of F initially and is eligible to remediate the course will have the grade reported as Incomplete (IC) on his/her transcript until the pr escribed remediation is attempted and a new grade is issued. The Registrar will report current IC grades to the appropriate Associate Dean at the time the IC is assigned. Once an IC grade has been officially changed to a letter grade on the transcript, t he Registrar will not retain a record of IC courses as part of the academic record. Students who fail to successfully remediate a grade of F will have failed the course and receive an F on the transcript. The highest grade that can be earned for a remedi ated course is 70%. The new grade, if remediated successfully, will have the letter grade C or P with an asterisk (C* or P*, respectively) associated with the course to reflect a repeated course on the transcript. The grade of C* represents a remediated, passed Graded course, and a P* represents a remedi ated, passed Pass -Fail course. 49 Quality Points Quality points are points assigned to grades in an academic \"banking\" system. CUSOM is on a four -point system. In this system, an \"A\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"P\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"B\" is worth three (3.0) points per hour, a \"C\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, a \"C*\" or \"P*\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, and zero (0) points awarded for \"F\" or failing grades. A s tudent who earns an \"A\" in a three - hour course has 4.0 points per hour x 3 hours = 12 total quality points. Incomplete (IC) and Withdraw (W), grades do not carry any quality points. Class Rank Students will be provided their class rank at the end of the first and second academic year. Class ranks are calculated after all final grades have been submitted at the end of each academic Semester , in Years One and Two. Class ranks are provided for informational purposes only and are only released to the student. Students who do not wish to receive information regarding their class rank may opt out of this notification by contacting the Registrar. The class rank has no direct correlation to the student's cumulative GPA. Final grades in all courses are calcul ated into the cumulative GPA throughout the two years. Class ranks are based solely upon the numerical grades earned in each course across Semesters 1 through 4. For example, two students could have a 4.00 GPA but one could be ranked number 1 and the other ranked number 6. The student ranked first achieved higher numerical grades in some courses (e.g., Student 1 earned a grade of 99% in Anatomy while Student 6 earned a grade of 93% in Anatomy). Class ranks are not reported on student transcripts ; how ever, higher class ranks may be identified on the Pre- Professional Committee Letter when applying to health professions programs . 6.2.3 Remediation Throughout the two years of the CUSOM M SBS curriculum, students must complete all required coursework with passing grades and other degree requirements as published in this Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum are brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion and St andards (APPS) Committee for review and possible disciplinary action. The APPS Committee may offer students who fail any part of the curriculum an opportunity for remediation. 50 A student in the first (MS BS-1) or second (MS BS-2) year of studies, who fails any course, will appear before the APPS Committee. If the Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remediation is complete. The student will receive a grade of C* for a gra ded course or P* for a Pass/Fail course after the successful remediation of the failed course. The C* or P* will remain on the transcript with the notation that the student passed after remediation. A student will earn a grade of F if not allowed remedia tion or if the student fails the remediation. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDIATE IS NOT GUARANTEED AND IS A DECISION MADE BY THE APPS COMMITTEE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. A STUDENT MUST NOT ASSUME HE/SHE WILL BE GRANTED REMEDIATION. 6.2.4 Grading for Years One and Two Eval uation Categories For the purposes of this Grading Policy, CUSOM MSBS recognizes five categories of evaluation modalities, including, but not limited to: 1. Written e xaminations 2. Quizzes 3. Assignments 4. Presentations 5. Other (e.g., Projects, In-class activities, Independent work ) Each category is represented within the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. A course grade can be determined by any combination of the components listed above as determined by the Course Director and approved by the Academic Officer . Process In an effort to promote faculty flexibility in assigning grades through assessment venues for the f ive categories identified above , yet also provide consistency across courses, CUSOM recognizes the following approach to testing and grading: Integrated written exams typically occur three to four times in each Semester in Years 1 & 2. Separate written exa ms are administered for Introduction to Biostatistics and Advanced Biostatistics. Journal Club I -II, Capstone Project I -II, Community Outreach, Professional Development, Clinical Experience, Introduction to Biostatistics, and Advanced Biostatistics are not included on the integrated exams. All other courses may have questions on integrated exams. 51 Integrated Quizzes are typically administered each Monday afternoon of the MS BS-1 and MS BS-2 curriculum. These are integrated and include questions from lectures given in the specified preceding week (s). Quizzes may be administered at other times as determined by respective faculty. Course grades are typically determined based on percentage of total points earned out of total points possible. Grades are defined by the course-grading plan approved prior to start of the course and delineated in the course syllabi . As su ch, bonus point s are not pe rmitted. In rare instances, there may be except ions to the establish ed Grading Policy, whi ch require jus tification for deviation from the original plan; however, every attempt is made to ensure the policy stated to the stude nts at the start of the course is the policy by which they will receive th eir course grades. 6.3 Educational Records 6.3.1 Policy Statement on Student Information and Educational Recor ds It is the policy of CUSOM to release certain directory information of CUSOM MSBS students in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA; 42 USCA 1232g, as amended). Under the provisions of this law, students in post -secondary education have the right to inspect and review their school records, as defined by law. Other than for \"Directory Information,\" see: www.campbell.e du/registrar/family-educat ion-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa/ Campbell University will release information only with the student's written consent or in compliance with federal law and regulation. The CUSOM Registrar's Office will maintain a locked fireproof cabinet in a secure, locked room for the safekeeping of all CUSOM MSBS student academic records. In addition, CUSOM has a secure, confidential, and onsite computeri zed record system with offsite secure network backup. All items entered into this system are retained as a part of the student's permanent record. The student's permanent record contains his/her transcript from CUSOM, transcripts and transcript evaluatio ns from other educational agencies attended by the student, secondary school transcripts, Standardized test scores, the student's application for admission, general correspondence with the student, and if applicable, letters concerning misconduct. Upon appointment with the Registrar, a student may examine their transcript and contents of their permanent record. University officials with access to the student's educational records are the President, Provost, Academic Deans, Registrar, Director of Student A ffairs, and designees of these University officials with a legitimate educational interest in the record. 52 Campbell University guarantees each student certain rights in compliance with FERPA. Please refer to the Annual Notification of health and safety emergency exception which states that the institution may disclose personally identifiable information from an education record to appropriate parties including parents in connection with an emergency if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health and safety of the student or other individuals. More information can be found at: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/s tudents.html 6.4 Attendance 6.4.1 Attendance Policy Attendance of first - and second- year students is expected at all lectures, and required at all labs and other scheduled curricular activities. Attendance will be monitored by the Assistant Director of the MSBS program, and electronic attendance records are maintained. Absences for emergencies are considered on a case- by-case basis through the Assistant Director of the MSBS program . Any falsification of attendance records is viewed as an Honor Code violation. Failure to maintain adequate attendance during the two years of the curriculum may result in corrective action through the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Violations of the attendance requirement policy may res ult in disciplinary action by the APPS Committee including, but not limited to, removal from any leadership position with a student club, organization or student government office, and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism issues in the student's record. In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. 6.4.2 MSBS-1 and MSBS-2 Years It is recognized there may be isolated instances when an individual must be absent; however, a student who misses a lec ture, laboratory or workshop is not excused from the subject materials or duties of that particular session(s) . The student may be required to make -up the missed educational session(s) during off-hours. Make -up laboratories are conducted only in extreme situations and at the discretion of the Course Director in consultation with the Academic Officers when necessary. 53 The total number of absences must not exceed 20% of a course. No excused absences are granted while the 20% threshold has not been reached. However, students who qualify for an excused absence will receive two -days, each of the two days with a 3 lecture hour allowance, 6 total lectures per Semester , not per course, to be used during the time -period noted in the excused absence request. This excused time allowance will be tracked but will not count towards their 20% threshold. A student may be eligible to request an excused absence through the Assistant Director of the MSBS program by meeting one of the following qualifying criteria: For a medical co ndition/illness, the student must provide the Assistant Director of the MSBS program with a note fr om the exa mining physician (who is NOT a f amily member) indicating the medical visit, the amount of recommended time -off, a nd the student's re turn-to-class dat e. For personal leave, unless it is emergent in nature, the absence request must be submitte d at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. Personal leave does not include vacations, weddings, graduations or other similar activities or events. Examples include: o Death in imme diate family stepparent , grandparen t, spouse, spous e's parent, child or siblin g. For Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. For attending CUSOM -related activities or national meetings of student clubs and organizations, an excused absence request must be submitted, in writing, to the Assistant Director of the MSBS program at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence(s). To be considered for such request, students must have a cumulative GPA 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, no prior course failures, and be in good academic standing. Students are allowed a maximum of two ( 2) excused absences per semester for voluntary attendance at conferences if all other excused absence criteria has been met. No travel arrangements should be made prior to approval being granted by t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program . CUSOM accept s no responsibility or liability for any losses as a consequence of any cancelled or delayed travel plans. Approved absences for students required to attend national conferences will not be subject the 20% rule; however, formal requests must be submitted for approval. Students may request an excused absence for religious holidays not included in the list of recognized University holidays. Appropriate documentation to support the request is required, and must be submitted for approval to t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program . 54 As there is no 20% allowance for mandatory laboratory (Anatomy) , student presentations (Journal Club I -II and Capstone Project I -II), workshops and other indicated activities that require active student participation and group activities as indicated in course syllabi and by the direction of the Course Director, a separate excused absence request must be completed and submitted to the Course Director and t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program . The same aforementioned crite ria outlined above apply. The Assistant Director of the MSBS program will notify the Course Director of the decision if approved. Approval must be granted and obtained in order to arrange a make -up with the Course Director. An unexcused absence from one of these activities may result in a grade of zero (0) or an overall grade deduction (refer to each specific course syllabus). In the event of any absence from an examination or quiz, approval must be obtained from t he Assistant Director of the MSBS progr am to arrange a make- up (approvals based upon the qualifying criteria detailed above). It is essential each student make every effort not to miss any examination or quiz. Requests for make -up examinations or quizzes must be made in a timely manner with t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program . An unexcused absence from an examination or quiz may result in a grade of zero (0) for that assessment. For an absence to be considered excused, students must notify t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program and complete the appropriate lecture or lab \"Excused Absence Request Form\" online. The Assistant Director of the MSBS program will determine if the excused absence is approved or denied, and the student will be notified of the decision in a timely manner . If a student is failing any course or has been placed on Academic Probation, he/she may not be approved for an excused absence unless for an extenuating situation determined o n a case -by-case basis. The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs will resolve any disagreement concerning an attendance decision. Once an absence request is approved, it is the student's responsibility to contact the Course Directors and the Assistant Director of the MSBS program to arrange a makeup for missed laboratories , course acti vities, or an examination/quiz where applicable. It is important to note that, although the Course Directors will do their best to accommodate the makeup requests, some missed experiences may not be replicable, and the arrangement is at the Course Directo rs' discretion. In the case in which a missed experience is not replicable, and therefore unable to be made up, the student may receive a zero (0) for that assessment, which may lead to an overall failing course grade. 55 Official Ho lidays CUSOM o bserves the f ollowing Univ ersity holidays. New Year 's Day Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Good Friday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor D ay Thanksgiving (2 Days) Christmas ( Varies) Holidays falling on a weekend will be observed either on the Friday before or the Monday after the holiday, or as designated by Campbell University. Jury Duty It is the duty of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called. If a CUSOM MSBS student is called to serve on a jury, or if a CUSOM MSBS student is ordered to appear in court as a witness, the student should submit the appropriate lecture and/or lab excused absence request as outlined above, and advise the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs as soon as possible. As noted above, in the cases of Jury Duty, the absence re quest and supporting documentation must be submitted to t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. Cons equences of Non-compliance of Attendance Policies As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. The Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee may consider non -compliance with the Attendance Policy by MSBS-1 and MS BS-2 students as a violation of CUSOM policy which may result in disciplina ry action. APPS Committee actions include, but are not limited to, loss of remedial privileges; removal from any leadership position with any student club, organization, or student government office; and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism in the student's record . In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. 6.4.3 Severe Weather P olicy If inclement weather results in changes to class schedules a message will be posted via the website at www.campbell.edu and Facebook, Twitter, and through the Campbell University inclement weather line : On cam pus: dial 5700 Local, but not on campus: di al (910)-814-5700 Long distance: 1-800-760-8980 then dial 5700 56 6.5 Dress C ode Policy Students must maintain a professional appearance and professional attire whenever on CUSOM grounds, including adjacent property at Campbell University and on all clinical experiences. Students must be pro fession ally dressed for a ll lectures, examinations, labo ratory classes, and workshops. Men must wear dress trousers, appropriate shoes and socks, dress shirt and necktie. Women are required to wear appropriate dresses or skirts of reasonable length for a professional setting (e.g., in the medical school or any clinical settings ) or slacks with appropriate blouses. Changing areas and lockers are provided for students to change into appropriate dress for Anatomy labs. A clean and well -cared -for appe arance should be maintained. The apparel and appearance of faculty, staff, and students project, in part, the image the community has of the University. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to be neat, well - groomed, and appropriately dressed for the work and study they do. The clothing selected should not be distracting to faculty, staff, or students. Hairstyles should be clean and ne at, avoiding extreme length, styles, or colors. Beards and mustaches must be neat and trimmed at all times. Excess ive body piercings are not acceptable. Shorts, jeans, sweatpants, and T -shirts are not permitted. R evealing or tight, form fitting clothing is unacce ptable. Hats (unless for religious reasons), caps, hoodies or sunglasses may not be worn during classes or examinations. Any student wearing a hat (unless for religious reasons), cap, hoodie, or sunglasses will be asked to remove it. Students who have tattoos m ust be aware that clinical sites may require they be covered at all times during clinical experiences . As such CUSOM encourages all students to cover their tattoos starting early on in their professional career while on -campus, and during clinical experiences . Students inappropriately dressed or groomed may be required to leave the campus and not return until appropriately attired. Any class or lab missed during this time will be considered an unexcused absence. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming shall be presented to the Office of Student Affairs, whose decision will be final. Repeated infractions may be considered a professionalism issue resulting in referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee. Additional Dres s Code Requirements: Certain educational experiences at CUSOM require a specific dress code. Th is include s the laboratory classes of Anatomy. 57 Anatomy Laboratory Dress C ode Lab coats are to be worn in the anatomy lab at all times. CUSOM provides, and launders lab coats and disposable latex -free gloves. It is recommended that the student wear scrubs or old clothes and shoes that can be discarded when the gross anatomy curriculum is over. Wear appropriate clothing and comfortable shoes. The lab is cool, so warm clothing is recommended. Close -toed shoes and long pants are required. Flip-flops, open- toed shoes, shorts and spaghetti -strap tops are not permitted. Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not perm itted in anatomy labs. Lockers are available in the locker rooms adjacent to the lab where students may store their gross anatomy lab clothes. Students must provide their own locks and leave all their personal belongings in a locker instead of stacking them in the fourth floor lobby outside the laboratory. Protective eyewear is suggested but not required (students provide own eyewear). Soft contact lenses are NOT recommended in the lab (they may absorb the chemicals used in the laboratory). 6.6 Academic Standing and Progress 6.6.1 Academic Standing and Academic Progress Academic Standing is defined as a student's status at any time within a given academic Semester of the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. A student who is in good academic standing is one with a passing grade in all courses at any given point in time. This information is used in determining eligibility for students to participate in CUSOM approved activities, such as conferen ces, student organizations, etc. Students wishing to serve as officers in clubs/organizations or participate in events, travel to meetings or other related activities must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale to be considered. Academic Progress for students in years 1 and 2 of the curriculum requires passing all courses in all Semesters , successfully completing all curricular requirements in the Semesters , and meeting the requirements as set forth by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for students, including those in a Modified Course of Study. Students must also demonstrate adequate development in professionalism as determined by the faculty and administration. 58 Students placed in a Modified Course of Study must agree to comply with the plan as deter mined by the APPS Committee. As long as the student is making satisfactory progress in the Modified Course of Study, they will remain in full - time status. Students who do not follow the Modified Course of Study, or who do not make satisfactory academic p rogress while in a Modified Course of Study, may be referred to the APPS Committee for additional required remediation, or additional sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. Second -year students should refer to S ection 6.9.1 of this Bulletin for further information regarding graduation requirements. Students not making satisfactory academic progress towards graduation will be referred to the APPS Committee for review and further recommendations, which may include but is not limited to, placement on a Modified Course of Study, Academic Probation or Dismissal from the program. 6.6.2 Modified Course of Study A Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as mandated board preparation, required remediation, illness, leave of absence, or withdrawal . The MCOS will be individually designed based upon the student's performance and needs by the respective Associate Dean and approved by the APPS Committee. Students in a MCOS must agree to, and comply with, the conditions and schedule of the MCOS . Students not following the MCOS may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not considered an active student) at any time. A student in a MCOS who does not adhere to the requirements and parameters of the MCOS may be referred to the APPS Committee for further action and may be placed on S uspension. 6.7 Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee The APPS Committee, in conjunction with the Office of Academic Affairs, monitors the academic progress achieved by all students throughout the entire CUSOM MSBS academic program. The APPS Committee meets at the end of any Semester to review students who have achieved a failing course grade, failed to successfully remediate a failed course, when a delay in a student's academic progress is identified, or when deemed necessary. The Chair of the APPS Committee or the appropriate Assoc iate Dean for the academic year involved may also call a meeting of the APPS Committee in cases where the academic progress of a student is affected by a leave of absence or other factors. 59 Additionally, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct (i.e., cheating or plagiarism), violations of the Honor Code or Code of Misconduct, or unprofessional conduct. Additional infor mation regarding these violations is found in Section s 6.10.2- 6.10.4 of this Bulletin - \"Honor Code, Code of Misconduct, and Grievance Procedures\". The APPS Committee is appointed by the Dean, and membership may be subject to change at any time. The Regi strar and Director of Student Affairs participate as voting members. A quorum is defined as a simple majority of the members. The committee Chair, with approval of the Dean, may invite non- voting members to attend. As APPS Committee meetings are conside red academic proceedings and not legal hearings , neither attorneys nor other representatives are allowed. 6.7.1 Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting Regarding Academic Performance APPS Committee meetings are held at the end of each Semester , after the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs has determined all grades, or as needed. Reasons for an APPS Committee hearing include, but are not limited to , if a student has: Failed a course Attempted and failed to remediate a course Failed to pa ss any course while on Acad emic Probation Failed to complete any degree or program requirements Violated the CUSOM Honor Code Violate d any CUSOM or Campbell Unive rsity policy/procedure or provision of this Bulletin Failed to make acade mic progress, or follow directives set forth, in an assigned remediation plan, or any Modified Course of Study Failed a c ontrolled substance screening test Received f indings on a criminal backg round check that would affect the student's matriculation or participation in clinical experiences Failed to adhere to set timelines/due dates Failed to respond in timely manner to email and other forms of communication from CUSOM. Upon initial review of a referral of a student to the APPS Committee, the Chair of the APPS Committee may determine an intermediary action, such as the student meeting with the appropriate Associate Dean or other designated individual, may be warranted in an effort to resolve the issue in lieu of an APPS Committee hearing. 60 6.7.2 APPS Committee Proced ures for Academic Performance Matters The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or designee, will Chair the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee have the following roles: The appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved reports on the academic progress of student(s), as necessary. The Associate Dean may submit a written or oral report documenting assistance the student has received or been offered, including but not limited to tutoring or advising. The Course Director, Department Chair, or the student's Faculty Advisor may be invited to an APPS Committee meeting to comment on student performance and related topics, as necessary. The Director of Student Affairs may report on documentation the Office of Student Affairs has which may be relevant to the student's academic progress. The Registrar is available to discuss the student's academic record if needed. The Director of the MSBS Program may report on documentation he/she has which may be relevant to the student's academic progress. The APPS Committee Chair shall identify a secretary to record minutes and to ensure all communications occur in a timely manner. Each student reviewed by the APPS Committee is provided the opportunity to make a maximum of a ten -minute presentation (no Power Points or handouts) relevant to an y issues or considerations that the student wish es to make known to the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee may then directly question the student. This is the only portion of the meeting at which the student may be physically present. In lieu of an in- person presentation, the student may be allowed to phone in to the APPS Committee meeting, and has the option to submit a written document, no more than two pages, single -spaced. These options are only available upon approval by the Chair of the APPS C ommittee, pending a valid reason for not presenting in person. All deliberations, minutes, findings, and recommendations of the APPS Committee functions remain confidential except where the student waives confidentiality or the release is required by law. For students failing to make academic progress including, but not limited to, multiple grades of IC in o ne Semester or across more than one Semester , failure of a course, or failure to successfully complete any curricular requirements, the APPS Committee may impose a sanction including, but not limited to , any combination of the following: Award a satisfactory grade (C*, P*, or PC*) and promotion to the next Semester following satisfactory remediation 61 Require remediation, further coursework, repeat of courses, or write a topic -specific paper Require the student to repeat multiple courses in which the student initially earned a failing grade Specify a timeline or manner in which any remediation must occur Place a student on a defined term of Academic Warning or Acade mic Probation Extend a student's term of Academic Warning or Acad emic Probation Remove a student from clubs/organizations or leadership roles Require more frequent meetings with CUSOM's Academic Center for Excellence or faculty advisors Request further assessment to verify the student has the ability to make satisfactory progress to ward graduation including but not limited to, psychological evaluations, controlled substance or alcohol screening/testing, or other evaluations. Such testing will be at the student's expense. Assign a Modified Course of Study which may delay promotion and graduation until satisfactory progress through a directed remediation program has occurred In addition to imposing the above sanctions for failure to make academic progress, the Committee may review student progress in order to remove students from Academic Warning, Academic Probation , or Suspension. The APPS Committee may also recommend to the Dean Suspension or Dismissal of a student from the program when the APPS Committee determines the student is unable to make academic progress due to, but not limited to , any combination of the following: Failure of two or more courses in any Semester in Years 1 and 2 of the curriculum Failure of three or more total courses in Years 1 and 2 of the curriculum Failure of any course while i n a Modified Course of Study Failure of any course while on Academic Probation Any other issues deemed relevant. The APPS Committee Chair will notify the student in writing of the outcome of the APPS Committee meeting and any applicable sanctions as soon as practical. Upon rec eipt of notification, the student must sign a Notice of Decision either accepting the terms of the decision, or signing the Notice of Decision to appeal the decision, within the timeframe defined in the Notice of Decision. An appeal of the APPS Committee decision by the student must be made in writing to the Dean within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of notification and be based only upon new and relevant information not available to the APPS Committee at the time of the hearing. The Dean will reply w ithin fourteen (14) 62 calendar days of receiving the written appeal. If the student does not appeal within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of notification, the APPS Committee decision is final. An appeal not received in the Office of the Dean by 5:00pm Eastern seven (7) calendar days after receipt of notification will not be considered, and the decision of the APPS Committee will be considered final. The Dean does not meet with the student prior to receiving the required written appeal material, and the student must make no attempt to meet with the Dean immediately prior to the APPS Committee meeting or between the date of the APPS Committee meeting and the date of any potential appeal hearing. The Dean's decision is final. 6.7.3 Procedur es for N on-Academic Matters Allegations of misconduct may arise from an individual student, group of students, faculty member, or staff member. For issues arising from Honor Code, Code of Misconduct, or professionalism violations, the person(s) identifying the issue(s ) should report the issue(s) to the Director of Student Affairs or the respective Associate Dean (Biomedical or Clinical) within seven (7) calendar days of the incident. The Director of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean will collect documentati on which may be relevant to the alleged violation. This may include, but is not limited to, a written report from the student(s), faculty or staff involved with the incident(s). In the case where students are reporting the suspected violation, unless required at a hearing, waived by the subject(s) of the alleged violation, or required by law, confidentiality of the reporting student is maintained, and the Director of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean will present the reporting student's testimo ny. Dated notes are taken to describe the discussion. The Director of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean, notifies the Associate Dean for Clinical Integration of the suspected misconduct or violation and provides him/her with a detailed summary of the reason for referral along with all supporting documentation. The Associate Dean for Clinical Integration then, (i) constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the suspected misconduct, who reports their findings in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Committee. 63 6.7.4 Rights of the Student / R esponde nt With respect to a hearing regarding academic misconduct, an alleged violation of the student Honor Code, or the Code of Misconduct, and/or professionalism standards, the Student / Respondent(s) is guaranteed the right to: a timely hearing, if requested receive notice of the allegation(s) at least three (3) days prior to the hearing a presumption of innocence until proven guilty solicit advice expect the case to be adjudicated in a confidential manner appeal the decision to the Dean 6.7.5 Ad hoc Comm ittee Proced ures If referred to an ad hoc Committee, the Chair of the ad hoc Committee will schedule a hearing with the ad hoc Committee and notify the accused student(s) (the \"Respondent\") at least three (3) days prior to the hearing. This hearing typically is held as soon as practical following the referral of the case to the ad hoc Committee. The Respondent(s) shall meet with the ad hoc Committee an d be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to explain him/herself and offer any mitigating factors. Although the hearing's purpose is fact -finding, the Respondent(s) shall have the right to offer witnesses to support his/her position. All sessions of the ad hoc Committee are closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. No legal counsel shall be present, as this is not a legal proceeding. All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case.

The Dean's decision is final. 6.7.8 Special Meet ings of the APPS Committee The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who is returning from an approved extended leave or Suspension to determine where the student will resume the program and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. 6.8 Separation from the Program 6.8.1 Separation from CUSOM There are four (4) categories of separation from CUSOM: Leave of Absence Withdrawal Suspension Dismissal The Dean makes all final decisions regarding any separation from CUSOM. All current or former students returning from an approved period away from CUSOM MSBS , such as, but not limited to, a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, minimally must submit a completed Secondary Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a medical or psychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. A subset of the Admissions Committee, consisting of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance. 69 Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will ne ed to re -apply through PostBacCAS and will not be guaranteed re -admission. In order to return from any approved separation, the student must provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved separation. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved separation to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curricu lum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the MSBS curriculum and training required to be successful and completed all degree requirements . 6.8.2 Leave of Absence A Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean. A leave of absence is a temporary separation from CUSOM which may not last longer than 180 calendar days. Reasons for a leave includ e, but are not limited to, academic, personal, medical, and maternity. If a leave exceeds beyond 180 calendar days, it will become a Withdrawal. A Leave of Absence is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Director of Student Affairs, who then provides it to the Dean. A Leave of Absence request must also include an anticipated date of return. The Dean in turn makes the f inal determination on the Leave of Absence request. A Leave of Absence request requires completion of a Leave of Absence form and may or may not require the return of CUSOM issued items depending upon the specific circumstances of the Leave of Absence. The date for a Leave of Absence is the date of the Dean's approval of the Leave of Absence request. 6.8.3 Academic Leave of Absence An Academic Leave of Absence is a unique situation, usually of a one -year duration, which allows students to pursue a research opportunity or complete a one -year post -secondary degree. Upon completion of this additional educational, experiential activity or scholarly pursuit, the student minimally must submit a compl eted Seconda ry Appli cation, Background Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date. 70 In order to return from any approved Academic Leave of Absence, the student must provide doc umen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Academic Leave of Absence and an anticipated date of return. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved Academic Leave of Absence to determ ine where the student will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific poi nt in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the MSBS curriculum and training required to be successful and completed all degree requirements . Students who do no t return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throu gh PostBacCAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. 6.8.4 Personal L eave of Absence A Personal Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean and may not last longer than 180 calendar days. A Personal Leave of Absence is available to address situations such as a death of a spouse, child, or such other circumstance that would interrupt a student's education. In order to return from any approved Personal Leave of Absence, the student must provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Personal Leave of Absence , including an anticipated date of return . Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved separation to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the MSBS curriculum and training required to be successful and completed all degree requirements . Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re -apply through PostBacCAS and will not be guaranteed re -admission. 71 6.8.5 Med ical Leave of Absence (Absence Less than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good academic standing, who provide acceptable supporting documentation indicating a valid medical reason requiring a leave of less than 180 calendar days and an anticipated date of return . Decisions regarding the granting of a medical leave are determined by the Dean. A Medical Leave of Absence may last no longer than 180 calendar days, if the leave extends beyond 180 calendar days it will automatically become a Medical Withdrawal as described below . In order to return from an approved medical leave, the student must provide the Dean with documentation from a physician approving/releasing the student to return as a full -time student in the curriculum. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved medical leave to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curr iculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the MSBS curriculum and training required to be successful and completed all degree requirements . Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re -apply through PostBacCAS and will not be guaranteed re -admission. 6.8.6 Student Maternity Leave of Absence CUSOM adheres to, and follows, federal guidelines for granting leave for students who give birth while enrolled in the curriculum. A Student Maternity Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good ac ademic standing, who provide acceptable supporting documentation indicating a clearance from her treating physician to return and an expected date of return to CUSOM on a full -time, unrestricted basis. Decisions regarding the granting of a maternity leave are determined by the Dean. A Student Maternity Leave of Absence extending more than 180 calendar days will require the student to file for request a Medical Withdrawal. The student will meet with the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS BS- 1 and MSBS-2) and the Director of Student Affairs at the earliest available time to discuss t he anticipated maternity leave. The student will provide the Director of Student Affairs a proposed timeline of requested leave. 72 The student will provide a medical note from her medical provider with an anticipated return -to-school date. This date should be the date when the student is medically cleared to resume all activities of the curriculum as a full -time student, with no restrictions. If the treating physician pla ces an activity or time restriction on the student, the nature of the restriction(s) and the time frame for these restrictions must be well defined. Based on the date or return to full -time status, the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs ( MSBS-1 and MSBS-2 students ) will develop a proposed Modified Schedule. The student will meet with the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS BS- 1 and MSBS-2) and the Director of Student Affairs to review and discuss the proposed Modified Schedule. The student will s ign the Attestation section after any additional changes are made and agreed upon by all parties. The student will provide medical documentation to the Director of Student Affairs from her medical provider documenting full medical clearance for return, including a definitive date of return. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS BS-1 and MSBS-2), will contact and inform the Course Directors and the Assistant Academic Officer for the MSBS program for the affected courses of the Modified Schedule. The Director of Student Affairs will notify the Chief of Operations of the Modified Schedule. 6.8.7 Parental Leave of Absence CUSOM adheres to, and follows, federal guidelines for granting leave for students whose significant other gives birth, while enrolled in the curriculum. A Parental Leave of Absence may be granted on a case- by-case basis. Students requesting a parental leave of absence must be in good academic standing and provide appropriate do cumentation. A Parental Leave of Absence may be up to four (4) weeks for non- birth parents following the birth, or adoption, of a child. The student will meet with the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS BS- 1 & MS BS-2) and the Director of Student Af fairs at the earliest available time to discuss the anticipated Student Maternity/Paternity Leave. The student provides the Director of Student Affairs a proposed timeline of the requested leave. Once the anticipated dates of the leave are determined, th e student will complete the CUSOM Leave of Absence Request and obtain the necessary signatures 73 prior to the final signature from the Dean. The student must meet with the Registrar, the Assistant Director of Financial Aid, and the Campbell University Busin ess Office. The Office of Student Affairs will notify the entities listed below of the Leave of Ab sence and provide a copy of the approved signed Leave of Absence form. Registrar's Office Financial Aid Office Following the birth or adoption, the non- birth parent will provide the Office of Student Affairs with an anticipated return -to-school date. Once an anticipated return date is identified, the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs for MS BS-1 & MS BS-2 students will develop a proposed Modified Schedule. The student will meet with the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS -1 & MS -2) and the Director of Student Affairs to review and discuss the proposed Modified Schedule. The student will sign the Attestation section after any additional chang es are made and agreed upon by all parties. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS BS-1 & MS BS-2) will contact and inform the Course Directors and the Assistant Academic Officer for the MSBS program for the affected courses of the Modified Schedule. The Director of Student Affairs will notify the Chief of Operations of the Modified Schedule. 6.8.8 Withdrawal Withdrawal from CUSOM is granted by the Dean. A Withdrawal may be a temporary separation from CUSOM , which m ay last longer than 180 calen dar days or permanent separation from CUSOM. Reasons for a withdrawal include, but are not limited to, personal and medical. Any request for Withdrawal must be completed prior to beginning the first final course assessment (e.g., exam) of a Semester . This would include courses ending earlier than other courses in a Semester (e.g., a student would need to withdraw before completing the Biostatistics Final, which typically ends prior to the last integrated exam of the Semester ). Failure to withdraw by this d ate may result in issuance of a grade of F for all courses in that Semester , which will be recorded on the student's transcript and adversely affect the student's GPA. A student may not withdraw if a grade h as been assigne d or if a final examination or a ssessment event has been st arted. Withdrawal from a course after an examination has been administered will result in the final grade being the grade of record. As such, a Withdra wal cannot remove a grade of F. 74 A Withdr awal is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Director of Student Affairs, who then provides it to the Dean. The Dean in turn makes the final determination on the Withdrawal request. The student must comple te and return a Withdrawal Form and any designated CUSOM issued items to the Office of Student Affairs b efore the stu dent wi ll be conside red Withdrawn in Good S tanding. The date for a Withdr awal is the d ate of the Dean's approval of the W ithdrawal request. The Dean makes the final decision regarding Withdrawals. Students who discontinue their education at CUSOM MSBS , for any reason, are required to complete a Withdrawal Form. Upon receipt of the completed Withdrawal Form and CUSOM issued items, the student is Withdrawn in Good Standing f rom CUSOM and entitled to certain benefits, i.e., application for readm ission or issuance of an official transcript if requested. Students on S uspension may not withdraw. Students eligible to r eturn from a Withdrawal f rom CUSOM MSBS , minimally must submit a comple ted Backg round Check and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requiremen ts, such as a medical or p sychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deem ed appropriate. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal may be required to provide the Dean with doc umen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Withdrawal. A subset of the Admissions Committee, consisting of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance. Once approved for re turn, the APPS Com mittee will determine pla cement of the student in the c urriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is r equired. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropri ate continuum of the MSBS curriculum and training required to be successful and completed all degree requirements . NOTE: Althoug h dif ferent ca tegories of W ithdraw al are identified, the student transcript will r eflect a \"W\" for any approved Withdrawal. 75 6.8.9 Personal Wit hdrawal A Personal Withdrawal will be granted to students who wish to voluntarily leave CUSOM for personal reasons. Students withdrawing from CUSOM MSBS for personal reasons are not guaranteed re -admission. To be deemed Withdrawn in Good Standing, the student must have passed all classes and be in good academic standing, complete all required paperwork and follow all CUSOM procedures during the withdrawal process. Students eligible to return from a Personal Withdrawal may be required to provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved withdrawal. A subset of the Admissions Committee, consisting of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of the student in the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to re sume a specif ic point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropri ate continuum of the MSBS curriculum and training required to be successful and completed all degree requirements . 6.8.10 Med ical Withdrawal (Absence Greater than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Withdrawal may be granted to students who are in good academic standing and who have an approved medical reason for a medical leave of absence that exceeds 180 calendar days. A student returning from an approved Medical Withdrawal m inimally must submit a completed Secondary Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, suc h as a medical or psychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. In order to return from an approved Medical Withdrawal, the student must also provide the Dean with documentation from a physician approving/releasing the student to return as a full -time student in the curriculum. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved medical leave to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and to determ ine if any additional action or 76 supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the MSBS curriculum and training required to be successful and completed all degree requirements . Student s who do not return on the approved date, or othe rwise do not fulfill all of the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throu gh PostBacCAS and will not be g uaranteed re-admission. 6.8.11 Suspension Suspension is defined as a tempo rary separation from the institution and during this period students are enrolled, not registered and are not eligible for financial aid . The duration of the Suspension will be determined by the Dean and ma y inclu de recom mendations from the APPS Com mittee. While on Suspension, stude nts must not represent thems elves as CUSOM MSBS students. In addition, they may not be on the University campus or affiliated clinical campuses. Studen ts on S uspension are not eligible to Withdraw. If the terms set out unde r the Suspension are not fulfil led, or the p eriod of Suspension is greater than 180 calen dar days, the student will be dismissed from CUSOM MSBS . 6.8.12 Dismissal Dismis sal from CUSOM MSBS is based upon recommendations made by the APPS Com mittee, with fina l app roval for dis missal by the Dean. 6.9 Graduation 6.9.1 Graduation Requirements The degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences is granted to, and conferred upon, candidates who: Have satisfied all academic requirements, and completed the total number of credits required for their class as calculated at the time of graduation; Have demonstrated good moral, professional, and ethical character; Completed all required exit paperwork and settled all financial obligations with CUSOM, Campbell University and affiliate and collaborative partners incurred during the acade mic program. 77 To become eligible for graduation, each student must successfully complete all the above requirements within four (4 ) years following matriculation. The four (4) years allow for the completion of a Modified Course of Study due to medical, academic, behavioral or other leave of absence. The Dean may, in exceptional circumstances, grant an extension to this 4- year rule. Professional and ethical competence is required for graduation. Students must demonstrate the ethical and professional qualities deemed necessary for professional success. Students may be dismissed from CUSOM if any of these competencies are not met. In addition, the revocation of the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences degree may occur following graduation for discovered misconduct of prior students. Allegations of misconduct, which may result in a revocation of a granted degree, are considered by the Dean. A student must complete all curricular requirements at CUSOM MSBS , or a minimum of two (2) years at CUSOM and another institution accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), between the date of matriculation and graduation. A CUSOM MSBS student must complete to the satisfaction of the faculty, as determined by the individual C ourse Directors and through the APPS Committee, all prescribed courses and degree requirements to graduate. The Dean makes the determination on any student appeals of APPS Committee or Vice Dean recommendations, b ased solely upon new and meaningful information not available to the APPS Committee or Vice Dean at the time of the initial hearing and deliberation. Students must meet with the Assistant Director of Financial Aid and Registrar to complete all required ex it documentation in order to receive a diploma. CUSOM MSBS students must also attend the exit process and commencement program in order to receive a diploma. Upon passage of coursework , and all other requirements as delineated in this Academic Bulletin, the Faculty of CUSOM, through the Dean and President, recommends degree candidates to the Board of Trustees. Upon approval of the recommendation, the Board of Trustees confers the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences degree on students successfully completing all requirements for graduation. 78 6.9.2 Delayed Graduation Policy If a student is suspended, takes a Leave of Absence, or is required to retake courses in the curriculum as a result of specific course failures or a deficiency in overall academic performance, the student will be placed in a Modified Course of Study (MCOS). As discussed in Section 6.6.2 of this Academic Bulletin, a Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as required remediation, illness, leaves of absence, or withdrawals. The inst itution of a MCOS will result in a delay in the scheduling and completion of a student's graduation date. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education -based financial aid. Specific counseling and advice should be sought from the CUSOM Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid for these or other indicated situations. 6.10 Student Conduct 6.10.1 Student Conduct All CUSOM MSBS students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner at all times. Establishing and maintaining the highest concepts of honor and personal integrity during graduate school is critical to future success as healthcare profession als. It is the responsibility of the student to support the standards of student conduct and it is reasonable to expect this of all students attending CUSOM MSBS . All CUSOM MSBS students have the rights and obligations of other citizens and measure the u rgency of these obligations in the light of responsibilities to colleagues, to their profession, and to the institution. When CUSOM MSBS students speak or act as private citizens, they must avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their School or the University. As such, they should not identify themselves as CUSOM MSBS students when posting comments or material on websites, social media, or other forms of communication without the express permission of the Dean. As citizens engaged in a profession which depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, students have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom. 79 Student Statement of Professional Ethics As a CUSOM MSBS student, I will... Be guided by a deep c onviction of the w orth and dignity of all human life; Pursue the a dvancem ent of knowl edge and recognize the special responsibilitie s placed u pon m e; Adhere to the policies and procedures of CUSOM in all matters; Seek and communicate truth; Promote scholarly compe tence and integrity; Practice intellectual honesty; Uphold scholarly and ethical st andards; Demonstrate respect for peers, faculty, staff, administration and the community in general; Foster hone st acade mic conduc t and ensure student evaluations reflect the stude nt's true merit; Promote appropriate interaction between students and facul ty, stude nts and administr ation, and students and st aff; Avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment; Respect and defend the free inqui ry of associates' exchange of ideas and sh ow respect for the opinions of others; Give due regard to the paramount responsibilitie s within the institution in de termining the amount and character of work done outside it. Respect for Patients CUSOM takes the utmost care to ensure patient respect and confidentiality. As MSBS students, students must demonstrate respect for patients through appropriate language and behavior, including that which is non- threatening and non- judgmental. This respect extends to interactions during all required and volunteer clinical experiences . In order to maintain professional relationships with patients and their families, patient privacy and modesty will be respected during history taking, physical examinations, and any other contact. It is critical for students to be truthful and not intent ionally mislead or give false information. Students should avoid disclosing information to a patient which only the patient's physician should reveal. Students should always, or at the request of the patient, consult more experienced members of the medic al team regarding patient care. 80 Respect for Faculty, Staff, Colleagues, Hospital Personnel, and Community Students will respect faculty, staff, colleagues, and others, including hospital personnel, guests, and members of the general public. This respect should be demonstrated by punctuality in relationships with peers, prompt execution of reasonable instructions, and deference to those with superior knowledge, experience or capabilities. Students should express views in a calm and respectful mann er when in disagreement with another individual, understanding that a mutual agreement will not always be reached. Respect for Self All students should uphold a high level of personal ethics, beliefs, and morals in their daily conduct. Respect for Laws, Policies and Regulations Students must respect and obey the laws, policies, and regulations at all levels of the University and the local community, state and federal government. 6.10.2 Honor Code The Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine Honor Code of Conduct (CUSOM Honor Code) embodies a spirit of mutual trust, intellectual honesty, and professionalism between the School and the student body, and it is the highest expression of the values shared by the CUSOM and Campbell University communities. The CUSOM Honor Code is based on the fundamental belief that every student is worthy of trust and it is maintained to protect the right to participate in an academic environment free from injustice caused by dishonesty. Furthe r, CUSOM MSBS students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner. Students have an obligation to maintain the highest standards of honesty and integrity. It is not possible to enumerate all examples of expected academic and professional behavior, nor is it possible to enumerate all behaviors considered inappropriate, unprofessional, unethical, or not in keeping with the standards of a CUSOM MSBS student. The following serves only as a guideline to students. In general, the founding principles of the CUSOM Honor Code are the established rules and regulations of the CUSOM community. The CUSOM community includes CUSOM, affiliated hospitals, and any institution where CUSOM MSBS students pursue activities for academic credit. V iolation of these rules and regulations may constitute a violation of the CUSOM Honor Code. In addition, specific examples of behavior which may constitute a 81 violation of the CUSOM Honor Code include, but are not limited to, the following: Cheating: Providing , acquiring or receiving any unauthori zed assistance or unfair advantage on any form of academic work, or attempt thereof. Sharing inf ormation f rom testing/exams is also conside red a form of cheating. Plagiarism: Copying the language, structure, ideas, algorithms, or comput er code of another and representing it as one's own work on any form of academic work or attempt thereof. Falsification: Fabrication of information on a ny form of academic work or attempt the reof; including, but not limited to, the f ollowin g: o Clinical and community service requirements o Assignment s, projects, and presentations Disruptive Behavior : Any inappr opriate etiquette or inappr opriate disturbance either solely or repeated often enough oft en enough to establis h a disrespectful trend. Inappropri ate disturbances include but are not l imited to t he following: o Arriving late for class or lab o Disrupting class with cellular phone s o Disrupting class with c omput ers or c omput er games o Disrupting class with loud talking or other activities which create a distraction o Leaving trash in classrooms or academic areas, including student small g roup stu dy room s o Bringing food into unauthori zed areas or hosting food functions without pe rmissio n o Posting una pprove d materials or a pprove d mat erials in inappr opriate areas o Parking in inappropriate or reserved spa ces Unacceptable use of technolog y: Any violation of the acceptable use guidelines as publ ished by the CU SOM IT department or as noted in the Campbell University Technology Usage Policy: https://www.campbell.edu/information -technology - services/acceptable- use-policy/ In addition, unaccept able uses of technolog y include, but are not limited to, the following: o Using compute rs for pur poses which are conside red unprofessional or i mmoral o Accessi ng pornographic material at any time while on any campus of the CUSOM community or using any equipm ent of the CUSOM community to acc ess such m aterial o Distributing, posting, or uploading materials to students or any other third party not authorized to receive them or to those 82 outside CUSOM is an Honor Code violation. Lecture materials, includi ng PowerPoint presentations, and videos contain confide ntial and proprietary info rmation and material protected by intellectual p roperty laws. Students do not ha ve permission to sha re them. o Any device capable of capturing still or video images or audio recordings, including cell phones, are not permitted in any laboratory (anatomy, clinical skills, OMM, Simulation), or in any clinical setting, including and not limited to OSCE, standardized patients, clinical experiences , and the student health clinic. Unprofessional or unethical behavior : Behavior on or off the CUSOM campus that would or could cause a loss of respect or confidence in the offending stu dent or in the CUSOM community by the publ ic, faculty, staff, colleagues, or the-communi ty-at-large. Section 6.7.5 of th is Bulletin, \"Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee ; Ad hoc Committee Procedures \"\", describes the process for addressing cases related to allegations of misconduct or professionalism and/or Honor Code violations. In such cases, the Director of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean, notifies the Associate Dean for Clinical Integ ration of the suspected violation and provides him/her with a detailed summary of the reason for referral along with all supporting documentation. The Associate Dean for Clinical Integration then, (i) constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the sus pected misconduct, who reports their findings in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Committee. Unprofessional or unethical behavior may include, but is not limited to, the following: Entering or using the facilities of the CUS OM community without appropri ate authori zation or during inappropri ate times. Knowingly and purpos ely disrupt ing teaching, research, administrative, or student func tions of the CUSOM community. Abusive or disrespectful conduc t toward members of the faculty, administrative or pro fessional staff, employees, students, patients, or visitors of the CUSOM communi ty. Medical simulators should be treated with the same level of respect and professionalism as standardized or actual patients Disclosure of privil eged information from campus activities or patient care. Taking pictures or recording video in the anatomy lab, clinical lab, OSCE rooms, or in any rooms housing clinical simulators. Impro per relationships or activities invol ving persons entrusted to a student as part of educational requirements, which extend beyond those 83 educational requirements. Entrusted persons may inclu de, but are not limited to, patients or othe r stude nts unde r supervisio n. Controlled substance screening tests which show abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively dilute urine, or screening tests which are positive (i.e., evidence of the substance or showing presence) for alcohol, pres cription medications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina. Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. For example, al though the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to patients . o As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University pol icy. Anothe r example is a breathalyzer result or a blood alcohol concentr ation sample identi fying lev els of alcohol above the legal limit in violation of law, such as in a Driving Und er the Influence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), or a similar charge. The presence of these subs tances, regardless of any legal conside rations or adjudi cation by the courts, is c onside red unp rofessional or u nethical behavior by CUSOM. Breach of Integrity: Any behavior at any time that is conside red a severe lapse in judgment and has the potential to damage the professional, ethical or moral integrity of the CUSOM community. A violation of any policy of the Univ ersity or CUSOM, including but not limited to the merican Osteopathic Asso ciation Code of E Miscon duct Violations may include , but are not limited to: Harassment (other than a violation of the Title IX Policy), harm, a buse, or damage to any person or prope rty in the CUSOM community. This include s know ingly or purp osely ng damage to or va CUSOM c ommunity proper ty. Arrest for a crimin al offense othe r than a minor traffic offense. Participating in academic or clinical endeav ors in the CUSOM community while unde r the influ ence of alcohol, or c ontroll ed substances. Use, possession, or distribution of alcohol, illicit subst ances, prescription me dications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismiss al. Controll ed substances will be viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. Please note this include s substances which are illegal in the state of N orth Ca rolina, but which m ay be legal in other states. 84 Com municating or posting of information or images in a public arena, including w ritten or electroni c/Internet communications, which could result in a loss of re spect by patients or other memb ers of the public toward the offending student or tow ard CUSO M. Release of Information All documents and other information concerning student discipline, inclu ding w ritten reprim ands, are securely maintain ed in a confid ential file. Such actions become a part of the student 's permanent educat ion record but are only released at the written disc retion of the D ean. Ho wever, all disciplinary actions, with the exception of A dmonitions and Academic Warnings , are required to be reported o n the student record . 6.10.4 Grievance Processes Resolution and Grievance Proced ure CUSOM recognizes the need for students to voice grievances and to seek resolution to problems, disagreements with faculty/administrators, or interpretations of institutional policy. CUSOM also recognizes the responsibility of the student to express their concerns in a professional and ethical manner. Concerns may involve course grades other than a grade reviewed by the APPS Committee, promotion, behavioral issues, financial concerns or issues related to external (e.g. COCA, SACSCOC) accredit ation standards and procedures. This grievance process shall not be used to appeal or review violations of the Honor Code or an appeal from the APPS Committee final decision by the Dean or the APPS Committee. All grievances must be filed in writing to th e CUSOM Office of the Dean. All grievance material is securely maintained in the Dean's Office in a specific student/employee/faculty file as appropriate to the grievance. Each step of the Resolution and Grievance Procedure generally take fourteen (14) c alendar days to complete, unless otherwise noted. Extensions or waivers to this timeframe may be granted on a case -by-case basis. Notice of a request for an extension from a student must be submitted in writing to the Dean within ten (10) calendar days prior to the deadline. Decisions regarding the request for an extension shall be communicated to the student via letter within two (2) business days of receipt of the request for an extension. Likewise, if CUSOM needs to extend a deadline, the Office of t he Dean shall provide said notice ten (10) calendar days before the due date. 85 Grievance for Academic Re solutions and Appeals An individual concern of an academic nature should be first discussed with the immediate instructor and must be done in a professional manner. This concern generally includes those which arise from personal conflicts or actions taken against a student individually. For individual concerns, if resolution cannot be reached, the student may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal, in writing to the appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved. If resolution cannot be reached from the prior appeals, the student may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with a student if the appeal has not been presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. A concern over general course procedures or grading policies should be addressed through the Class President through the Curriculum Committee. If a resolution cannot be reached through the normal processes for an acceptabl e and reasonable request, the Class President may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved. If resolution cannot be reached from the prior appeals, the Class President may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with the Class President if the appeal has not been presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. Reminder : Course Assessment policies and test question challenges are not covered under student grievances. See course- specific syllabi for information regarding these issues. A concern over CUSOM policies and procedures should be addressed through the SGA President and the Director of Student Affairs. If through the normal processes for an acceptable and reasonable request, a resolution cannot be reached, the SGA President may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with the SGA President if the appeal has not been presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. If the concern is financial, or with other areas of CUSOM, the student should follow the appropriate chain of command as defined by the CUSOM Organizational Chart. 86 Grievance Proced ure for Harassment* or Discrimination Students who feel they are being discriminated against have the right to exercise the Grievance Procedure. Retaliation against any individual who files a grievance or participates in the grievance process is strictly prohibited. In the event a student or anyone who participated in the grievance process beli eves they have been subjected to retaliation, that individual may use the Harassment Grievance procedures listed below. Step One: The Resolution Process Students who meet the Technical Standards for admission to CUSOM, as described in this Academic Bulletin, and feel they are being discriminated against shall first meet with the Director of Student Affairs to explain their grievance.

The Director of Student Affairs shall keep a record of the grievance investigation, including all supporting documentation and a report of the findings. All material shall be filed as previously stated in this procedure. 87 Step Two: The Grievance Hearing Process If the student feels the informal resolution has not been successful, or disagrees with the informal resolution, he/she may request the Director of Student Affairs and the Dean to call a Grievance Hearing. The student has thirty (30) calendar days after receiving written notice of denial of the grievance to request such a hearing. The request must be in writing, signed b y the student, and include the following information: A clear and precise stat ement of the g rievance; A statement explaining how the action is discrimin atory or the decision unr easonable if it i s a denial of a requested accom modatio n; The n ame the r esponde nt pa rties (the p erson(s)) against whom the g rievance is filed); An explanation of each responde nt respons ible for the action or decision; The requested re medy; and Any request to bring a non-participating observer to the heari ng.

Neither party shall be entitled to have an attorney represent them at the hearing. Only the Chair shall be entitled to question any witness, and decide upon the relevancy of any evidence presented. Prior to convening the grievance hearing meeting, the Grievance Hearing Board shall be trained on the specific grievance hearing procedures relating to the individual grievance and will be provided with additional educational material as appropriate. Following this initial hearing and presentation, if additional information is needed to render a decision, the Grievance Hearing Board may recess for a period of not greater than fou rteen (14) calendar days. The Grievance Hearing Board, or the Director of Student Affairs at the request of the Grievance Hearing Board, shall conduct further investigation of the alleged grievances. The Grievance Hearing Board may, during this time, meet with CUSOM's legal counsel who has further expertise in the law regarding disabil ity and discrimination. The second meeting of the Grievance Hearing Board, which shall occur within fourteen (14) calendar days, shall be to further discuss the grievance, the investigation, the educational materials provided, and the advice of legal counsel.

Student Services 7.1 Student Health 7.1.1 Student Health CUSOM MSBS students are able to utilize the Campbell University Health Center for medical concerns; personal medical information is kept confidential, in compliance with all HIPAA regulations. Student Health Center office hours can be found on the health center website: https://www.campbe ll.edu/health-center/ All students are required to maintain health insurance coverage from matriculation through graduation. For medical emergencies and after -hours healthcare, students are encouraged to access appropriate care as warranted by their situation including local Urgent Care facilities, Emergency Departments and Emergency Medical Services. In an emergency, students should access EMS and the 911 dispatch s ystem. 7.1.2 Health Insurance All CUSOM MSBS students are required to have health insurance coverage. Before registration and before the beginning of class annually, all students must either provide proof of health insurance or purchase the health insurance made available through Campbell University. Any medical costs incurred by students as a result of needle sticks or exposure to infectious diseases or materials, while in training, are the responsibility of the student and his/her health insuranc e carrier. Information on Campbell University Student Health Insurance can be found using the following link: https://www. campbell.edu/students/student-health- insurance/ 7.1.3 Immunizations Prior to matriculation, all students are required to provide a completed medical history form, proof of immunization, a completed controlled substance screen (described below) and a completed physical examination conducted by a licensed physician through the CastleBranch portal . The Immunization Policy, with a complete description of all immunization requirements, is available in the Office of Clinical Affairs . All students must provide written documentation completed and signed by their health care provider or institutional representative, verifying that all CUSOM MSBS immunization and titer requirements, in accordance with the CDC Guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec -vac/hcw.html ) have been met as listed below: 93 Diphthe ria, Per tussis and Tetanus o All s tudents m ust submit document ation (physician signature or vaccinatio n record) of i mmuniz ation with a *Tda p boost er (Boostrix\u00ae or Adacel\u00ae) since t he year 20 05. o Following the T dap boos ter, proof of a Td r outine boost er is required every ten (10) years TB test (prior to matriculation and again prior to the second year of the program ) o There are two acceptable methods for TB screening and all students m ust provide document ation of the results from O NE of the two methods: A two -step tube rculin (IGRAs ) blood TB test mu st be obt ained w ithin six (6) m onths of m atriculation Hepatitis B virus (quantitative titer) o Students must provide da tes and ve rification (vaccination r ecord) of compl eting a Hepatitis B vaccination s eries consist ing of three (3) hepatitis B in jections o In addition, ve rification of quantitative demonstr ating immuni ty to hepa titis B must be provided Students who do not sho w im munity followi ng the vaccination series should r efer to the Immunization Pol icy for further steps MMR: Measles (Rube ola), Mumps and Rube lla o Students must provide da tes and ve rification (vaccination r ecord) of two (2) M MR vaccinations, oc curring at least 28 da ys apart If the stude nt is able to pr ovide a n immuniz ation record or physician si gnature verifying the d ates of these two ( 2) vaccinations, no titer will be required o Students una ble to pr ovide im munization records or physician signature verifying compl etion of the MMR series have two ( 2) options: Repeat t he MMR series of two ( 2) vaccinations a t least 2 8 days apart and provide document ation verifying compl etion of the series Obtain asles, mumps, and rubella Varicella the matriculation) Influenza vaccin ation every year COVID -19 vaccination as recommended for healthcare providers, once developed. Taking steps to minimize the risk of COVID -19 infections (or any other spread of disease) at CUSOM is a shared responsibility. Every member of our community - including you - must do their part. This means adhering to national, state, and local health guidelines and requirements, and adhering to those measures CUSOM deems safe and appropriate for its campus. Specific details will be provided as circumstances dictate, but this may include such thing as: temperature checks, social distancing, wearing masks or other facial coverings, using other PPE, not reporting to class or work if sick, and isolating and quarantining when required. You agree to do all of this not just for yourself, but for the safety of others, and because this is consistent with the spirit of CUSOM. 94 Additional immunizations may be required in order to be in compliance with the CCCC EMT training program, MSBS students are expected to meet those requirements. CUSOM does not waive immunization or student health requirements for religious, medical or personal preferences. CUSOM may revise the immunization requirements at any time as deemed necessary, and all students will be required to comply with subsequent changes. 7.1.4 Controlled Substance Screening Protocol Controll ed substance screeni ng of learners and sta ff memb ers is mandatory at most healthcare facilities prior to participating in patient care. As such, a controll ed substance screeni ng test showing no evidence of alcohol, illicit substa nces, prescription me dications without a valid pr escription, or substances, which are illegal in the state of No rth Carolin a, is required before matriculation into the MSBS program . Addit ional screening or confirmato ry tests m ay be required as determined by the CUSOM MSBS program . CUSOM reserves the right to require controll ed substance testing or a psychiatric evaluation on any student whe n there is an incident of erratic or unusu al behavior, or there is a reason able concern due to a stude nt's b ehavior, appear ance or pe rformance. Refusal or failure to submit to testing may result in disciplina ry action up to, and includin g, dismissal from the program. Students found to have screening tests posit ive for alcohol, illicit substances, and control led substances (define d as a drug or substance that is listed in Schedules I through V of the Federal Controll ed Substances A ct (21 U.S.C. \u00a7812) ) or prescription medi cations without a valid prescription may be subject to disciplina ry action up to, and including , dismissal. Please note this also include s substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolin a, but which m ay be legal in other states. For examp le, althoug h the use of m arijuana is legal in some states, the US Federa l Drug En forceme nt Agency lists it as an illegal drug. As such, the use of ma rijuana in any form is a violation of Uni versity policy. CUSOM has no control over the content of third-party backg round check s, which may include charges of Driving Under the Influ ence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), or similar offenses . Even expunge d records may appear on these checks. Backg round checks revealing prior crimin al activity, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting application to professional programs or employment oppor tunities. 95 7.1.5 Medical Emergencies The safety of students, faculty, staff and visitors to the Health Science Campus is of utmost concern and the utilization of a standard approach to medical emergencies will ensure the provision of the most timely, efficient, and appropriate care in a medical emergency. As a school of osteopathic medicine, CUSOM's focus and expertise is in the domain of m edical education. While many capable and compassionate health care providers are present on our campus on any given day, their role in this setting is as educators and administrators rather than as clinicians. While able to render immediate assistance i n a life -threatening emergency, they should not be consulted to make treatment or disposition recommendations in non- emergent situations. Anyone suffering from a medical emergency must be evaluated by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) which is activated by dialing 911. If anyone on the Health Science Campus suffers from a medical emergency, the person of first contact with the patient should dial 911 immediately to summon EMS assistance. Following activation of the EMS system, security must be notified of the situation and will also be responsible for contacting EMS to confirm the need for emergency response as well as to provide them with more detailed information regarding the location of the patient and instructions for appropriate access to the building. Security will complete, and maintain, an incident report form for any situation in which EMS is called to provide assistance, even if the patient ultimately refuses treatment and/or transport. Incident Reporting If a student suffers an accident resulting in an injury during a MSBS activity while on campus, the student must complete an incident report, and call/go to the Campbell University's Health Center for consultation and assistance. Incident reports can be o btained from Campbell University's Health Center (910) 893- 1560. If the accident occurs at a clinical training facility, that facility's incident report form should be completed, and the clinical supervisor, Director of Student Medical Education or Direct or of Medical Education, the Regional Dean and the CUSOM Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs should be contacted for assistance. A copy of the facility's incident report must be sent to: Campbell Student Health Services P.O. Box: 565 129 T.T. Lanier St. Buies Cr eek, NC 27506 Medical Emergency Identified Call 911 Contact CUSOM Security for 96 7.2 Behavioral Health 7.2.1 Counseling Services Confidential counseling services are available 24 -hours -a-day, seven -days-a- week in a confidential manner through a combination of resources which includes clinical services offered by the CUSOM Department of Behavioral Health (CUSOM BH) under the leadership of the Departmental Chair and Clinical Director ( https://medicine.campbell.edu/behavioral -health ), and StudentLinc, a student assistance program. Working with CUSOM's Academic and Student Affairs, the Clinical Director for the Department of Behavioral Health, a licensed mental health professional, and other CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff are available during n ormal business hours for direct student contact. CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff are also available as a point -of-contact for after -hours issues in conjunction with StudentLinc described below. CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff provide counseling for CUSOM MSBS students in two (2) on- campus locations based on student preference: Leon Levine Hall and the Campbell Health Cente r. In addition to publication in this Academic Bulletin, students a re advised of the location of this service and how to access behavioral health services during Orientation as well as periodically throughout the year. More information regarding Behavioral Health services may be found at: https://me dicine.cam pbell.edu/behavioral-health Students who are unable to travel to the on-campus locations can meet with a CUSOM Department of Behavioral Health coun selor via WebEx , a secure videoconferencing system which meets HIPAA and FERP A standards . Thi s approach makes communicat ion with, and couns eling for, MSBS student s much more accessible and convenient. Students may also utilize video, phone or web -based counseling through StudentLinc.

The law states that a person with a \" disabil ity\" is: \"Someone with a physical or ment al impairm ent which substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; or a person with a record of such impairm ent; or a person who is regard ed as having suc h an impairm ent.\" (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation A ct of 1973) Equal educat ional opport unity me ans that a person with a disabilit y who is qualified for admission must have access to the same unive rsity programs, services, and activities as all other students. I f necessar y to provide equal opportuni ty, Campbell will make reasonable modi fications to its policies, practices and procedu res, unless doing so would funda ment ally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or financial burden . Under the provisions of Section 504, unive rsities may not discriminate in the recruitme nt, admission, educat ional process, or treatment of students. S tudents who have self-identifie d, provide d document ation of disabili ty, and requested reasonable accom modations are entitled to receive approved modi fications of programs, appropriate academic adjustments, or auxiliary aids that enable them to participate in and benefit from all educat ional progra ms and activities. Section 504 specifies that unive rsities may not limit the number of students with disabilit ies admitted, make preadmissions inqui ries as to wh ether or not an applicant has a disabi lity, use admission tests or criteria that inadequately measure the academ ic qua lifications of students with disabilit ies because special provisions were not mad e, exclude a qualified student with a disabilit y from any course of study, or establis h rul es and pol icies th at may adversely affect studen ts wi th disabili ties. In support of its commitment to provide equal educational oppor tunity, Campbell provide s a variety of services and accom modations to students with document ed disabilit ies. C ampbell Univ ersity's Student Guide for Accessin g Disability Services can be accessed here. 101 Questions or c omments about t his m anual should be directed to: Laura Rich Director of Disability Services Student Services, with Disa bilities Section I - Wh o to C ontact Students with doc ument ed ties who O'Dell , MEd CUSOM Director of Student Affairs Leon Levine H all of M edical Sciences, Room approv al through the University's pro cess. A medi cal, psychological or other diagnosis may rise to the level of a disabilit y if it substantially limits one or more major life functions, one of which is learning. A dis ability may be tempor ary or ongoing. Section II: Ho w to Obtain Services General Procedur e for Receiving Acco mmodations Step 1: Incoming or current students are requested to contact the Director of Student A ffairs to req uest se rvices as soon as possible. The Unive rsity is not responsible for identi fying students with disabilit ies and is not required to provide services unless proper pro cedure s have been follow ed in making a request. Step 2: The student must schedule a meeting with the Director of Student A ffairs, who consul ts with the Director of Disability Services to provide document ation of the dis ability and to complete the a pprop riate paperwork. Step 3: The Director of Student Affairs reviews the student's request and supporting do cument ation, if neede d. The process of review d epends in part on the nature of the student's disability. Decisions re garding accom modations are made on a case-by-102 case basis. There is no stand ard accom modation for any particular disability . CUSOM will make r easona ble modifi cations to its policies, practices and pro cedu res, unless doing so would funda ment ally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or financial bu rden. Step 4: If the request for accommodations is approve d, the Director of Student Affairs generate s a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) documenting the student 's individual, approve d accom modations. The O ffice of S tudents Affairs coordi nates dissemination of the LOA. Any student whose requested accom modations are not approve d is encouraged to meet with the Director of Student Affairs to discuss the reasons for the denial. The Director of Student Affairs m ay discuss the grievanc e proc edure with the student a t this time. Additional Information Regarding Accommodations Do cumentation For any stude nt deemed eligible, CUSOM provide s modations or modi fications to policies and pract ices in order to ensure t hat all students have equal access to all CUSOM programs, services, and ac tivities. The p urpose of accom modations is not to ensure success, but rather to provide access a nd equal educat ional opportuni ty. Accom modations are not d retroactively. Any student approv ed for accom modations is entitled to services and accom modations only from the date the approva l is given. E ven if the stude nt can establis h he/she had a disabilit y at the time of the course in question, CUSOM will not expung e or re-exam ine coursework completed b efore the stude nt was reviewed and approved for accom modation(s). No student is required to disclose his or her disabilit y to the Unive rsity. However, as discuss ed above, any student who discloses and receives approve d accom modations after he/she has begun study at CUSOM will not receive any retroactive accom modations on work comple ted before the approva l for accom modations w as made. Document ation of a student's disabilit y is only shared with relevant CUSOM f aculty, staff or administration on a need-to-know b asis with a release of info rmation s igned by the student . 103 Service Animal Information Accordi ng to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal is defined as \"any animal individual ly trained to work or perform tasks for the b enefit of an individual with a disability , includin g, but not limited to, guiding ind ividuals with impaired vision, alerting indi viduals to an impending seizure or protecting ind ividuals during one , alerting individuals who are hearing i mpaired to intruders, pulling a wheelc hair and fetching droppe d items\". P roviding comfo rt or suppor t does not qual ify an animal as a service animal. If the re are any questions as to whether an animal qualifies as a service animal, a determination is made by Director of Student Affairs with consultation with the Director of Disability Services . In compl iance with the ADA, service animals are welcome in all bu ildings on campus and m ay attend any class, meet ing, or other event. Se rvice animals are ex pected to ex hibit reasona ble b ehavior while on campus. The owners of disrupt ive and aggressive service animals may be asked to remove t hem from unive rsity facilities. If the imprope r behavior hap pens repeated ly, the owne r may be told not t o bring the service animal into a ny facility until they take si gnifi cant s teps to m itigate the behavior . Emotional support animals are animals that provide comfo rt and relieve symptoms of ment al health disorde rs. Emotional support a nimals are not allowed in campus buildings, including classrooms and dining facilities unless it is d eemed as a reasonable accom modation and will be inclu in Letter of Accom modation (LOA) from CU SOM. The CUS OM Director of Student Affairs can p rovide further information. Cleanliness of any approved service or emotional support animal on campus is mandatory. Consideration of others must be taken into account when providing maintenance and hygiene of animals. The owner is expected to clean up and dispose of all animal waste. If the service or emotional support animal becomes a disruption to other students, the animal must be removed to a location that does not cause a disruption to the education of other students. Confidentiality of Information Information received from a student is governed unde r the provisions of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. Unde r the provisions of this la w, students in post-secondar y education have the right to inspe ct and review their school records as defined by law. Oth er than for \"Directory Information\", Campbell Univ ersity will release information only with the student's written consent and will use \"Directory Information\" in the best interests of the student . 104 CUSOM is committed to ensuri ng all led concerni ng a student remains confid ential as required by applicable law. Any information moni tored or c ollected is used for the benefit of t he student . Only those faculty and staff memb ers of CUSOM have access to information collected for use in accompl ishing n ecessar y tasks for the student. A ny info rmation gathered is not released to th ird parties except in accor dance with state and federal law . A student must give written authori zation to release info rmation he/she wish es to share with others. The student must specify the information to be released, the purpose of the release, and to whom the infor mation is to be forwarded. This release may be handwritten, or a form from CUSOM Office of S tudent A ffairs m ay be used. https://cuweb.wuf oo.com/forms/cusom -release-of-information/ A student has the right to review his/her own file and as a courtesy to the individual, copies of doc uments and information obtaine d will be provide d at no cost with l imitation s. Section III: S tudent Responsibilities General Student Responsibilities 1. Identify him/herself to the Director of Student Affairs to begin the process of requesting accommodations. CUSOM is not respons ible for identi fying students with disabilit ies or for contacting su ch students to begin the acc ommodation request process. 2. Provide document ation which conforms to the University's guidelines. If the student's document ation is insuf ficient for any reason, the student is respons ible for pursuing whatever additional document ation is required and to pa y any costs thereof. CUSOM reserves the r ight not to provide services or a ccommodations until all of the documen tation sp ecified in the g uidelines is provided. 3. Any student approved for accommodations is r espons ible for retrieving his or he r Letter of A ccom modation (LOA) and Release of Information Form fr om the Director of Student Affairs or available a t: https://cuweb.wuf oo.com/forms/cusom -release-of-information/ Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Testing Accommod ations Testing accom modations require frequent communication between the student and the Assistant Director of the MSBS Program . It is very important that testing infor mation be shared with the Assistant Director of the MSBS Program in a timel y mann er. 105 At the beginning of the semest er, and at least one week prior to the first scheduled test, the student should discuss with the Assistant Director of the MSBS Program all approve d testing accommodations. This discussion should address the que stions of how, when and where the Assistant Director of the MSBS Program will provide the testing accom modations. The student should make sure to have a calen dar and a copy of the LOA with him/her at the time of this discussion. The student should also remind the Assistant Director of the MSBS Program of their need for accom modations at least one w eek prior to each test/exam . If at any time you feel that the Assistant Director of the MSBS Program is not adequately meet ing your accom modations, discuss this with the Assistant Director of the MSBS Program and the Dire ctor of Student Affairs immedi ately . Rememb er, the Assistant Director of the MSBS Program is only required to provide accom modations spe cifically listed in the Letter of Accom modation.

Section IV: Doc umenting a Disability General Do cumentation Guidelines To ensure reasonable and appropri ate services and accom modations are provide d to students with disabilit ies, students requesting such accom modations and services must provide current document ation of their disability . S uch doc umentation generally must include the followin g: A clear diagnosti c statement of the disability prepared by a licensed prof essional A description of the mann er in which the disab ility limits the student in a specified major life activit y and the s everity of the limitation 106 It is the respons ibility of the student requesting the accom modations and services to document the disability . As such, the cost of evaluations required pursua nt to these guidel ines is to be borne by the student. If there is a change in the student's condition, he/she may request modi fications to previously approve d accom modations. The student will have to provide current suppor ting do cument ation for review at that time. An Indivi dualized Education Plan (IEP) or a 504 plan may help to suppl ement documentation, but are genera lly insuf ficient docum entation whe n presented a lone. Guidelines for Documenting a L earning Dis ability Every report should be on letterhead, typed, dated, signed and otherwise legible, a nd be comprised of the following elements: Eval uator I nformation: The n ame, t itle, and credentials of the qualified profe ssional who conduc ted the a ssessment should begin the r eport. P lease note that memb ers of the stude nt's family are not c onside red appropri ate evaluato rs. Recen t Assessment: The report m ust provide adequate information about the stude nt's current lev el of functioning. If such information is missing, the student may be asked to provide a more recent or compl ete assessment. Testing: There should be a discu ssion of all tests that were administe red, observations of the student's behavior during testing, and a listing of all of his/her test scores (i.e. domain, cluster, subtest, index, etc.) represented in standard scores and/or percentile ranks. Informal assessme nt, an Individuali zed Education Plan (IEP), or a 504 plan m ay help to suppl ement a more compre hensive insuf ficient docum entation whe n presented a lone. In addition, a clinical summary and a clearly sta ted diagnosis are helpful and should be included in the report. The sum mary should integrate the elements of the battery with back ground infor mation, observations of the client during the testing situation, a nd the student's current academ ic situation. This summary should present evide nce of a substantial limitation to learning and explain how the patterns of strength and w eakn ess are sufficiently significant to substantiate a learning disabilit y dia gnosis. I t should also demons trate that the evaluator has ruled out alternative explanations for the learning probl em. If social or emotional factors are found to be possible obstacles to learning, they should be discuss ed. This summary may include recom mended accom modations, but these are in no way bindi ng to the Univ ersity. CUS OM reserves the right to evaluate all document ation and de termine approp riate accom 107 e Proced ure All requests for accom modations or special services should first be brought to the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs. Problem s with approved accomm odations or services should first be reported in writing to the CUSOM Director of Student A ffairs. If the student is unable to resolve the matter with the CUSOM Dire ctor of Student A ffairs, the student and the CUSOM Director of S tudent A ffairs should forward the complaint to the Director of Disability Services for an informal resolut ion. The Director of Disability Services will arrange a meeting with the student and CUSOM Director of Student A ffairs with in ten (10) business d ays of receiv ing the compla int.

Students are also encouraged to exercise their rights of complaint through the Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights and other legal channels if needed. 7.3 Clubs and Organizations 7.3.1 Student Clubs and Organizations Student clubs and organizations are a very important part of the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) and the MSBS program . The service performed by members of student organizations benefits not only the community and the region, but also the members, as they gain valuable knowledge, skills, and experience. 108 Many MSBS students are actively involved in at least one organization, and some students are members of several. MSBS Year 2 students may serve as officers or committee members at the state, regional or national level ; MSBS Year 1 students can be members . The goals of student clubs and organizations relate to the Mission of CUSOM and the osteopathic profession. As suc h, the following are the endorsed student clubs and organizations at CUSOM: Christian Medical and De ntal Association (CMDA) Student National Medical Association (SNMA) Minority Association of Pre -Medical Students (MAPS) Graduate Level Pre- SOMA, a division of the Student Osteopathic Medical Association (SOMA) The above list may not be all-inclusive and is subject to change at any time. MSBS can be invited to attend CUSOM medical student club activities, but cannot hold membership within those medical school clubs. Grade Requirements Students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale as calcul ated at the end of each grading period, no c ourse failures, and be in good academic standing in order to: Serve as a MSBS Class Representative Serve as a CUSOM MSBS club or organization officer Serve on a CUSOM or MSBS committe e Attend any off-camp us conference/meeting Participate in medi cal mission trips Participate in research, including the summer r esearch scholars ' program Students may enter leadership roles beginning at the conclusion of Year 1. The cumulative GPA of each student wishing to participate in any of the above roles is reviewed by the Director of Student Affairs and the Registrar after each academic Semester and, if the cumulative GPA falls below 3.0, the student must relinquish his/her leadership role or other duties/privileges mentioned above. For an activity requiring pre -approval for participation, such as a mission trip or a research project, the cumulativ e GPA at the time of application for the activity is utilized; however, if the cumulative GPA drops below 3.0 by the start of the activity, the student may not be allowed to participate in order to allow them to focus on their academic well-being. 109 CUSOM MSBS Class Representatives The Class Representatives serves as a voice for all MSBS students in both Year 1 and Year 2 . The responsibilities of Class Representatives include collecting and expressing student opinions, acting as a liaison for the student body, promoting the MSBS program , supporting club and class activities and working to improve the quality of life for all MSBS students at CUSOM. The Director of the MSBS program serves as the advisor for any concerns brought forth by the Class Representatives on behalf of their cohorts. Recognition of Student Organizations The first step in obtaining recognition for a new student organization is the submission of a petition to the Office of Student Affairs. The petition must include the goals of the organization, the proposed charter, and the name of the proposed faculty advisor. Once the petition has been approved by the Director of Student Affairs, the petition i s forwarded to the Dean for final approval. Use of College Logo Students and faculty may not represent themselves verbally, in print, or electronically (including use of Campbell University or CUSOM logos, titles, letterhead, or stationery) as representing Campbell University , CUSOM or the MSBS program without the express written permission of the CUSOM Dean and University Communications and Marketing. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the p rogram. The request form to use the school logo for any merchandise must be submitted to the Director of Student Affairs who will process the request and grant final approval. Student Sponsored Ev ents Any event conducted by a student club or organization recognized by CUSOM 's MSBS program is considered a student -sponsored event. Events of this nature require the approval of the Office of Student Affairs and requests must be submitted in writing to the Office of Student Affairs. Requests must include a statement of purpose and the facilities required for the event. Event scheduling forms requiring the use of institutional facilities are available through the Office of Student Affairs. Alcoholic beverages are prohibited at any on - or off- campu s student club or organization event or activity. 110 Scheduling Extr acurricular Activities Students, or student organizations, wishing to host events involving extracurricular academic activities (i.e., speakers, mini -courses, pharmaceutical exhibits, or non- credit courses) must have the approval of the Office of Student Affairs. Written requests or activities request forms for approval must be submitted to the Office of Student Affairs. All off - campus events sponsored by a CUSOM MSBS club or organization must receive approval from the Office of Student Affairs prior to the event or activity and prior to contacting any off -campus facility or organization to schedule or host the event. Attending Conferences Students who meet the requi red criteria may be permitted to attend conferences (not greater than three consecutive days). Only students in good academic standing are eligible to attend, and time away from campus is counted per the CUSOM MSBS Attendance Policy. Copies of the Student Organizations Handbook are available from the Office of Student Affairs. 7.3.2 CUSOM MSBS Alumni Student Society for Alumni and Friends The Student Society for Alumni and Friends (SSAF) is a student organization sponsored by the Campbell Medicine Alumni Association; the Executive Director of External Affairs and Alumni Engagement serves as the club advisor. The mission of SSAF is to conne ct students, alumni and friends of CUSOM MSBS by providing leadership opportunities, educating students about the impact of philanthropic engagement with CUSOM and the University, and inspiring future generation of alumni. SSAF helps students communicate the goals, purpose and impact of CU Advancement and Alumni Engagement while giving them the opportunity to educate other students about the importance of giving back. SSAF consists of a group of highly motivated students interested in the promotion of phi lanthropic awareness on campus and are leaders and volunteers for events such as Campbell Medicine Golf Classic, TAG Day, Founders Week, and Campbell Day of Giving. Students who serve as club officers receive training in event planning, project management , fundraising, strategic planning and marketing. 111 SSAF members serve as ambassadors to students, alumni and friends of CUSOM. Members serve as agents for their respective classes during their tenure as students and throughout their lifetime as alumni. Me mbership is free and participation in initiatives and events will be taken into consideration when of fering exclusive opportunities. 7.3.3 CUSOM Committees Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) and the MSBS program values the talents, perspective and experience of its students and the positive contributions they make to key operational, academic, and improvement efforts of the school. As such, student participation and contributions are solicited whenever possible. Appointments to Committees differs from appointment as a student government representative or class leader, and appointment to, and service on, a CUSOM MSBS Committee should be considered a privilege. The process begins with the Office of Academic Affairs identifying student vacancies on CUSOM MSBS Committees, as approved by the Dean, prior to the start of each academic year (and as vacancies arise within an academic year). Student members of CUSOM MSBS Committees must meet pre - identified criteria including, but not limited to, the student being in good standing at all times relative to: Academic standing: A cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher on a 4.0 scale is required at the time of appointment. If the GPA falls below the minimum required for appointment at any time, the student will be asked to step down from service to focus on her/his academics. Professionalism: No student is permitted to serve on a CUSOM MSBS Committee if they are on Conduct Probation or otherwise have any issues related to Ho nor Code or Professionalism infractions. Committee service of students with an Admonition is determined based on the recommendation of the APPS Committee at the time the Admonition is assigned or by the APPS Committee Chair if an Admonition is assigned by the Chair instead of an APPS Committee hearing. If an appointed student has a documented professionalism issue at any time, the student will be required to step down from the committee service. Other: All other requirements necessary to be a registered student in good standing, such as payment of tuition, must be met. First-year students may not serve on CUSOM MSBS Committees, except in rare circumstances, until they successfully complete the first semester . 112 At designated times in the MSBS program , the class representatives may be asked by the Office Student Affairs of to solicit names of students who have interest in the identified CUSOM MSBS Committees which include student membership. The Office of Student Affairs provides the charge of each Committee and the desired qualities of the ideal student member. Interested students submit materials addressing how they meet the stated needs of the Committee based on their interests and experiential base. These materials are submitted to the class repr esentatives at a time designated by the Office of Student Affairs. The class representatives review all submissions in a fair, impartial, and unbiased manner, and send to the Office of Student Affairs their recommendations for no more than three (3) stude nts they identify for each Committee vacancy. The Office of Student Affairs then works with the Office of Academic Affairs to ensure each student recommended meets all the stated prerequisites for service. Once verified, the names are forwarded to the respective Committee Chairs, who are given a brief timeframe to review the applications and select the student(s) they wish to invite to serve on the committee. The Office of Student Affairs will notify the students selected to any MSBS Committees . All faculty and student committee appointments are subject to approval by the Dean. 113 8. Research and Scholarly Activity 8.1 Research at CUSOM Research is fundamental to, consistent with, and a prerequisite for excellence in teaching and the creation of a scholarly atmosphere for learning. CUSOM recognizes the critical role for developing its research capacity in order to continue to attract and retain top -tier faculty and students, thereby training students for productive careers in osteopathic medicine, biomedical research, and in making valuable contributions to society. Research and scholarly activity at CUSOM may take different forms, which may include basic biomedical research, translational research, clinical research, and medical educational resear ch. 8.2 Policy Statement on Student Research and Scholarly Activity CUSOM strives to advance scientific and medical knowledge and to promote the distinctive philosophy and practice of osteopathic medicine. Whereas CUSOM specifically supports the academi c and scholarly pursuits of students and faculty, this policy specifically addresses student research and scholarly activities. CUSOM is committed to supporting students in pursuing research and extracurricular scholarly opportunities. Whereas students a re encouraged to participate in research, students are not permitted to act as a principal investigator (PI). Rather, they must partner with a faculty member who takes on the role of PI. Furthermore, CUSOM requires all students who are interested in enga ging in research to notify the Associate Dean for Research of their intent. As such, student -researchers are provide with an additional layer of oversight and support in addition to their faculty mentor. 8.3 Education in Research Principles Principles o f responsible conduct in research (RCR) are presented during Year 2 of the MSBS curriculum . Topics include general principles of research ethics, human subject protections and the responsibilities of CUSOM MSBS students in basic science and clinical research. Additional education opportunities in research, scientific method, statistics, and scholarly activities are presented throughout the curriculum. As active members of a research team, students may be required to complete the associated CITI training, if appropriate. If such training is required, the student must provide the Associate Dean of Research with documentation of completion prior to beginning work on the project. Additional training specific to the research project will be provided by the research mentors. 114 8.4 Research Opportunities CUSOM MSBS students may pursue research and scholarly activities in many areas of individual interest. Faculty mentors in areas of biomedical and clinical research are available to provide guidance for student scholarly work. The faculty mentor has overall respons ibility for the conduct of research or scholarly activity, and is ultimately responsible for obtaining approval from regulatory committees as needed. As such, CUSOM requires that a faculty member approve all scholarly activity undertaken by students; howe ver, student and faculty investigators may share the responsibility for complying with policies related to research ethics. For a student -initiated project, the student must have a faculty sponsor, who will serve as the project PI and student mentor. The student may prepare the relevant proposals and applications in close cooperation with the mentor. Mentors and students are responsible for conducting their research in accordance within University and institutional affiliates' research policies. Student s participating in research must comply with all appropriate regulatory requirements, which may include Institution Review Board approval prior to initiation of the project. Students and their faculty mentors are responsible for knowing which compliance requirements are appropriate. 8.5 Student Presentation Processes Students are encouraged to share the results of their research through publication and presentation of their projects. The Associate Dean for Research oversees research publications and scholarly activities of students. Students are required to receive approval from the Associate Dean for Research prior to presentation or publication of any research project conducted while a CUSOM MSBS student. For meeting submissions, the final version of the abstract must be submitted and approved by the faculty mentor and the Associate Dean for Research. The Associate Dean for Research must review and approve all compliance requirements before submission of the abstract for any meeting. For manuscript s ubmissions (case report, original research, or any other publication), the final manuscript draft must be submitted and approved by the Associate Dean for Research prior to submission to any journal for consideration of publication. The final poster, pres entation or manuscript must be reviewed and approved by the faculty mentor and all listed co -authors. The author(s) and mentor must be up to date on research compliance processes. Failure to adhere to any of these requirements will be considered professi onal misconduct and will be reported through the appropriate channels for consideration by the APPS C ommittee as described elsewhere in this Bulletin . 115 8.6 Research Symposium Campbell University and CUSOM has a tradition of highlighting and showcasing student research interests. Annually, Campbell University hosts the Campbell University Interprofessional Education (IPE) Symposium, which is an adjudicated competition open to s tudents, residents and faculty. The IPE research symposium is an opportunity for students to see other projects from their fellow students, as well as projects from other healthcare fields. CUSOM MSBS students may also present posters and oral presentati ons at other local, regional and national events. 116 9.

This list is not all- inclusive and the changes outlined may further change as the situation dictates. Safety of CUSOM MSBS students, faculty and staff is paramount and is the driving force for these changes, which are only for the 2020- 2021 Academic Year. Admissions Requirements The MSBS program has adjusted its admissions requirements for the Fall 2021 admissions cycle to afford flexibility throughout the application process for prospective students, while maintaining high academic and personal standards. CUSOM will ensure individual and holistic review of each application, and how COVID -19 has impacted the pathway to the MSBS program . To this end, the MSBS program will: Accept all pass/fail grades from coursework, including pre- requisite course work, taken at a regionally accredited institution during semesters impacted by COVID - 19. Accept all on -line coursework, including lab credits, taken at a regionally accredited institution during semesters impacted by COVID -19. Review verified applications from candidates who have not completed all required lab credits if their institutions were unable to provide these courses during affected semesters (completion at a later date may be required). Review verified applications with unofficial transcripts if the applicant's institution cannot provide official transcripts due to the pandemic. Official transcripts will be required prior to an offer of acceptance. Review verified appl ications, and invite qualified candidates for admission interviews prior to receiving standardized test scores. o Planned standardized exams for which you are currently registered should be indicated on the PostBacCAS application. o Completion of the GRE or MCAT and receipt of official scores will be required prior to an offer of acceptance. Consider applications from candidates with fewer health care experience hours and other extracurricular experi ences if planned experiences were cancelled or limited by the COVID -19 pandemic. Review applications, and extend invitations for admission interviews prior to receiving the required letter of recommendation from a physician or supervisor . A letter of recommendation from a physician or supervisor will be required prior to an offer of acceptance. 131 Health, Vaccine and Immunizations Requirements All deposited MSBS students are required to submit the following through the CastleBranch portal : 1. Compl eted medical history form 2. Proof of all CUSOM i mmunization requirements 3. Completed controlled substance screen (described below) 4. Completed physical examination conduc ted by a licensed physician using the appropri ate CUSOM form Students must obtain all CUSOM -required immunizations and corresponding titers, prior to matriculation compl iant with all immuni zation requirements throug h graduation. Students who fail to comply with this requirement by the end of the first semester will be referred to the A cademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Please refer to the CUSOM Immuni zation Policy, available in this Academic Bulletin and available through CastleBranch , for a compl ete description of all immuniz ation requirements. All students must provide written document ation through the CastleBranch portal (completed and signed by their health care provi der or institutional representative) verifying all CUSOM -required immunization and titer requirements, as listed below, and in accordance with the CDC Guid elines (https://www .cdc.gov/va ccines/ followi ng: Diphthe ria, Per tussis and Tetanus o All s tudents m ust submit document ation (physician signature or va ccinatio n record) of i mmuniz ation with a *Tda p boost er (Boostrix\u00ae or Adacel\u00ae) since the year 20 05. o Following the T dap boos ter, proof of a Td r outine boost er is re quired every ten (10) years TB test (prior to matriculation and again prior to the second year of the program ) o There are two (2) acceptable methods for TB screening and all students m ust provide document ation of the results from O NE of the two methods: A two -step tube rculin (IGRAs ) blood TB test mu st be obt ained w ithin six (6) m onths of m atriculation Hepatitis B virus (quantitative titer) o Students must provide da tes and ve rification (vaccination r ecord) of compl eting a Hepatitis B vaccination s eries consist ing of three (3) hepatitis B injections o In addition, ve rification of quantitative a ntibody titers demonstr ating immuni ty to hepa titis B must be provided Students who do not sho w im munity followi ng the vaccination se ries should r efer to the Immunization Pol icy for further steps MMR: Measles (Rube ola), Mumps and Rube lla o Students must provide da tes and ve rification (vaccination r ecord) of two (2) MMR vaccinations, oc curring at least 28 d ays apart 132 If the stude nt is able to pr ovide a n immuniz ation record or p hysician si gnature verifying the d ates of these two ( 2) vaccinations, no t iter will be required o Students una ble to pr ovide im munization records or physician signature verifying compl etion of the MMR series have two ( 2) options: Repeat t he MMR series of two (2) v accinations a t least 2 8 days apart and provide document ation verifying compl etion of the series Obtain asles, mumps, and rubella Varicella the matriculation) Influenza vaccin ation every year COVID -19 vaccination as recommended, once developed The EMT course through CCCC may have additional immunization requirements above those re quired by CUS OM. CUSOM do es not w aive immuniz ation or student health requirements for religious, medical or p ersonal preferences. CUSOM m ay revise the immunization requirements at any time as deemed necessa ry, and all students wi ll be re quired to compl y with any subs equent ch anges. Curriculum Delivery Changes For the curricular content identified below, CUSOM will implement the following changes in the delivery of the curricular content, but not the content itself in most instances: Didactic lectures All in -person didactic lectures will be delivered through either recorded presentations utilizing Panopto video capture and posted on Blackboard, or live sessions conducted by videoconferencing. All curricular content remains the same; however, syllabi ha ve been updated as necessary to reflect changes due to the remote learning approach. As an example, attendance is recorded at all live videoconference efforts, including clinical cases and other interactive venues, even meetings; however, students are per mitted to proceed through recorded videos and other online curriculum content asynchronously. The Semester calendars remain the same, and when live videoconferencing or interactive sessions are utilized, every attempt is made to hold these at the same time the content is scheduled on the Semester Calendar. Dates of the Semester quizzes and integrated exams remain unchanged, however, the timing of exams and certain sessions to later in the day may occur since some CUSOM MSBS students may be in western time zones. Laboratory sessions o Anatomy All Anatomy labs will be converted to virtual anatomy lab sessions with online assessments. 133 A critical component of our approach to transition to remote learning is the maintenance of regular and meaningful engagement of our faculty with students. As part of Campbell University, CUSOM has access to several university -provided tools and applications to facilitate faculty -student engagement, including Blackboard Collaborate, the Blackboard Learning Management System, WebEx Videoconferencing, and Panopto video recording and capture. Transcript Changes For First and Second Year Students In the event of a global pandemic or other disaster, courses may be delivered by remote learning, and students will be given the option to remain with the traditional grading scale, or to convert to an alternate Satisfactory (\"S\") or Fail (\"F\") grading scale for the affected time period. The alternate grading scale accrue zero quality points per hour, thereby having a neutral effect upon grade point average. The transcript will note the reasoning for the transition to remote learning. Graduation Changes In the event that there is a resurgence of COVID -19 and there are local, state, or nation- wide restrictions, CUSOM will offer a Virtual Platform for Graduation. In the event of travel bans and state- wide restrictions, we encourage families to delay purchasing airline tickets and procuring lodging accommodations until further directives from the University. CUSOM will provide a personalized Virtual Celebration for the graduating class of 2021 for the DO/MSBS/MHPE programs in the event of state -wide orders. The Office of the Registrar along with the Director of the MSBS Program will work with students to verify permanent mailing a ddresses for each student. Diplomas and other materials related to Graduation will be mailed to students at the address provided and verified by each student. CUSOM will work cooperatively with Campbell University and University directives regarding in -person or virtual ceremonies, diploma conferral dates, and any virtual links to Commencement exercises. 134 Behavioral Health Department Service Changes Clinical Service Policy Until such time as social distancing requirements are lifted, CUSOM's Department of Behavioral Health will continue to provide all clinical services remotely via phone or through the HIPAA/FERPA compliant WebEx application. This modality of service delivery is to be maintained even if departmental clinicians are physically on campus while providing services. Departmental Service Protocol 1. Students and other parties seeking counseling services can request an appointment requested, the departmental Administrative Assistant (Mrs. Teresa Butrum) will contact said party and have them complete the online intake form. 3. Once the intake form is completed, the party will be sent the available times for all clinicians within the department along with a request for their preference regarding the venue of service delivery (i.e., phone/WebEx). Wrap -Around Services In addition to Behavioral Health clinical staff, CUSOM utiliz es the services of StudentLinc, a 24/7/365 s tudent assistance program that offers wrap-around psychosoc ial support services. Services are acces sed through StudentLinc's online web portal: https://www .mystude ntlinc.com/ or via their mobile application.

Depending on the nature and severity of the event, the client may then be referred out to a community provider to better address their needs. Referrals will be made either by the clinician directly o r through CUSOM's student assistance program (i.e., StudentLinc) . Departmental Service Protocol 1. The departmental clinician will conduct an evaluation to determine the nature and severity of the ideation . 2. If the clinician determines that the client is at emergent risk, 911 will be notified and a local sheriff's deputy will be sent to their current address for a well -check. Additionally, the clinician will remain in contact with the client until the sheriff arrives. All clients seen by the department within the last three months will be sent a link to update their information within the HER . Current and home addresses are required client information and must be filled out prior to scheduling an appointment . 3. The clinician will also inform the client's emergen cy contact of the situation . The departmental service agreement has been amended to reflect this change in policy. Emergency contact information is now also required before a client can schedule an appointment . 4. Once the client has been taken into custody, the clinician will inform their direct supervisor of the event . 5. The clinician will thoroughly document the incident in the client's chart within the departmental electronic health records system . 6. Depending on the nature and severity of the event, the client may then be referred out to a community provider for follow -up care. Referrals will be made directly by the clinician or through the student assistance program (i.e., StudentLinc: www.mystudentlinc.com ). 136 NOTES AND DEFINITIONS The word \"student \" in this Bulletin refers to any person who is enroll ed in any course offered by CUSOM .
