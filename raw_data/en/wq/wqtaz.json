The cornerstone of the chiropractic approach is the correction of spinal misalignments (vertebral subluxations) that interfere with the body's natural self-healing, self-regulating mechanisms which are controlled by the nervous system. When indicated, we also utilize nutritional therapy, physical therapies and other natural supportive techniques to help the individual regain their health. Once health is restored, chiropractic wellness care helps patients and their family members to maximize and maintain their good health throughout their lifetime. Our mission is to educate our patients and the community about the many health benefits of living a natural chiropractic lifestyle. |Monday| | | 9 AM - 12 Noon, 2 PM - 6 PM |Tuesday| | | 2 PM - 6 PM |Wednesday| | | 9 AM - 12 Noon, 2 PM - 6 PM | | | | 9 AM - 12 Noon, 2 PM - 6 PM "}
