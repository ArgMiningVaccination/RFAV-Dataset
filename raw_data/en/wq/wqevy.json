In POLITICS?![ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive219&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] I've disengaged from the internet, a lot, and it's been very good for me, but I still read a lot of discussions. Tell me if you've heard this before... Someone berates Obama, the Obama-supporter assumes they are a Republican, then berates them as a Republican partisan. The person thus accused then loftily declares \"I am a Libertarian\". I've seen it happen in a lot of places. I'd like to point out that 60,933,500 votes were cast for Mitt Romney, the Republican, and 1,275,971 votes were cast for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian. (According to Wikipedia, anyway). Now, obviously, Greens, Libertarians and Republicans would have a lot of issues with Barack Obama, the warmongering statist Democrat, but I have yet, since November 2012, to speak to one person (on the internet) who voted for Mitt Romney, despite statistics implying that 47% of all people who voted in the last election voted for him. Are Romney voters [so antiquated they cannot use the Internet](/wiki/Ted_Stevens)? Do I just [suck at Math](/wiki/Schlafly_statistics)? Do I just use/read the [wrong sites](/wiki/Confirmation_bias)? Or, to quote Matt Taibbi regarding the Tea Party and their insistence they were Conservative dissenters in regard to the Bush administration, is it that \"they are full of shit\"? -- [TheLateGatsby](/wiki/User:TheLateGatsby) ( [The end of the dock ](/wiki/User_talk:TheLateGatsby)) 21:04, 24 January 2014 (UTC) - Well, how thorough is your research? Do you go from site to site asking people how they voted? I'm sure there must be some Romney supporters on the internet if you're determined to find them.

[Compro01](/wiki/User:Compro01)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Compro01)) 22:10, 24 January 2014 (UTC) - I agree, internet comments sections seem to give a skewed take on people's views; it's a mystery I've given a little thought to. I think it has to do not only who's using internet news sources, but who feels comfortable and inclined to make comments on them. Judging by youtube comments, the average person seems to be some kind of conspiracy loving anarcho-libertarian scientific racist/evolutionary psychological misogynist. I don't think this is representative of the population as a whole, in fact I think these views are generally pretty rare, but they may be representative of the views of young white middle class under/unemployed alienated white techie men, the kind of people who use the internet a lot, that is the \"basement dweller\". - Watch as I pull the reason for this directly out of my ass. Things are changing. Previously privileged classes, specifically white men are losing their grip on power and basement dwellers are suffering for it. Not the rich and the powerful, those guys are fine, but the lower middle class white guy is taking a beating. For much of the post WWII 20th century just being a not poor white male was enough to access the comfortable ranks of respectable financially secure society, but now as progressive multiculturalism advances, those same people are facing stiff competition from women and minorities and many are alienated because of it, withdrawing to the safety of the basement. Symptomatic of this alienating situation is the basement dweller's worldview. It's anarcho-libertarian because they see the government working in opposition to their material and social interests as it promotes a more egalitarian society through social programs and affirmative action. While they obviously benefit, as we all do, from government largess, it offers them relatively little in comparison to their ancestors. Unlike their grandfathers who were richly rewarded for their part in the WWII military apparatus and even their fathers many of whom got a decent slice of the Cold War military industrial complex pie, the basement dweller gets very little in terms of direct government aid in the form of grants, jobs and student loans. Scientific racism serves to explain the basement dweller's feeling of innate superiority (\"I always new I was smarter than those people and this bell curve proves it!\") that has been cultivated by their father's and grandfather's status, but here's the key. While they buy into the meritocratic ideals which underpin the larger white American worldview they need an explanation for their lack of success. Rather than admit that they're not any smarter than the average lesbian latina whose beating them out for jobs, they personify their persecution in the JEW, who they believe infiltrated the previously pure white male social and governmental apparatus and steered it away from the proper course in order to generate JEW GOLD. They blame jews for everything from 9/11 (I'd argue that nearly all conspiracies are antisemitic to a degree) to the fact that they can't get laid. In a certain sense the JEW and his conspiracies, chemtrails and all, becomes a mystification of the alienating aspects of progressive liberal society. - Do all basement dwellers think like this? Of course not, but I'd argue that a disproportionate number do and thus we have the disproportionate representation of this libertarian/racist/conspiracy idea cluster on the internet. - TL;DR, people who comment on internet news articles, youtube video and Rationalwiki are alienated losers, it's no surprise that they have the ideology of an alienated loser. -- [Marlow](/wiki/User:Marlow)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Marlow)) 23:23, 24 January 2014 (UTC) - Pretty much. I think [this explanation](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/why-i-want-bitcoin-to-die-in-a.html#comment-1836175)on Charlie Stross's blog nails it: - Pretty much. I think >If you grow up with strong government, you may see them as the problem and want the free market to come in and save you. And if you grow up in your parent's basement, then you are shaped by an environment where the fundamental constraints on what you want to do are shaped neither by scarcity nor malignance, but _by genuine good intent_. Your relatives probably don't wan't you to spend all day smoking pot and playing video games; in some cases they will over-estimate just how much of a bad thing that is. And even if they _are_ right, it's not like anyone facing such hectoring is going to admit it. Pretty much every libertarian position can be understood in that frame of restrictive but benevolent authority being the root of all 'real' problems. It's a rare parent who literally tortures their kids, so torture is, at best, not a 'real' issue, not a priority. But many make them do stuff for their health, so mandatory health insurance is a big deal. Pretty much no parents kill their child with drones, many read their diaries. And so on. So to libertarians, Bitcoin is like wages from a fast food job as opposed to an allowance; lets you buy what you want without someone else having a veto. Only money that doesn't judge you can be considered entirely yours... - - [David Gerard](/wiki/User:David_Gerard)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:David_Gerard)) 09:54, 25 January 2014 (UTC) - - - For what it counts, I've encountered an even mix of Obama and Romney supporters on the less partisan areas of the Web.

That's the lynchpin of their argument, that there is no secular purpose in teaching people stuff that works rather than stuff that doesn't work. They even go so far as to say that a court shouldn't discriminate on this basis for the same reasons. It's a retreat to undergrad philosophy, \"Maybe nothing is real so therefore you should have sex with me\". It'd be nice to think that won't work on like, an actual judge, but who knows. - If only the stakes weren't so high it would seem sensible to provide a judgement that cures only the ills complained of, and not what's actually at the heart of the matter. Tell the superstitious that, along with their magic sky man they are now allowed to believe that the school teaches that Jesus rode a dinosaur or whatever. It isn't actually true, but the magic sky man stuff isn't true either and they go right along believing that.

It's always bugged me how Sam is critical of people who speak strongly and broadly on areas outside their area of expertise, but then he goes on and on about how he's solved free will, airport safety, and morality.

[Ikanreed](/wiki/User:Ikanreed) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Ikanreed)) 15:30, 28 January 2014 (UTC) - \"Half the median\" is just an awful statistic. For those of you still having trouble, the median refers to not the mean, but the point directly in the middle if you sort the data. It's especially useful for talking about individuals, because in America we have a highly skewed income distribution, where the average (mean) might be something like $60,000 dollars per household, but the average (median) is actually something like $54,000. That means, even though the mean is $60k, over 50% of households make $54k or less. Half the median, however, doesn't mean that you fall in the bottom 25%. It means that the household makes less than or equal to $27k. So, this statistic just means that 1/5 children in America live in households with a combined pre-tax income of less than $27,000 (assuming that I'm right on the $54k median).

The evidence for the existence of Jesus in particular is about the same as some minor local lords who did nothing in particular of note. We can and do accept their existence within the context of history because there's not a lot to be gained from assuming otherwise(given any evidence at all of a private citizen of that era is pretty rare), which leads to Wikipedia's situation with \"almost universal assent\" which doesn't equal agreement.

In a system like WoW it's not a problem if the plot demands something players don't like. King of the dwarves needs to die? Too bad, you see a cut scene and it's done. Sure, fine, it's not as though players were ever led to believe that their decisions would make a lasting difference. But if you build an open system like EVE, some players, maybe even lots of players, might decide they'd like to be peaceful settlers who avoid violence. But that messes with the real game economy driven by such violence, the one that keeps the developers income high. So they can't have that. So \"accidents\" happen, things that you rely on \"break\" and you find conflict inevitable, because conflict drives revenue. - Our universe is indifferent to us. It doesn't take pity on us when we're \"almost\" good enough, but it also doesn't say \"Oops, now that you figured out how to make light I'm changing the rules so you'll suffer in darkness anyway\".

How can a virus adapt to a more hostile environment if it can't enter the environment without being killed in the first place? Both bacteria and viruses grow and spread as they incubate within a host, and it's not like a virus is full-strength the minute it spreads to an individual.

If successful\u2014and uncontained\u2014they are unlikely to be any worse than a typical pre-medicine plague.

However, if a bacterium in a sick individual does mutate in a way that it produces a copy that is antibiotic resistance, this isn't necessarily a problem, because it still has to compete will all those other bacteria for supplies from your body. However, if you start taking antibiotics, you essentially apply a really strong selection against bacteria that aren't antibiotic resistant. Suddenly, they start dying, and the resistant bacteria no longer have as much competition for resources, so they can spread out all the time. So, again, antibiotic/vaccine resistant things have much more of a chance to appear in the first place if there are a lot of people acting as breeding grounds for them.

It has, in fact, no interest in killing or even damaging it's host. It just wants to get spread from one person to another and thus continue to reproduce. A pathogen which rapidly killed all of its hosts would soon run out of them and would die out, so it's in the pathogen's interest to do as little damage as possible consistent with getting transmitted. The problem, of course, is that for many pathogens their very method of transmission is damaging - diarrhoea, sneezes or whatever - or that their life-cycle obliges them to damage their host in other ways. But ideally they'd \"like\" to remain unnoticed by both the immune system and by modern medicine.-- [Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"I think you'll find it's more complicated than that.\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M) 08:47, 30 January 2014 (UTC) - Indeed. A \"pathogen\" which would come to do that would be known as not-a-pathogen (which there are plenty of in and on the bodies of us humans), but those are not the topic of interest here.

Because neither the individual organisms nor the species are conscious of this pressure it doesn't function the way an incentive would to a person. Species have nothing incentivising them not to win this sort of pyrrhic victory, parasites destroying their host, predators hunting their prey to extinction, and so on, until it's too late. [Tialaramex](/wiki/User:Tialaramex)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Tialaramex)) 13:25, 30 January 2014 (UTC) - Indeed. And that is why I put my descriptions of \"intentionality\" on the part of the pathogen in scare quotes. But in the same way that we can talk about \"selfish genes\" - where we know perfectly well that they are not actually \"selfish\" - it an be illustrative to speak about what is in the organism's \"best interests\". - But the most usual course of events in both predator/prey interactions and disease/host interactions is for them to find some accommodation. Pretty obviously, cases were either predators or diseases have driven their prey/hosts to extinction are shortly followed by the extinction of the predator or the disease. - An interesting example of a disease becoming less virulent is syphilis. A disease which is now much less virulent than the variety first identified. -- [Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"I think you'll find it's more complicated than that.\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M)14:00, 30 January 2014 (UTC) - We shouldn't feel too safe. This mechanism works whereby predators that are too thorough get wiped out themselves. Therefore those that survive are the milder predators. For us, if a disease is too thorough, it may get wiped out by wiping us out, but that is not an acceptable outcome for us. And it may be a danger we shouldn't necessarily wave off.

Guinea Worm, a case[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive219&action=edit\u00a7ion=22)] So I'm going to write here a bit about Guinea Worm Disease because it's useful to understand what's going on here without invoking mysterious invisible boogie men, Guinea Worm is an actual parasitic worm, you don't need a microscope to see adult worms and it's a human disease that we're trying to wipe out. As a macroscopic organism we obviously don't vaccinate people against Guinea Worm, or try to treat it (primarily) with antibiotics. Indeed since the remaining hosts are mostly in the most desperately poor places of the world where minimal medical support is available we don't bother with invasive surgery and tricky dose control on poisons either. Instead the primary strategy is education - teaching people not to drink untreated water and if they have a worm to get it cared for properly at a clinic not dip the affected body part in a body of water and thus help break the cycle. This is supported by providing water treatment and filters and paying people to run the clinics, etc. Eradication of Guinea Worm is going fairly well. In the super-long-term it's almost unavoidably a win, because people who don't drink pond water don't get infected. Even now, in the third world we've gone from from millions of infected to a few thousand. However, as this has happened and global focus has zoomed in to tiny African villages where it remains prevalent we've found something... unexpected. Guinea Worms have partly adapted to live in dogs. Unlike humans no amount of education or outright bribery will cause dogs to comply with rules about not drinking pond water or ignoring the instinct to dip \"burning\" extremities in cool water. Maybe there was Guinea Worm in North African dogs fifty years ago and we never noticed, I'm not sure, I don't think the WHO are sure either. But this shows how natural selection fights our attempts to wipe out a disease, independent of the specific mechanics we use. Ten years ago the people fighting GWD expected the disease organism to be wiped out in its entirety since it had no other known host, now it appears that even if we \"win\" the disease will live on in dogs.

But they let their proponents go back to the good folk at home and say they did their best against them heathern pointy-head godless intellectuals who would sap and impurify their precious bodily fluids. It's completely normal for a legislature to handle a significant percentage, even a clear majority of bogus legislation that's never going anywhere near the statute books. Because everybody knows this legislation is bogus it does not normally get media coverage, but from time to time somebody notices a particular bill and freaks out, either because they don't know any better, or because it suits their political agenda to do so. Laymen will often be astounded by the notion that this is normal because they aren't told about it, although it's hard to imagine them reading an article headed \"Useless crap the legislature rejected today\" in their national newspaper. I had a fellow insisting that there was a conspiracy to conscript all able-bodied men and women in the UK for a forthcoming war and we weren't being told about it. Their evidence was a Bill taken to Westminster by an obscure backbench MP which indeed purports to re-start \"National Service\" (the name under which conscription last operated) and they could not believe that such bills were routine and achieve nothing. Until I asked them if they'd been similarly worried two years before, and a year before that, when the exact same Bill was put forward and, of course, came to nothing. Then I pointed out that each time these Bills were scheduled to be considered on a Friday afternoon, and asked them, what sort of tasks do they schedule for a Friday afternoon at work, the really important stuff or the kind of thing you can half-ass and it doesn't matter? At last the conspiracy theorist fell silent. [81.2.89.122](/wiki/Special:Contributions/81.2.89.122) ( [talk](/w/index.php?title=User_talk:81.2.89.122&action=edit&redlink=1)) 16:21, 31 January 2014 (UTC) From our Spanish correspondent.[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive219&action=edit\u00a7ion=27)] Life in Spain seems to be becoming increasingly surreal. As many will be aware the Spanish government is in the process of pushing through a new more-restrictive abortion law which will only allow abortion in cases of rape and where the mother's life is at risk. And even under those highly-restrictive conditions you still will need your parent's permission if you are under 18. Any (yes \"any\") survivable foetal abnormality will not be a justification for abortion. In order to bolster its case for this deeply unpopular proposal the government has claimed [its new law will boost Spain's flagging economy](http://www.thelocal.es/20140127/spains-abortion-laws-will-boost-economy). A suggestion which has been met with incredulity. (Thinking through the question \"In how many ways is this wrong?\" is an interesting intellectual exercise.) However, the Spanish government has another string to its bow. It is being secretly helped by [a 16th century Spanish nun](http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/01/24/inenglish/1390579198_022392.html) according to the interior minister. As this announcement was met by some surprise, one political party has officially [asked the government to quantify](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/30/spanish-government-saint-teresa-economic-crisis) the amount of aid received and to state whether or not it anticipates receiving further supernatural aid. Some have speculated that this aid might breach EU guidelines as well. Not to be outdone, a recently-appointed Catholic Cardinal has likened homosexuality to a treatable defect [similar to his own blood pressure](http://news.yahoo.com/spain-39-cardinal-says-homosexuality-39-defect-39-135809123.html). In an equally weird development the Church is sending 20 extra priests to the Vatican for [exorcism training](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/catholic-church-trains-more-priests-to-perform-exorcisms-9046578.html) in order to help counter the \"unprecedented rise\" in cases of \"demonic possession\". Lest anyone is left with the impression that the population of the Bible Belt has recently decamped to Spain I should mention that vast numbers of Spaniards are not at all happy about all this. While such weird church pronouncements are accepted with that same mixture of amusement, tolerance and embarrassment reserved for dotty aunt Matilda after too many glasses of sherry, the government is certainly going to pay come the elections - or possibly the revolution.-- [Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"I think you'll find it's more complicated than that.\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M) 09:49, 31 January 2014 (UTC) [Still smells like desperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ElectionMonthlyAverageGraphSpain2015.png).

I was standing around and thinking to myself, \"I am the only atheist in the room\".

How do I deal with this situation and how do I prepare my own atheist ceremony thing?

[Heresiarch](/wiki/User:Heresiarch)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Heresiarch)) 11:53, 4 February 2014 (UTC) - Drink twice if Ham has an argument refuted- and makes it again anyway. - Drink 456890076421247906667990 times if Ham very obviously loses- but acts as if he's won anyway.

[Danoso](/wiki/User:Danoso)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Danoso)) 21:04, 4 February 2014 (UTC) A question on this[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive219&action=edit\u00a7ion=37)] I've not really been following this all that much being a continent away but I've just been looking around the internet and I see that the subject of the debate is: \"Is Creation a Viable Model of Origins?\" Yet everywhere I see it spoken about as \"Creationism versus evolution\" or something of that nature. I even see people pointing out that Nye is not an expert in evolution. But evolution, as such, has nothing whatsoever to do with \"origins\" - either of the universe or life. So isn't a lot of debate already ill-focused? Or am I missing something?-- [Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"I think you'll find it's more complicated than that.\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M) 13:01, 4 February 2014 (UTC) - I mean, the debate topic is actually really, really favorable, or at least it should be in the hands of the right debater. If you've ever listened to the Miller v. Morris debate, with the proposition of \"the theory of evolution is superior to the theory of special creation as an explanation for the scientific evidence related to origins\" ( [http://ncse.com/creationism/general/miller-morris-debate-1981](http://ncse.com/creationism/general/miller-morris-debate-1981)), it was practically a murder, because Miller was able to focus on comparing how each piece of data fit creation vs evolution. This debate topic is even better, because a competent debater would be able to just repeatedly attack creation, since it's the topic of the debate, and even be able to attack their opponent for mentioning evolution, asking why they are so obsessed with attacking evolution instead of defending their model, which is the topic of the debate. However, I think many people realize that we aren't sure of how skilled Nye is as a debater. We also realize that the creationists are generally not interested in honestly presenting and defending their theory. So, there is a justified concern that what will happen is that the creationists will end up attacking Evolution the whole time, Nye won't properly call them out on it and will fall into their trap, and everyone will declare it a win for creationists. - The best case scenario is that NCSE secretly kidnapped Nye and forced him to watch creationist debates, practice debating mock creationists, and memorize the index of creationist claims. If Nye is properly prepared this should be another shutdown. If Nye isn't prepared then we know what to expect. Lots of distortions from the creationists, but just enough style over substance that they come out looking positive to most of their believers. [Shadow of Lords](/wiki/User:ShadowofLords) [talk](/wiki/User_talk:ShadowofLords)14:24, 4 February 2014 (UTC) - Yeah, the debate topic/title itself is good. It might force Ham to come up with something original and provide some evidence. All Nye then needs to do is point out how he has utterly failed to back up his position with anything other than imagined slights against evolutionary biology. [gnostic](/wiki/User_talk:Armondikov)14:49, 4 February 2014 (UTC) - There is a group of people, including evolutionary biologists, who would say that evolution requires abiogenesis, and creationists tend to group origin of the universe in with that. Certainly from the creationist side, it is about the origin of life and the origin of the universe. [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Sterile)14:54, 4 February 2014 (UTC) - Sure evolution requires abiogenesis. It also requires a universe. But as we all know evolution takes place happens after both those things exist and the debate is apparently about those previous two things. - I'm not entirely sure that everybody - including the two participants - is going to recognise this though. In point of fact I'm not so sure that \"origin of the universe\" and \"abiogenesis\" would be strong ground for Nye. What's he going to say? \"We've got some good hypothesis\"? In point of fact science is a lot clearer on evolution than it is on the other two.-- [Bob](/wiki/User:Bob_M) [\"I think you'll find it's more complicated than that.\"](/wiki/User_talk:Bob_M)15:05, 4 February 2014 (UTC) - [EC] The Creationist position has never really moved far away from evolution because their central tenet is that man is a special creation in the image of God. If evolution (by natural selection) is totally wrong then it doesn't change the fact the Earth is 4.6by old. Upholding a young-Earth scenario is all about a clinging to a divinely created Adam, an idea which evolution has booted into the long grass.

Just saw this posted to my Bishop's wall on FB after reading about it here. Typical comment: - not a debate. a discussion. if Ken Ham wants to argue ALL of modern science is wrong, if he wants to say it's an illusion, then it's a debate. Otherwise, they are just pulling our legs, using cell phones that would be impossible without quantum mechanics and being healed with medicines that are the result of modern biology that is founded on evolution. As Archbishop Anastasios said last week: modern civilization is not foreign to God. -- [MarkAHershberger](/w/index.php?title=User:MarkAHershberger&action=edit&redlink=1)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:MarkAHershberger)) 21:39, 4 February 2014 (UTC) I'm back, motherfuckers.[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive219&action=edit\u00a7ion=38)] Well, it was only 23 days, but I'm back. Whilst I was away, I got my study back on track, got my car fixed after, like, 5 months or something, recorded a few songs, and succeeded in starting the first romantic relationship I've ever had (meaning that this year's Valentine's Day will involve more than just porn, fapping and heavy metal)! Oh, and I'm having a tonsilladenoidectomy on the 20th, which I'm a bit nervous about, because this guy was like \"yeah, I had that done. I threw up blood, could barely swallow, and had a huge scab form on the back of my throat. Totally worth it.\" Anyway, what's been going on at the Wiki of Rationality? Have I missed anything?

Just after that, Weaseloid discovered a method for converting any type of matter into gold and so is currently in the process of buying several sun-drenched islands to house his massive harem of supermodels. Next, I think it was Psy who posted a sequence of posts that caused the brains of over three quarters of those who saw them to go into a kind of fascination/revulsion stasis, which caused several hospitals to be overloaded. Then just yesterday, ListenerX announced that he had made contact with an alien civilization, but had cut off communication after they announced a preference for the color red. I think that's everything.
