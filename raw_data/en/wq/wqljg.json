A comment submitted to the Commission will be part of the public record. The Commission will consider the comment at a public meeting when the Commission determines what, if any, recommendation it will make to the Legislature. It is just as important to advise the Commission that you approve the tentative recommendation as it is to advise the Commission that you believe revisions should be made to it. COMMENTS ON THIS TENTATIVE RECOMMENDATION SHOULD BE RECEIVED BY THE COMMISSION NOT LATER THAN August 26, 2019. The Commission will often substantially revise a proposal in response to comment it receives. Thus, this tentative recommendation is not necessarily the recommendation the Commission will submit to the Legislature. California Law Revision Commission c/o UC Davis School of Law Davis, CA 95616 650-494-1335 <commission@clrc.ca.gov> SUMMARY OF TENTATIVE RECOMMENDATION The California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") was enacted in 1968 to promote public access to public records, while also recognizing competing interests. In enacting the CPRA, the Legislature, \"mindful of the right of individuals to privacy,\" found and declared that \"access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.\" Since its enactment, the CPRA has been revised over and over again, in piecemeal fashion. This has resulted in a statute that is poorly organized and cumbersome for members of the public to use and understand, impeding fulfillment of the goals underlying the CPRA. To address that problem, the Legislature asked the Law Revision Commission to study the CPRA on a priority basis and prepare a report containing recommended legislation that would make the CPRA more user-friendly, without changing its substance. More specifically, the Legislature asked the Commission to develop legislation that would: (1) Reduce the length and complexity of current sections. (2) Avoid unnecessary cross-references. (3) Neither expand nor contract the scope of existing exemptions to the general rule that records are open to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the CPRA. (4) To the extent compatible with (3), use terms with common definitions. (5) Organize the existing provisions in such a way that similar provisions are located in close proximity to one another. (6) Eliminate duplicative provisions. (7) Clearly express legislative intent without any change in the substantive provisions. The Commission has been studying the CPRA as directed. This tentative recommendation is its current draft of the requested report. In preparing this draft, the Commission has taken great care to ensure that the proposed recodification of the CPRA would not make any substantive change in the law. The Commission seeks comments on this tentative recommendation. Comments from knowledgeable persons (whether positive, negative, or more nuanced) are crucial in the Commission's study process. This tentative recommendation was prepared pursuant to Resolution Chapter 158 of the Statutes of 2018. Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 1 - CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP In 2016, the Legislature directed the Law Revision Commission to conduct a 1 strictly nonsubstantive clean-up of the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\")1 2 and related provisions. The Legislature requested that the Commission complete 3 this work \"as soon as possible, considering the Commission's preexisting duties 4 and workload demands ....\"2 5 This tentative recommendation presents a complete draft of a proposed 6 recodification of the CPRA to make it more user-friendly, without changing its 7 substance. The Commission seeks comments on the proposed recodification. 8 The history and purposes of the CPRA are discussed briefly below, followed by 9 a discussion of the history and purposes of this study. The Commission then 10 describes the general character and noteworthy features of the proposed 11 recodification, as well as the methodology used in preparing it. 12 Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the 13 Government Code. 14 History and Purposes of the CPRA 15 The CPRA was enacted in 1968 to promote public access to public records, 16 while also recognizing competing interests.3 In enacting the CPRA, the 17 Legislature, \"mindful of the right of individuals to privacy,\" found and declared 18 that \"access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business is a 19 fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.\"4 20 \"[P]eople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, 21 but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.\"5 The 22 CPRA thus serves \"a crucial function.\"6 As the California Supreme Court has 23 explained: 24 Implicit in the democratic process is the notion that government should be 25 accountable for its actions. In order to verify accountability, individuals must 26 1. Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48. 2. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)); see also 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)) (reaffirming Commission's authority to study CPRA). 3. See 1968 Cal. Stat. ch. 1473. 4. 1968 Cal. Stat. ch. 1473, \u00a7 39 (Section 6250). 5.

Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 2 - have access to government files. Such access permits checks against the arbitrary 1 exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.7 2 Although public access to public records is of great importance, it must 3 sometimes yield to a competing interest.8 Thus, the CPRA \"contains numerous 4 exemptions to the requirement of public disclosure, many of which are designed to 5 protect individual privacy.\" 9 Under the CPRA, the public \"is entitled to inspect 6 public records unless one of the exemptions ... applies.\"10 7 The CPRA thus strikes \"a careful balance\" between the right of public access 8 and competing considerations.11 Since its enactment, the Legislature has 9 continually refined that balance, adjusting the statutory scheme over and over 10 again in an incremental manner as new issues surfaced.12 11 Due to the piecemeal nature of these repeated reforms, the CPRA has developed 12 into a complicated tangle of statutory provisions. In its present form, it is hard for 13 users (especially non-lawyers) to comprehend and follow, and hard for the 14 Legislature to place new material where it logically belongs. 15 Here are a few illustrations: 16 Instead of being grouped together, provisions with the same subject matter 17 are sometimes separated in ways that can make key material hard to find. 18 For example, Section 6254(f) is a long and complicated exemption 19 pertaining to law enforcement records, with multiple caveats, qualifications, 20 exceptions, and exceptions to the exceptions. Sections 6254.30 and 6262 21 7. Id., quoting Internat'l Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 21, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court, 42 Cal. 4th 319, 328-29, 165 P.3d 488, 64 Cal.

Rptr. 3d 183 (2006) (Judicial decisions interpreting CPRA \"seek to balance the public right to access to information, the government's need, or lack of need, to preserve confidentiality, and the individual's right to privacy.\"). The statutory balancing of competing interests in the CPRA is similar to the interplay between two sometimes conflicting provisions of the California Constitution: the people's right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 3) and the right of privacy (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1). See, e.g., City of San Jose, 2 Cal. 5th at 616 (\"Similarly, while the Constitution provides for public access, it does not supersede or modify existing privacy rights.\"); Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training, 42 Cal. 4th at 288 (comparing balancing in California Constitution with balancing in CPRA). 12. See, e.g., Assembly Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (April 19, 2016), p. 3 (\"Since the enactment of the CPRA, it has been amended multiple times to exempt certain records.\"); Senate Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (June 14, 2016), p. 4 (referring to \"nearly 50 years of amendments to the CPRA\"). Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 3 - clarify aspects of Section 6254(f), but they are not referenced in, or located 1 in proximity to, Section 6254(f).13 2 Other CPRA provisions are buried amongst unrelated material. Section 3 6254.7(c), governing records of a housing or building violation, is a good 4 example. It could easily be overlooked, because it is located in the middle of 5 Section 6254.7, surrounded by pollution-related material. 6 To place new material where it seemed to belong, the Legislature has at 7 times resorted to unsystematic decimal numbering (e.g., Sections 6254.1, 8 6254.10, 6254.4.5). This is potentially confusing, because it is difficult to 9 determine the proper sequence of those code sections and thus can be 10 difficult to find them. 11 At other times, the Legislature has added new material on a subject to an 12 already overlong statute that addresses the same subject and other topics. 13 This necessitates cumbersome labeling, such as Section 6254(f)(4)(B)(ii)(I). 14 Such labeling makes it hard for CPRA users to readily refer to the material 15 in question. 16 Problems like these impede fulfillment of the purposes underlying the CPRA. 17 History and Purposes of the Commission's Study 18 In 2016, the Legislature recognized and decided to address the problems 19 described above. That year, Assembly Member Chau authored the biennial 20 legislative resolution regarding topics assigned to the Commission for study. At 21 the request of the Assembly Committee on Judiciary, he included the following 22 new study in the resolution: 23 Resolved, That the Legislature authorizes and requests that the California Law 24 Revision Commission study, report on, and prepare recommended legislation as 25 soon as possible, considering the commission's preexisting duties and workload 26 demands, concerning the revision of the portions of the California Public Records 27 Act and related provisions, and that this legislation shall accomplish all of the 28 following objectives: 29 (1) Reduce the length and complexity of current sections. 30 (2) Avoid unnecessary cross-references. 31 (3) Neither expand nor contract the scope of existing exemptions to the general 32 rule that records are open to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the 33 Public Records Act. 34 (4) To the extent compatible with (3), use terms with common definitions. 35 (5) Organize the existing provisions in such a way that similar provisions are 36 located in close proximity to one another. 37 (6) Eliminate duplicative provisions. 38 13. Similarly, Section 6254(l) is a CPRA exemption for \"[c]orrespondence of and to the Governor or employees of the Governor's office or in the custody of or maintained by the Governor's Legal Affairs Secretary.\" Sections 6268 and 6268.5 also concern access to the Governor's records, but they are not referenced in, or located in proximity to, Section 6254(l). Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 4 - (7) Clearly express legislative intent without any change in the substantive 1 provisions ....14 2 An analysis for the Assembly Committee on Judiciary explained the need for 3 such a study: 4 The CPRA, signed into law in 1968 as a general record keeping law, allows the 5 public to monitor government activity. Since the enactment of the CPRA, it has 6 been amended multiple times to exempt certain records. ... Due to the multiple 7 changes to the statute, the CPRA has become difficult for the public to 8 understand.15 9 Similarly, an analysis for the Senate Committee on Judiciary explained: 10 Because of nearly 50 years of amendments to the CPRA, the CPRA has become 11 more difficult to understand. Making it easier for the public to understand their 12 rights to access government information will arguably lead to more access to 13 public records and more government accountability.16 14 The Legislature passed the resolution near the end of the legislative session 15 without anyone voting against it. 16 Soon afterwards, the Commission began examining the CPRA as requested. It 17 has been steadily building this tentative recommendation since then. 18 Scope of Study 19 As originally introduced, the legislative resolution instructed the Commission to 20 \"study, report on, and prepare recommended legislation ... concerning the revision 21 of the portions of the Government Code relating to public records ....\"17 It was not 22 clear whether the study was to encompass all Government Code provisions 23 relating to public records, or only those relating to inspection of public records. It 24 was also uncertain at best whether the Commission could examine any related 25 provisions located outside the Government Code, such as statutes that cross-refer 26 to the CPRA. 27 Later, however, the resolution was amended to instruct the Commission to 28 \"study, report on, and prepare recommended legislation ... concerning the revision 29 of ... the California Public Records Act and related provisions ....\"18 Given this 30 amendment, the Commission's authority appears to be limited to public records 31 14. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)); see also 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)). 15. Assembly Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (April 19, 2016), p. 3 (emphasis added). 16. Senate Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (June 14, 2016), p. 4 (emphasis added). 17. ACR 148 (Chau), as introduced on March 3, 2016 (emphasis added). 18. Due to what appears to have been an inadvertent error, the 2016 resolution referred to \"the portions of the California Public Records Act and related provisions ....\" See 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)). The italicized language was deleted when the Commission's authority to study the CPRA was reaffirmed in 2018. See 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)). Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 5 - inspection law, not other aspects of public records law (e.g., laws governing 1 retention of public records19 or criminalizing conduct relating to public records20). 2 Importantly, however, the Commission's authority does not appear to be 3 restricted to the Government Code. Rather, the Commission may examine 4 provisions located elsewhere, so long as they relate to the CPRA. The Commission 5 is thus authorized not only to prepare a recodification of the CPRA, but also to 6 recommend conforming revisions of the many statutes throughout the codes that 7 cross-refer to the CPRA. 8 Whether the Commission is authorized to go beyond conforming revisions and 9 suggest additional clean-up of record inspection laws other than the CPRA (e.g., 10 the Richard McKee Transparency Act of 201121) is not obvious from the language 11 of the resolution requesting this study. To move the study forward promptly, and 12 keep any resulting legislation manageable in size, the Commission has not done 13 so. 14 Nonsubstantive Reform 15 In directing the Commission to study the CPRA, the Legislature said that the 16 Commission's recommended legislation should \"[c]learly express legislative intent 17 without any change in the substantive provisions\" and \"[n]either expand nor 18 contract the scope of existing exemptions to the general rule that records are open 19 to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the Public Records Act.\"22 The 20 Legislature thus made clear that the Commission's work was to be entirely 21 nonsubstantive in nature. 22 The Commission took extreme care to abide by that limitation in preparing this 23 tentative recommendation. The specific measures it took to prevent any 24 substantive change are described below. 25 Objective and Participatory Study Process 26 The Commission's study process is well-suited to the development of a 27 nonsubstantive reform of the CPRA, for the following reasons: 28 The Commission is neutral and objective, with a long history of nonpartisan 29 statutory reforms.23 30 19. See, e.g., Sections 9080 (legislative records), 12220-12237 (State Archives), 14740-14746 (State Records Storage Act), 26201-26202.6 (county records), 34090-34090.8 (city records), 68150-68152 (trial court records). See also Sections 12270-12279 (State Records Management Act). 20. See, e.g., Sections 6200-6203.6 21. Sections 92950-92961. 22. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (emphasis added). 23. For a listing of reforms that have been enacted on the Commission's recommendation, see the most recent version of its Annual Report (available at www.clrc.ca.gov). Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 6 - The Commission is experienced in drafting legislation to recodify a 1 complex body of law without substantive change.24 2 The Commission actively solicits input from affected individuals and 3 interest groups. It carefully considers each comment and often makes 4 revisions in response to concerns raised. 5 In proposing a statutory reform, the Commission prepares a thorough report 6 that explains the purpose and effect of the reform. The report also includes a 7 complete draft of the proposed legislation and accompanying commentary, a 8 detailed table of contents, and a table showing the disposition of every 9 affected section. This report facilitates public review of the proposed 10 reform. 11 The Commission's work is transparent. All materials are publicly 12 distributed. All deliberations are conducted at open public meetings.25 13 Commission Comments 14 In preparing a recommendation, the Commission drafts an explanatory 15 \"Comment\" for every section that is added, amended, or repealed.26 A Comment 16 indicates the derivation of the section and often explains its relation to other law. 17 Virtually every Comment in this tentative recommendation expressly states that 18 a proposed new code section continues an existing code section \"without 19 substantive change.\"27 That is important because upon enactment of the 20 Commission's recommendation, the Comment would become a key aid in 21 determining legislative intent. 22 On completion of a final recommendation in this study, the Commission will 23 present the full recommendation, including the Comments, to the Legislature and 24 the Governor. If a bill is introduced to implement the recommendation, the 25 Commission will provide the full recommendation to each member of every policy 26 committee that reviews the bill. 27 24. See, e.g., Nonsubstantive Reorganization of Deadly Weapon Statutes, 38 Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports 217 (2009) (enacted as 2010 Cal. Stat. chs. 178 & 711, with support from both gun control and gun rights groups); Civil Discovery: Nonsubstantive Reform, 33 Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports 789 (2003) (enacted as 2004 Cal. Stat. ch. 182, without any \"no\" votes). 25. For a more thorough description of the Commission's study process, see CLRC Staff Memorandum 2012-1; B. Gaal, Evidence Legislation in California, 36 Sw. U. L. Rev. 561 (2008); see also http://www.clrc.ca.gov/Menu5_about/process.html. 26. In the proposed legislation presented in this tentative recommendation, the Comment for each proposed code section appears immediately after the code section. 27. For example, the Comment to proposed Section 7921.705 states that it \"continues former Section 6264 without substantive change.\" The Comment refers to the existing provision as \"former Section 6264\" (rather than \"Section 6264\") because the Comment would be used after enactment of the proposed law and repeal of the existing version of the CPRA. Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 7 - Commission materials that have been placed before and considered by the 1 Legislature are considered evidence of legislative intent,28 and are entitled to great 2 weight in construing statutes.29 The materials are a key interpretive aid for 3 practitioners as well as courts,30 and courts may judicially notice and rely on 4 them.31 Courts at all levels of the state32 and federal33 judicial systems use 5 Commission materials to construe statutes enacted on Commission 6 recommendation.34 7 The Commission's Comments to the proposed legislation in this study would 8 thus help to demonstrate that the legislation constitutes a purely nonsubstantive 9 recodification of the CPRA. 10 28.

Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 8 - Statements of Legislative Intent 1 The proposed law would be known as the \"CPRA Recodification Act of 2 2020.\"35 It includes several codified provisions that would expressly state the 3 purpose and effect of the recodification. 4 Proposed Section 7920.100 is a general statement regarding the nonsubstantive 5 effect of the recodification: 6 7920.100. Nothing in the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is intended to 7 substantively change the law relating to inspection of public records. The act is 8 intended to be entirely nonsubstantive in effect. Every provision of this division 9 and every other provision of this act, including, without limitation, every cross-10 reference in every provision of the act, shall be interpreted consistent with the 11 nonsubstantive intent of the act. 12 Proposed Section 7920.105 would make clear that a provision of the proposed 13 law is intended as a restatement and continuation of the provision that it restates, 14 rather than a new enactment, and that any reference to a restated provision is 15 deemed to include a reference to the section that restates it (and vice versa): 16 7920.105. (a) A provision of this division, or any other provision of the CPRA 17 Recodification Act of 2020, insofar as it is substantially the same as a previously 18 existing provision relating to the same subject matter, shall be considered as a 19 restatement and continuation thereof and not as a new enactment. 20 (b) A reference in a statute to a previously existing provision that is restated 21 and continued in this division, or in any other provision of the CPRA 22 Recodification Act of 2020, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed a 23 reference to the restatement and continuation. 24 (c) A reference in a statute to a provision of this division, or any other 25 provision of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which is substantially the 26 same as a previously existing provision, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be 27 deemed to include a reference to the previously existing provision. 28 Another provision (proposed Section 7920.110) would make clear that 29 restatement of an existing CPRA provision is not intended to have any effect, 30 positive or negative, on a judicial interpretation of the restated provision: 31 7920.110. (a) A judicial decision interpreting a previously existing provision is 32 relevant in interpreting any provision of this division, or any other provision of 33 the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and continues that 34 previously existing provision. 35 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, the Legislature 36 has not evaluated the correctness of any judicial decision interpreting a provision 37 affected by the act. 38 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended to, and does not, 39 reflect any assessment of any judicial decision interpreting any provision affected 40 by the act. 41 35. See proposed Section 7920.005 infra. Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 9 - Proposed Section 7920.115 sets forth similar rules with respect to an interpretation 1 advanced in an Attorney General opinion, because such opinions are particularly 2 common and influential in this area of the law. 3 Lastly, proposed Section 7920.120 would make clear that restatement of a 4 CPRA provision is not intended to have any effect, positive or negative, on a 5 judicial decision or Attorney General opinion on the constitutionality of the 6 restated provision: 7 7920.120. (a) A judicial decision or Attorney General opinion on the 8 constitutionality of a previously existing provision is relevant in determining the 9 constitutionality of any provision of this division, or any other provision of the 10 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and continues that previously 11 existing provision. 12 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, the Legislature 13 has not evaluated the constitutionality of any provision affected by the act, or the 14 correctness of any judicial decision or Attorney General opinion on the 15 constitutionality of any provision affected by the act. 16 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended to, and does not, 17 reflect any determination of the constitutionality of any provision affected by the 18 act. 19 The provisions discussed above would establish that enactment of the proposed 20 recodification should not be viewed as acquiescence in any court case or Attorney 21 General opinion construing the CPRA, or as an indication that the Legislature 22 assessed the constitutionality of each recodified section in enacting the 23 recodification. The proposed law would take no stand and have no effect on such 24 matters. 25 In addition to these codified statements of legislative intent, the proposed 26 legislation includes an uncodified provision that sets forth the following legislative 27 findings: 28 This act would recodify the California Public Records Act (Sections 6250 to 29 6276.48, inclusive, of the Government Code) in a more user-friendly manner 30 without changing its substance, and make conforming revisions. Consistent with 31 subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the 32 Legislature finds and declares: 33 (1) This act continues the existing substantive balance between the public's 34 right of access to information concerning the conduct of public business and 35 competing interests. This act does not impose any new limitation on the public's 36 right of access, which would require findings demonstrating the interest protected 37 by the new limitation and the need for protecting that interest. 38 (2) By making the California Public Records Act more user-friendly, this act 39 furthers the public's right of access to information concerning the conduct of 40 public business. 41 These legislative findings would further reinforce the nonsubstantive nature of the 42 reform. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 10 - Conservative Drafting 1 In preparing this tentative recommendation, the Commission used a conservative 2 drafting approach. It stuck closely to the existing statutory text, to further 3 minimize the risk of a substantive change. 4 The Commission was especially cautious with Section 6254(f), the exemption 5 pertaining to law enforcement records. Although that provision is particularly 6 complex and difficult to understand, the Commission refrained from attempting to 7 rephrase it more clearly.36 Instead, to avoid generating concerns about a 8 substantive change, the proposed legislation would relocate the substance of 9 Section 6254(f) in a new article almost verbatim.37 An adjacent article would 10 contain the substance of the related provisions previously mentioned (Sections 11 6254.30 and 6262).38 12 Legislative Process 13 After the Commission completes its study process and issues a final 14 recommendation, the proposed law would be scrutinized carefully in the 15 legislative process, just like any other bill. This would serve as a final safeguard 16 against any substantive change in the law. 17 Drafting Approach 18 As discussed above, the Commission used a conservative drafting approach in 19 preparing this tentative recommendation. Other significant drafting techniques and 20 decisions are described below. 21 Location of the Proposed Law 22 The CPRA is currently codified as \"Chapter 3.5. Inspection of Public Records\" 23 in \"Division 7. Miscellaneous\" in \"Title 1. General\" in the Government Code. It is 24 divided into two articles: 25 \"Article 1. General Provisions,\"39 which contains the heart of the CPRA. 26 \"Article 2. Other Exemptions from Disclosure,\"40 which contains a list of 27 CPRA exemptions (\"the CPRA index\"), most of which are located outside 28 the CPRA. 29 To effectively reorganize the CPRA, it would be helpful to be able to divide the 30 material now in \"Article 1. General Provisions\" into various subcategories, placing 31 36. Similarly, the Commission refrained from addressing the apparently minor substantive issues that are listed at the end of its report in \"Appendix B. Minor Clean-Up Issues for Possible Future Legislative Attention.\" 37. See proposed Sections 7923.600-7923.625 infra. 38. See proposed Sections 7923.650-7923.655 infra. 39. Sections 6250-6270.7. 40. Sections 6275-6276.48. Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 11 - similar provisions together. That would further the legislative objective to 1 \"[o]rganize the existing provisions in such a way that similar provisions are 2 located in close proximity to one another.\"41 3 In the hierarchy of the Government Code, an article is the lowest level heading 4 used to organize code sections. Because an article cannot be further subdivided, it 5 would be difficult to effectively reorganize the CPRA in its current code location. 6 Instead, the proposed law would repeal the existing CPRA and recodify its 7 substance in a new division (Division 10) of Title 1 of the Government Code. This 8 would make it possible to divide that material into parts,42 chapters, and articles \u2014 9 enough subcategories to create a user-friendly organizational scheme.43 10 Structure of the Proposed Law 11 New Division 10 would be divided into six parts, as follows: 12 Part 1. General Provisions. 13 Part 2. Disclosure and Exemptions Generally. 14 Part 3. Procedures. 15 Part 4. Enforcement. 16 Part 5. Specific Types of Public Records. 17 Part 6. Other Exemptions From Disclosure. 18 The content of each part is described briefly below. 19 Proposed \"Part 1. General Provisions\"44 consists of two chapters. \"Chapter 1. 20 Preliminary Provisions\" includes the short title of the law,45 the statements of 21 legislative intent described above,46 and a few other preliminary provisions.47 22 \"Chapter. 2. Definitions\" consists of some definitions that apply to the entire 23 CPRA.48 That chapter also includes (1) a signpost provision alerting readers to two 24 differing definitions of \"trade secret\" used in the CPRA,49 (2) the definition of 25 41. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)); see also 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)) (reaffirming Commission's authority to study CPRA). 42. There is precedent for using \"part\" as a subheading within the Government Code. See \"Division 3.6. Claims and Actions Against Public Entities and Public Employees\" (Sections 810-998.3). 43. In deciding to relocate the CPRA, the Commission noted that the CPRA is currently located near several other chapters that pertain to public records (see Chapters 3, 3.01, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 of Division 7 of Title 1). To alert CPRA users to that material, the Commission's Comment to the introductory provision in new Division 10 would refer each of those chapters. See proposed Section 7920.000 Comment infra. 44.

Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 12 - \"elected or appointed official,\" which is used in a CPRA-wide definition,50 and (3) 1 a definition of \"former Section 6254 provisions,\" which will provide a convenient 2 means of collectively referring to the material that is currently located in Section 3 6254 (an unmanageably long section) but would be split up in the recodification.51 4 The definitions in \"Chapter 2. Definitions\" would be in alphabetical order. The 5 other definitions used in the CPRA have limited application and would remain in 6 close proximity to the substantive material to which they pertain.52 7 Proposed \"Part 2. Disclosure and Exemptions Generally\"53 consists of three 8 chapters. \"Chapter 1. Right of Access to Public Records\" contains the legislative 9 findings and declarations for the CPRA.54 The chapter also contains some 10 restrictions on an agency's ability to transfer a public record or otherwise 11 relinquish control over its disclosure.55 \"Chapter 2. General Rules Governing 12 Disclosure\"56 and \"Chapter 3. General Rules Governing Exemptions from 13 Disclosure\"57 contain material corresponding to their respective titles. Among 14 other things, the CPRA catch-all exemption (existing Section 6255(a)) would be in 15 \"Chapter 3. General Rules Governing Exemptions from Disclosure.\"58 16 Proposed \"Part 3. Procedures\"59 contains a chapter on how to request a public 17 record, which is divided into several articles.60 Among other things, the chapter 18 includes the basic rule on inspection of a public record61 and the basic rule on 19 copying of a public record.62 Proposed \"Part 3. Procedures\" also contains a second 20 chapter, which consists of the CPRA's procedural rules governing agency 21 regulations, guidelines, systems, and similar matters.63 22 Proposed \"Part 4. Enforcement\"64 contains provisions relating to enforcement of 23 a CPRA request. It is divided into two chapters: (1) a chapter of general principles 24 50. See proposed Section 7920.500 infra. 51. See proposed Section 7920.505 infra. 52. See, e.g., proposed Sections 7924.100 and 7924.105 infra. 53. Proposed Sections 7921.000-7922.210 proposed Section 7921.000 infra (recodifying 55.

Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 13 - relating to enforcement65 and (2) a chapter of procedural provisions, which is 1 further subdivided into an article on superior court procedures66 and an article on 2 writ review.67 3 Proposed \"Part 5. Specific Types of Public Records\"68 consists of provisions 4 (mostly exemptions) that relate to a specific type of public record. It is divided into 5 nineteen different chapters, each addressing a particular subject matter, such as 6 \"Crimes, Weapons, and Law Enforcement\"69 or \"Health Care.\"70 The chapters are 7 arranged in alphabetical order. 8 Lastly, proposed \"Part 6. Other Exemptions From Disclosure\"71 contains the 9 CPRA's alphabetical index of exemptions,72 which is not substantive law but 10 rather a tool designed by the Legislature to assist CPRA users locate exemptions 11 scattered throughout the codes.73 Part 6 would continue that index in essentially its 12 current, alphabetical format.74 The Commission considered, but tentatively 13 rejected, other possibilities,75 such as reorganizing the index by subject matter76 or 14 relocating all of the exemptions into the CPRA (thus separating them from other 15 substantive provisions on the same subject matter).77 Comments on the optimal 16 format for the CPRA index would be especially helpful. 17 65.

For further discussion of the CPRA index, see CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-25. 74. The Commission checked each entry in the index and updated some problematic entries as noted in the Comments to proposed Sections 7930.105-7930.115, 7930.130-7930.135, 7930.145, and 7930.155-7930.205 infra and discussed in the accompanying Notes. The Commission also added an entry for California's constitutional right of privacy (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1), because it is so fundamental. See proposed Section 7930.100 infra. The Commission did not attempt to find other provisions that should be added to the CPRA index. Such research would time-consuming and could significantly delay the progress of this study. It is not essential at this time, because the index is just a user guide (not substantive law) and does not purport to be exhaustive. See Sections 6275-6276 (proposed Sections 7930.000-7930.005 infra). 75. See CLRC Minutes (April 2019), p. 6. 76. See CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-25, pp. 6-8 & attached \"Partial Draft of 'Part 6. Other Exemptions From Disclosure' of Proposed New Division 10 of Title 1 of the Government Code.\" 77. See CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-25, pp. 5-6. Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 14 - Numbering System 1 Throughout the proposed legislation, the Commission used a 3-digit decimal 2 system for numbering code sections (e.g., Section 7920.000). The Commission 3 also left gaps in the numbering, to allow ready insertion of new statutory material 4 in an appropriate location if needed in the future. 5 This numbering approach will prevent confusion regarding the proper 6 sequencing of code sections. It will also promote logical, user-friendly 7 organization as the CPRA continues to evolve. 8 Short, Simple Sections 9 The legislative resolution on this study instructs the Commission to \"[r]educe 10 the length and complexity of current sections.\"78 The CPRA currently contains a 11 number of long and complicated sections, most notably Section 6254, which spans 12 eight singled-spaced pages if printed from the Legislative Counsel's website 13 (5,583 words), with subdivisions labeled from (a) to (z) followed by (aa) to (ad), 14 some of which are split into paragraphs, subparagraphs, and even unnumbered 15 provisions.79 16 Excessively long sections can obscure relevant details of law, especially if a 17 single section addresses several different subjects. A better approach is to divide 18 the law into a larger number of smaller sections, with each section limited to a 19 single subject. 20 Short sections have numerous advantages. They enhance readability and 21 understanding of the law, and make it easier to locate and refer to pertinent 22 material. In contrast to a long section, a short section can be amended without 23 undue technical difficulties80 and new material can be inserted where logically 24 appropriate, facilitating sound development of the law.81 The use of short sections 25 78. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)); see also 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)) (reaffirming Commission's authority to study CPRA). 79. Other, less egregious examples in the CPRA include Sections 6253, 6254.2, 6254.18, and 6254.21. 80. The full text of a section must be set forth in any bill amending the section. Joint Rule 10. A lengthy bill entails higher printing costs than a short one. It also takes longer to review. Much of the material may be unrelated to a proposed reform, wasting reviewers' time and potentially injecting additional issues into a simple proposal. Further, the likelihood that two bills will be introduced to amend the same section is greater if a section is long and covers multiple topics than if a section is short and limited to a single topic. If two bills affect the same section and both are enacted, the bill that is signed last generally prevails over the other bill, rendering it a nullity. Section 9605. This can be avoided by double-jointing the bills or including other language to address the conflict. Taking such steps entails expense and effort, however, and introduces new possibilities for errors. 81. In amending a short section, the Legislature is unhampered by constraints such as overlong paragraphs and lack of available subparts. This promotes clear and straightforward drafting, as opposed to confusing and convoluted provisions. Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 15 - is the preferred drafting technique of the California Code Commission,82 the 1 Legislature,83 the Legislative Counsel,84 and the Law Revision Commission.85 2 For all of the reasons discussed above, the proposed law would divide lengthy 3 sections into shorter and simpler provisions. The number of sections would 4 approximately double, but the word count would not change that much. 5 Signposting in Comments 6 In the proposed legislation, the Comment accompanying each code section 7 would refer to other provisions (particularly within the CPRA) that may be of 8 interest to users.86 This would help CPRA users locate material relevant to their 9 situations. 10 Cross-References 11 The CPRA contains numerous internal cross-references. In the proposed 12 legislation, the Commission updated each such cross-reference to reflect the new 13 numbering scheme in the recodification. 14 To facilitate review of the updated cross-references, this tentative 15 recommendation includes two tables, located immediately after the proposed 16 legislation. One table shows the disposition of each existing code section; the 17 other table shows the derivation of each proposed code section. 18 The CPRA also contains numerous cross-references to statutes located outside 19 the CPRA. The Commission checked each of those cross-references, as well as 20 each of the internal cross-references, in preparing this tentative recommendation. 21 A few of the cross-references in the current version of the CPRA are plainly 22 erroneous. Where the proper cross-reference is obvious, the Commission corrected 23 the cross-reference in the proposed legislation, rather than perpetuating the error. 24 The cross-reference corrections are explained in the accompanying Comments; 25 they are also listed and explained in Appendix A. Where the proper cross-26 reference is not altogether obvious, the Commission left the cross-reference alone, 27 so as not to create a risk of a substantive change. Notes in the tentative 28 recommendation seek input on the problematic cross-references. 29 There are also many code sections located outside the CPRA that cross-refer to 30 one or more provisions within the CPRA. Those cross-references will also need to 31 be conformed to the new numbering scheme in the recodification. The 32 82.

See, e.g., proposed Section 7920.000 Comment & proposed Section 7921.000 Comment infra. Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 16 - Commission will prepare and circulate a separate tentative recommendation with 1 those conforming revisions. 2 Pending and Future Legislation 3 There are pending bills to revise the CPRA in one way or another.87 If one or 4 more of those bills is enacted, the Commission will incorporate the substance of 5 the enacted bill(s) into the proposed recodification, without substantive change. 6 There are also pending bills that would affect provisions that are listed, or 7 should be listed, in the CPRA index.88 If any of those bills is enacted, the 8 Commission will make an appropriate adjustment in the proposed continuation of 9 the CPRA index. 10 When the Commission eventually approves a final recommendation and a 11 legislator introduces a bill to implement that recommendation, there might be 12 conflicts between that bill and other pending bills (i.e., they might try to revise the 13 same code provision in different ways). If so, the Commission will recommend 14 double-jointing amendments or other steps to eliminate the conflicts and 15 coordinate the bills. The Commission will take similar steps with regard to any bill 16 that might bear on the content of the CPRA index. Any such adjustments will be 17 consistent with the nonsubstantive nature of this study. 18 Delayed Operative Date 19 Because of the breadth of the organizational changes that would be made by the 20 proposed legislation, the Commission recommends that it be given a delayed 21 operative date. The proposed legislation includes an uncodified provision to that 22 effect, which would delay the operation of the proposed law by six months (i.e., 23 until July 1, 2021).89 24 This delayed operation would provide time for those who work closely with the 25 affected statutes, including legal publishers, to adjust to the new organizational 26 scheme before it takes effect. The Commission's comments and the disposition 27 and derivation tables in the Commission's report would also help ease the 28 transition. 29 Although the proposed recodification would entail some transitional costs (such 30 as updating manuals and regulations), the Commission believes that the long-term 31 benefits of having a better organized, more user-friendly statutory scheme would 32 87. See, e.g., AB 54 (Ting); AB 1184 (Gloria); AB 749 (Durazo); see also AB 289 (Fong) (proposing to create California Public Records Act Ombudsperson). 88. See, e.g., AB 800 (Chu); SB 557 (Jones). 89. In general, a bill passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor becomes operative on January 1 of the year after its enactment. See Cal. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 8(c)(1); Gov't Code \u00a7 9600(a). For a variety of reasons, some bills specify a delayed operative date. See, e.g., Preston v. State Bd. of Equalization, 25 Cal. 4th 197, 223-24, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 407 (2001); Cline v. Lewis, 175 Cal. 315, 318 (1917); Johnston v. Alexis, 153 Cal. App. 3d 33, 40 (1984). Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 17 - soon outweigh those transitional costs. The CPRA would become more readily 1 accessible and understandable to laypersons and other persons using it, thus 2 furthering its underlying purposes. Importantly, the new statutory scheme would 3 also afford ample room for future refinement of the CPRA, promoting sound 4 development of the law. 5 Request for Public Comment 6 The Commission seeks public comment on its tentative recommendation. It 7 encourages comments on any aspect of the proposal, but it would especially 8 appreciate comments on the issues identified in the Notes that accompany some of 9 the proposed legislation. 10 Comments can be in any format and can be emailed to bgaal@clrc.ca.gov. 11 Comments supporting the proposed approach are just as important as comments 12 suggesting changes to that approach or expressing other views. 13 Comments from knowledgeable persons are invaluable in the Commission's 14 study process. 15 ____________________ Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 18 - Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 19 - Contents PROPOSED LEGISLATION ........................................................................................................................ 27 Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48 (repealed).

MINOR CLEAN-UP ISSUES FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION ................................................................................................................... 217 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 26 - Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 27 - PROPOSED LEGISLATION Note. A draft of an official Commission \"Comment\" follows each proposed code section in the 1 proposed recodification. Such Comments will be included in any final recommendation. The 2 Comments indicate the source of each recodified code section (or provision within the code section) 3 and describe how the recodified code section (or provision) compares with prior law. Courts have 4 routinely held that the Commission's Comments are evidence of legislative intent with regard to 5 any legislation that implements a Commission recommendation. 6 There is a \"disposition table\" at the end of the proposed recodification. It summarizes, in tabular 7 form, the disposition of every provision of the existing code that has been included in this proposed 8 recodification. 9 There is also a \"derivation table\" at the end of the proposed recodification. It summarizes, in 10 tabular form, the statutory derivation of every new code provision in this proposed recodification. 11 Some provisions in this draft are followed by a \"Note.\" Most of the Notes are intended to be 12 temporary and will not be part of the Commission's final recommendation. In general, the Notes 13 serve to flag issues requiring special attention or treatment. 14 Almost all of the proposed provisions would be located in the Government Code. All references 15 are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated. 16 The Commission welcomes public comment on any issue relating to the content of this draft or 17 any other aspect of its ongoing CPRA Clean-Up study. Comments should be directed to Barbara 18 Gaal, Chief Deputy Counsel (bgaal@clrc.ca.gov). 19 Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48 (repealed). California Public Records Act 20 SEC. ___. Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 21 of the Government Code is repealed. 22 Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 7920.000-7930.215 (added). California Public Records Act 23 SEC. ___. Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) is added to Title 1 24 of the Government Code, to read: 25 DIVISION 10. ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS 26 PART 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS 27 CHAPTER 1. PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS 28 Article 1. Short Titles 29 \u00a7 7920.000. California Public Records Act 30 7920.000. This division shall be known and may be cited as the California Public 31 Records Act. 32 Comment. Section 7920.000 continues former Section 6251 without substantive change. The 33 California Public Records Act or \"CPRA\" was formerly codified as Chapter 3.5 (commencing with 34 Section 6250) of Division 7 of this title. 35 For a similar law pertaining to federal agencies, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (\"Freedom of Information 36 Act\" or \"FOIA\"). 37 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 28 - For a key constitutional provision on \"access to information concerning the conduct of the 1 people's business,\" see Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 3(b). For legislative findings and declarations 2 underlying the CPRA, see Section 7921.000. For an alphabetical list of many CPRA exemptions 3 (most of which are located outside the CPRA), see Sections 7930.000-7930.215. 4 For guidance on access to legislative records, see Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 9070-9080 (\"Legislative Open 5 Records Act\"). For discussion of provisions and doctrines governing access to judicial records, see, 6 e.g., NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court, 20 Cal. 4th 1178, 980 P.2d 330, 86 Cal. 7 Rptr. 2d 778 (1999). For a law on access to the records of certain quasi-public entities, see Educ. 8 Code \u00a7\u00a7 72690-72701, 89913-89919, 92950-92961 (Richard McKee Transparency Act). 9 For guidance on record retention, see, e.g., Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 9080 (legislative records), 12220-10 12237 (State Archives), 14740-14746 (State Records Storage Act), 26201-26202.6 (county 11 records), 34090-34090.8 (city records), 68150-68152 (trial court records). See also Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 12 12270-12279 (State Records Management Act). 13 Many other statutes and sources of law govern public records. For instance, the following statutes 14 are located in Division 7 of this title, where the CPRA was formerly codified: Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6200-15 6203 (crimes relating to public records, documents and certificates), 6204-6204.4 (public records 16 protection and recovery), 6205-6210 (address confidentiality for victims of domestic violence, 17 sexual assault, and stalking), 6215-6216 (address confidentiality for reproductive health care 18 service providers, employees, volunteers, and patients), 6219 (governmental linguistics). 19 \u00a7 7920.005. CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 20 7920.005. This division recodifies the provisions of former Chapter 3.5 21 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of this title. The act that added this 22 division shall be known and may be cited as the \"CPRA Recodification Act of 23 2020.\" 24 Comment. Section 7920.005 is new. It provides a convenient means of referring to the 25 recodification of former Sections 6250-6276.48. For background, see California Public Records 26 Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). 27 Note. In drafting proposed Section 7920.005, the Commission assumed that it will approve a final 28 recommendation in this study in 2019 and seek introduction of implementing legislation in 2020. 29 The dates in Section 7920.005 and the accompanying Comment will require adjustment if those 30 assumptions prove incorrect. 31 Article 2. Effect of Recodification 32 \u00a7 7920.100. Nonsubstantive reform 33 7920.100. Nothing in the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is intended to 34 substantively change the law relating to inspection of public records. The act is 35 intended to be entirely nonsubstantive in effect. Every provision of this division and 36 every other provision of this act, including, without limitation, every cross-reference 37 in every provision of the act, shall be interpreted consistent with the nonsubstantive 38 intent of the act. 39 Comment. Section 7920.100 is new. It is modeled on Penal Code Section 16005. It makes clear 40 that the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 has no substantive impact. The act is intended solely to 41 make the California Public Records Act more user-friendly. For background, see California Public 42 Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). 43 For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision interpreting a predecessor of a 44 provision in this division, see Section 7920.110. For specific guidance on the impact of an Attorney 45 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 29 - General opinion interpreting a predecessor of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.115. 1 For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision or Attorney General opinion assessing 2 the constitutionality of a predecessor of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.120. 3 See Sections 7920.005 Continuation of existing law 5 7920.105. (a) A provision of this division, or any other provision of the CPRA 6 Recodification Act of 2020, insofar as it is substantially the same as a previously 7 existing provision relating to the same subject matter, shall be considered as a 8 restatement and continuation thereof and not as a new enactment. 9 (b) A reference in a statute to a previously existing provision that is restated and 10 continued in this division, or in any other provision of the CPRA Recodification Act 11 of 2020, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed a reference to the 12 restatement and continuation. 13 (c) A reference in a statute to a provision of this division, or any other provision 14 of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which is substantially the same as a 15 previously existing provision, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed to 16 include a reference to the previously existing provision. 17 Comment. Subdivision (a) of Section 7920.105 is new. It is similar to Section 2, which is a 18 standard provision found in many codes. See, e.g., Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 2; Corp. Code \u00a7 2; Code \u00a7 2(a); Veh. Code \u00a7 2. 20 Subdivision (b) is drawn from Section 9604 and Penal Code Section 16010(b). 21 Subdivision (c) is drawn from Family Code Section 2 and Penal Code Section 16010(c). 22 See Section 7920.005 (\"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\"). 23 \u00a7 7920.110. Judicial decision interpreting former law 24 7920.110. (a) A judicial decision interpreting a previously existing provision is 25 relevant in interpreting any provision of this division, or any other provision of the 26 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and continues that previously 27 existing provision. 28 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, the Legislature 29 has not evaluated the correctness of any judicial decision interpreting a provision 30 affected by the act. 31 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended to, and does not, reflect 32 any assessment of any judicial decision interpreting any provision affected by the 33 act. 34 Comment. Section 7920.110 is new. It is modeled on Penal Code Section 16020. 35 Subdivision (a) makes clear that case law construing a predecessor provision is relevant in 36 construing its successor in the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020. 37 Subdivisions (b) and (c) make clear that in recodifying former Sections 6250-6276.48, the 38 Legislature has not taken any position on any case interpreting any of those provisions. 39 For specific guidance on the impact of an Attorney General opinion interpreting a predecessor 40 of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.115. For specific guidance on the impact of a 41 judicial decision or Attorney General opinion assessing the constitutionality of a predecessor of a 42 provision in this division, see Section 7920.120. For general guidance on the nonsubstantive impact 43 of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, see Section 7920.100. 44 See Section 7920.005 (\"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\"). 45 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 30 - \u00a7 7920.115. Attorney General opinion interpreting former law 1 7920.115. (a) An opinion of the Attorney General interpreting a previously 2 existing provision is relevant in interpreting any provision of this division, or any 3 other provision of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and 4 continues that previously existing provision. 5 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, the Legislature 6 has not evaluated the correctness of any Attorney General opinion interpreting a 7 provision affected by the act. 8 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended to, and does not, reflect 9 any assessment of any Attorney General opinion interpreting any provision affected 10 by the act. 11 Comment. Section 7920.115 is new. It is comparable to Section 7920.110, but it pertains to 12 Attorney General opinions rather than judicial decisions. 13 Subdivision (a) makes clear that Attorney General opinions construing a predecessor provision 14 are relevant in construing its successor in the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020. 15 Subdivisions (b) and (c) make clear that in recodifying former Sections 6250-6276.48, the 16 Legislature has not taken any position on any Attorney General opinion interpreting any of those 17 provisions. 18 For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision interpreting a predecessor of a 19 provision in this division, see Section 7920.110. For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial 20 decision or Attorney General opinion assessing the constitutionality of a predecessor of a provision 21 in this division, see Section 7920.120. For general guidance on the nonsubstantive impact of the 22 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, see Section 7920.100. 23 See 7920.005 (\"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\"). 24 \u00a7 7920.120. Constitutionality 25 7920.120. (a) A judicial decision or Attorney General opinion on the 26 constitutionality of a previously existing provision is relevant in determining the 27 constitutionality of any provision of this division, or any other provision of the 28 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and continues that previously 29 existing provision. 30 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, the Legislature 31 has not evaluated the constitutionality of any provision affected by the act, or the 32 correctness of any judicial decision or Attorney General opinion on the 33 constitutionality of any provision affected by the act. 34 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended to, and does not, reflect 35 any determination of the constitutionality of any provision affected by the act. 36 Comment. Section 7920.120 is new. It is modeled on Penal Code Section 16025. Due to the 37 prevalence and significant impact of Attorney General opinions on CPRA issues, the section 38 expressly refers to Attorney General opinions as well as judicial decisions. 39 Subdivision (a) makes clear that case law and Attorney General opinions on the constitutionality 40 of a predecessor provision are relevant in determining the constitutionality of its successor in the 41 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020. 42 Subdivisions (b) and (c) make clear that in recodifying former Sections 6250-6276.48, the 43 Legislature has not taken any position on the constitutionality of any of those provisions. 44 For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision interpreting a predecessor of a 45 provision in this division, see Section 7920.110. For specific guidance on the impact of an Attorney 46 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 31 - General opinion interpreting a predecessor of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.115. 1 For general guidance on the nonsubstantive impact of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, see 2 Section 7920.100. 3 See Section 7920.005 (\"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\"). 4 Article 3. Effect of Division 5 \u00a7 7920.200. Effect of division 6 7920.200. The provisions of this division shall not be deemed in any manner to 7 affect the status of judicial records as it existed immediately prior to the effective 8 date of the provision that is continued in this section, nor to affect the rights of 9 litigants, including parties to administrative proceedings, under the laws of 10 discovery of this state, nor to limit or impair any rights of discovery in a criminal 11 case. 12 Comment. Section 7920.200 continues former Section 6260 without substantive change. 13 Former Section 6260 was enacted in 1968 (see 1968 Cal. Stat. ch. 1473, \u00a7 39) and amended in 14 1976 to insert the phrase \"nor to limit or impair any rights of discovery in a criminal case\" (see 15 1976 Cal. Stat. ch. 314, \u00a7 2). The effective date of the original enactment was January 1, 1969. See 16 Cal. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 8(c)(1); Gov't Code \u00a7 9600(a). 17 7920.500. \"Elected or appointed official\" 19 7920.500. For purposes of Article 3 (commencing with Section 7928.200) of 20 Chapter 5, \"elected or appointed official\" includes, but is not limited to, all of the 21 following: 22 (a) A state constitutional officer. 23 (b) A member of the Legislature. 24 (c) A judge or court commissioner. 25 (d) A district attorney. 26 (e) A public defender. 27 (f) A member of a city council. 28 (g) A member of a board of supervisors. 29 (h) An appointee of the Governor. 30 (i) An appointee of the Legislature. 31 (j) A mayor. 32 (k) A city attorney. 33 (l) A police chief or sheriff. 34 (m) A public safety official. 35 (n) A state administrative law judge. 36 (o) A federal judge or federal defender. 37 (p) A member of the United States Congress or appointee of the President. 38 Comment. Section 7920.500 continues former Section 6254.21(f) without substantive change. 39 See Section 13 (singular includes plural and vice versa). 40 See Section 7920.535 (\"public safety official\"). 41 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - - \u00a7 7920.505. \"Former Section 6254 provisions\" 1 7920.505. (a) The following provisions are continuations of provisions that were 2 included in former Section 6254 as that section read when it was repealed by the 3 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020: 4 (1) Section 7921.500. 5 (2) Article 1 (commencing with Section 7923.600) of Chapter 1 of Part 5. 6 (3) Section 7923.700. 7 (4) Sections 7923.800 and 7923.805. 8 (5) Section 7924.505. 9 (6) Section 7925.000 10 (7) Section 7925.005. 11 (8) Section 7925.010. 12 (9) Section 7926.000. 13 (10) Section 7926.100. 14 (11) Section 7926.200. 15 (12) Section 7926.210. 16 (13) Section 7926.220, except the continuation of former Section 6254.14(b). 17 (14) Section 7926.225, except the continuation of former Section 6254.14(b). 18 (15) Section 7926.230, except the continuation of former Section 6254.14(b). 19 (16) Section 7926.235. 20 (17) Section 7927.000. 21 (18) Section 7927.100. 22 (19) Section 7927.200. 23 (20) Section 7927.300. 24 (21) Section 7927.500. 25 (22) Section 7927.700. 26 (23) Section 7927.705. 27 (24) Section 7928.000. 28 (25) Section 7928.100. 29 (26) Sections 7928.405 and 7928.410. 30 (27) Section 7928.705. 31 (28) Section 7929.000. 32 (29) Section 7929.200. 33 (30) Section 7929.205. 34 (31) Chapter 18 (commencing with Section 7929.400) of Part 5. 35 (32) Section 7929.605. 36 (b) The provisions listed in subdivision (a) may be referred to as \"former Section 37 6254 provisions.\" 38 (c) Subdivision (a) does not include any provision that was first codified in one of 39 the specified numerical ranges after the effective date of the CPRA Recodification 40 Act of 2020. 41 Comment. Section 7920.505 is new. It provides a convenient means of referring to the 42 provisions that comprised former Section 6254. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 33 - For a disposition table showing where each provision in former Section 6254 was recodified, as 1 well as a derivation table showing the source of each provision in the CPRA Recodification of 2 2020, see California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ 3 (2019). 4 See Section 7920.005 (\"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\"). 5 Note. Proposed Section 7920.505 is modeled on several provisions in the Deadly Weapons 6 Recodification Act of 2010. See Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 16575 (\"Former Article 4 of Chapter 1 provisions\"), 16585 (\"Former Section 12078 provisions\"). convenience. 9 \u00a7 7920.510. \"Local agency\" 10 7920.510. As used in this division, \"local agency\" includes any of the following: 11 (a) A county. 12 (b) A city, whether general law or chartered. 13 (c) A city and county. 14 (d) A school district. 15 (e) A municipal corporation. 16 (f) A district. 17 (g) A political subdivision. 18 (h) Any board, commission, or agency of the foregoing. 19 (i) Another local public agency. 20 (j) An entity that is a legislative body of a local agency pursuant to subdivision 21 (c) or (d) of Section 54952. 22 Comment. Section 7920.510 continues former Section 6252(a) without substantive change. 23 In subdivision (j), the erroneous reference to \"subdivisions (c) and (d) of Section 54952 that 24 appeared in former Section 6252(a) has been replaced with a reference to \"subdivision (c) or (d) of 25 Section 54952.\" (Emphasis added.) This is a technical correction. 26 See Section 7920.525 (\"public agency\"). 27 Note. Existing Section 6252(a) includes as a local agency an entity that is a legislative body of a 28 local agency pursuant to \"subdivisions (c) and (d) of Section 54952.\" (Emphasis added). 29 Those subdivisions provide: 30 54952. As used in this chapter, \"legislative body\" means: 31 .... 32 (c)(1) A board, commission, committee, or other multimember body that governs a 33 private corporation, limited liability company, or other entity that either: 34 (A) Is created by the elected legislative body in order to exercise authority that may 35 lawfully be delegated by the elected governing body to a private corporation, limited liability 36 company, or other entity. 37 (B) Receives funds from a local agency and the membership of whose governing body 38 includes a member of the legislative body of the local agency appointed to that governing 39 body as a full voting member by the legislative body of the local agency. 40 (2) Notwithstanding subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), no board, commission, 41 committee, or other multimember body that governs a private corporation, limited liability 42 company, or other entity that receives funds from a local agency and, as of February 9, 1996, 43 has a member of the legislative body of the local agency as a full voting member of the 44 governing body of that private corporation, limited liability company, or other entity shall be 45 relieved from the public meeting requirements of this chapter by virtue of a change in status 46 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 34 - of the full voting member to a nonvoting member. 1 (d) The lessee of any hospital the whole or part of which is first leased pursuant to 2 subdivision (p) of Section 32121 of the Health and Safety Code after January 1, 1994, where 3 the lessee exercises any material authority of a legislative body of a local agency delegated 4 to it by that legislative body whether the lessee is organized and operated by the local agency 5 or by a delegated authority. 6 Given the content of these provisions, it seems improbable that the Legislature intended to 7 require an entity to satisfy the requirements of both subdivisions to qualify as a \"local agency\" 8 under Section 6252(a). Proposed Section 7920.510(j) would continue this cross-reference as 9 \"subdivisions (c) or (d) of Section 54952.\" (Emphasis added.) 10 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 11 especially appreciate public comment on this revision. 12 \u00a7 7920.515. \"Member of the public\" 13 7920.515. As used in this division, \"member of the public\" means any person 14 other than a member, agent, officer, or employee of a federal, state, or local agency 15 who is acting within the scope of that membership, agency, office, or employment. 16 Comment. Section 7920.515 continues former Section 6252(b) without substantive change. 17 used in this division, \"person\" includes any natural person, 20 corporation, partnership, limited liability company, firm, or association. 21 Comment. Section 7920.520 continues former Section 6252(c) without substantive change. 22 \u00a7 7920.525. \"Public agency\" 23 7920.525. (a) As used in this division, \"public agency\" means any state or local 24 agency. 25 (b) As used in Article 5 (commencing with Section 7926.400) of Chapter 5 of Part 26 5, \"public agency\" means an entity specified in subdivision (c) of Section 7926.400. 27 Comment. Subdivision (a) of Section 7920.525 continues former Section 6252(d) without 28 substantive change. 29 Subdivision (b) is new. It is intended to help persons locate the special definition of \"public 30 agency\" that applies to the article on reproductive health services facilities (Sections 7926.400-31 7926.430). 32 used in this division, \"public records\" includes any writing 35 containing information relating to the conduct of the public's business prepared, 36 owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or 37 characteristics. 38 (b) \"Public records\" in the custody of, or maintained by, the Governor's office 39 means any writing prepared on or after January 6, 1975. 40 Comment. Section 7920.530 continues former Section 6252(e) without substantive change. (\"state agency\"), 7920.550 - \u00a7 7920.535. \"Public safety official\" 1 7920.535. As used in this division, \"public safety official\" means the following 2 parties, whether active or retired: 3 (a) A peace officer as defined in Sections 830 to 830.65, inclusive, of the Penal 4 Code, or a person who is not a peace officer, but may exercise the powers of arrest 5 during the course and within the scope of the person's employment pursuant to 6 Section 830.7 of the Penal Code. 7 (b) A public officer or other person listed in Section 1808.2 or 1808.6 of the 8 Vehicle Code. 9 (c) An \"elected or appointed official\" as defined in Section 7920.500. 10 (d) An attorney employed by the Department of Justice, the State Public Defender, 11 or a county office of the district attorney or public defender, the United States 12 Attorney, or the Federal Public Defender. 13 (e) A city attorney and an attorney who represents cities in criminal matters. 14 (f) An employee of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation who 15 supervises inmates or is required to have care or custody of a prisoner. 16 (g) A sworn or nonsworn employee who supervises inmates in a city police 17 department, a county sheriff's office, the Department of the California Highway 18 Patrol, federal, state, or a local detention facility, or a local juvenile hall, camp, 19 ranch, or home, and a probation officer as defined in Section 830.5 of the Penal 20 Code. 21 (h) A federal prosecutor, a federal criminal investigator, and a National Park 22 Service Ranger working in California. 23 (i) The surviving spouse or child of a peace officer defined in Section 830 of the 24 Penal Code, if the peace officer died in the line of duty. 25 (j) State and federal judges and court commissioners. 26 (k) An employee of the Attorney General, a district attorney, or a public defender 27 who submits verification from the Attorney General, district attorney, or public 28 defender that the employee represents the Attorney General, district attorney, or 29 public defender in matters that routinely place that employee in personal contact 30 with persons under investigation for, charged with, or convicted of, committing 31 criminal acts. 32 (l) A nonsworn employee of the Department of Justice or a police department or 33 sheriff's office that, in the course of employment, is responsible for collecting, 34 documenting, and preserving physical evidence at crime scenes, testifying in court 35 as an expert witness, and other technical duties, and a nonsworn employee that, in 36 the course of employment, performs a variety of standardized and advanced 37 laboratory procedures in the examination of physical crime evidence, determines 38 their results, and provides expert testimony in court. 39 Comment. Section 7920.535 continues former Section 6254.24 without substantive change. 40 In subdivision (b), the erroneous reference to \"Sections 1808.2 and 1808.6 of the Vehicle Code\" 41 that appeared in former Section 6254.24(b) has been replaced with a reference to \"Section 1808.2 42 or 1808.6 of the Vehicle Code.\" (Emphasis added.) This is a technical correction. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 36 - In subdivision (g), the erroneous phrase \"and a local juvenile hall, camp, ranch, or home\" that 1 appeared in former Section 6254.24(g) has been replaced with the phrase \"or a local juvenile hall, 2 camp, ranch, or home.\" (Emphasis added.) This is a technical correction. 3 See Section 7920.520 (\"person\"). 4 Notes. 5 (1) Existing Section 6254.24(b) includes as a public safety official a public officer or other 6 person listed in \"Sections 1808.2 and 1808.6 of the Vehicle Code.\" (Emphasis added). 7 The cross-referenced Vehicle Code sections provide: 8 1808.2. In addition to those specified in Section 1808.4, the home address of any 9 inspector or investigator regularly employed and paid as such in the office of a district 10 attorney or any peace officer employee of the Board of Prison Terms appearing in any record 11 of the department is confidential. 12 1808.6. (a) In addition to those specified in Section 1808.4, the home address of any of 13 the following persons, that appears in any record of the department, is confidential, if the 14 person requests the confidentiality of that information: 15 (1) The chairperson, executive officer, commissioners, and deputy commissioners of the 16 Board of Prison Terms. 17 (2) The chairperson, members, executive director, and hearing representatives of the 18 Youthful Offender Parole Board. 19 (3) The spouse or children of persons listed in this section, regardless of the spouse's or 20 child's place of residence. 21 (b) The confidential home address of any of the persons listed in subdivision (a) shall not 22 be disclosed to any person, except a court, a law enforcement agency, the State Board of 23 Equalization, or any governmental agency to which, under any provision of law, information 24 is required to be furnished from records maintained by the department. 25 (c) Any record of the department containing a confidential home address shall be open 26 to public inspection, as provided in Section 1808, if the address is completely obliterated or 27 otherwise removed from the record. The home address shall be withheld from public 28 inspection for three years following termination of office or employment, except with respect 29 to retired peace officers, whose home addresses shall be withheld from public inspection 30 permanently upon request of confidentiality at the time the information would otherwise be 31 opened. The department shall inform any person who requests a confidential home address 32 of the name of the agency that employs the individual whose address was requested. 33 Given the content of these provisions, it seems improbable that the Legislature intended to 34 require a person to be listed in both of the Vehicle Code provisions to qualify as a \"public safety 35 official\" within the meaning of Section 6254.24. In all likelihood, the cross-reference to \"Sections 36 1808.2 and 1808.6 of the Vehicle Code\" should be replaced by a reference to \"Section 1808.2 or 37 1808.6 of the Vehicle Code.\" Proposed Section 7920.535(b) would take that approach. 38 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 39 especially appreciate public comment on this revision. 40 (2) Existing Section 6254.24(g) includes as a public safety official an employee \"who 41 supervises inmates in a city police department, a county sheriff's office, the Department of the 42 California Highway Patrol, federal, state, or a local detention facility, and a local juvenile hall, 43 camp, ranch, or home....\" (Emphasis added). 44 It seems improbable that the Legislature intended this provision to include as a \"public safety 45 official\" only an employee who supervises inmates in one of the enumerated facilities for adults 46 and in one of the enumerated facilities for juveniles. Proposed Section 7920.535(g) would refer 47 instead to an employee \"who supervises inmates in a city police department, a county sheriff's 48 office, the Department of the California Highway Patrol, federal, state, or a local detention facility, 49 or a local juvenile hall, camp, ranch, or home....\" (Emphasis added). 50 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 37 - The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 1 especially appreciate public comment on this revision. 2 (3) Existing Section 6254.24(g) also includes as a public safety official \"a probation officer as 3 defined in Section 830.5 of the Penal Code.\" Although Penal Code Section 830.5 refers generically 4 to a \"probation officer,\" the section does not define nor in any way clarify the meaning of the term. 5 The term is also used in many other code sections without any definition. For further discussion of 6 this point, see CLRC Staff Memorandum 2017-50, pp. 8-10. 7 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 8 especially appreciate public comment on whether the phrase \"as defined in Section 830.5 of 9 the Penal Code\" should be retained in proposed Section 7920.535(g). 10 \u00a7 7920.540. \"State agency\" 11 7920.540. (a) As used in this division, \"state agency\" means every state office, 12 officer, department, division, bureau, board, and commission or other state body or 13 agency, except those agencies provided for in Article IV (except Section 20 thereof) 14 or Article VI of the California Constitution. 15 (b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) or any other law, \"state agency\" also means 16 the State Bar of California, as described in Section 6001 of the Business and 17 Professions Code. 18 Comment. Section 7920.540 continues former Section 6252(f) without substantive change. 19 Note. Existing Section 6252(f) refers to \"the State Bar of California, as described in Section 6001 20 of the Business and Professions Code.\" Proposed Section 7920.540(b) would include the same 21 phrase, but legislation to restructure the State Bar was recently enacted. See 2017 Cal. Stat. ch. 422 22 (SB 36 (Jackson)). Because this is a strictly nonsubstantive study on an unrelated topic, the 23 Commission has not assessed whether the substance of Section 6252(f) requires revisions to reflect 24 the restructuring of the State Bar. If legislation to make such revisions is introduced, it could be 25 coordinated with the Commission's proposal as needed to make sure that nothing is chaptered out. 26 See Section 9605. 28 7920.545. (a) is defined in subdivision (f) of Section 7924.305. 29 (b) Subdivision (f) of Section 7924.510 defines \"trade secret\" for purposes of that 30 section. 31 Comment. Section 7920.545 is new.

(a) As used in this section, \"agency\" includes a member, agent, officer, 44 or employee of the agency acting within the scope of that membership, agency, 45 office, or employment. 46 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 42 - (b) Notwithstanding any other law, if a state or local agency discloses to a member 1 of the public a public record that is otherwise exempt from this division, this 2 disclosure constitutes a waiver of the exemptions specified in: 3 (1) The provisions listed in Section 7920.505. 4 (2) Sections 7924.510 and 7924.700. 5 (3) Other similar provisions of law. 6 (c) This section, however, does not apply to any of the following disclosures: 7 (1) A disclosure made pursuant to the Information Practices Act (Chapter 1 8 (commencing with Section 1798) of Title 1.8 of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil 9 Code) or a discovery proceeding. 10 (2) A disclosure made through other legal proceedings or as otherwise required 11 by law. 12 (3) A disclosure within the scope of disclosure of a statute that limits disclosure 13 of specified writings to certain purposes. 14 (4) A disclosure not required by law, and prohibited by formal action of an elected 15 legislative body of the local agency that retains the writing. 16 (5) A disclosure made to a governmental agency that agrees to treat the disclosed 17 material as confidential. Only persons authorized in writing by the person in charge 18 of the agency shall be permitted to obtain the information. Any information obtained 19 by the agency shall only be used for purposes that are consistent with existing law. 20 (6) A disclosure of records relating to a financial institution or an affiliate thereof, 21 if the disclosure is made to the financial institution or affiliate by a state agency 22 responsible for regulation or supervision of the financial institution or affiliate. 23 (7) A disclosure of records relating to a person who is subject to the jurisdiction 24 of the Department of Business Oversight, if the disclosure is made to the person 25 who is the subject of the records for the purpose of corrective action by that person, 26 or, if a corporation, to an officer, director, or other key personnel of the corporation 27 for the purpose of corrective action, or to any other person to the extent necessary 28 to obtain information from that person for the purpose of an investigation by the 29 Department of Business Oversight. 30 (8) A disclosure made by the Commissioner of Business Oversight under Section 31 450, 452, 8009, or 18396 of the Financial Code. 32 (9) A disclosure of records relating to a person who is subject to the jurisdiction 33 of the Department of Managed Health Care, if the disclosure is made to the person 34 who is the subject of the records for the purpose of corrective action by that person, 35 or, if a corporation, to an officer, director, or other key personnel of the corporation 36 for the purpose of corrective action, or to any other person to the extent necessary 37 to obtain information from that person for the purpose of an investigation by the 38 Department of Managed Health Care. 39 Comment.

For inspection and copying of a public record, 45 see Sections 7922.525 and 7922.530. 46 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 44 - For the effect of the CPRA, see Section 7920.200; see also Sections 7920.100-7920.120 (effect 1 of CPRA recodification). For references to some other bodies of law governing public records, see 2 Section 7920.000 Comment. 3 limitations, Section 6254(f) creates a CPRA exemption for: 5 Records of complaints to, or investigations conducted by, or records of intelligence 6 information or security procedures of, the office of the Attorney General and the Department 7 of Justice, the Office of Emergency Services and any state or local police agency, or any 8 investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local police agency, or any 9 investigatory or security files compiled by any other state or local agency for correctional, 10 law enforcement, or licensing purposes. 11 That exemption (commonly known as the \"law enforcement exemption\") is subject to an 12 exception pertaining to a request by a district attorney. Section 6262 provides: 13 6262. The exemption of records of complaints to, or investigations conducted by, any 14 state or local agency for licensing purposes under subdivision (f) of Section 6254 shall not 15 apply when a request for inspection of such records is made by a district attorney. 16 The Commission considered the possibility of recodifying that exception in \"Article 3. 17 Disclosure to District Attorney and Related Matters.\" It seemed more helpful, however, to place 18 the exception in close proximity to the CPRA exemption to which it pertains \u2014 i.e., in close 19 proximity to the provision(s) that would continue the substance of Section 6254(f). That is the 20 approach taken in this draft. See proposed Section 7923.650. 21 Because the exception specifically applies to a district attorney, however, the Comment to 22 proposed Section 7921.700 would refer to it. That should help alert readers to the existence of the 23 exception. 24 Comments on this approach would be helpful. 25 \u00a7 7921.705. Enforcement of district attorney's right to inspect or copy 26 7921.705. (a) If a district attorney makes a request to a state or local agency to 27 inspect or receive a copy of a public record or class of public records not exempted 28 by this division, and the state or local agency fails or refuses to allow inspection or 29 copying within 10 working days of that request, the district attorney may petition a 30 court of competent jurisdiction to require the state or local agency to allow the 31 requested inspection or copying. 32 (b) Unless the public interest or good cause in withholding the requested records 33 clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure, the court may require the public 34 agency to allow the district attorney to inspect or copy those records. 35 Comment.

Justification for Withholding of Record 40 \u00a7 7922.000. Justification for withholding of record (CPRA catch-all exemption) 41 7922.000. An agency shall justify withholding any record by demonstrating that 42 the record in question is exempt under express provisions of this division, or that on 43 the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing the record 44 clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record. 45 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 46 - Comment. Section 7922.000 continues former Section 6255(a) without substantive change. This 1 provision is sometimes known as the \"catch-all exemption\" to the California Public Records Act 2 (\"CPRA\"). 3 For provisions governing redaction or truncation of social security numbers, see Sections 4 7922.200-7922.210.

Redaction of SSN by local agency 19 7922.200. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature that, in order to protect against the 20 risk of identity theft, a local agency shall redact social security numbers from a 21 record before disclosing the record to the public pursuant to this division. 22 (b) Nothing in this division shall be construed to require a local agency to disclose 23 a social security number. 24 (c) This section does not apply to a record maintained by a county recorder. 25 Comment. Section 7922.200 continues former Section 6254.29 without substantive change. 26 For truncation of a social security number by a county recorder, see Section 7922.205. For 27 truncation of a social security number with regard to a secured transaction, see Section 7922.210. 28 For additional exemptions to the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") and special rules 29 applicable to specific types of public records (including some rules relating to social security 30 numbers), see Sections 7922.000, 7923.600-7929.610; see also Sections 7930.000-7930.215 31 (alphabetical list of many CPRA exemptions). 32 For legislative findings and declarations underlying the CPRA, see Section 7921.000.

Nothing in this division shall be construed to require the disclosure by 21 a filing office of any \"official filing,\" if a \"public filing\" version of that record is 22 available pursuant to Section 9526.5 of the Commercial Code. 23 Comment. Section 7922.210 continues former Section 6254.28 without substantive change. 24 The erroneous references to an \"official record\" and a \"public record\" in former Section 6254.28 25 have been replaced with references to an \"official filing\" and a \"public filing,\" respectively, to 26 conform to the terminology used in Commercial Code Section 9526.5. This is a technical 27 correction. 28 For redaction of a social security number by a local agency, see Section 7922.200. For truncation 29 of a social security number by a county recorder, see Section 7922.205.

For references to some other bodies of law governing public records, see 43 Section 7920.000 Comment. 44 Note. The provision cross-referenced in Section 6254.28 does not refer to either an \"official record\" 45 or a \"public record,\" despite the inference to the contrary in Section 6254.28. Instead, Commercial 46 Code Section 9526.5 refers to and defines an \"official filing\" and a \"public filing\": 47 48 9526.5. (a) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following 49 meanings: 50 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 48 - (1) \"Official filing\" means the permanent archival filing of all instruments, papers, 1 records, and attachments as accepted for filing by a filing office. 2 (2) \"Public filing\" means a filing that is an exact copy of an official filing except that any 3 social security number contained in the copied filing is truncated. The public filing shall have 4 the same legal force and effect as the official filing. ... 5 This slight disconnect in terminology probably stems from Section 6254.27 (proposed Section 6 7922.205), which concerns disclosure of a record in the possession of a county recorder. The article 7 cross-referenced in that adjacent, very similar section does refer to both an \"official record\" and a 8 \"public record.\" 9 Proposed Section 7922.210 would make nonsubstantive revisions to Section 6254.28 to conform 10 to the terminology used in the cross-referenced code section, by (1) replacing the term \"official 11 record\" with \"official filing\" and (2) replacing the term \"public record\" with \"public filing.\" 12 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 13 especially appreciate public comment on this revision. 14 PART 3. PROCEDURES 15 CHAPTER 1. REQUEST FOR A PUBLIC RECORD 16 Article 1. General Principles 17 \u00a7 7922.500. No delay or obstruction 18 7922.500.

In 2018, the Legislature enacted a bill renumbering Penal Code Section 288a as Penal Code 43 Section 287. See 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 423, \u00a7 49 (SB 1494 (Committee on Public Safety)). That bill 44 included a conforming revision of Section 6254(f)(3), but the conforming revision was chaptered 45 out by another bill. See Section 9605 (bill conflict rules); 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 423, \u00a7\u00a7 27 (conforming 46 revision), 130 (subordination clause); 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 960, \u00a7 1 (AB 748 (Ting)). 47 As noted in the accompanying Comment, proposed Section 7923.620 would continue the 48 substance of Section 6254(f)(3), with revisions to reflect the renumbering of Penal Code Section 49 288a (in the same manner as the conforming revision that was chaptered out). 50 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 76 - \u00a7 7923.625. Video or audio recording relating to critical incident 1 7923.625. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, commencing July 2 1, 2019, a video or audio recording that relates to a critical incident, as defined in 3 subdivision (e), may be withheld only as follows: 4 (a)(1) During an active criminal or administrative investigation, disclosure of a 5 recording related to a critical incident may be delayed for no longer than 45 calendar 6 days after the date the agency knew or reasonably should have known about the 7 incident, if, based on the facts and circumstances depicted in the recording, 8 disclosure would substantially interfere with the investigation, such as by 9 endangering the safety of a witness or a confidential source. If an agency delays 10 disclosure pursuant to this section, the agency shall provide in writing to the 11 requester the specific basis for the agency's determination that disclosure would 12 substantially interfere with the investigation and the estimated date for disclosure. 13 (2) After 45 days from the date the agency knew or reasonably should have known 14 about the incident, and up to one year from that date, the agency may continue to 15 delay disclosure of a recording if the agency demonstrates that disclosure would 16 substantially interfere with the investigation. After one year from the date the 17 agency knew or reasonably should have known about the incident, the agency may 18 continue to delay disclosure of a recording only if the agency demonstrates by clear 19 and convincing evidence that disclosure would substantially interfere with the 20 investigation. If an agency delays disclosure pursuant to this paragraph, the agency 21 shall promptly provide in writing to the requester the specific basis for the agency's 22 determination that the interest in preventing interference with an active investigation 23 outweighs the public interest in disclosure and provide the estimated date for the 24 disclosure. The agency shall reassess withholding and notify the requester every 30 25 days. A recording withheld by the agency shall be disclosed promptly when the 26 specific basis for withholding is resolved. 27 (b)(1) If the agency demonstrates, on the facts of the particular case, that the 28 public interest in withholding a video or audio recording clearly outweighs the 29 public interest in disclosure because the release of the recording would, based on 30 the facts and circumstances depicted in the recording, violate the reasonable 31 expectation of privacy of a subject depicted in the recording, the agency shall 32 provide in writing to the requester the specific basis for the expectation of privacy 33 and the public interest served by withholding the recording and may use redaction 34 technology, including blurring or distorting images or audio, to obscure those 35 specific portions of the recording that protect that interest. However, the redaction 36 shall not interfere with the viewer's ability to fully, completely, and accurately 37 comprehend the events captured in the recording and the recording shall not 38 otherwise be edited or altered. 39 (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the agency demonstrates that the 40 reasonable expectation of privacy of a subject depicted in the recording cannot 41 adequately be protected through redaction as described in paragraph (1) and that 42 interest outweighs the public interest in disclosure, the agency may withhold the 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 77 - recording from the public, except that the recording, either redacted as provided in 1 paragraph (1) or unredacted, shall be disclosed promptly, upon request, to any of 2 the following: 3 (A) The subject of the recording whose privacy is to be protected, or the subject's 4 authorized representative. 5 (B) If the subject is a minor, the parent or legal guardian of the subject whose 6 privacy is to be protected. 7 (C) If the subject whose privacy is to be protected is deceased, an heir, 8 beneficiary, designated immediate family member, or authorized legal 9 representative of the deceased subject whose privacy is to be protected. 10 (3) If disclosure pursuant to paragraph (2) would substantially interfere with an 11 active criminal or administrative investigation, the agency shall provide in writing 12 to the requester the specific basis for the agency's determination that disclosure 13 would substantially interfere with the investigation, and provide the video or audio 14 recording. Thereafter, the recording may be withheld by the agency for 45 calendar 15 days, subject to extensions as set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (a). 16 (c) An agency may provide greater public access to video or audio recordings than 17 the minimum standards set forth in this section. 18 (d) For purposes of this section, a peace officer does not include any peace officer 19 employed by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. 20 (e) For purposes of this section, a video or audio recording relates to a critical 21 incident if it depicts any of the following incidents: 22 (1) An incident involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer 23 or custodial officer. 24 (2) An incident in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer 25 against a person resulted in death or in great bodily injury. 26 (f) This section does not alter, limit, or negate any other rights, remedies, or 27 obligations with respect to public records regarding an incident other than a critical 28 incident as described in subdivision (e). 29 Comment.

(a) This division does not require disclosure of a video or audio 8 recording that was created during the commission or investigation of the crime of 9 rape, incest, sexual assault, domestic violence, or child abuse that depicts the face, 10 intimate body part, or voice of a victim of the incident depicted in the recording. An 11 agency shall justify withholding such a video or audio recording by demonstrating, 12 pursuant to Section 7922.000 and subdivision (a) of Section 7922.540, that on the 13 facts of the particular case, the public interest served by not disclosing the recording 14 clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the recording. 15 (b) When balancing the public interests as required by this section, an agency shall 16 consider both of the following: 17 (1) The constitutional right to privacy of the person or persons depicted in the 18 recording. 19 (2) Whether the potential harm to the victim caused by disclosing the recording 20 may be mitigated by redacting the recording to obscure images showing intimate 21 body parts and personally identifying characteristics of the victim or by distorting 22 portions of the recording containing the victim's voice, provided that the redaction 23 does not prevent a viewer from being able to fully and accurately perceive the events 24 captured on the recording.

See also Section 13 (singular includes plural and vice 41 versa). 42 Note. Subdivisions (a), (b), (d), (e), and (f) of existing Section 6254.7 concern pollution data and 43 other pollution-related matters. In contrast, subdivision (c) concerns violations of building 44 standards and safety requirements. It says: 45 (c) All records of notices and orders directed to the owner of any building of 46 violations of housing or building codes, ordinances, statutes, or regulations which 47 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 98 - constitute violations of standards provided in Section 1941.1 of the Civil Code, and 1 records of subsequent action with respect to those notices and orders, are public records. 2 Because subdivision (c) deals with a distinct topic, the Commission tentatively decided to 3 recodify it in a separate article as shown here (proposed Section 7924.700) instead of in \"Article 2. 4 Pollution\" with the rest of the substance of Section 6254.7 (proposed Section 7924.510). That 5 organizational scheme would help draw attention to the provision. However, the approach would 6 also slightly complicate the task of conforming the many statutes that cross-refer to Section 6254.7. 7 Would the benefits of this organizational scheme outweigh that detriment? Comments on this 8 point would be helpful. 9 Article 4. Enforcement Orders 10 \u00a7 7924.900. Internet posting of final enforcement orders of California Environmental 11 Protection Agency and specified entities within that agency 12 7924.900.

Existing Section 6254.25 cross-refers to \"subdivision (q) of Section 11126.\" However, 16 Section 11126 no longer has a subdivision (q); the material in question was relocated to subdivision 17 (e) in 1996 (see 1996 Cal. Stat. ch. 1041, \u00a7 5). Proposed Section 7927.205 (continuing the substance 18 of Section 6254.25) would correct this erroneous cross-reference, as mentioned in the 19 accompanying Comment. 20 In addition, the cross-referenced provision (Section 11126) appears to contain an inadvertent 21 drafting error. Some paragraph relabeling and related revisions seem necessary. To fix the problem, 22 the Commission plans to include a technical amendment of Section 11126 with the conforming 23 revisions and repeals for its proposed recodification. For further discussion of this point, see CLRC 24 Staff Memorandum 2017-50, pp. 11-16. 25 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 26 especially appreciate public comment on these matters. 27 CHAPTER 9.

INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS 22 \u00a7 7930.000. Legislative intent and instructions 23 7930.000. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature to assist members of the public and 24 state and local agencies in identifying exemptions to the California Public Records 25 Act. It is the intent of the Legislature that, after January 1, 1999, each addition or 26 amendment to a statute that exempts any information contained in a public record 27 from disclosure pursuant to Section 7927.705 shall be listed and described in 28 Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7930.100) pursuant to a bill authorized by a 29 standing committee of the Legislature to be introduced during the first year of each 30 session of the Legislature. 31 (b) The statutes and constitutional provisions listed in Chapter 2 (commencing 32 with Section 7930.100) may operate to exempt certain records, or portions thereof, 33 from disclosure. The statutes and constitutional provisions listed and described may 34 not be inclusive of all exemptions. The listing of a statute or constitutional provision 35 in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7930.100) does not itself create an 36 exemption. Requesters of public records and public agencies are cautioned to review 37 the applicable statute or constitutional provision to determine the extent to which it, 38 in light of the circumstances surrounding the request, exempts public records from 39 disclosure. 40 Comment. Section 7930.000 continues former Section 6275 without substantive change. 41 For additional guidance on using the alphabetical index in the next chapter (Sections 7930.100-42 7930.215), see Section 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 160 - Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-1 7929.600. For the CPRA catch-all exemption, and effect of index 5 7930.005. Records or information not required to be disclosed pursuant to Section 6 7927.705 may include, but shall not be limited to, records or information identified 7 in statutes listed in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7930.100). 8 Comment. Section 7930.005 continues former Section 6276 without substantive change. 9 For additional guidance on using the alphabetical index in the next chapter (Sections 7930.100-10 7930.215), see Section 7930.000 (legislative intent and instructions). For special rules in the 11 California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 12 7923.600-7929.600. For the CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 13 CHAPTER 2. INDEX 14 Note. Existing Sections 6276.01-6276.48 comprise an alphabetical list of CPRA exemptions 15 located throughout the codes. This chapter (proposed Sections 7930.100-7930.215) would recodify 16 that list in the same alphabetical format. 17 Would some other format be more user-friendly? For example, would it be preferable to group 18 the exemptions by subject matter, as in the partial redraft attached to CLRC Staff Memorandum 19 2019-25 (available at http://www.clrc.ca.gov/pub/2019/MM19-25.pdf)? Is there a better 20 possibility? 21 For further discussion of this organizational issue, see CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-25, pp. 22 1-9. 23 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 24 especially appreciate public comment on this matter. 25 \u00a7 7930.100. Constitutionally-based exemptions 26 7930.100. The following constitutional provisions may operate to exempt certain 27 records, or portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 28 Crime victims, confidential information or records, The Victims' Bill of Rights 29 Act of 2008: Marsy's Law, Section 28 of Article I of the California Constitution. 30 Privacy, inalienable right, Section 1 of Article I of the California Constitution. 31 Comment. Section 7930.100 continues former Section 6276.01 and includes a reference to the 32 constitutional right of privacy, which is fundamental in this context (see Section 7921.000). That 33 addition is not a substantive change. The index in this chapter is just a user guide, not substantive 34 law. 35 For the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The 36 statutes and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or 37 portions thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in 38 Section 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 39 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 40 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 41 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 42 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 161 - \u00a7 7930.105. From \"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome\" to \"Advance Health Care 1 Directive Registry\" 2 7930.105. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 3 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 4 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, blood test results, written authorization 5 not necessary for disclosure, Section 121010, Health and Safety Code. 6 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, blood test subject, compelling identity 7 of, Section 120975, Health and Safety Code. 8 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, confidentiality of personal data of 9 patients in State Department of Public Health programs, Section 120820, Health and 10 Safety Code. 11 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, confidentiality of research records, 12 Sections 121090, 121095, 121115, and 121120, Health and Safety Code. 13 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, confidentiality of vaccine volunteers, 14 Section 121280, Health and Safety Code. 15 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, confidentiality of information obtained 16 in prevention programs at correctional facilities and law enforcement agencies, 17 Sections 7552 and 7554, Penal Code. 18 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, disclosure of results of HIV test, 19 penalties, Section 120980, Health and Safety Code. 20 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, personal information, insurers tests, 21 confidentiality of, Section 799, Insurance Code. 22 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, public safety and testing disclosure, 23 Sections 121065 and 121070, Health and Safety Code. 24 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Research and Confidentiality Act, 25 production or discovery of records for use in criminal or civil proceedings against 26 subject prohibited, Section 121100, Health and Safety Code. 27 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Public Health Records Confidentiality 28 Act, personally identifying information confidentiality, Section 121025, Health and 29 Safety Code. 30 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, test of criminal defendant pursuant to 31 search warrant requested by victim, confidentiality of, Section 1524.1, Penal Code. 32 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, test results, disclosure to patient's 33 spouse and others, Section 121015, Health and Safety Code. 34 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, test of person under Youth Authority, 35 disclosure of results, Section 1768.9, Welfare and Institutions Code. 36 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Research and Confidentiality Act, 37 financial audits or program evaluations, Section 121085, Health and Safety Code. 38 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Research and Confidentiality Act, 39 violations, Section 121100, Health and Safety Code. 40 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Research and Confidentiality Act, 41 personally identifying research records not to be disclosed, Section 121075, Health 42 and Safety Code. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 162 - Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Research and Confidentiality Act, 1 permittee disclosure, Section 121080, Health and Safety Code. 2 Administrative procedure, adjudicatory hearings, interpreters, Section 11513. 3 Adoption records, confidentiality of, Section 102730, Health and Safety Code. 4 Advance Health Care Directive Registry, exemption from disclosure for 5 registration information provided to the Secretary of State, Section 7926.100. 6 Comment. Section 7930.105 continues former Section 6276.02 without substantive change. For 7 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 8 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 9 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 10 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 11 Former Section 6276.02 included an entry for: \"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 12 confidentiality of test results of person convicted of prostitution, Section 1202.6, Penal Code.\" That 13 entry is not included in Section 7930.105 because it is obsolete. Penal Code Section 1202.6 was 14 repealed and added in 2017, and the new provision has nothing to do with confidentiality of AIDS 15 test results. See 2017 Cal. Stat. ch. 537, \u00a7 17. 16 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 17 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 18 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 19 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 20 Note. Existing Section 6276.02 includes an entry for: \"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 21 confidentiality of test results of person convicted of prostitution, Section 1202.6, Penal Code.\" 22 However, Penal Code Section 1202.6 was recently repealed and added, and the new provision has 23 nothing to do with confidentiality of AIDS test results. See 2017 Cal. Stat. ch. 537, \u00a7 17. 24 The Commission is not aware of any new provision that continues the substance of the repealed 25 section. Thus, (1) proposed Section 7930.105 would not include the entry quoted above, and (2) 26 the accompanying Comment would explain this omission. 27 This drafting approach does not pose any risk of a substantive change, because the list of 28 exemptions in this chapter is just an aid for CPRA users (not substantive law) and it does not purport 29 to be exhaustive. See proposed Sections 7930.000 and 7930.005 (existing Sections 6275 and 6276). 30 If there is a replacement for former Penal Code Section 1202.6 (1996 Cal. Stat. 1023, \u00a7 392), 31 however, it would be helpful to list it in proposed Section 7930.005. Does such a replacement exist? 32 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 33 especially appreciate public comment on this matter. 34 \u00a7 7930.110. From \"Aeronautics Act\" to \"Avocado handler transaction records\" 35 7930.110. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 36 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 37 Aeronautics Act, reports of investigations and hearings, Section 21693, Public 38 Utilities Code. 39 Agricultural producers marketing, access to records, Section 59616, Food and 40 Agricultural Code. 41 Aiding disabled voters, Section 14282, Elections Code. 42 Air pollution data, confidentiality of trade secrets, Section 6254.7, and Sections 43 42303.2 and 43206, Health and Safety Code. 44 Air toxics emissions inventory plans, protection of trade secrets, Section 44346, 45 Health and Safety Code. 46 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 163 - Alcohol and drug abuse records and records of communicable diseases, 1 confidentiality of, Section 123125, Health and Safety Code. 2 Alcoholic beverage licensees, confidentiality of corporate proprietary 3 information, Section 25205, Business and Professions Code. 4 Ambulatory Surgery Data Record, confidentiality of identifying information, 5 Section 128737, Health and Safety Code. 6 Apiary registration information, confidentiality of, Section 29041, Food and 7 Agricultural Code. 8 Archaeological site information and reports maintained by state and local 9 agencies, disclosure not required, Section 6254.10. 10 Arrest not resulting in conviction, disclosure or use of records, Sections 432.7 and 11 432.8, Labor Code. 12 Arsonists, registered, confidentiality of certain information, Section 457.1, Penal 13 Code. 14 Artificial insemination, donor not natural father, confidentiality of records, 15 Section 7613, Family Code. 16 Assessor's records, confidentiality of information in, Section 408, Revenue and 17 Taxation Code. 18 Assessor's records, confidentiality of information in, Section 451, Revenue and 19 Taxation Code. 20 Assessor's records, display of documents relating to business affairs or property 21 of another, Section 408.2, Revenue and Taxation Code. 22 Assigned risk plans, rejected applicants, confidentiality of information, Section 23 11624, Insurance Code. 24 Attorney applicant, investigation by State Bar, confidentiality of, Section 6060.2, 25 Business and Professions Code. 26 Attorney applicant, information submitted by applicant and State Bar admission 27 records, confidentiality of, Section 6060.25, Business and Professions Code. 28 Attorney-client confidential communication, Section 6068, Business and 29 Professions Code, and Sections 952 and 954, Evidence Code. 30 Attorney, disciplinary proceedings, confidentiality prior to formal proceedings, 31 Section 6086.1, Business and Professions Code. 32 Attorney, disciplinary proceeding, State Bar access to nonpublic court records, 33 Section 6090.6, Business and Professions Code. 34 Attorney, law corporation, investigation by State Bar, confidentiality of, Section 35 6168, Business and Professions Code. 36 Attorney work product confidentiality in administrative adjudication, Section 37 11507.6. 38 Attorney, work product, confidentiality of, Section 6202, Business and 39 Professions Code. 40 Attorney work product, discovery, Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 41 2018.010) of Title 4 of Part 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 42 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 164 - Automated forward facing parking control devices, confidentiality of video 1 imaging records from the devices, Section 40240, Vehicle Code. 2 Automated traffic enforcement system, confidentiality of photographic records 3 made by the system, Section 21455.5, Vehicle Code. 4 Automobile Insurance Claims Depository, confidentiality of information, Section 5 1876.3, Insurance Code. 6 Automobile insurance, investigation of fraudulent claims, confidential 7 information, Section 1872.8, Insurance Code. 8 Avocado handler transaction records, confidentiality of information, Section 9 44984, Food and Agricultural Code. 10 Comment. Section 7930.110 continues former Section 6276.04 without substantive change. For 11 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 12 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 13 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 14 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 15 Former Section 6276.04 included an entry for: \"Auditor General, access to records for audit 16 purposes, Sections 10527 and 10527.1.\" Former Section 6276.04 also included an entry for: 17 \"Auditor General, disclosure of audit records, Section 10525.\" Those entries are not included in 18 Section 7930.110 because they are obsolete. Sections 10525, 10527, and 10527.1 have been 19 repealed. See 2011 Cal. Stat. ch. 328, \u00a7 12. 20 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 21 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 22 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 23 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 24 Note. Section 6276.04 includes an entry for: \"Auditor General, access to records for audit purposes, 25 Sections 10527 and 10527.1.\" Section 6276.04 also includes an entry for: \"Auditor General, 26 disclosure of audit records, Section 10525.\" However, Sections 10525, 10527, and 10527.1 have 27 been repealed. See 2011 Cal. Stat. ch. 328, \u00a7 12. 28 The Commission is not aware of any new provision that continues the substance of any of the 29 repealed sections. Thus, (1) proposed Section 7930.110 would not include the entries quoted above, 30 and (2) the accompanying Comment would explain this omission. 31 This drafting approach does not pose any risk of a substantive change, because the list of 32 exemptions in this chapter is just an aid for CPRA users (not substantive law) and it does not purport 33 to be exhaustive. See proposed Sections 7930.000 and 7930.005 (existing Sections 6275 and 6276). 34 If there is a replacement for former Section 10525, 10527, or 10527.1, however, it would be 35 helpful to list it in proposed Section 7930.110. Does any such replacement exist? 36 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 37 especially appreciate public comment on this matter. 38 \u00a7 7930.115. From \"Bank and Corporation Tax\" to \"Business and professions licensee 39 exemption for social security number\" 40 7930.115. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 41 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 42 Bank and Corporation Tax, disclosure of information, Article 2 (commencing 43 with Section 19542), Chapter 7, Part 10.2, Division 2, Revenue and Taxation Code. 44 Bank employees, confidentiality of criminal history information, Section 4990, 45 Financial Code. 46 Bank reports, confidentiality of, Section 459, Financial Code. 47 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 165 - Basic Property Insurance Inspection and Placement Plan, confidential reports, 1 Section 10097, Insurance Code. 2 Beef Council of California, confidentiality of fee transactions information, 3 Section 64691.1, Food and Agricultural Code. 4 Bids, confidentiality of, Section 10304, Public Contract Code. 5 Birth, death, and marriage licenses, confidential information contained in, 6 Sections 102100, 102110, and 102230, Health and Safety Code. 7 Birth defects, monitoring, confidentiality of information collected, Section 8 103850, Health and Safety Code. 9 Birth, live, confidential portion of certificate, Sections 102430, 102475, 103525, 10 and 103590, Health and Safety Code. 11 Blood tests, confidentiality of hepatitis and AIDS carriers, Section 1603.1, Health 12 and Safety Code. 13 Blood-alcohol percentage test results, vehicular offenses, confidentiality of, 14 Section 1804, Vehicle Code. 15 Business and professions licensee exemption for social security number, Section 16 30, Business and Professions Code. 17 Comment. Section 7930.115 continues former Section 6276.06 without substantive change. For 18 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 19 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 20 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 21 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 22 Former Section 6276.06 included an entry for: \"Bank employees, confidentiality of criminal 23 history information, Sections 777.5 and 4990, Financial Code.\" That entry has been revised to refer 24 only to Financial Code Section 4990. The reference to Financial Code Section 777.5 is obsolete 25 because that section has been repealed. See 2008 Cal. Stat. ch. 125, \u00a7 53. 26 Former Section 6276.06 also included an entry for: \"Bank reports, confidentiality of, Section 27 289, Financial Code.\" That entry has been revised because Financial Code Section 289 was 28 repealed and its substance moved to Financial Code Section 459. See 2011 Cal. Stat. ch. 243, \u00a7 1; 29 compare 2008 Cal. Stat. ch. 501, \u00a7 9 with Fin. Code \u00a7 459. Section 7930.115 thus refers to Financial 30 Code Section 459, instead of Financial Code Section 289. 31 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 32 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For the CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 33 Notes. 34 (1) Section 6276.06 includes an entry for: \"Bank employees, confidentiality of criminal history 35 information, Sections 777.5 and 4990, Financial Code.\" However, Financial Code Section 777.5 36 has been repealed. See 2008 Cal. Stat. ch. 125, \u00a7 53. 37 The Commission is not aware of any new provision that continues the substance of the repealed 38 section. Thus, proposed Section 7930.115 would include the entry quoted above, but it would only 39 refer to Financial Code Section 4990. The accompanying Comment would explain the omission of 40 Financial Code Section 777.5. 41 This drafting approach does not pose any risk of a substantive change, because the list of 42 exemptions in this chapter is just an aid for CPRA users (not substantive law) and it does not purport 43 to be exhaustive. See proposed Sections 7930.000 and 7930.005 (existing Sections 6275 and 6276). 44 If there is a replacement for former Section 777.5, however, it would be helpful to list it in 45 proposed Section 7930.115. Does any such replacement exist? 46 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 166 - (2) Section 6276.06 also includes an entry for: \"Bank reports, confidentiality of, Section 289, 1 Financial Code.\" However, Financial Code Section 289 has been repealed (see 2011 Cal. Stat. ch. 2 243, \u00a7 1). Its substance has been moved to Financial Code Section 459 (compare 2008 Cal. Stat. 3 ch. 501, \u00a7 9 with Fin. Code \u00a7 459). Accordingly, proposed Section 7930.115 would refer to 4 Financial Code Section 459, instead of Financial Code Section 289. 5 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 6 especially appreciate public comment on these matters. 7 \u00a7 7930.120. From \"Cable television subscriber information\" to \"California Wine Grape 8 Commission\" 9 7930.120. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 10 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 11 Cable television subscriber information, confidentiality of, Section 637.5, Penal 12 Code. 13 CalFresh, disclosure of information, Section 18909, Welfare and Institutions 14 Code. 15 California AIDS Program, personal data, confidentiality, Section 120820, Health 16 and Safety Code. 17 California Apple Commission, confidentiality of lists of persons, Section 75598, 18 Food and Agricultural Code. 19 California Apple Commission, confidentiality of proprietary information from 20 producers or handlers, Section 75633, Food and Agricultural Code. 21 California Asparagus Commission, confidentiality of lists of producers, Section 22 78262, Food and Agricultural Code. 23 California Asparagus Commission, confidentiality of proprietary information 24 from producers, Section 78288, Food and Agricultural Code. 25 California Avocado Commission, confidentiality of information from handlers, 26 Section 67094, Food and Agricultural Code. 27 California Avocado Commission, confidentiality of proprietary information from 28 handlers, Section 67104, Food and Agricultural Code. 29 California Cherry Commission, confidentiality of proprietary information from 30 producers, processors, shippers, or grower-handlers, Section 76144, Food and 31 Agricultural Code. 32 California Children's Services Program, confidentiality of factor replacement 33 therapy contracts, Section 123853, Health and Safety Code. 34 California Cut Flower Commission, confidentiality of lists of producers, Section 35 77963, Food and Agricultural Code. 36 California Cut Flower Commission, confidentiality of proprietary information 37 from producers, Section 77988, Food and Agricultural Code. 38 California Date Commission, confidentiality of proprietary information from 39 producers and grower-handlers, Section 77843, Food and Agricultural Code. 40 California Egg Commission, confidentiality of proprietary information from 41 handlers or distributors, Section 75134, Food and Agricultural Code. 42 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 -

Section 7930.120 continues former Section 6276.08 without substantive change. For 16 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 17 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 18 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 19 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 20 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 21 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 22 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 23 CPRA catch-all exemption, see to \"Community college employee\" 25 7930.125. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 26 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 27 Cancer registries, confidentiality of information, Section 103885, Health and 28 Safety Code. 29 Candidate for local nonpartisan elective office, confidentiality of ballot statement, 30 Section 13311, Elections Code. 31 Child abuse information, exchange by multidisciplinary personnel teams, Section 32 830, Welfare and Institutions Code. 33 Child abuse report and those making report, confidentiality of, Sections 11167 34 and 11167.5, Penal Code. 35 Child care liability insurance, confidentiality of information, Section 1864, 36 Insurance Code. 37 Child concealer, confidentiality of address, Section 278.7, Penal Code. 38 Child custody investigation report, confidentiality of, Section 3111, Family Code. 39 Child day care facility, nondisclosure of complaint, Section 1596.853, Health and 40 Safety Code. 41 Child health and disability prevention, confidentiality of health screening and 42 evaluation results, Section 124110, Health and Safety Code. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 169 - Child sexual abuse reports, confidentiality of reports filed in a contested 1 proceeding involving child custody or visitation rights, Section 3118, Family Code. 2 Child support, confidentiality of income tax return, Section 3552, Family Code. 3 Child support, promise to pay, confidentiality of, Section 7614, Family Code. 4 Childhood lead poisoning prevention, confidentiality of blood lead findings, 5 Section 124130, Health and Safety Code. 6 Children and families commission, local, confidentiality of individually 7 identifiable information, Section 130140.1, Health and Safety Code. 8 Cigarette tax, confidential information, Section 30455, Revenue and Taxation 9 Code. 10 Civil actions, delayed disclosure for 30 days after complaint filed, Section 11 482.050, Code of Civil Procedure. 12 Closed sessions, document assessing vulnerability of state or local agency to 13 disruption by terrorist or other criminal acts, Section 7929.200. 14 Closed sessions, meetings of local governments, pending litigation, Section 15 54956.9. 16 Colorado River Board, confidential information and records, Section 12519, 17 Water Code. 18 Commercial fishing licensee, confidentiality of records, Section 7923, Fish and 19 Game Code. 20 Commercial fishing reports, Section 8022, Fish and Game Code. 21 Community care facilities, confidentiality of client information, Section 1557.5, 22 Health and Safety Code. 23 Community college employee, candidate examination records, confidentiality of, 24 Section 88093, Education Code. 25 Community college employee, notice and reasons for nonreemployment, 26 confidentiality, Section 87740, Education Code. 27 Comment. Section 7930.125 continues former Section 6276.10 without substantive change. For 28 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 29 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 30 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 31 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 32 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 33 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 34 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 35 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 36 Note. Section 6276.10 includes an entry for: \"Community care facilities, confidentiality of client 37 information, Section 1557.5, Health and Safety Code.\" There are two, almost identical versions of 38 Section 1557.5 in the Health and Safety Code. Because the two sections are almost identical, it is 39 not necessary to differentiate between them. Like existing Section 6276.10, proposed Section 40 7930.125 would simply refer to \"Section 1557.5, Health and Safety Code.\" 41 \u00a7 7930.130. From to \"Customer list of telephone answering service\" 42 7930.130. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 43 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 44 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 170 - Conservatee, confidentiality of the conservatee's report, Section 1826, Probate 1 Code. 2 Conservatee, estate plan of, confidentiality of, Section 2586, Probate Code. 3 Conservatee with disability, confidentiality of report, Section 1827.5, Probate 4 Code. 5 Conservator, confidentiality of conservator's birthdate and driver's license 6 number, Section 1834, Probate Code. 7 Conservator, supplemental information, confidentiality of, Section 1821, Probate 8 Code. 9 Conservatorship, court review of, confidentiality of report, Section 1851, Probate 10 Code. 11 Consumer fraud investigations, access to complaints and investigations, Section 12 26509. 13 Consumption or utilization of mineral materials, disclosure of, Section 2207.1, 14 Public Resources Code. 15 Contractor, evaluations and contractor responses, confidentiality of, Section 16 10370, Public Contract Code. 17 Controlled Substance Law violations, confidential information, Section 818.7. 18 Controlled substance offenders, confidentiality of registration information, 19 Section 11594, Health and Safety Code. 20 Cooperative Marketing Association, confidential information disclosed to 21 conciliator, Section 54453, Food and Agricultural Code. 22 Coroner, inquests, subpoena duces tecum, Section 27491.8. 23 County aid and relief to indigents, confidentiality of investigation, supervision, 24 relief, and rehabilitation records, Section 17006, Welfare and Institutions Code. 25 County alcohol programs, confidential information and records, Section 11812, 26 Health and Safety Code. 27 County Employees' Retirement, confidential statements and records, Section 28 31532. 29 County mental health system, confidentiality of client information, Section 5610, 30 Welfare and Institutions Code. 31 County social services, investigation of applicant, confidentiality, Section 18491, 32 Welfare and Institutions Code. 33 County social services rendered by volunteers, confidentiality of records of 34 recipients, Section 10810, Welfare and Institutions Code. 35 County special commissions, disclosure of health care peer review and quality 36 assessment records not required, Section 14087.58, Welfare and Institutions Code. 37 County special commissions, disclosure of records relating to the commission's 38 rates of payment for publicly assisted medical care not required, Section 14087.58, 39 Welfare and Institutions Code. 40 Court files, access to, restricted for 60 days, Section 1161.2, Code of Civil 41 Procedure. 42 Court files, access to, restricted for 60 days, Section 1708.85, Civil Code. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 171 - Court reporters, confidentiality of records and reporters, Section 68525. 1 Court-appointed special advocates, confidentiality of information acquired or 2 reviewed, Section 105, Welfare and Institutions Code. 3 Crane employers, previous business identities, confidentiality of, Section 7383, 4 Labor Code. 5 Credit unions, confidentiality of investigation and examination reports, Section 6 14257, Financial Code. 7 Credit unions, confidentiality of employee criminal history information, Section 8 14409.2, Financial Code. 9 Criminal defendant, indigent, confidentiality of request for funds for investigators 10 and experts, Section 987.9, Penal Code. 11 Criminal offender record information, access to, Sections 11076 and 13202, Penal 12 Code. 13 Crop reports, confidential, Section 7927.300. 14 Customer list of chemical manufacturers, formulators, suppliers, distributors, 15 importers, and their agents, the quantities and dates of shipments, and the proportion 16 of a specified chemical within a mixture, confidential, Section 147.2, Labor Code. 17 Customer list of employment agency, trade secret, Section 16607, Business and 18 Professions Code. 19 Customer list of telephone answering service, trade secret, Section 16606, 20 Business and Professions Code. 21 Comment. Section 7930.130 continues former Section 6276.12 without substantive change. For 22 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 23 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 24 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 25 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 26 Former Section 6276.12 included an entry for: \"Contractor, license applicants, evidence of 27 financial solvency, confidentiality of, Section 7067.5, Business and Professions Code.\" That entry 28 is not included in Section 7930.130 because it is obsolete. Business and Professions Code Section 29 7067.5 has been repealed. See 2015 Cal. Stat. ch. 656, \u00a7 8. 30 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 31 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 32 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 33 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 34 Note. Section 6276.12 includes an entry for: \"Contractor, license applicants, evidence of financial 35 solvency, confidentiality of, Section 7067.5, Business and Professions Code.\" However, Business 36 and Professions Code Section 7067.5 has been repealed. See 2015 Cal. Stat. ch. 656, \u00a7 8. 37 There does not appear to be any replacement; former Section 7067.5's requirement to submit 38 evidence of financial solvency seems to have been eliminated in the bill that repealed the section 39 and increased the amount of the required bond. Thus, (1) proposed Section 7930.130 would not 40 include the entry quoted above, and (2) the accompanying Comment would explain this omission. 41 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 42 especially appreciate public comment on this matter. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 172 - \u00a7 7930.135.

Section 7930.135 continues former Section 6276.14 without substantive change. For 21 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 22 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 23 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 24 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 25 Former Section 6276.14 included an entry for: \"Developmentally disabled person, 26 confidentiality of patient records, state agencies, Section 4553, Welfare and Institutions Code.\" 27 That entry has been revised because Welfare and Institutions Code Section 4553 was repealed in 28 2002 and replaced by a new provision that has nothing to do with record disclosure (see 2002 Cal. 29 Stat. ch. 676, \u00a7 21). The substance of the repealed provision was moved to Welfare and Institutions 30 Code Section 4552.5 (compare 1977 Cal. Stat. ch. 1252, \u00a7 550 with Welf. & Inst. Code \u00a7 4552.5). 31 Section 7930.135 thus refers to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 4552.5, instead of Welfare 32 and Institutions Code Section 4553. 33 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 34 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 35 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 36 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 37 Note. Section 6276.14 includes an entry for: \"Developmentally disabled person, confidentiality of 38 patient records, state agencies, Section 4553, Welfare and Institutions Code.\" However, Welfare 39 and Institutions Code Section 4553 has been repealed and replaced by a new provision that has 40 nothing to do with record disclosure. See 2002 Cal. Stat. ch. 676, \u00a7 21. 41 The substance of the repealed provision has been moved to Welfare and Institutions Code 42 Section 4552.5. Compare 1977 Cal. Stat. ch. 1252, \u00a7 550 with Welf. & Inst. Code \u00a7 4552.5. 43 Accordingly, proposed Section 7930.135 would refer to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 44 4552.5, instead of Welfare and Institutions Code Section 4553. 45 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 46 especially appreciate public comment on this matter. 47 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 174 - \u00a7 7930.140. From \"Educational psychologist-patient\" to \"Executive Department\" 1 7930.140.

Section 7930.140 continues former Section 6276.16 without substantive change. For 5 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 6 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 7 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 8 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 9 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 10 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 11 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 12 CPRA catch-all exemption, see to \"Fur dealer licensee\" 14 7930.145. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 15 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 16 Family Court, records, Section 1818, Family Code. 17 Farm product processor license, confidentiality of financial statements, Section 18 55523.6, Food and Agricultural Code. 19 Farm product processor licensee, confidentiality of grape purchases, Section 20 55601.5, Food and Agricultural Code. 21 Fee payer information, prohibition against disclosure by Board of Equalization 22 and others, Section 55381, Revenue and Taxation Code. 23 Financial institutions, issuance of securities, reports and records of state agencies, 24 Section 7929.000. 25 Financial statements of insurers, confidentiality of information received, Section 26 925.3, Insurance Code. 27 Financial statements and questionnaires, of prospective bidders for the state, 28 confidentiality of, Section 10165, Public Contract Code. 29 Financial statements and questionnaires, of prospective bidders for California 30 State University contracts, confidentiality of, Section 10763, Public Contract Code. 31 Firearms, centralized list of exempted federal firearms licensees, disclosure of 32 information compiled from, Sections 28475 and 28480, Penal Code. 33 Firearms, centralized list of dealers and licensees, disclosure of information 34 compiled from, Section 26715, Penal Code. 35 Firearm license applications, Sections 7923.800 and 7923.805. 36 Firearm sale or transfer, confidentiality of records, Section 28060, Penal Code. 37 Fishing and hunting licenses, confidentiality of names and addresses contained in 38 records submitted to the Department of Fish and Game to obtain recreational fishing 39 and hunting licenses, Section 1050.6, Fish and Game Code. 40 Foreign marketing of agricultural products, confidentiality of financial 41 information, Section 58577, Food and Agricultural Code. 42 Forest fires, anonymity of informants, Section 4417, Public Resources Code. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 176 - Foster homes, identifying information, Section 1536, Health and Safety Code. 1 Franchise Tax Board, access to Franchise Tax Board information by the State 2 Department of Social Services, Section 11025, Welfare and Institutions Code. 3 Franchise Tax Board, auditing, confidentiality of, Section 90005. 4 Franchises, applications, and reports filed with Commissioner of Corporations, 5 disclosure and withholding from public inspection, Section 31504, Corporations 6 Code. 7 Fur dealer licensee, confidentiality of records, Section 4041, Fish and Game Code. 8 Comment. Section 7930.145 continues former Section 6276.18 without substantive change. For 9 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 10 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 11 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 12 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 13 Former Section 6276.19 included an entry for: \"Firearms, centralized list of exempted federal 14 firearms licensees, disclosure of information compiled from, Sections 24850 to 24890, inclusive, 15 Penal Code.\" That entry has been revised to refer to Penal Code Sections 28475 and 28480. This 16 revision corrects a transposition error (Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 24850-24890 do not exist but Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 17 28450-28490 do). The revision also deletes irrelevant material that used to be combined with the 18 pertinent material in a long code section (see former Penal Code \u00a7 12083 (2009 Cal. Stat. ch. 334, 19 \u00a7 4), which was repealed in 2010 and recodified as Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 28450-28490). 20 Former Section 6276.19 also included an entry for: \"Firearms, centralized list of dealers and 21 licensees, disclosure of information compiled from, Sections 26700 to 26915, inclusive, Penal 22 Code.\" That entry has been revised to refer only to Penal Code Section 26715. This revision deletes 23 irrelevant material that used to be combined with the pertinent material in a long code section (see 24 former Penal Code \u00a7 12071 (2009 Cal. Stat. ch. 335, \u00a7 10), which was repealed in 2010 and 25 recodified as Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 26700-26915). 26 Another entry in former Section 6276.19 was for: \"Firearm sale or transfer, confidentiality of 27 records, Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 28050) of Division 6 of Title 4 of Part 6, Penal 28 Code.\" That entry has been revised to refer only to Penal Code Section 28060. This revision deletes 29 irrelevant material that used to be combined with the pertinent material in a long code section (see 30 former Penal Code \u00a7 12082 (2008 Cal. Stat. ch. 699, \u00a7 20), which was repealed in 2010 and 31 recodified as Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 28050) of Division 6 of Title 4 of Part 6 of the 32 Penal Code). 33 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 34 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 35 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 36 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 37 Notes. 38 (1) Section 6276.18 includes an entry for: \"Firearms, centralized list of exempted federal 39 firearms licensees, disclosure of information compiled from, Sections 24850 to 24890, inclusive, 40 Penal Code.\" (Emphasis added.) The italicized cross-reference is incorrect; there are no such 41 sections in the Penal Code. The numbers were inadvertently transposed in conforming the cross-42 reference when the Commission's deadly weapons recodification was enacted. The correct cross-43 reference is to Penal Code Sections 28450 to 28490, inclusive. 44 However, this should perhaps be shortened to refer only to Penal Code Sections 28475 and 45 28480, because the other code sections in the specified range appear to have nothing to do with 46 record disclosure. They were just included in the Section 6276.18 entry because historically they 47 used to be in the same lengthy code section as the material that is now in Penal Code Sections 48 28475 and 28480. 49 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 177 - To help persons using the CPRA index focus on pertinent material, proposed Section 7930.145 1 would refer only to Penal Code Sections 28475 and 28480. The accompanying Comment would 2 explain this revision. 3 (2) Section 6276.18 also includes an entry for: \"Firearms, centralized list of dealers and 4 licensees, disclosure of information compiled from, Sections 26700 to 26915, inclusive, Penal 5 Code.\" This entry should perhaps be shortened to refer only to Penal Code Section 26715, because 6 the other code sections in the specified range appear to have nothing to do with record disclosure. 7 They were just included in the Section 6276.18 entry because historically they used to be in the 8 same lengthy code section as the material that is now in Penal Code Section 26715. To help persons 9 using the exemption index focus on pertinent material, proposed Section 7930.145 would refer only 10 to Penal Code Section 26715. 11 (3) Another entry in Section 6276.18 is for: \"Firearm sale or transfer, confidentiality of records, 12 Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 28050) of Division 6 of Title 4 of Part 6, Penal Code.\" This 13 entry should perhaps be shortened to refer only to Penal Code Section 28060, because the other 14 code sections in the specified range appear to have nothing to do with record disclosure. They were 15 just included in the Section 6276.18 entry because historically they used to be in the same lengthy 16 code section as the material that is now in Penal Code Section 28060. To help persons using the 17 exemption index focus on pertinent material, proposed Section 7930.145 would refer only to Penal 18 Code Section 28060. 19 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 20 especially appreciate public comment on these matters. 21 22 \u00a7 7930.150. From \"Gambling Control Act\" to \"Guardianship\" 23 7930.150. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 24 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 25 Gambling Control Act, exemption from disclosure for records of the California 26 Gambling Control Commission and the Department of Justice, Sections 19819 and 27 19821, Business and Professions Code. 28 Genetically Handicapped Persons Program, confidentiality of factor replacement 29 therapy contracts, Section 125191, Health and Safety Code. 30 Governor, correspondence of and to Governor and Governor's office, Section 31 7928.000. 32 Governor, transfer of public records in control of, restrictions on public access, 33 Sections 7928.005 and 7928.010. 34 Grand jury, confidentiality of request for special counsel, Section 936.7, Penal 35 Code. 36 Grand jury, confidentiality of transcription of indictment or accusation, Section 37 938.1, Penal Code. 38 Group Insurance, public employees, Section 53202.25. 39 Guardianship, confidentiality of report regarding the suitability of the proposed 40 guardian, Section 1543, Probate Code. 41 Guardianship, disclosure of report and recommendation concerning proposed 42 guardianship of person or estate, Section 1513, Probate Code. 43 Comment. Section 7930.150 continues former Section 6276.22 without substantive change. For 44 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 45 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 178 - and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 1 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 2 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 3 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 4 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 5 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 6 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. tax information\" to \"Housing authorities\" 8 7930.155. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 9 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 10 Hazardous substance tax information, prohibition against disclosure, Section 11 43651, Revenue and Taxation Code. 12 Hazardous waste control, business plans, public inspection, Section 25509, Health 13 and Safety Code. 14 Hazardous waste control, notice of unlawful hazardous waste disposal, Section 15 25180.5, Health and Safety Code. 16 Hazardous waste control, trade secrets, disclosure of information, Sections 25512, 17 25512.1 and 25538, Health and Safety Code. 18 Hazardous waste control, trade secrets, procedures for release of information, 19 Section 25358.2, Health and Safety Code. 20 Hazardous waste generator report, protection of trade secrets, Sections 25244.21 21 and 25244.23, Health and Safety Code. 22 Hazardous waste licenseholder disclosure statement, confidentiality of, Section 23 25186.5, Health and Safety Code. 24 Hazardous waste recycling, information clearing house, confidentiality of trade 25 secrets, Section 25170, Health and Safety Code. 26 Hazardous waste recycling, list of specified hazardous wastes, trade secrets, 27 Section 25175, Health and Safety Code. 28 Hazardous waste recycling, trade secrets, confidential nature, Sections 25173 and 29 25180.5, Health and Safety Code. 30 Healing arts licensees, central files, confidentiality, Section 800, Business and 31 Professions Code. 32 Health authorities, special county, confidentiality of records, Sections 14087.35, 33 14087.36, and 14087.38, Welfare and Institutions Code. 34 Health care provider disciplinary proceeding, confidentiality of documents, 35 Section 805.1, Business and Professions Code. 36 Health care service plans, review of quality of care, privileged communications, 37 Sections 1370 and 1380, Health and Safety Code. 38 Health commissions, special county, confidentiality of peer review proceedings, 39 rates of payment, and trade secrets, Section 14087.31, Welfare and Institutions 40 Code. 41 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 179 - Health facilities, patient's rights of confidentiality, subdivision (c) of Section 1 128745 and Sections 128735, 128736, 128737, 128755, and 128765, Health and 2 Safety Code. 3 Health personnel, data collection by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and 4 Development, confidentiality of information on individual licentiates, Section 5 127780, Health and Safety Code. 6 Health plan governed by a county board of supervisors, exemption from 7 disclosure for records relating to provider rates or payments for a three-year period 8 after execution of the provider contract, Sections 7926.205 and 54956.87. 9 Hereditary Disorders Act, legislative finding and declaration, confidential 10 information, Sections 124975 and 124980, Health and Safety Code. 11 Hereditary Disorders Act, rules, regulations, and standards, breach of 12 confidentiality, Section 124980, Health and Safety Code. 13 HIV, disclosures to blood banks by department or county health officers, Section 14 1603.1, Health and Safety Code. 15 Home address of public employees and officers in Department of Motor Vehicles, 16 records, confidentiality of, Sections 1808.2 and 1808.4, Vehicle Code. 17 Horse racing, horses, blood or urine test sample, confidentiality, Section 19577, 18 Business and Professions Code. 19 Hospital district and municipal hospital records relating to contracts with insurers 20 and service plans, Section 7926.210. 21 Hospital final accreditation report, Section 7926.000. 22 Housing authorities, confidentiality of rosters of tenants, Section 34283, Health 23 and Safety Code. 24 Housing authorities, confidentiality of applications by prospective or current 25 tenants, Section 34332, Health and Safety Code. 26 Comment. Section 7930.155 continues former Section 6276.24 without substantive change. For 27 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 28 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 29 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 30 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 31 Former Section 6276.24 included an entry for: \"Hazardous waste control, business plans, public 32 inspection, Section 25506, Health and Safety Code.\" That entry has been revised because Health 33 and Safety Code Section 25506 was repealed in 2013 (see 2013 Cal. Stat. \u00a7 419, \u00a7 2). The current 34 version of Health and Safety Code Section 25506 has nothing to do with record disclosure. The 35 substance of the repealed provision was moved (with revisions) to Health and Safety Code Section 36 25509 (compare 1988 Cal. Stat. ch. 1585, \u00a7 7 with Health & Safety Code \u00a7 25509). Section 37 7930.155 thus refers to Health and Safety Code Section 25509, instead of Health and Safety Code 38 Section 25506. 39 Former Section 6276.24 also included an entry for: \"Hazardous waste control, trade secrets, 40 disclosure of information, Sections 25511 and 25538, Health and Safety Code.\" That entry has been 41 revised because Health and Safety Code Section 25511 was repealed in 2013 (see 2013 Cal. Stat. 42 ch. 419, \u00a7 2). The current version of Health and Safety Code Section 25511 has nothing to do with 43 record disclosure. The substance of the repealed provision was moved (with revisions) to Health 44 and Safety Code Sections 25512 and 25512.1 (compare 1985 Cal. Stat. ch. 1167, \u00a7 1 with Health 45 & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 25512, 25512.1). Section 7930.155 thus refers to Health and Safety Code Section 46 25512 and 25512.1, instead of Health and Safety Code Section 25511. 47 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 180 - For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 1 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 2 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 3 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 4 Notes. 5 (1) Existing Section 6726.24 includes an entry for: \"Hazardous waste control, business plans, 6 public inspection, Section 25506, Health and Safety Code.\" However, the version of Health and 7 Safety Code Section 25506 relating to record disclosure was repealed in 2013. See 2013 Cal. Stat. 8 \u00a7 419, \u00a7 2. The current version of Health and Safety Code Section 25506 has nothing to do with 9 record disclosure. 10 The substance of former Health and Safety Code Section 25506 appears to have been moved 11 (with revisions) to Health and Safety Code Section 25509 (compare 1988 Cal. Stat. ch. 1585, \u00a7 7 12 with Health & Safety Code \u00a7 25509). Accordingly, proposed Section 7930.155 would refer to 13 Health and Safety Code Section 25509, instead of Health and Safety Code Section 25506. 14 (2) Existing Section 6276.24 includes an entry for: \"Hazardous waste control, trade secrets, 15 disclosure of information, Sections 25511 and 25538, Health and Safety Code.\" However, the 16 version of Health and Safety Code Section 25511 relating to record disclosure was repealed in 17 2013. See 2013 Cal. Stat. ch. 419, \u00a7 2. The current version of Health and Safety Code Section 18 25511 has nothing to do with record disclosure. 19 The substance of former Health and Safety Code Section 25511 appears to have been moved 20 (with revisions) to Health and Safety Code Sections 25512 and 25512.1 (compare 1985 Cal. Stat. 21 ch. 1167, \u00a7 1 with Health & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 25512, 25512.1). Accordingly, proposed Section 22 7930.155 would refer to Health and Safety Code Sections 25512 and 25512.1, instead of Health 23 and Safety Code Section 25511. 24 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 25 especially appreciate public comment on these matters. 26 \u00a7 7930.160. From \"Improper governmental activities reporting\" to \"Investigative consumer 27 reporting agency\" 28 7930.160. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 29 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 30 Improper governmental activities reporting, confidentiality of identity of person 31 providing information, Section 8547.5. 32 Improper governmental activities reporting, disclosure of information, Section 33 8547.6. 34 Industrial loan companies, confidentiality of financial information, Section 35 18496, Financial Code. 36 Industrial loan companies, confidentiality of investigation and examination 37 reports, Section 18394, Financial Code. 38 Influenza vaccine, trade secret information and information relating to recipient 39 of vaccine, Section 120160, Health and Safety Code. 40 In forma pauperis litigant, rules governing confidentiality of financial 41 information, Section 68633. 42 Infrastructure information, exemption from disclosure for information voluntarily 43 submitted to the Office of Emergency Services, Section 7929.205. 44 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 181 - In-Home Supportive Services Program, exemption from disclosure for 1 information regarding persons paid by the state to provide in-home supportive 2 services, Section 7926.300. 3 Initiative, referendum, recall, and other petitions, confidentiality of names of 4 signers, Sections 7924.100, 7924.105, and 7924.110. 5 Insurance claims analysis, confidentiality of information, Section 1875.16, 6 Insurance Code. 7 Insurance Commissioner, confidential information, Sections 735.5, 1067.11, 8 1077.3, and 12919, Insurance Code. 9 Insurance Commissioner, informal conciliation of complaints, confidential 10 communications, Section 1858.02, Insurance Code. 11 Insurance Commissioner, information from examination or investigation, 12 confidentiality of, Sections 1215.8, 1433, and 1759.3, Insurance Code. 13 Insurance Commissioner, writings filed with nondisclosure, Section 855, 14 Insurance Code. 15 Insurance fraud reporting, information acquired not part of public record, Section 16 1873.1, Insurance Code. 17 Insurance licensee, confidential information, Section 1666.5, Insurance Code. 18 Insurer application information, confidentiality of, Section 925.3, Insurance 19 Code. 20 Insurer financial analysis ratios and examination synopses, confidentiality of, 21 Section 933, Insurance Code. 22 Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery information, prohibition 23 against disclosure, Section 45982, Revenue and Taxation Code. 24 International wills, confidentiality of registration information filed with the 25 Secretary of State, Section 6389, Probate Code. 26 Intervention in regulatory and ratemaking proceedings, audit of customer seeking 27 and award, Section 1804, Public Utilities Code. 28 Investigation and security records, exemption from disclosure for records of the 29 Attorney General, the Department of Justice, the Office of Emergency Services, and 30 state and local police agencies, Sections 7923.600 to 7923.625, inclusive. 31 Investigative consumer reporting agency, limitations on furnishing an 32 investigative consumer report, Section 1786.12, Civil Code. 33 Comment. Section 7930.160 continues former Section 6276.26 without substantive change. For 34 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 35 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 36 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 37 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 38 Former Section 6276.26 included an entry for: \"Influenza vaccine, trade secret information and 39 information relating to recipient of vaccine, Section 120155, Health and Safety Code.\" That entry 40 has been revised because the version of Health and Safety Code Section 120155 relating to trade 41 secrets and record disclosure (2007 Cal. Stat. ch. 130, \u00a7 174) was amended and renumbered as 42 Health and Safety Code Section 120160 (see 2015 Cal. Stat. ch. 303, \u00a7 347). Section 7930.160 thus 43 refers to Health and Safety Code Section 120160, instead of Health and Safety Code Section 44 120155. 45 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 182 - Former Section 6276.26 also included an entry for: \"In forma pauperis litigant, rules governing 1 confidentiality of financial information, Section 68511.3.\" That entry has been revised because 2 Section 68511.3 was repealed (see 2008 Cal. Stat. ch. 462, \u00a7 1). Similar (but not identical) material 3 relating to record disclosure is now located in Section 68633 (compare former Section 4 68511.3(a)(4)-(5) & (c)(1) (2006 Cal. Stat. ch. 538, \u00a7 326) with Section 68633(f)). Proposed 5 Section 7930.160 would thus refer to Section 68633, instead of Section 68511.3. 6 Another entry in former Section 6276.26 was for: \"Insurance Commissioner, information from 7 examination or investigation, confidentiality of, Sections 1215.7, 1433, and 1759.3, Insurance 8 Code.\" That entry has been revised because the version of Insurance Code Section 1215.7 relating 9 to record disclosure (1969 Cal. Stat. ch. 1275, \u00a7 1) was amended and renumbered as Insurance 10 Code Section 1215.8 (see 2012 Cal Stat. ch. 282, \u00a7 8). Proposed Section 7930.160 would thus refer 11 to Insurance Code Section 1215.8, instead of Insurance Code Section 1215.7. 12 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 13 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 14 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 15 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 16 Notes. 17 (1) Existing Section 6276.26 includes an entry for: \"Influenza vaccine, trade secret information 18 and information relating to recipient of vaccine, Section 120155, Health and Safety Code.\" 19 However, the version of Health and Safety Code Section 120155 relating to trade secrets and record 20 disclosure (2007 Cal. Stat. ch. 130, \u00a7 174) has been amended and renumbered as Health and Safety 21 Code Section 120160 (see 2015 Cal. Stat. ch. 303, \u00a7 347). The current version of Health and Safety 22 Code Section 120155 has nothing to do with record disclosure. Accordingly, proposed Section 23 7930.160 would refer to Health and Safety Code Section 120160, instead of Health and Safety 24 Code Section 120155. 25 (2) Existing Section 6276.26 also includes an entry for: \"In forma pauperis litigant, rules 26 governing confidentiality of financial information, Section 68511.3.\" However, Section 68511.3 27 has been repealed (see 2008 Cal. Stat. ch. 462, \u00a7 1). Similar (but not identical) material relating to 28 record disclosure is now located in Section 68633 (compare former Section 68511.3(a)(4)-(5) & 29 (c)(1) (2006 Cal. Stat. ch. 538, \u00a7 326) with Section 68633(f)). Accordingly, proposed Section 30 7930.160 would refer to Section 68633, instead of Section 68511.3. This drafting approach does 31 not pose any risk of a substantive change, because the list of exemptions in this chapter is just an 32 aid for CPRA users (not substantive law). See proposed Section 7930.000 (existing Section 6275). 33 (3) Another entry in existing Section 6276.26 is for: \"Insurance Commissioner, information 34 from examination or investigation, confidentiality of, Sections 1215.7, 1433, and 1759.3, Insurance 35 Code.\" However, the current version of Insurance Code Section 1215.7 has nothing to do with 36 record disclosure. The version of Insurance Code Section 1215.7 relating to record disclosure (1969 37 Cal. Stat. ch. 1275, \u00a7 1) was amended and renumbered as Insurance Code Section 1215.8 (see 2012 38 Cal Stat. ch. 282, \u00a7 8). Accordingly, proposed Section 7930.160 would refer to Insurance Code 39 Section 1215.8, instead of Insurance Code Section 1215.7. 40 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 41 especially appreciate public comment on these matters. 42 \u00a7 7930.165. From \"Joint Legislative Ethics Committee\" to \"Los Angeles County Tourism 43 Marketing Commission\" 44 7930.165. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 45 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 46 Joint Legislative Ethics Committee, confidentiality of reports and records, Section 47 8953. 48 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 183 - Judicial candidates, confidentiality of communications concerning, Section 1 12011.5. 2 Judicial proceedings, confidentiality of employer records of employee absences, 3 Section 230.2, Labor Code. 4 Jurors' lists, lists of registered voters and licensed drivers as source for, Section 5 197, Code of Civil Procedure. 6 Juvenile court proceedings to adjudge a person a dependent child of court, sealing 7 records of, Section 389, Welfare and Institutions Code. 8 Juvenile criminal records, dissemination to schools, Section 828.1, Welfare and 9 Institutions Code. 10 Juvenile delinquents, notification of chief of police or sheriff of escape of minor 11 from secure detention facility, Section 1155, Welfare and Institutions Code. 12 Labor dispute, investigation and mediation records, confidentiality of, Section 13 3601. 14 Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, mental health services recipients, confidentiality of 15 information and records, mental health advocate, Sections 5540, 5541, 5542, and 16 5550, Welfare and Institutions Code. 17 Law enforcement vehicles, registration disclosure, Section 5003, Vehicle Code. 18 Legislative Counsel records, Section 7928.100. 19 Library circulation records and other materials, Sections 7925.000 and 7927.105. 20 Life and disability insurers, actuarial information, confidentiality of, Section 21 10489.15, Insurance Code. 22 Litigation, confidentiality of settlement information, Section 68513. 23 Local agency legislative body, closed sessions, disclosure of materials, Section 24 54956.9. 25 Local government employees, confidentiality of records and claims relating to 26 group insurance, Section 53202.25. 27 Local summary criminal history information, confidentiality of, Sections 13300 28 and 13305, Penal Code. 29 Local agency legislative body, closed session, nondisclosure of minute book, 30 Section 54957.2. 31 Local agency legislative body, meeting, disclosure of agenda, Section 54957.5. 32 Long-term health facilities, confidentiality of complaints against, Section 1419, 33 Health and Safety Code. 34 Long-term health facilities, confidentiality of records retained by State 35 Department of Public Health, Section 1439, Health and Safety Code. 36 Los Angeles County Tourism Marketing Commission, confidentiality of 37 information obtained from businesses to determine their assessment, Section 38 13995.108. 39 Comment. Section 7930.165 continues former Section 6276.28 without substantive change. For 40 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 41 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 42 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 43 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 44 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 184 - Former Section 6276.28 included an entry for: \"Labor dispute, investigation and mediation 1 records, confidentiality of, Section 65, Labor Code.\" That entry has been revised because Labor 2 Code Section 65 was repealed (see 2012 Cal. Stat. ch. 46, \u00a7 78). The substance of former Labor 3 Code Section 65 was moved to Section 3601 (compare former Labor Code Section 65 (1997 Cal. 4 Stat. ch. 772, \u00a7 11) with Section 3601). Proposed Section 6278.28 would thus refer to Section 3601, 5 instead of Labor Code Section 65. 6 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 7 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 8 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 9 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 10 Note. Existing Section 6276.28 includes an entry for: \"Labor dispute, investigation and mediation 11 records, confidentiality of, Section 65, Labor Code.\" However, Labor Code Section 65 has been 12 repealed (see 2012 Cal. Stat. ch. 46, \u00a7 78). Its substance has been moved to Section 3601 (compare 13 former Labor Code Section 65 (1997 Cal. Stat. ch. 772, \u00a7 11) with Section 3601). Accordingly, 14 proposed Section 6278.28 would refer to Section 3601, instead of Labor Code Section 65. 15 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 16 especially appreciate public comment on this matter. 17 \u00a7 7930.170. From \"Managed health care plans\" to \"Multijurisdictional drug law 18 enforcement agency\" 19 7930.170. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 20 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 21 Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, negotiations with entities contracting or 22 seeking to contract with the board, Sections 7926.225 and 7926.230. 23 Mandated blood testing and confidentiality to protect public health, prohibition 24 against compelling identification of test subjects, Section 120975 of the Health and 25 Safety Code. 26 Mandated blood testing and confidentiality to protect public health, unauthorized 27 disclosures of identification of test subjects, Sections 1603.1, 1603.3, and 121022 28 of the Health and Safety Code. 29 Mandated blood testing and confidentiality to protect public health, disclosure to 30 patient's spouse, sexual partner, needle sharer, or county health officer, Section 31 121015 of the Health and Safety Code. 32 Manufactured home, mobilehome, floating home, confidentiality of home address 33 of registered owner, Section 18081 of the Health and Safety Code. 34 Marital confidential communications, Sections 980, 981, 982, 983, 984, 985, 986, 35 and 987 of the Evidence Code. 36 Market reports, confidential, Section 7927.300. 37 Marketing of commodities, confidentiality of financial information, Section 38 58781 of the Food and Agricultural Code. 39 Marketing orders, confidentiality of processors' or distributors' information, 40 Section 59202 of the Food and Agricultural Code. 41 Marriage, confidential, certificate, Section 511 of the Family Code. 42 Medi-Cal Benefits Program, confidentiality of information, Section 14100.2 of 43 the Welfare and Institutions Code. 44 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 185 - Medi-Cal Benefits Program, Request of Department for Records of Information, 1 Section 14124.89 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 2 Medi-Cal Fraud Bureau, confidentiality of complaints, Section 12528. 3 Medi-Cal managed care program, exemption from disclosure for financial and 4 utilization data submitted by Medi-Cal managed care health plans to establish rates, 5 Section 14301.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 6 Medi-Cal program, exemption from disclosure for best price contracts between 7 the State Department of Health Care Services and drug manufacturers, Section 8 14105.33 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 9 Medical information, disclosure by provider unless prohibited by patient in 10 writing, Section 56.16 of the Civil Code. 11 Medical information, types of information not subject to patient prohibition of 12 disclosure, Section 56.30 of the Civil Code. 13 Medical and other hospital committees and peer review bodies, confidentiality of 14 records, Section 1157 of the Evidence Code. 15 Medical or dental licensee, action for revocation or suspension due to illness, 16 report, confidentiality of, Section 828 of the Business and Professions Code. 17 Medical or dental licensee, disciplinary action, denial or termination of staff 18 privileges, report, confidentiality of, Sections 805, 805.1, and 805.5 of the Business 19 and Professions Code. 20 Meetings of state agencies, disclosure of agenda, Section 11125.1. 21 Mentally abnormal sex offender committed to state hospital, confidentiality of 22 records, Section 4135 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 23 Mentally disordered and developmentally disabled offenders, access to criminal 24 histories of, Section 1620 of the Penal Code. 25 Mentally disordered persons, court-ordered evaluation, confidentiality of reports, 26 Section 5202 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 27 Mentally disordered or mentally ill person, confidentiality of written consent to 28 detainment, Section 5326.4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 29 Mentally disordered or mentally ill person, voluntarily or involuntarily detained 30 and receiving services, confidentiality of records and information, Sections 5328, 31 5328.15, 5328.2, 5328.4, 5328.8, and 5328.9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 32 Mentally disordered or mentally ill person, weapons restrictions, confidentiality 33 of information about, Section 8103 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 34 Milk marketing, confidentiality of records, Section 61443 of the Food and 35 Agricultural Code. 36 Milk product certification, confidentiality of, Section 62121 of the Food and 37 Agricultural Code. 38 Milk, market milk, confidential records and reports, Section 62243 of the Food 39 and Agricultural Code. 40 Milk product registration, confidentiality of information, Section 38946 of the 41 Food and Agricultural Code. 42 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 186 - Milk equalization pool plan, confidentiality of producers' voting, Section 62716 1 of the Food and Agricultural Code. 2 Mining report, confidentiality of report containing information relating to mineral 3 production, reserves, or rate of depletion of mining operation, Section 2207 of the 4 Public Resources Code. 5 Minor, criminal proceeding testimony closed to public, Section 859.1 of the Penal 6 Code. 7 Minors, material depicting sexual conduct, records of suppliers to be kept and 8 made available to law enforcement, Section 1309.5 of the Labor Code. 9 Misdemeanor and felony reports by police chiefs and sheriffs to Department of 10 Justice, confidentiality of, Sections 11107 and 11107.5 of the Penal Code. 11 Monetary instrument transaction records, confidentiality of, Section 14167 of the 12 Penal Code. 13 Missing persons' information, disclosure of, Sections 14204 and 14205 of the 14 Penal Code. 15 Morbidity and mortality studies, confidentiality of records, Section 100330 of the 16 Health and Safety Code. 17 Motor vehicle accident reports, disclosure, Sections 16005, 20012, and 20014 of 18 the Vehicle Code. 19 Motor vehicles, department of, public records, exceptions, Sections 1808 to 20 1808.7, inclusive, of the Vehicle Code. 21 Motor vehicle insurance fraud reporting, confidentiality of information acquired, 22 Section 1874.3 of the Insurance Code. 23 Motor vehicle liability insurer, data reported to Department of Insurance, 24 confidentiality of, Section 11628 of the Insurance Code. 25 Multijurisdictional drug law enforcement agency, closed sessions to discuss 26 criminal investigation, Section 54957.8. 27 Comment. Section 7930.170 continues former Section 6276.30 without substantive change. For 28 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 29 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 30 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 31 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 32 Former Section 6276.30 included an entry for: \"Managed care health plans, confidentiality of 33 proprietary information, Section 14091.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\" That entry is not 34 included in Section 7930.170 because it is obsolete. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14091.3 35 (2012 Cal. Stat. ch. 23, \u00a7 81) was repealed by its own terms on January 1, 2014. 36 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 37 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 38 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 39 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 40 Notes. 41 (1) Existing Section 6276.30 includes an entry for: \"Managed care health plans, confidentiality 42 of proprietary information, Section 14091.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\" However, 43 Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14091.3 (2012 Cal. Stat. ch. 23, \u00a7 81) was repealed by its 44 own terms on January 1, 2014. 45 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 187 - The Commission is not aware of any new provision that continues the substance of the repealed 1 section. Thus, proposed Section 7930.170 would not include the entry quoted above. The 2 accompanying Comment would explain this omission. 3 This drafting approach does not pose any risk of a substantive change, because the list of 4 exemptions in this chapter is just an aid for CPRA users (not substantive law) and it does not purport 5 to be exhaustive. See proposed Sections 7930.000 and 7930.005 (existing Sections 6275 and 6276). 6 If there is a replacement for former Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14091.3 (2012 Cal. 7 Stat. ch. 23, \u00a7 81), however, it would be helpful to list it in proposed Section 7930.170. Does such 8 a replacement exist? 9 (2) Existing Section 6276.30 also includes an entry for: \"Mentally disordered or mentally ill 10 person, weapons restrictions, confidentiality of information about, Section 8103 of the Welfare and 11 Institutions Code.\" At present, there are two versions of Welfare and Institutions Code Section 12 8103: A version that will sunset by its own terms on January 1, 2020 (2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 861, \u00a7 1) 13 and a version that will become operative on January 1, 2020 (2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 861, \u00a7 2). However, 14 both versions contain the same language regarding record disclosure (see subdivision (e)(3)). 15 Consequently, proposed Section 7930.170, like existing Section 6276.30, would simply refer to 16 \"Section 8103 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\" 17 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 18 especially appreciate public comment on these matters. 19 \u00a7 7930.175. From \"Narcotic addict outpatient revocation proceeding\" to \"Osteopathic 20 physician and surgeon\" 21 7930.175. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 22 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 23 Narcotic and drug abuse patients, confidentiality of records, Section 11845.5, 24 Health and Safety Code. 25 Native American graves, cemeteries and sacred places, records of, Section 26 7927.000. 27 Notary public, confidentiality of application for appointment and commission, 28 Section 8201.5. 29 Nurse, alcohol or dangerous drug diversion and rehabilitation records, 30 confidentiality of, Section 2770.12, Business and Professions Code. 31 Obscene matter, defense of scientific or other purpose, confidentiality of 32 recipients, Section 311.8, Penal Code. 33 Occupational safety and health investigations, confidentiality of complaints and 34 complainants, Section 6309, Labor Code. 35 Occupational safety and health investigations, confidentiality of trade secrets, 36 Section 6322, Labor Code. 37 Official information acquired in confidence by public employee, disclosure of, 38 Sections 1040 and 1041, Evidence Code. 39 Oil and gas, confidentiality of proposals for the drilling of a well, Section 3724.4, 40 Public Resources Code. 41 Oil and gas, disclosure of onshore and offshore exploratory well records, Section 42 3234, Public Resources Code. 43 Oil and gas, disclosure of well records, Section 3752, Public Resources Code. 44 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 188 - Oil and gas leases, surveys for permits, confidentiality of information, Section 1 6826, Public Resources Code. 2 Oil spill feepayer information, prohibition against disclosure, Section 46751, 3 Revenue and Taxation Code. 4 Older adults receiving county services, providing information between county 5 agencies, confidentiality of, Section 9401, Welfare and Institutions Code. 6 Organic food certification organization records, release of, Section 110845, 7 Health and Safety Code. 8 Osteopathic physician and surgeon, rehabilitation and diversion records, 9 confidentiality of, Section 2369, Business and Professions Code. 10 Comment. Section 7930.175 continues former Section 6276.32 without substantive change. For 11 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 12 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 13 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 14 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 15 Former Section 6276.32 included an entry for: \"Narcotic addict outpatient revocation 16 proceeding, confidentiality of reports, Section 3152.5, Welfare and Institutions Code.\" That entry 17 is not included in Section 7930.175 because it is obsolete. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 18 3152.5 (1978 Cal. Stat. ch. 856, \u00a7 5) was repealed by the terms of former Welfare and Institutions 19 Code Section 3202 (see 2012 Cal. Stat. ch. 41, \u00a7 119). 20 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 21 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 22 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 23 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 24 Note. Existing Section 6276.32 includes an entry for: \"Narcotic addict outpatient revocation 25 proceeding, confidentiality of reports, Section 3152.5, Welfare and Institutions Code.\" However, 26 Welfare and Institutions Code Section 3152.5 (1978 Cal. Stat. ch. 856, \u00a7 5) was repealed by the 27 terms of former Welfare and Institutions Code Section 3202 (see 2012 Cal. Stat. ch. 41, \u00a7 119). 28 The Commission is not aware of any new provision that continues the substance of the repealed 29 section. Thus, (1) proposed Section 7930.175 would not include the entry quoted above, and (2) 30 the accompanying Comment would explain this omission. 31 This drafting approach does not pose any risk of a substantive change, because the list of 32 exemptions in this chapter is just an aid for CPRA users (not substantive law) and it does not purport 33 to be exhaustive. See proposed Sections 7930.000 and 7930.005 (existing Sections 6275 and 6276). 34 If there is a replacement for former Welfare and Institutions Code Section 3152.5 (1978 Cal. 35 Stat. ch. 856, \u00a7 5), however, it would be helpful to list it in proposed Section 7930.175. Does such 36 a replacement exist? 37 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 38 especially appreciate public comment on this matter. 39 \u00a7 7930.180. From \"Parole revocation proceedings\" to \"Postmortem or autopsy photos\" 40 7930.180. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 41 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 42 Parole revocation proceedings, confidentiality of information in reports, Section 43 3063.5, Penal Code. 44 Passenger fishing boat licenses, records, Section 7923, Fish and Game Code. 45 Paternity, acknowledgement, confidentiality of records, Section 102760, Health 46 and Safety Code. 47 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 189 - Patient-physician confidential communication, Sections 992 and 994, Evidence 1 Code. 2 Patient records, confidentiality of, Section 123135, Health and Safety Code. 3 Payroll records, confidentiality of, Section 1776, Labor Code. 4 Peace officer personnel records, confidentiality of, Sections 832.7 and 832.8, 5 Penal Code. 6 Penitential communication between penitent and clergy, Sections 1032 and 1033, 7 Evidence Code. 8 Personal Care Services Program, exemption from disclosure for information 9 regarding persons paid by the state to provide personal care services, Section 10 7926.300. 11 Personal Income Tax, disclosure of information, Article 2 (commencing with 12 Section 19542), Chapter 7, Part 10.2, Division 2, Revenue and Taxation Code. 13 Personal information, Information Practices Act, prohibitions against disclosure 14 by state agencies, Sections 1798.24 and 1798.75, Civil Code. 15 Personal information, subpoena of records containing, Section 1985.4, Code of 16 Civil Procedure. 17 Personal representative, confidentiality of personal representative's birth date and 18 driver's license number, Section 8404, Probate Code. 19 Persons formerly classified as mentally abnormal sex offenders committed to a 20 state hospital, confidentiality of records, Section 4135, Welfare and Institutions 21 Code. 22 Persons with mental health disorders, court-ordered evaluation, confidentiality of 23 reports, Section 5202, Welfare and Institutions Code. 24 Persons with mental health disorders, confidentiality of written consent to 25 detainment, Section 5326.4, Welfare and Institutions Code. 26 Persons with mental health disorders voluntarily detained and receiving services, 27 confidentiality of records and information, Sections 5328, 5328.15, 5328.2, 5328.4, 28 5328.8, and 5328.9, Welfare and Institutions Code. 29 Persons with mental health disorders, weapons restrictions, confidentiality of 30 information about, Section 8103, Welfare and Institutions Code. 31 Petition signatures, Section 18650, Elections Code. 32 Petroleum supply and pricing, confidential information, Sections 25364 and 33 25366, Public Resources Code. 34 Pharmacist, alcohol or dangerous drug diversion and rehabilitation records, 35 confidentiality of, Section 4372, Business and Professions Code. 36 Physical therapist or assistant, records of dangerous drug or alcohol diversion and 37 rehabilitation, confidentiality of, Section 2667, Business and Professions Code. 38 Physical or mental condition or conviction of controlled substance offense, 39 records in Department of Motor Vehicles, confidentiality of, Section 1808.5, 40 Vehicle Code. 41 Physician and surgeon, rehabilitation and diversion records, confidentiality of, 42 Section 2355, Business and Professions Code. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 190 - Physician assistant, alcohol or dangerous drug diversion and rehabilitation 1 records, confidentiality of, Section 3534.7, Business and Professions Code. 2 Physician competency examination, confidentiality of reports, Section 2294, 3 Business and Professions Code. 4 Physicians and surgeons, confidentiality of reports of patients with a lapse of 5 consciousness disorder, Section 103900, Health and Safety Code. 6 Physician Services Account, confidentiality of patient names in claims, Section 7 16956, Welfare and Institutions Code. 8 Pilots, confidentiality of personal information, Section 1157.1, Harbors and 9 Navigation Code. 10 Pollution Control Financing Authority, financial data submitted to, Section 11 7924.505. 12 Postmortem or autopsy photos, Section 129, Code of Civil Procedure. 13 Comment. Section 7930.180 continues former Section 6276.34 without substantive change. For 14 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 15 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 16 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 17 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 18 Former Section 6276.34 included an entry for: \"Payment instrument licensee records, inspection 19 of, Section 33206, Financial Code.\" That entry is not included in Section 7930.180 because it is 20 obsolete. Financial Code Section 33206 (1996 Cal. Stat. ch. 1064, \u00a7 712) has been repealed. See 21 2010 Cal. Stat. ch. 612, \u00a7 4. 22 Former Section 6276.34 also included an entry for: \"Physician and surgeon, rehabilitation and 23 diversion records, confidentiality of, Section 2355, Business and Professions Code.\" That entry is 24 not included in Section 7930.180 because it is obsolete. Business and Professions Code Section 25 2355 (2000 Cal. Stat. ch. 836, \u00a7 12) has been repealed. See 2005 Cal. Stat. ch. 674, \u00a7 16 (sunset 26 clause, operative Jan. 1, 2009). 27 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 28 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 29 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 30 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 31 Notes. 32 (1) Existing Section 6276.34 includes an entry for: \"Payment instrument licensee records, 33 inspection of, Section 33206, Financial Code.\" However, Financial Code Section 33206 (1996 Cal. 34 Stat. ch. 1064, \u00a7 712) was part of the Payment Instruments Law (former Fin. Code \u00a7 33000 et seq.), 35 which was repealed by a bill enacted in 2010. See 2010 Cal. Stat. ch. 612, \u00a7 4. 36 That bill also repealed the Money Abroad Law (former Fin. Code \u00a7 1800 et seq.) and the 37 Travelers Check Act (former Fin. Code \u00a7 1851 et seq.). Much of the substance of these three 38 repealed bodies of law was consolidated into the Money Transmission Act (Fin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1800-39 1872). See, e.g., Senate Committee on Banking, Finance & Insurance Analysis of AB 2789 (June 40 30, 2010). 41 The Commission has not found any new provision that continues the substance of the former 42 Financial Code Section 33206. Thus, proposed Section 7930.180 would not include the entry 43 quoted above. The accompanying Comment would explain this omission. 44 This drafting approach does not pose any risk of a substantive change, because the list of 45 exemptions in this chapter is just an aid for CPRA users (not substantive law) and it does not purport 46 to be exhaustive. See proposed Sections 7930.000 and 7930.005 (existing Sections 6275 and 6276). 47 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 191 - If there is a replacement for former Financial Code Section 33206 (1996 Cal. Stat. ch. 1064, \u00a7 1 712), however, it would be helpful to list it in proposed Section 7930.180. Does such a replacement 2 exist? 3 (2) Existing Section 6276.34 also includes an entry for: \"Persons with mental health disorders, 4 weapons restrictions, confidentiality of information about, Section 8103, Welfare and Institutions 5 Code.\" At present, there are two versions of Welfare and Institutions Code Section 8103: A version 6 that will sunset by its own terms on January 1, 2020 (2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 861, \u00a7 1) and a version 7 that will become operative on January 1, 2020 (2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 861, \u00a7 2). However, both versions 8 contain the same language regarding record disclosure (see subdivision (e)(3)). Consequently, 9 proposed Section 7930.180, like existing Section 6276.34, would simply refer to \"Section 8103, 10 Welfare and Institutions Code.\" 11 (3) Another entry in existing Section 6276.34 is for: \"Physician and surgeon, rehabilitation and 12 diversion records, confidentiality of, Section 2355, Business and Professions Code.\" However, 13 Business and Professions Code Section 2355 (2000 Cal. Stat. ch. 836, \u00a7 12) has been repealed. See 14 2005 Cal. Stat. ch. 674, \u00a7 16 (sunset clause, operative Jan. 1, 2009). 15 The Commission has not found any new provision that continues the substance of the former 16 Business and Professions Code Section 2355; the diversion programs to which it pertained appear 17 to have been discontinued. Thus, proposed Section 7930.180 would not include the entry quoted 18 above. The accompanying Comment would explain this omission. 19 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 20 especially appreciate public comment on these matters. 21 22 \u00a7 7930.185. From \"Pregnancy tests by local public health agencies\" to \"Pupil records\" 23 7930.185. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 24 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 25 Pregnancy tests by local public health agencies, confidentiality of, Section 26 123380, Health and Safety Code. 27 Pregnant women, confidentiality of blood tests, Section 125105, Health and 28 Safety Code. 29 Prehospital emergency medical care, release of information, Sections 1797.188 30 and 1797.189, Health and Safety Code. 31 Prenatal syphilis tests, confidentiality of, Section 120705, Health and Safety 32 Code. 33 Prescription drug discounts, confidentiality of corporate proprietary information, 34 Section 130506, Health and Safety Code. 35 Prisoners, behavioral research on, confidential personal information, Section 36 3515, Penal Code. 37 Prisoners, confidentiality of blood tests, Section 7530, Penal Code. 38 Prisoners, medical testing, confidentiality of records, Sections 7517 and 7540, 39 Penal Code. 40 Prisoners, transfer from county facility for mental treatment and evaluation, 41 confidentiality of written reasons, Section 4011.6, Penal Code. 42 Private industry wage data collected by public entity, confidentiality of, Section 43 7927.600. 44 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 -

193 - Public social services, confidentiality of records, Section 10850, Welfare and 1 Institutions Code. 2 Public social services, disclosure of information to law enforcement agencies, 3 Section 10850.3, Welfare and Institutions Code. 4 Public social services, disclosure of information to law enforcement agencies 5 regarding deceased applicant or recipient, Section 10850.7, Welfare and Institutions 6 Code. 7 Public utilities, confidentiality of information, Section 583, Public Utilities Code. 8 Pupil, confidentiality of personal information, Section 45345, Education Code. 9 Pupil drug and alcohol use questionnaires, confidentiality of, Section 11605, 10 Health and Safety Code. 11 Pupil, expulsion hearing, disclosure of testimony of witness and closed session of 12 district board, Section 48918, Education Code. 13 Pupil, personal information disclosed to school counselor, confidentiality of, 14 Section 49602, Education Code. 15 Pupil record contents, records of administrative hearing to change contents, 16 confidentiality of, Section 49070, Education Code. 17 Pupil records, access authorized for specified parties, Section 49076, Education 18 Code. 19 Pupil records, disclosure in hearing to dismiss or suspend school employee, 20 Section 44944.3, Education Code. 21 Pupil records, release of directory information to private entities, Sections 49073 22 and 49073.5, Education Code. 23 Comment. Section 7930.185 continues former Section 6276.36 without substantive change. For 24 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 25 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 26 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 27 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 28 Former Section 6276.36 included an entry for: \"Public Employees' Retirement System, 29 confidentiality of data filed by member or beneficiary with board of administration, Section 30 20134.\" That entry has been revised because Section 20134 was repealed and its substance moved 31 to Section 20230. See 1995 Cal. Stat. ch. 379, \u00a7 1; compare 1985 Cal. Stat. ch. 1508, \u00a7 1 with 32 Section 20230. Section 7930.185 would thus refer to Section 20230, instead of Section 20134. 33 Former Section 6276.36 also included an entry for: \"Pupil records, disclosure in hearing to 34 dismiss or suspend school employee, Section 44944.1, Education Code.\" That entry has been 35 revised because Section 44944.1 was repealed and added, and the new provision does not address 36 record disclosure (see 2014 Cal. Stat. ch. 55, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 18). The substance of the repealed provision 37 has been moved to Education Code Section 44944.3 (compare 1985 Cal. Stat. ch. 324, \u00a7 3 (former Educ. Code Educ. Code \u00a7 44944.3). Proposed Section 7930.135 would thus refer 39 to Education Code Section 44944.3, instead of Education Code Section 44944.1. 40 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 41 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 42 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 43 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 44 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 194 - Notes. 1 (1) Existing Section 6276.36 includes an entry for: \"Public Employees' Retirement System, 2 confidentiality of data filed by member or beneficiary with board of administration, Section 3 20134.\" However, Section 20134 has been repealed (see 1995 Cal. Stat. ch. 379, \u00a7 1). Its substance 4 has been moved to Section 20230 (compare 1985 Cal. Stat. ch. 1508, \u00a7 1 with Section 20230). 5 Accordingly, proposed Section 7930.185 would refer to Section 20230, instead of Section 20134. 6 (2) Existing Section 6276.36 also includes an entry for: \"Pupil records, disclosure in hearing to 7 dismiss or suspend school employee, Section 44944.1, Education Code.\" However, Education 8 Code Section 44944.1 was repealed and added, and the new provision does not address record 9 disclosure. See 2014 Cal. Stat. ch. 55, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 18. 10 The substance of the repealed provision has been moved to Education Code Section 44944.3. 11 Compare 1985 Cal. Stat. ch. 324, \u00a7 3 Educ. Code \u00a7 44944.1) Code \u00a7 44944.3. 12 Accordingly, proposed Section 7930.185 would refer to Education Code Section 44944.3, instead 13 of Education Code Section 44944.1. 14 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 15 especially appreciate public comment on these matters. 16 \u00a7 7930.190. From \"Radioactive materials\" to \"Reward by Governor\" 17 7930.190. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 18 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 19 Radioactive materials, dissemination of information about transportation of, 20 Section 33002, Vehicle Code. 21 Railroad infrastructure protection program, disclosure not required for risk 22 assessments filed with the Public Utilities Commission, the Director of Emergency 23 Services, or the Office of Emergency Services, Section 7929.215. 24 Real estate broker, annual report to Bureau of Real Estate of financial information, 25 confidentiality of, Section 10232.2, Business and Professions Code. 26 Real property, acquisition by state or local government, information relating to 27 feasibility, Section 7928.705. 28 Real property, change in ownership statement, confidentiality of, Section 27280. 29 Records described in Section 1620 of the Penal Code. 30 Records of contract purchasers, inspection by public prohibited, Section 85, 31 Military and Veterans Code. 32 Records of persons committed to a state hospital pursuant to Section 4135 of the 33 Welfare and Institutions Code. 34 Registered public obligations, inspection of records of security interests in, 35 Section 5060. 36 Registration of exempt vehicles, nondisclosure of name of person involved in 37 alleged violation, Section 5003, Vehicle Code. 38 Rehabilitation, Department of, confidential information, Section 19016, Welfare 39 and Institutions Code. 40 Reinsurance intermediary-broker license information, confidentiality of, Section 41 1781.3, Insurance Code. 42 Relocation assistance, confidential records submitted to a public entity by a 43 business or farm operation, Section 7262. 44 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 195 - Rent control ordinance, confidentiality of information concerning 1 accommodations sought to be withdrawn from, Section 7060.4. 2 Report of probation officer, inspection, copies, Section 1203.05, Penal Code. 3 Repossession agency licensee application, confidentiality of information, 4 Sections 7503, 7504, and 7506.5, Business and Professions Code. 5 Reproductive health facilities, disclosure not required for personal information 6 regarding employees, volunteers, board members, owners, partners, officers, and 7 contractors of a reproductive health services facility who have provided requisite 8 notification, Sections 7926.400 to 7926.430, inclusive. 9 Residence address in any record of Department of Housing and Community 10 Development, confidentiality of, Section 7927.415. 11 Residence address in any record of Department of Motor Vehicles, confidentiality 12 of, Section 7927.405, Government Code, and Section 1808.21, Vehicle Code. 13 Residence and mailing addresses in records of Department of Motor Vehicles, 14 confidentiality of, Section 1810.7, Vehicle Code. 15 Residential care facilities, confidentiality of resident information, Section 16 1568.08, Health and Safety Code. 17 Residential care facilities for the elderly, confidentiality of client information, 18 Section 1569.315, Health and Safety Code. 19 Resource families, identifying information, Section 16519.55, Welfare and 20 Institutions Code. 21 Respiratory care practitioner, professional competency examination reports, 22 confidentiality of, Section 3756, Business and Professions Code. 23 Restraint of trade, civil action by district attorney, confidential memorandum, 24 Section 16750, Business and Professions Code. 25 Reward by Governor for information leading to arrest and conviction, 26 confidentiality of person supplying information, Section 1547, Penal Code. 27 Comment. Section 7930.190 continues former Section 6276.38. For the source of the 28 introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes and constitutional 29 provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions thereof, from 30 disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 7930.000 and 31 essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 32 The last entry in former Section 6276.38 was for: \"Safe surrender site, confidentiality of 33 information pertaining to a parent or individual surrendering a child, Section 1255.7, Health and 34 Safety Code.\" That entry is not included in Section 7930.190. Instead, it is included in Section 35 7930.195, together with other entries that begin with \"S.\" 36 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 37 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 38 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 39 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 40 Note. Existing Section 6276.38 includes an entry for: \"Residential care facilities for the elderly, 41 confidentiality of client information, Section 1569.315, Health and Safety Code.\" There are two 42 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 196 - versions of Section 1569.315 in the Health and Safety Code (1985 Cal. Stat. ch. 869, \u00a7 4; 1985 Cal. 1 Stat. ch. 1096, \u00a7 5). 2 Both versions require a residential care facility for the elderly to keep and protect \"the privacy 3 and confidentiality of\" certain records. Most of the differences between the versions are stylistic, 4 but only the first version applies to \"the ... address ... of the client's physician ....\" 5 Like existing Section 6276.38, proposed Section 7930.190 would simply refer to \"Section 6 1569.315, Health and Safety Code.\" Is that the best way to handle this situation? 7 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 8 especially appreciate public comment on this matter. 9 \u00a7 7930.195. From \"Safe surrender site\" to \"Social security numbers within records of local 10 agencies\" 11 7930.195. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 12 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 13 Safe surrender site, confidentiality of information pertaining to a parent or 14 individual surrendering a child, Section 1255.7, Health and Safety Code. 15 Sales and use tax, disclosure of information, Section 7056, Revenue and Taxation 16 Code. 17 Santa Barbara Regional Health Authority, exemption from disclosure for records 18 maintained by the authority regarding negotiated rates for the California Medical 19 Assistance Program, Section 14499.6, Welfare and Institutions Code. 20 Savings association employees, disclosure of criminal history information, 21 Section 6525, Financial Code. 22 Savings associations, inspection of records by shareholders, Section 6050, 23 Financial Code. 24 School district governing board, disciplinary action, disclosure of pupil 25 information, Section 35146, Education Code. 26 School employee, merit system examination records, confidentiality of, Section 27 45274, Education Code. 28 School employee, notice and reasons for hearing on nonreemployment of 29 employee, confidentiality of, Sections 44948.5 and 44949, Education Code. 30 School meals for needy pupils, confidentiality of records, Section 49558, 31 Education Code. 32 Sealed records, arrest for misdemeanor, Section 851.7, Penal Code. 33 Sealed records, misdemeanor convictions, Section 1203.45, Penal Code. 34 Sealing and destruction of arrest records, determination of innocence, Section 35 851.8, Penal Code. 36 Search warrants, special master, Section 1524, Penal Code. 37 Sex change, confidentiality of birth certificate, Section 103440, Health and Safety 38 Code. 39 Sex offenders, registration form, Section 290.021, Penal Code. 40 Sexual assault forms, confidentiality of, Section 13823.5, Penal Code. 41 Sexual assault counselor and victim, confidential communication, Sections 42 1035.2, 1035.4, and 1035.8, Evidence Code. 43 Shorthand reporter's complaint, Section 8010, Business and Professions Code. 44 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 197 - Small family day care homes, identifying information, Section 1596.86, Health 1 and Safety Code. 2 Social security number, applicant for driver's license or identification card, 3 nondisclosure of, Section 1653.5, Vehicle Code, and Section 7922.200. 4 Social security number, official record or official filing, nondisclosure of, Section 5 9526.5, Commercial Code, and Sections 7922.205 and 7922.210. 6 Social Security Number Truncation Program, Article 3.5 (commencing with 7 Section 27300), Chapter 6, Part 3, Division 2, Title 3. 8 Social security numbers within records of local agencies, nondisclosure of, 9 Section 7922.200. 10 Comment. Section 7930.195 continues former Section 6276.40. For the source of the 11 introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes and constitutional 12 provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions thereof, from 13 disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 7930.000 and 14 essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 15 Former Section 6276.38 consisted of entries beginning with \"R,\" plus an entry for: \"Safe 16 surrender site, confidentiality of information pertaining to a parent or individual surrendering a 17 child, Section 1255.7, Health and Safety Code.\" The quoted entry belongs with other entries that 18 begin with \"S,\" not with entries that begin with \"R.\" Thus, the quoted entry is recodified here in 19 Section 7930.195, not in Section 7930.190. 20 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 21 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 22 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 23 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 24 Note. Existing Section 6276.40 includes an entry for: \"Social security number, applicant for 25 driver's license or identification card, nondisclosure of, Section 1653.5, Vehicle Code ....\" At 26 present, there are two versions of Vehicle Code Section 1653.5, with different rules governing 27 when they are operative: (1) 2014 Cal. Stat. ch. 452, \u00a7 2, and (2) 2014 Cal. Stat. ch. 71, \u00a7 168. Both 28 versions restrict disclosure of the social security number of an applicant for a driver's license or 29 identification card. For that reason, and because only one version will be operative at a time, 30 proposed Section 7930.195, like existing Section 6276.40, would simply refer to \"Section 1653.5, 31 Vehicle Code ....\" 32 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 33 especially appreciate public comment on this matter. 34 \u00a7 7930.200. From \"State agency activities relating to unrepresented employees\" to 35 \"Sturgeon egg processors\" 36 7930.200. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 37 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 38 State agency activities relating to unrepresented employees, Section 7928.405. 39 State agency activities relating to providers of health care, Section 7927.500. 40 State Auditor, access to barred records, Section 8545.2. 41 State Auditor, confidentiality of records, Sections 8545, 8545.1, and 8545.3. 42 State civil service employee, confidentiality of appeal to state personnel board, 43 Section 18952. 44 State civil service employees, confidentiality of reports, Section 18573. 45 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 198 - State civil service examination, confidentiality of application and examination 1 materials, Section 18934. 2 State Compensation Insurance Fund, exemption from disclosure for various 3 records maintained by the State Compensation Insurance Fund, Sections 7929.400 4 to 7929.430, inclusive. 5 State Contract Act, bids, questionnaires and financial statements, Section 10165, 6 Public Contract Code. 7 State Contract Act, bids, sealing, opening and reading bids, Section 10304, Public 8 Contract Code. 9 State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, 10 confidentiality of proprietary information submitted to, Section 25223, Public 11 Resources Code. 12 State hospital patients, information and records in possession of Superintendent 13 of Public Instruction, confidentiality of, Section 56863, Education Code. 14 State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, access to government agency records, 15 Section 9723, Welfare and Institutions Code. 16 State Long-Term Care Ombudsman office, confidentiality of records and files, 17 Section 9725, Welfare and Institutions Code. 18 State Long-Term Care Ombudsman office, disclosure of information or 19 communications, Section 9715, Welfare and Institutions Code. 20 State Lottery Evaluation Report, disclosure, Section 8880.46. 21 State prisoners, exemption from disclosure for surveys by the California Research 22 Bureau of children of female prisoners, Section 7443, Penal Code. 23 State summary criminal history information, confidentiality of information, 24 Sections 11105, 11105.1, 11105.3, and 11105.4, Penal Code. 25 State Teachers' Retirement System, confidentiality of information filed with the 26 system by a member, participant, or beneficiary, Section 22306, Education Code. 27 Sterilization of disabled, confidentiality of evaluation report, Section 1955, 28 Probate Code. 29 Strawberry marketing information, confidentiality of, Section 63124, Food and 30 Agricultural Code. 31 Structural pest control licensee records relating to pesticide use, confidentiality 32 of, Section 15205, Food and Agricultural Code. 33 Student driver, records of physical or mental condition, confidentiality of, Section 34 12661, Vehicle Code. 35 Student, community college, information received by school counselor, 36 confidentiality of, Section 72621, Education Code. 37 Student, community college, records, limitations on release, Section 76243, 38 Education Code. 39 Student, community college, record contents, records of administrative hearing to 40 change contents, confidentiality of, Section 76232, Education Code. 41 Student, sexual assault on private higher education institution campus, 42 confidentiality of information, Section 94385, Education Code. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 199 - Student, sexual assault on public college or university, confidentiality of 1 information, Section 67385, Education Code. 2 Sturgeon egg processors, records, Section 10004, Fish and Game Code. 3 Comment. Section 7930.200 continues former Section 6276.42 without substantive change. For 4 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 5 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 6 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 7 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 8 Former Section 6276.42 included an entry for: \"State Teachers' Retirement System, 9 confidentiality of information filed with the system by a member, participant, or beneficiary, 10 Sections 22306 and 26215, Education Code.\" That entry has been revised to refer only to Education 11 Code Section 22306. The reference to Education Code Section 26215 is obsolete because that 12 section was repealed as redundant. See 2017 Cal. Stat. ch. 298, \u00a7 11; Senate Committee on Public 13 Employment & Retirement Analysis of AB 1325 (July 10, 2017), p. 5. 14 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 15 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 16 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 17 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 18 Note. Existing Section 6276.42 includes an entry for: \"State Teachers' Retirement System, 19 confidentiality of information filed with the system by a member, participant, or beneficiary, 20 Sections 22306 and 26215, Education Code.\" However, Education Code Section 26215 has been 21 repealed, apparently because it was considered redundant with Education Code Section 22306. See 22 2017 Cal. Stat. ch. 298, \u00a7 11; Senate Committee on Public Employment & Retirement Analysis of 23 AB 1325 (July 10, 2017), p. 5. 24 Thus, proposed Section 7930.200 would include the entry quoted above, but it would only refer 25 to Education Code Section 22306. The accompanying Comment would explain the omission of 26 Education Code Section 26215. 27 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 28 especially appreciate public comment on this matter. 29 \u00a7 7930.205. From \"Taxpayer information\" to \"Trust companies\" 30 7930.205. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 31 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 32 Taxpayer information, confidentiality, local taxes, Section 7925.000. 33 Tax preparer, disclosure of information obtained in business of preparing tax 34 returns, Section 17530.5, Business and Professions Code. 35 Teacher, credential holder or applicant, information provided to Commission on 36 Teacher Credentialing, confidentiality of, Section 44341, Education Code. 37 Teacher, certified school personnel examination results, confidentiality of, 38 Section 44289, Education Code. 39 Telephone answering service customer list, trade secret, Section 16606, Business 40 and Professions Code. 41 Timber yield tax, disclosure to county assessor, Section 38706, Revenue and 42 Taxation Code. 43 Timber yield tax, disclosure of information, Section 38705, Revenue and Taxation 44 Code. 45 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 200 - Title insurers, confidentiality of notice of noncompliance, Section 12414.14, 1 Insurance Code. 2 Tobacco products, exemption from disclosure for distribution information 3 provided to the State Department of Public Health, Section 22954, Business and 4 Professions Code. 5 Tow truck driver, information in records of California Highway Patrol, 6 Department of Motor Vehicles, or other agencies, confidentiality of, Sections 2431 7 and 2432.3, Vehicle Code. 8 Toxic substances, Department of, inspection of records of, Section 25152.5, 9 Health and Safety Code. 10 Trade secrets, Section 1060, Evidence Code. 11 Trade secrets, confidentiality of, occupational safety and health inspections, 12 Section 6322, Labor Code. 13 Trade secrets, disclosure of public records, Section 3426.7, Civil Code. 14 Trade secrets, food, drugs, cosmetics, nondisclosure, Sections 110165 and 15 110370, Health and Safety Code. 16 Trade secrets, protection by Director of the Department of Pesticide Regulation, 17 Sections 7924.300 to 7924.335, inclusive. 18 Trade secrets and proprietary information relating to pesticides, confidentiality of, 19 Sections 14022 and 14023, Food and Agricultural Code. 20 Trade secrets, protection by Director of Industrial Relations, Section 6396, Labor 21 Code. 22 Trade secrets relating to hazardous substances, disclosure of, Sections 25358.2 23 and 25358.7, Health and Safety Code. 24 Traffic violator school licensee records, confidentiality of, Section 11212, Vehicle 25 Code. 26 Traffic offense, dismissed for participation in driving school or program, record 27 of, confidentiality of, Section 1808.7, Vehicle Code. 28 Transit districts, questionnaire and financial statement information in bids, 29 Section 99154, Public Utilities Code. 30 Tribal-state gaming contracts, exemption from disclosure for records of an Indian 31 tribe relating to securitization of annual payments, Section 63048.63. 32 Trust companies, disclosure of private trust confidential information, Section 33 1602, Financial Code. 34 Comment. Section 7930.205 continues former Section 6276.44 without substantive change. For 35 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 36 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 37 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 38 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 39 Former Section 6276.44 included an entry for: \"Trust companies, disclosure of private trust 40 confidential information, Section 1582, Financial Code.\" That entry has been revised because 41 Financial Code Section 1582 was repealed in 2011 and replaced by a new provision that has nothing 42 to do with disclosure of private trust confidential information (see 2011 Cal. Stat. ch. 243, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3). 43 The substance of the repealed provision was moved to Financial Code Section 1602 (compare 44 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 201 - former Fin. Code \u00a7 1582 (1996 Cal. Stat. ch. 1064, \u00a7 212) with Fin. Code \u00a7 1602). Section 7930.205 1 thus refers to Financial Code Section 1602, instead of Financial Code Section 1582. 2 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 3 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 4 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 5 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 6 Note. Existing Section 6276.44 includes an entry for: \"Trust companies, disclosure of private trust 7 confidential information, Section 1582, Financial Code.\" However, Financial Code Section 1582 8 was repealed and added in 2011, and the new provision has nothing to do with disclosure of private 9 trust confidential information. See 2011 Cal. Stat. ch. 243, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3. 10 The substance of the repealed provision has been moved to Financial Code Section 1602. 11 Compare former Fin. Code \u00a7 1582 (1996 Cal. Stat. ch. 1064, \u00a7 212) with Fin. Code \u00a7 1602. 12 Accordingly, proposed Section 7930.205 would refer to Financial Code Section 1602, instead of 13 Financial Code Section 1582. 14 The Commission welcomes input on any aspect of its proposed recodification, but it would 15 especially appreciate public comment on this matter. 16 \u00a7 7930.210. From \"Unclaimed property\" to \"Wards and dependent children\" 17 7930.210. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 18 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 19 Unclaimed property, Controller records of, disclosure, Section 1582, Code of 20 Civil Procedure. 21 Unemployment compensation, disclosure of confidential information, Section 22 2111, Unemployment Insurance Code. 23 Unemployment compensation, information obtained in administration of code, 24 Section 1094, Unemployment Insurance Code. 25 Unemployment fund contributions, publication of annual tax paid, Section 989, 26 Unemployment Insurance Code. 27 University of California, exemption from disclosure for information submitted by 28 bidders for award of best value contracts, Section 10506.6, Public Contract Code. 29 Unsafe working condition, confidentiality of complainant, Section 6309, Labor 30 Code. 31 Use fuel tax information, disclosure prohibited, Section 9255, Revenue and 32 Taxation Code. 33 Utility systems development, confidential information, Section 7927.300. 34 Utility user tax return and payment records, exemption from disclosure, Section 35 7284.6, Revenue and Taxation Code. 36 Vehicle registration, confidentiality of information, Section 4750.4, Vehicle 37 Code. 38 Vehicle accident reports, disclosure of, Sections 16005, 20012, and 20014, 39 Vehicle Code and Section 27177, Streets and Highways Code. 40 Vehicular offense, record of, confidentiality five years after conviction, Section 41 1807.5, Vehicle Code. 42 Veterans Affairs, Department of, confidentiality of records of contract purchasers, 43 Section 85, Military and Veterans Code. 44 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 202 - Veterinarian or animal health technician, alcohol or dangerous drugs diversion 1 and rehabilitation records, confidentiality of, Section 4871, Business and 2 Professions Code. 3 Victims' Legal Resource Center, confidentiality of information and records 4 retained, Section 13897.2, Penal Code. 5 Voter, affidavit or registration, confidentiality of information contained in, 6 Section 7924.000. 7 Voter, registration by confidential affidavit, Section 2194, Elections Code. 8 Voting, secrecy, Section 1050, Evidence Code. 9 Wards and dependent children, inspection of juvenile court documents, Section 10 827, Welfare and Institutions Code. 11 Comment. Section 7930.210 continues former Section 6276.46 without substantive change. For 12 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 13 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 14 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 15 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 16 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 17 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 18 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 19 CPRA catch-all exemption, see to \"Youth Authority\" 21 7930.215. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 22 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 23 Wards, petition for sealing records, Section 781, Welfare and Institutions Code. 24 Winegrowers of California Commission, confidentiality of producers' or 25 vintners' proprietary information, Sections 74655 and 74955, Food and Agricultural 26 Code. 27 Workers' Compensation Appeals Board, injury or illness report, confidentiality 28 of, Section 6412, Labor Code. 29 Workers' compensation insurance, dividend payment to policyholder, 30 confidentiality of information, Section 11739, Insurance Code. 31 Workers' compensation insurance fraud reporting, confidentiality of information, 32 Section 1877.4, Insurance Code. 33 Workers' compensation insurer or rating organization, confidentiality of notice of 34 noncompliance, Section 11754, Insurance Code. 35 Workers' compensation insurer, rating information, confidentiality of, Section 36 11752.7, Insurance Code. 37 Workers' compensation, notice to correct noncompliance, Section 11754, 38 Insurance Code. 39 Workers' compensation, release of information to other governmental agencies, 40 Section 11752.5, Insurance Code. 41 Workers' compensation, self-insured employers, confidentiality of financial 42 information, Section 3742, Labor Code. 43 Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 203 - Workplace inspection photographs, confidentiality of, Section 6314, Labor Code. 1 Youth Authority, parole revocation proceedings, confidentiality of, Section 2 1767.6, Welfare and Institutions Code. 3 Youth Authority, release of information in possession of Youth Authority for 4 offenses under Sections 676, 1764.1, and 1764.2, Welfare and Institutions Code. 5 Comment. Section 7930.215 continues former Section 6276.48 without substantive change. For 6 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 7 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 8 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 9 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 10 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 11 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 12 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.600. For the 13 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 14 UNCODIFIED 15 Legislative findings 16 SEC. ____. This act would recodify the California Public Records Act (Sections 17 6250 to 6276.48, inclusive, of the Government Code) in a more user-friendly 18 manner without changing its substance, and make conforming revisions. Consistent 19 with subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the 20 Legislature finds and declares: 21 (1) This act continues the existing substantive balance between the public's right 22 of access to information concerning the conduct of public business and competing 23 interests. This act does not impose any new limitation on the public's right of access, 24 which would require findings demonstrating the interest protected by the new 25 limitation and the need for protecting that interest. 26 (2) By making the California Public Records Act more user-friendly, this act 27 furthers the public's right of access to information concerning the conduct of public 28 business. 29 Operative date 30 SEC. ____. This act becomes operative on July 1, 2021. 31 ______________ Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 204 - Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 205 - DISPOSITION OF FORMER LAW Note. This table shows the proposed disposition of the following provisions of the California Public Records Act (Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48), as that law existed on January 1, 2018. Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Government Code. Existing Provision(s) Proposed May 2019 - 208 - Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 209 - DERIVATION OF NEW LAW Note. This table shows the derivation of each proposed provision in this draft. Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to the Government Code. Proposed Provision(s) Existing 210 - Proposed Provision(s) Existing May 2019 - 212 - Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 213 - APPENDIX A. CORRECTED CROSS-REFERENCES In tentatively reorganizing the CPRA, the Commission identified some provisions that appear to contain one or more incomplete or incorrect cross-references. Where the proper cross-reference is obvious, the Commission corrected the cross-reference in its proposed legislation. That approach seems more sensible than tentatively proposing to perpetuate a plainly incorrect cross-reference. Those instances are described in detail below. Section 6252(a), defining \"local agency,\" cross-refers to \"subdivisions (c) and (d) of Section 54952.\"1 It seems improbable, however, that the Legislature intended to require an entity to satisfy the requirements of both subdivisions to qualify as a \"local agency\" under Section 6252(a) for purposes of the CPRA. Proposed Section 7920.510 (continuing the substance of Section 6252(a)) would correct this problem by referring instead to \"subdivision (c) or (d) of Section 54952.\"2 Section 6253.2 cross-refers to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 12302.25. The 2018 maintenance of the codes bill amended Section 6253.2 to cross-refer to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 12302.25 instead of Section 12302.5,3 but that amendment was chaptered out by another bill.4 Proposed Section 7926.300 would incorporate the cross-reference correction that the Legislature approved in the 2018 maintenance of the codes bill. Section 6254(f) contains two cross-references to Penal Code Section 288a. In 2018, Penal Code Section 288a was renumbered as Penal Code Section 287.5 Proposed Sections 7923.615 and 7923.620 would continue the part of Section 6254(f) in question, with revisions to reflect the renumbering of Penal Code Section 288a. Section 6254(y)(5) cross-refers to \"Part 6.4 (commencing with Section 12699.50) of Division 2 of the Insurance Code,\" which has been repealed pursuant to a sunset provision.6 Proposed Section 7926.230 (continuing the substance of Section 6254(y)) would update that cross-reference by referring to \"former Part 6.4 (commencing with Section 12699.50) of Division 2 of the Insurance Code ....\"7 Section 6254.4(c) refers to \"the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 15301 et seq.) ...\" However, the content of the federal 1. Emphasis added. 2. For further discussion of this point, see CLRC Staff Memorandum 2017-49, pp. 6-8. 3. See 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 92, \u00a7 87 (SB 1289 (Committee on Judiciary)). 4. See Section 9605 (bill conflict rules); 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 35, \u00a7 4 (AB 1811 (Committee on Budget)); 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 92, \u00a7 246 (subordination clause in SB 1289 (Committee on Judiciary)). 5. See 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 423, \u00a7 49 (SB 1494 (Committee on Public Safety)). 6. See 2014 Cal. Stat. ch. 31, \u00a7 37 (former Ins. Code \u00a7 12699.64). 7. Emphasis added. Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 214 - Help America Vote Act was transferred to a new title of the federal code in 2012 (52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20901). Proposed Section 7924.000(b) (continuing the substance of 6254.4(c)) would update the cross-reference to reflect the relocation. Section 6254.18(f) says: \"Within 90 days of separation of an employee, contractor, volunteer, board member, or officer of the reproductive health service facility who has provided notice to a public agency pursuant to subdivision (c), the facility shall provide notice of the separation to the relevant agency or agencies.8 The notification requirement is currently located in subdivision (d), not in subdivision (c). Proposed Section 7926.425 would correct that problem by cross-referring to the provision that would continue the substance of subdivision (d) of Section 6254.18 (proposed Section 7926.415), instead of the provision that would continue the substance of subdivision (c). In defining \"public safety official,\" Section 6254.24(b) refers to a \"public officer or other person listed in Sections 1808.2 and 1808.6 of the Vehicle Code.\"9 Given the content of Sections 1808.2 and 1808.6, however, it seems improbable that the Legislature intended to require a person to be listed in both of those provisions to qualify as a \"public safety official\" within the meaning of Section 6254.24. Proposed Section 7920.535(b) (continuing the substance of Section 6254.24(b)) would correct that problem by referring to \"Section 1808.2 or 1808.6 of the Vehicle Code.\"10 Section 6254.24(g) includes as a \"public safety official\" an employee \"who supervises inmates in a city police department, a county sheriff's office, the Department of California Highway Patrol, federal, state, or a local detention facility, and a local juvenile hall, camp, ranch, or home ....\"11 It seems improbable that the Legislature intended this provision to include as a \"public safety official\" only an employee who supervises inmates in one of the enumerated facilities for adults and in one of the enumerated facilities for juveniles. Thus, proposed Section 7920.535(g) (continuing the substance of Section 6254.24(g)) would refer instead to an employee \"who supervises inmates in a city police department, a county sheriff's office, the Department of California Highway Patrol, federal, state, or a local detention facility, or a local juvenile hall, camp, ranch, or home ....12 Section 6254.25 cross-refers to \"subdivision (q) of Section 11126.\" However, Section 11126 no longer has a subdivision (q); the material in question was relocated to subdivision (e) in 1996.13 Proposed Section 8.

Stat. ch. 1041, \u00a7 5. Additionally, the cross-referenced provision (Section 11126) appears to contain an inadvertent drafting error; some paragraph relabeling and related revisions seem necessary. The Commission will include a Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 215 - 7927.205 (continuing the substance of Section 6254.25) would correct the erroneous cross-reference to \"subdivision (q) of Section 11126.\" The second sentence of Section 6268(c) says: \"Records or writings shall not be transferred pursuant to this paragraph unless the institution receiving them agrees to maintain, and does maintain, the materials according to commonly accepted archival standards.\"14 Section 6268(c) is not divided into paragraphs; the entire subdivision consists of a single paragraph, making the quoted reference to \"this paragraph\" (as opposed to \"this subdivision\") slightly confusing. Examination of the legislative history clarifies the situation. The material now labeled as subdivision (c) of Section 6268 used to be in an unlabeled paragraph of that section.15 The quoted reference to \"this paragraph\" was thus meant to refer to the entirety of what is now subdivision (c). Accordingly, proposed Section 7928.010(b)(2) (continuing the quoted sentence) would refer to the material continuing subdivision (c) \u2014 i.e., proposed Section 7928.010(b) or \"this subdivision.\" Sections 6276.01 to 6276.48 comprise an alphabetical list of CPRA exemptions located throughout the codes. Some of the entries in that list are obsolete and require revisions. For discussion of the obsolete entries and revisions made, see the Comments to proposed Sections 7930.100 to 7930.215. technical amendment of Section 11126 with the conforming revisions and repeals for its proposed recodification.

Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 216 - Tentative Recommendation May 2019 - 217 - APPENDIX B. MINOR CLEAN-UP ISSUES FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION In conducting this strictly nonsubstantive study, the Commission tentatively identified some minor problems in the CPRA, which it probably could not address without potentially raising concerns about the possibility of a substantive change. Those issues are listed here. As far as the Commission is aware, this list consists of relatively noncontroversial clean-up issues, not issues involving substantial controversy. If any of the issues listed below appears likely to involve substantial controversy, please notify the Commission. Consider whether to clarify the usage of the term \"local agency\" in Section 6252.7 and its continuation (proposed Section 7921.310).16 Consider whether to simplify the description in the first sentence of Section 6254.5 (proposed Section 7921.505(a)) of which exemptions are waived.17 Consider whether to revise the descriptions in subdivisions (g) and (i) of Section 6254.5 (proposed Section 7921.505(b)(7) & (9)) to make them more readily understandable.18 16.
