Despite this, many patients don't discuss the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) with their health care providers. The reasons for this are varied, including that some patients do not relate CAM use with medical care so would not think to bring it up during a medical visit. Therefore, if patients do not discuss their use of CAM and their physicians do not inquire about it, it can create a gap in the patient's history. To provide fully integrated and optimal care, it's crucial that health care providers obtain a complete and accurate view of their patients' conventional and CAM practices. This then allows the physician to create a safe, integrated treatment plan that is based on all health care approaches. This article provides basic informa - tion on CAM, presents data on the prevalence of CAM use, stresses the importance of communication between providers and patients, and offers some resources to facilitate these discussions. What Is CAM? CAM is defined as a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine. CAM includes products and practices such as herbal supplements, meditation, chiropractic care, and acupuncture. The terms \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" refer more to the manner in which these treatments, practices, and products are used rather than the Figure 1. CAM Use by Age, 2007 Source: Barnes PM, Bloom B, Nahin R. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults and Children: United States, 2007. CDC National Health Statistics from page 1 2 Rx for Prevention LA County Department of Public Health November-December 2011 nature of the treatments themselves. Specifically, the National Institute of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines \"alternative medicine\" as the use of CAM in place of conventional medicine.1 In contrast, \"complementary medicine\" is defined as the use of CAM together with conventional medicine. Who Uses CAM? The 2007 National Health Interview Survey asked individuals throughout the United States about their health behaviors and practices, including CAM use. The types of CAM listed in the survey included acupuncture, ayurveda, biofeedback, chela - tion therapy, chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, deep breathing exercises, diet-based therapies, energy healing therapy/Reiki, guided imagery, homeopathic treatment, hypnosis, massage, meditation, movement therapies, natural products, naturopathy, progressive relaxation, qi gong, tai chi, traditional healers, and yoga. Results from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey include the following One-third of adults reported some CAM use in the past year: 38.3 percent of those surveyed used some form of CAM in the past 12 months.2 At 44%, the highest rates of recent CAM use were reported by people aged 50 to 59 years (Figure 1). One in nine children used CAM in the past year: The same 2007 survey also revealed that CAM use is not limited to adults. The survey compiled data regarding more than 9,000 children from birth to 18 years of age. In the past 12 months, approximately one in nine children (11.8%) reportedly used CAM.3 Parents frequently do not tell their child's health care provider about CAM use. In one study, only one-third of parents discussed their child's current CAM use with their child's pediatrician.4 An overview of those more likely to use CAM based on the 2007 survey is presented in Table 1. In general, women, adults aged 30 to 69 years, those with higher levels of education, those living in the western United States, and those hospital - ized in the past year were more likely to use CAM. Its use was higher among children whose parents also used CAM, youth 12 to 17 years of age, children with multiple health conditions, and those whose families delayed or did not use conventional medical care due to cost. Conditions and Diseases for Which CAM Is Most Frequently Used Among adults, CAM was most frequently used for management of back, neck, and joint pain; arthritis and other musculo- skeletal concerns; as well as anxiety, headache, migraine and insomnia (Table 2).3 In comparison, children used CAM most frequently for back pain and other musculoskeletal conditions, head and chest colds, asthma, sinusitis, other allergies, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/attention deficit disorder, anxiety/stress, and insomnia. Therapies for Which CAM Is Most Frequently Used Natural products, deep breathing, meditation, and chiropractic, osteopathic and massage therapies were the most commonly used CAM among adults in 2007 (Table 2).3 Between 2002 and 2007, there were significant increases in the use of deep breathing exercises, meditation, massage therapy, and yoga. The most common CAM therapies used by children were similar to that of adults. In both children and adults, natural products (excluding vitamins and minerals) were the most commonly used therapies. The most common natural products respondents reported using in the past 30 days are shown in Table 3.3 Fish oil/omega 3, glucosamine, echinacea, flaxseed oil, and ginseng were the top five most common natural products used in the past 30 days by adults; for children, the top five most common natural products used in the past 30 days were echinacea, fish oil/omega 3, combination herb pills, flaxseed oil, and prebiotics/probiotics. Use of Natural Products/Dietary Supplements Natural products (including probiotics, and herbal medicines) were the most frequently cited type of CAM used. A 2007 survey estimated that U.S. consumers spent $14.8 billion on non-vitamin, non-mineral, natural products without evidence of efficacy.5 This is equivalent to approximately one-third of total out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs. Catego - rized as dietary supplements, consumers often believe that these \"natural\" products are safer than pharmaceutical drugs. However, many consumers are unaware that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medication regulations do not apply to dietary supplements. Table 1.

As with adults overall, women were more likely to use CAM than men, and CAM use increased with educational level. The study also revealed that among those with recent CAM use, 42 percent had not discussed their use of CAM with a health care provider.6 The reasons why patients did not discuss their CAM use with a health care provider were varied: 42 percent said the provider never asks about CAM, and 30 percent said that they did not know they should bring it up. Patients discussed CAM most frequently with physicians (28%) or nurses/nurse practitioners (12%). Patients usually initiated CAM discussions (55%) compared to physician-initiated discussions (26%). Physicians most frequently discussed potential drug interactions (44%), gave advice on initiating CAM use (41%), and talked about CAM effectiveness (41%). More than half of adults over 50 surveyed used CAM to improve or maintain their health. Among this group, CAM was used for general wellness, to reduce pain, treat a painful condition, to treat a specific condition, or to supplement con - ventional medicine. Of those reporting CAM use, approximate - ly one-third (37%) used herbal products and dietary supple - ments. Massage therapy, chiropractic manipulation, and other bodywork, were used by approximately one-fifth of respondents (22%). Approximately one in four respondents (26%) cited family and friends as their primary source of information about CAM; the next most frequently cited sources were the Internet (14%) and their personal physicians (13%). CAM Use and Prescription Medications The AARP/NCCAM survey also documented the degree to which CAM is used concurrently with prescription medications.7 Among those surveyed, four out of five (78%) reported taking one or more prescription medications. Younger respondents were less likely to take prescription medications. Twenty-eight percent of those aged 50 to 64 years took no prescription medications, compared with 10 percent of those aged 65 and older. Among those reporting CAM use in the past 12 months, 77 percent of people reported taking one or Table 2.

Almost two-thirds (63%) of those reporting simultaneous CAM and prescription drug use also reported taking two or more prescription medications. Dietary Supplements: Prior Proof of Safety and Efficacy Are Not Required by the FDA The FDA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to conduct clinical trials to establish both a drug's efficacy and safety before it can be marketed. The same scrutiny does not apply to dietary supplements, which are categorized as foods and, therefore, do not require proof of efficacy or safety prior to sale. Supplement manufacturers must only certify that they follow good manufacturing practices, thereby ensuring supple - ments are processed consistently and meet specified quality standards. At best, good manufacturing practices are intended to ensure that products contain the listed ingredients in the listed amounts and do not contain contaminants. The FDA does monitor supplement safety. If the FDA finds a product to be unsafe, it may issue a warning or require that the product be removed from the market. Table 4 lists the physiological impacts of some common dietary supplements, including a few for which FDA warning or bans were issued. During the nearly six-year period from January 1, 2003, through October 31, 2008, the FDA received 3,502 adverse event reports related to dietary supplements, with nearly one-third (31.6%) requiring hospitalization.8 Among these, 471 events were considered life-threatening, and 142 resulted in death. The NCCAM offers a series of fact sheets titled, Herbs at a Glance , that provide basic information about specific herbs or botanicals. This includes common names, uses, potential side effects, and resources for more information ( www.nccam.nih. gov/health/herbsataglance.htm ).Discussing CAM with Patients CAM is used by adults and children to promote health and wellness, often in conjunction with conventional medicine and prescription drugs. However, most patients do not proactively disclose their use of CAM to health care providers. Although patients with chronic and acute medical conditions turn to CAM in large numbers\u2014most frequently to treat pain (including back, neck, or joint pain; arthritis; or other mus - culoskeletal conditions), as well as anxiety, cholesterol, head or chest colds, and other medical conditions9\u2014many do not share their information with their physicians. While physicians may not have sufficient time to fully explore CAM use during a patient visit, it is important to at least ask about CAM use and provide general advice. In addi - tion to the use of prescription and over-the-counter medica - tions, patients should be asked about their use of alternative treatment systems (e.g., acupuncture, homeopathy treatment, naturopathic treatment, traditional healers, manipulation/ body-based treatments, and mind-body treatments) and the use of specific products (e.g., folk medicines, herbal/natural products, diet-based treatments, and megavitamins). Methods to collect this information include the following: Include a question about CAM use on medical history forms. Ask patients to bring a list of all therapies they use, including prescription, over-the-counter, herbal therapies, natural products, folk medicine therapies, and vitamins. Have a nurse, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant initiate the conversation. Patients using CAM should be asked why they are using these complementary and alternative therapies. They should be advised that well-designed clinical trials for many CAM therapies are often lacking; therefore, the safety and effective - ness of many CAM therapies are uncertain. Because many CAM products are not regulated by the FDA, the composition of some CAM products may vary. Patients should be advised that some dietary supplements may interact with medications or other supplements, may have side effects of their own, or may contain potentially harmful ingredients not listed on the label. They should also be informed that most supplements have not been tested in pregnant women, nursing mothers, or children. Physicians don't need to know everything about all CAM treatments. There are several credible resources that offer evidence-based information for clinicians as well as patient education materials. Here are a few: Resources for Providers National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine www.nccam.nih.gov www.nccam.nih.gov/health/providers Tools and Resources The NIH's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine has launched Time to Talk, an educational campaign to encourage patients\u2014particularly those age 50 or older\u2014and their health care providers to openly discuss the use of CAM. The campaign is a part of NCCAM's effort to educate both consumers and health care providers about the importance of discussing CAM and providing evidence-based information to help with health care decision-making. This campaign encourages patients to tell their providers about CAM use and for providers to ask about it by offering tools and resources\u2014 such as wallet cards, posters, and tip sheets\u2014all of which are available for free on the NCCAM website (www.nccam.nih.gov/timetotalk ) or by calling 1-888-644-6226. continued on page 6 >COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE from page 5 6 Rx for Prevention LA County Department of Public Health November-December 2011 CAM on PubMed Journal citations specific to CAM www.nccam.nih.gov/research/camonpubmed Online Continuing Education Series Video lectures available for CME/CEU credits www.nccam.nih.gov/training/videolectures Resources for Patients National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine www.nccam.nih.gov 1-888-644-6226 (Toll-free clearinghouse) MedlinePlus www.medlineplus.gov Discussing Children's Use of CAM When discussing CAM use by children, physicians may share the following points with their patients: Few high-quality studies have examined how CAM thera - pies may affect young people, and results from studies in adults do not necessarily apply to children. Children are not small adults. Their immune and central nervous systems are not fully developed, so they may respond to treatments differently than adults. This is especially true for infants and young children. Herbs and other dietary supplements may interact with medicines or other supplements, or they may cause prob - lems during surgery, such as bleeding-related complica - tions. In addition, \"natural\" does not necessarily mean \"safe.\" CAM therapies can have side effects, and these may be different in children than in adults. Scientific studies provide valuable information about how safe and effective a specific CAM therapy is in children. However, since few, if any, rigorous studies in young people exist, additional scientific studies are needed. Anecdotes and testimonials (personal stories) about CAM therapies are common and can be compelling, but they are not evidence.Conclusion Since many patients do not initiate discussions about their use of CAM with their physicians during a medical visit, physicians should view the visit as a prime opportunity to ask the patient about his or her use of CAM. This proactive approach opens the door to communication and allows the physician to create a safer and more integrated treatment plan for the patient.

Sanchez, PhD, MPH Kim Harrison Eowan, MPH, MCHES Americans suffer from inequalities in access to preven - tive health care and disparities in health outcomes by race/ethnicity,1 and elimination of such disparities is one of the four goals of Healthy People 2020.2 There are many causes of disparities that clinicians can concretely address in their practice. Racial/ethnic disparities have been found for preventive services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), notably3: Screening for cancers Counseling for tobacco cessation Aspirin use for cardiovascular disease Screening for hypertension. In addition, racial and ethnic disparities for childhood and adult immunizations are well-documented. For instance, in 2009 Latinos and African Americans in LA County were less likely to receive a seasonal flu vaccination in comparison to Asians.4 In 2003, whites were more likely than other racial/ ethnic groups to have received a pneumococcal vaccination in their lifetime5 (Figure 1). Underuse of effective preventive services leaves some groups at higher risk for preventable morbidity and premature death. For instance, nationally, African Americans have been found to have the highest age-adjusted death rate due to influenza and pneumonia6 and non-Hispanic black children have been found to have higher seasonal flu-related hospitalization rates than non-Hispanic white children.7 Locally, African Americans in Los Angeles County experience the highest death rates due to breast cancer and coronary heart disease.8 The causes for disparities are varied but, in 2002, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recognized that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that racial/ethnic disparities in health persist largely due to economic and social inequities.9 Those who are unemployed, uninsured and/or residing in impoverished communities are less likely to receive some universally recommended preventive services. In addition, a history of inequities has influenced care-seeking behavior and attitudes toward preventive services.10 Thus, traditional health care decision-making has shifted to include patients as active and collaborative partners in medical decisions and treatment plans. Strategies to promote this partnership are the focus of this article. Addressing Disparities in the Medical Practice Build trust with your patients and confidence in preventive services . Why? Nearly a decade of research shows that a lack of patient trust has an adverse impact on doctor-patient interactions, compliance with physician recommendations, self-reported health status, and health care utilization. How? Use a comforting and caring tone, pose nonjudgmental open-ended questions to learn of concerns, encourage and respond to questions, explain recommendations, address misconceptions, and tell your patients why you personally recommend the preventive service. For instance, when promoting the flu vaccine, consider a conversation opener like \"I've recommended that you get your flu vaccine because the research and my experience have convinced me that it's Figure 1. Proportion of LA County Residents Who Received a Flu Vaccination and a Pneumococcal Vaccination Source: California Health Interview Survey Flu vaccine in the past 12 months, all ages excluding individuals 12-17 years of age, 2009 Pneumococcal vaccine ever, adults 65 years of age, 2003 * Note: Pneumonia vaccination rates were statistically unstable for American Indian/Alaskan Native and the estimate was less than 500 people for the Hawaiian/Pacific Islander category.

I get my vaccine every year and so do my kids. But some of my patients have had questions about this vaccine. What questions or concerns can I address for you?\" Consider recruiting a diverse clinical and support staff that shares the cultural and ethnic background of your patients. Engage family members while being sensitive to confidentiality and HIPAA issues. Why? In some cultures, family members play an impor - tant role in health care decisions. For instance, caregiving has been an explicit role expectation for women in African American families as a means of individual/group survival and remains a valued experience.11,12 Thus, daughters in some African American families play a critical role as informal caregivers and may wish to be involved in their family mem - bers' preventive health decisions. In some families, including Hispanic families, the father or husband may be seen as the decision-maker, and some patients look to elders for advice. How? When appropriate, ask patients who they wish to in - volve in medical decisions, engage these individuals in visits, and provide written materials that patients can bring home to discuss with family members. Use plain language. Why? Health literacy is the capacity to \"obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions and follow instructions for treatment.\"13 Patients with limited health literacy have been found to have less awareness of preventive and self-care mea - sures and to exhibit less healthy behaviors.14-16 Nearly 45% of all high-school graduates have limited health literacy and the majority of adults have difficulty using everyday health infor - mation.14 Therefore, many of your patients may have trouble reading a typical patient educational handout, deciphering an immunization schedule, or identifying a healthy weight range on a BMI chart. How? The following strategies, recommended by the American Medical Association Foundation, may help physicians address health literacy issues in their practice.13 Provide easy-to-understand information to all patients. Some groups may be more likely to have limited health literacy, but even highly educated, articulate, and health- literate individuals can have trouble understanding recommendations, and most will never tell a provider of their challenge. Speak slowly, avoid medical terms, use plain language (Figure 2), limit information, and give the most important points first. Provide educational materials that use short words and sentences, include only essential information, and list recommended actions. Underline key points and use pictures to enhance understanding (Figure 3). A sample low-literacy educational flyer is posted at www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/Handwashing/ StopGerms.pdf . Use nonjudgmental language to confirm patient under - standing and encourage questions. - Ask patients to explain what they've been told (\"teach back\" technique) to confirm understanding. For example, say \"Please explain the steps you'll be taking to complete the TB skin test.\" or \"When your wife asks you about your exercise plan, what will you tell her?\" or \"Please re - cap when you'll need to come back for Bridget's vaccines.\" - Encourage questions with a statement like \"It can be tough to sort through all of the health-related information. Please feel comfortable asking questions and letting me know if there is anything that you don't understand.\" See the Resources box for downloadable educational materials and health literacy resources. Provide culturally sensitive care. Why? Physician cultural competence and the ability to engage in relationship-based care that promotes communication, partnership, respect, and trust have been linked with greater satisfaction with care, treatment adherence, and use of preventive health services.18-20 How? Providing culturally sensitive care requires actions at many levels. Consider completing an assessment like the Cultural and Linguistic Competence Policy Assessment (www.clcpa.info ) to help identify areas to focus on in the practice. Think about whether you and your staff Address misconceptions in a nonjudgmental way. Speak the predominant languages and reflect the cultural background of your patients. Use competent interpreters, as recommended, rather than relying on patients' family members. Use materials that are translated and culturally tailored. Understand cultural standards for greetings, eye contact, gestures, interruptions, and turn-taking.Figure 2 . Examples of Plain Language Medical Terms17 Say \"hand washing\" instead of \"hand hygiene.\" Say \"length of time a disease is in someone's body before they feel or look sick\" instead of \"incubation period.\" Say \"a tool used to measure how fast you can blow out air\" instead of \"peak flow meter.\" Say \"more open to, in danger of getting, likely to get\" instead of \"susceptible.\" continued on page 10 >ADDRESSING RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES from page 8 9 November-December 2011 LA County Department of Public Health Rx for Prevention Design Is it easy to read, with at least one-inch margins?

Culture may influence beliefs about disease causation, heredity, holistic practices, home remedies, stigma, illness, healing, and control of health- related decisions. Conclusion By working to build trust, using plain language, and providing culturally sensitive care, physicians and their care teams can address disparities. While these strategies will not resolve the underlying causes of disparities, they are expected to improve care and the uptake of preventive health services in culturally diverse communities.
