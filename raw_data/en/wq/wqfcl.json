The response activities from Oregon's state and local agencies started in April of 2009, consisted of two distinct waves of the outbreak, with planning efforts occurring during the summer months of 2009 and after the fall wave until the present day. The H1N1 pandemic resulted in an unprecedented level of statewide response activities, with state incident management team (IMT) activation that lasted 174 days, and state agency operation center (AOC) activation of 72 days. Local and state public health agencies, senior leadership and members of the public planned and implemented a Governor's Pandemic Influenza Summit, which was attended by 700 people and streamed live to a larger audience to stimulate urgency for preparedness messages and continuity of operations planning across all sectors of the State of Oregon. There was on-going health worker protection, medical surge, and community mitigation planning throughout the response. While it is understood that emergency response activities were supported from April 2009 through December 2009, federal, state and local efforts continue with H1N1 surveillance, plan review and revision, education and training. This report will focus on the statewide efforts of the second wave of H1N1 that occurred over the past 10 months, from September 2009 through June 2010. The purpose of this document is to acknowledge the State of Oregon's efforts to improve public health preparedness and response capabilities for pandemic influenza events, identify key successes, areas for improvement and recommendations for the ongoing improvement planning process. This AAR presents and analyzes issues and results, identifies strengths to be maintained and built upon, and distinguishes potential areas for further consideration or improvement. The suggested actions in this AAR should be viewed as recommendations only. In some cases, Oregon's State, local, tribal, and private agencies and organizations that were involved in the response may determine that the benefits of implementation are insufficient to outweigh the costs. In other cases, these groups may identify alternate solutions that may be more effective or efficient. Senior management should review the applicable recommendations and determine the most appropriate course of action given the available resources (e.g., time, staff, funding) for implementation. In general, this AAR has focused on the response to a pandemic influenza incident and, more specifically, on command, control and coordination; public health decision making; communication internally and with partners; public information; epidemiological investigation; medical countermeasures, and management and distribution. The major strengths identified during this response are as follows: Governor's Pandemic Influenza Summit was planned and executed in 28 days Multiple communication methods were accessed and fou nd to be helpful to the healthcare providers Surveillance information and epidemiological support by the State was helpful to local jurisdictions After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response EXECUTIVE SUMMARY viii OREGON Lessons learned from the first wave in the spring we re implemented in the OSPHL plans for a more effective system Majority of Agency Operations Center (AOC) and joint information center (JIC) staff had Incident Command System (ICS) training prior to assuming their position during this emergency Communities reported that past planning, training, a nd exercising created successful response efforts at the local level State Immunization/Vaccine Distribution group was ve ry responsive and supportive to meeting local needs Office of Public Health Division (OPHD) worked with Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to establish guidelines regarding the use of masks for healthcare workers Weekly flu update press releases ( F lu Bites ) and flu.oregon.gov public website were helpful to healthcare providers and the general public Indian Health Services (IHS) had success with commun ity information and warning Respondents reported several successes in disseminat ing public information to their stakeholders\u2014local phone banks, newspapers, and radio and television stations were the biggest avenues to disperse information The posting of guidance on the flu.oregon.gov websit e was a single location that any person or organization could refer to for the most current information and guidance Throughout the response, there were several opportunities identified for improvement in Oregon's ability to respond to a pandemic influenza incident. The primary areas for improvement are: The development and approval process for new policies and guidance in the AOC was delayed. There was inconsistent transparency of revisions to State policies and guidance revisions in anticipation of the fall wave of H1N1 There is confusion on emergency management's role in a public health emergency There were gaps in local and State-level dissemination of information to the public. Changes to the prioritization guidelines for receiving vaccine were frustrating to local jurisdictions. State guidelines were difficult to adjust for the difference in needs between rural counties and the more populated counties HOSCAP was not updated consistently by all hospitals. Health Alert Network (HAN) system had varying degrees of success There was a lack of communication and coordination between the Oregon Department of Human Services' (DHS) Public Health Division (OPHD) and the Seniors and People with Disabilities (SPD). Conference calls were not always well structured and/or accurately informative. Local health departments have not fully integrated State Alert Technologies OPS Center, causing limited effectiveness for support of the statewide response. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ix OREGON Changes to surveillance data collection criteria made consistent information gathering challenging State AOC incident management teams (IMTs) have inconsistent membership. There is confusion on AOC staffing assignments, roles and responsibilities. OPS Center website is not a secured website, which limits its use for public health operation centers. The State JIC faced challenges in organizational structure and leadership. There was limited non-English material available for public information and warning. State level public service announcements (PSAs) were delayed. State guidance for altered standards of care for healthcare facilities needs development. There is confusion at the local level on how to declare a local public health emergency. Mass vaccinator contracts did not work well for most local communities. There was no mechanism to redistribute supplies between counties after they were received from the State or the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). The 100-dose minimum allotment request for vaccine did not meet the needs of some jurisdictions. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 1 - OVERVIEW OF EVENT 1 OREGON CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF THE EVENT The Oregon 2009 Fall H1N1 response was a real-time response to the worldwide outbreak of H1N1. Oregon utilized the current State and local pandemic influenza response plans and capabilities. The overarching purpose of this event was to respond to and mitigate the spread of the H1N1 (Swine Flu) Influenza Virus. Oregon activated the full capabilities of the public health response forces to address the event. Oregon's effort focused on four areas. First and foremost, the effort focused on providing treatment and prophylaxis to individuals exposed to the H1N1 virus. To support this, significant energy was expended to deploy and manage both medical supplies and assets as appropriate. From an epidemiologic perspective, Oregon concentrated on providing accurate information to guide State and local response activities, inform preparedness partners and the general public, and to assist the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) efforts to monitor the spread of the H1N1 virus. And finally, Oregon focused on providing accurate and timely information and guidance to all preparedness partners and the general public. RESPONDING ORGANIZATIONS The Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 response occurred statewide and involved representatives from the following State, Federal, and local entities: State Agencies Office of the Governor Oregon Department of Administrative Services (DAS) Oregon Department of Corrections Oregon Department of Education Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS) o Communications o Mental Health and Addictions o Office of Contracts and Procurement o Oregon Public Health Division (OPHD) o Seniors and People with Disabilities (SPD) o State Board of Pharmacy o State Hospital Oregon Department of Transportation Oregon Disaster Medical Assistant Team (ODMAT) Oregon Higher Education Oregon Military Department (OMD) o Office of Emergency Management (OEM) o Oregon National Guard (ONG) Oregon Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OR-OSHA) Oregon State Police (OSP) Oregon State Public Health Laboratory (OSPHL) Federal Agencies FEMA Region X Health and Human Services (HHS) o Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Emergency Response (ASPER) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 1 - OVERVIEW OF EVENT 2 OREGON o Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Local Responder Organizations 34 local health departments Community based organizations serving vulnerable populations Schools Volunteer organizations Native American Tribes The Confederated Tribes of Siletz The Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians The Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs The Coquille Indian Tribe The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Indians Private Organizations and Associations 62 Oregon hospitals and healthcare systems Individual and group healthcare providers Oregon Association of Hospitals and Healthcare Associations Pharmaceutical distribution companies Pharmacies and pharmacy chains Print and electronic media Private vaccination providers After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 3 OREGON CHAPTER 2: ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE This section of the report reviews the performance of the activities and tasks. Observations are organized by capability and associated activities taken from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (U.S. DHS) Target Capability List (TCL). The TCL comprises 37 capabilities which address response capabilities, immediate recovery, selected prevention and protection mission capabilities, as well as common capabilities such as planning and communications that support all missions. Activities serve as a guide for identifying and prioritizing investments when working to establish a capability. The capabilities linked to the Oregon September-December 2009 H1N1 Response are listed followed by corresponding activities. Each capability activity is followed by related observations, analyses, and recommendations. The analyses of capabilities that follow reflect the individual views of respondents. The information gathered from the Survey Monkey could not be organized regionally. The analyses are subjective and the recommendations are opinions that may or may not meet with the State's or local community's strategies and priorities. CAPABILITY: PLANNING Capability Summary : Planning is the mechanism through which Federal, State, local and tribal government, non-governmental organizations (NGO), and the private sector develop, validate, and maintain plans, policies, and procedures describing how they will prioritize, coordinate, manage, and support personnel, information, equipment, and resources to prevent, protect and mitigate against, respond to, and recover from events. The focus of the planning capability is on successful achievement of a plan's concept of operations using target capabilities and not on the ability to plan as an end in itself. Activity 1: Develop/Revise Operational Plans Observation 1.1 (Area for Improvement): Although statewide planning efforts continued between spring and fall waves of H1N1, there were still areas that needed improvement. Analysis: There was a definite break in H1N1 activity across the nation, including Oregon, in the summer months of 2009 and most State and local operation centers scaled back to either a skeleton staff or closed down entirely. This was generally referred to as the end of phase one in a pandemic activity. According to Annex F of the State of Oregon's Emergency Management Plan (Pandemic Influenza Plan) \"All agencies and healthcare providers must make use of the interim period between pandemic waves to assess successes and shortcomings to prepare for a resurgence of disease\". Statewide planning activities included preparation for the Governor's Summit in the fall, meetings with stakeholders to discuss Community Mitigation efforts, fall planning assumption document dissemination and revising the roles and responsibilities for personnel supporting joint information center (JIC) activation. The State sent planning guidance documents and continued with weekly conference calls for local jurisdictions during the summer, but a number of the counties' did not participate during After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 4 OREGON this break between waves, or that their perception was that this was not enough assistance for them. It is recognized that the state hotlines and websites were useful tools for healthcare professionals and the public during the Fall H1N1 response. However, a few counties stated more pro-active website planning would have allowed material to be reviewed and revised during the summer, in a less stressful time period\u2014ready to be posted to the web when it was timely. Public information and frequently asked questions were delayed in getting out to local jurisdictions. During the summer months, there was a significant plan revision for JIC operations, with new position checklists, role clarifications and training of personnel. This allowed a more coordinated public information and warning response to support the anticipated second wave of H1N1. There were many general and specific fact sheets that had been developed addressing pandemic flu topics, transmission, prevention, antivirals, etc. These documents were used as stepping stones for new document production. Prior to the second wave the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not set guidance that would address H1N1 vaccinations for healthcare workers. Oregon followed CDC guidelines, and were also waiting for this guidance. Using the CDC guidance, available during the fall response, the State recommended supporting healthcare workers receiving vaccination and recommended that these sign a waver if they decline the vaccine. During the summer a few counties did not receive or were not aware of the May 2009 Interim Community Mitigation Measures that addressed school dismissal criteria or guidelines. Impacts on a few school districts was significant (40% or more absenteeism) and these schools were closed on case by case basis. This is a local issue, with decisions made and supported on a local level. Recommendation: 1. Plans, procedures, and protocols for pandemic influenza should be reviewed / revised / written to ensure more timely response capabilities for future pandemics Observation 1.2 (Strength): Communities reported that past planning, training, and exercising created successful response efforts at the local level. Analysis: Phone interviews and survey respondents reported an overall high level of confidence with their local public health and local senior leadership. They attribute this to robust planning, training, and exercises that have occurred with all partners/stakeholders prior to H1N1 vaccine. Those that were able to plan, train, and exercise with their partners felt they had a very good working relationship with each other and were able to communicate successfully with each other and with their community. In those areas vaccination clinics were viewed as successful and were well attended. Recommendation: None After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 5 OREGON Observation 1.3 (Area of Improvement): Changes to the prioritization guidelines for receiving vaccine were frustrating to local healthcare providers. Analysis: The CDC set the guidelines for priority groups to receive vaccination and the State of Oregon followed these. Respondents on the survey stated that they were confused and frustrated with the sub-prioritizing of the priority groups when the CDC changed guidelines. Also, most pre-planning efforts encompassed a larger priority group to receive vaccinations. Most first responders have been told they would receive vaccine as a priority group, but most were not on the list for distribution for the H1N1. Transporters of the vaccine perceived they were at risk for contracting the virus, since they were not vaccinated. Many expressed anger over this. Healthcare professionals did not feel they received adequate information about reasons for not vaccinating them when prior plans all called for it. School teachers stated that they are in a high risk group due to their daily contact with large numbers of children, but were not in the first group. Private practice physicians reported that there appeared to be no special prioritization for pediatrics with HIV/AIDS or other underlying health conditions. Child care facility owners felt that their facilities with high infection potential (similar to schools) were not fully recognized. Many respondents felt that decision making was way too slow from the State over opening up priority groups sooner. State Public Health (PH) decision making to open up vaccinations to all people was later than it should have been. By the time the decision was made to relax the strict priority groups the peak of illness was waning and the community members were not interested in receiving the vaccine. Many counties had leftover vaccine at the end of December 2009. Recommendations: 1. Develop an information campaign that has templates for various levels of vaccine supply 2. Establish a timeline for decision making regarding priority groups to ensure more timely guidance 3. Develop process for vaccine prioritization which can be customized for different jurisdictions Observation 1.4 (Area of Improvement): State guidelines were not flexible to adjust for the difference in needs between rural counties and the more populated counties. Analysis: The rural counties have needs and challenges not faced in the metropolitan regions of the State. Staffing is limited\u2014one employee may be responsible for a wide range of tasks each of which is the full-time job for someone in a more densely populated area. There did not seem to be any flexibility in some of the guidelines for these counties. When a response continues for several weeks the State could be more proactive in helping the overwhelmed rural areas successfully care for the population, complete reports, gather information, etc. Each county has a State Local Health Department (LHD) Liaison, and due to past planning, training, and exercises, has clear understanding of issues involving their region. These State liaisons were all assigned to the State Agency Operations Center (AOC) and not readily accessible to their regional community partners. The southern counties stated their LHDs felt that the State LHD Liaisons could have mitigated many of the issues occurring in the beginning of the response. The After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 6 OREGON southern counties were hit first with H1N1 and felt that State PH did not believe they were experiencing an outbreak. When the hospitals asked for State consideration of altered standards of care or declaration of a public health emergency they were told that they were overreacting. It was felt that the State LHD Liaison could have been sent to the southern region to better facilitate a situational awareness to the State. Recommendations: 1. Establish State guidelines that can be flexible for the rural counties 2. Identify ways in which State PH can assist rural areas during an extended response 3. Review AOC staffing to allow State LHD Liaisons to be assigned to their respective areas during a crisis Observation 1.5 (Area of Improvement): The process for development and approval of new policies and guidance in the AOC was delayed. Analysis: During the Oregon H1N1 first wave response some of the State policy and guidance was created by specific branches without review by the AOC Planning Section. This did not allow for policy coordination with all agencies involved. During the second wave, although the process had been significantly improved, there were still significant delays in dissemination of guidance. The coordination of policy, guidance and review with all stakeholders took several days to occur. This delay in the approval process also delayed dissemination of guidance to local jurisdictions, posting to the flu.oregon.gov, Health Alert Network (HAN) and OPS Center. Recommendations: 1. Review/revise the policy for development and approval of new policies and guidance to ensure delegation of authority for policy approval to an on site leader at all times to minimize delays in approval 2. Train staff on new/revised policies 3. Conduct an exercise Activity 2: Validate Plans Observation 2.1 (Area of Improvement): There was inconsistent transparency of State plan revisions in anticipation of the fall wave of H1N1. Analysis: Over the summer of 2009 state and county agencies, local communities, and the AOC/JIC conducted hot washes, debriefings, reviewed their pandemic flu plans, and made plan revisions. There did not appear to be a push out of statewide plan revision or mitigation strategies directly to local agencies. The AOC/JIC revisions were posted on either to HAN or OPS Center, and LHD who were used to navigating these tools felt that there was good effort at planning for the next wave. Those LHD that did not search for the documents or guidance has less satisfaction with their perception of statewide planning efforts. They contacted different agencies for advice on what to do, and usually got conflicting instruction depending on with whom they talked. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 7 OREGON Recommendations: 1. Establish process to communicate and transmit state planning process and products to response partners 2. On-going training of State and local partners on use of HAN, OPS Center CAPABILITY: COMMUNICATIONS Capability Summary : Communications is the fundamental capability within disciplines and jurisdictions that practitioners need to perform the most routine and basic elements of their job functions. Agencies must be operable, meaning they possess sufficient wireless communications capabilities to meet their daily internal and emergency communication requirements, before they focus on interoperability. Communications interoperability is the ability of public safety agencies (e.g., police, fire, emergency medical services [EMS]) and service agencies (e.g., public works, transportation, hospitals) to talk within and across agencies and jurisdictions using various authorized communications systems to exchange voice, data, and/or video with one another on demand or in real time. It is essential that public safety has the intra-agency operability it needs, and that it builds its systems toward interoperability. Activity 1: Develop and Maintain Plans, Procedures, Programs, and Systems Observation 1.1 (Strength and Area for Improvement): Hospital Capacity (HOSCAP) is not initially designed to accurately provide a real time hospital status and was revised to gather additional information. Analysis: Of the online survey respondents, several indicated that they used HOSCAP to monitor hospital situation status, the use of critical resources (ventilators), and/or available beds (adult and pediatric). A comment was provided indicating that some of the questions do not allow respondents to provide a clear picture of the hospital's situation. There should be an area for each hospital to give an account of how many beds, ventilators, etc., are at the facility, then the number in use, and how many are staffed and available. One example was: \"For my facility, we do not carry the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). When we answered 'no' on the question consistently, this was interpreted as \"no critical patients.\" Hot wash attendees commented that HOSCAP does not have enough detail to provide an accurate picture of the current status at any given facility or for an area. For example, some hospitals had to cancel surgeries due to the lack of surgical masks but this information is not captured on the HOSCAP website. This information is critical for other hospitals to know and should be reportable on HOSCAP. Supplemental data was gathered through other communications methods to keep everyone informed. During the second wave response it was recognized that additional information from the hospitals would be helpful. HOSCAP modifications were made, communication to the hospitals After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 8 OREGON was made, and the revision was implemented. This additional information was helpful during the response. It was recommended that any future planning for this website should have representation from hospitals. Recommendations: 1. State should seek input from hospitals regarding information currently gathered in HOSCAP that could lead to incorrect decisions 2. Revise HOSCAP to improve information accuracy 3. Conduct an exercise to determine if revisions more accurately provide information desired Observation 1.2 (Area for Improvement): HOSCAP was not updated consistently by all hospitals. Analysis : It was noted in several regional hot washes that some hospitals did not provide updated information on a daily basis because of limited staffing and a lack of understanding how HOSCAP was used. The supplemental Federal questions created confusion because there was no definition of what was being asked; therefore answers were not reliable and caused an inaccurate picture to be reported. Individuals doing the input may need more training to ensure that appropriate information is being posted. Incomplete or inaccurate information can impact decisions made by others. The usefulness of HOSCAP is questionable because not every hospital in the State accessed and updated the website. Recommendations: 1. Evaluate how HOSCAP was used during the response to determine cause for gaps in its use 2. Review/revise protocols 3. Provide training on use and important of HOSCAP as a daily use tool 4. Conduct an exercise Observation 1.3 (Area for Improvement): Health Alert Network (HAN) system had varying degrees of success. Analysis: Oregon's HAN system is a primary source of information yet there were some local health departments and response agencies that do not regularly use it. Some had difficulty navigating through the HAN system and would use other resources (such as flu.oregon.gov and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] website) for their information. Most State and local personnel have been trained in the use of HAN during emergencies. Yet, there was still confusion on where to find the latest information. For example, during H1N1 some items were posted on flu.oregon.gov but not duplicated on HAN. This created confusion for local agency staff as they were never sure where something would be posted and this contradicted procedures the staff had been trained to use. Searching for documents was often frustrating and some times the information was never located. Information became buried in various folders. Review and revisions were not disseminated to local end-users until the second wave. For After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 9 OREGON example, naming conventions were changed; conference call posting information had to be clarified; correct posting protocols were not available and/or not followed (e.g., obtaining incident manager's approval prior to posting); and the capability to add a planning calendar did not exist. Other problems mentioned were that some HAN messages were sent out before the State website was changed causing confusion to those that were cross-referencing sources and/or linking the State website to a county website. This lack of coordinated messaging caused some individuals to be uncertain what was current and what was out-of-date. Some survey respondents want all information to be channeled into one source for one-stop information gathering. Much of the information was repeated multiple times and often placed in different locations in HAN. Conference call participants commented that when told material was posted on HAN it occasionally had not yet been posted. There was also a delay in the State posting county situation status (Sit Stat) reports. Some believe that the counties should be allowed to post their own Sit Stats on HAN. Tribal representatives felt the system worked well for them; it was easy to sign up new users; they were able to obtain information on HAN when they could not reach their partners by phone. Most emergency management organizations that received prior training felt that HAN worked well for them. There were some issues with permissions at the city level and would have liked to have access to incident action plans which could have been posted to HAN. Recommendations: 1. Review/revise all phases of the communications plan to ensure accurate information is provided to healthcare providers and the public 2. Review/revise the protocols for posting to HAN 3. Provide staff just in time training for HAN to rural communities Activity 2: Develop and Maintain Training and Exerci se Programs Observation 2.1 (Area for Improvement): There was a lack of communication and coordination between State Public Health Division's Incident Management Team (IMT) and Department of Human Services (DHS) / Seniors and People with Disabilities (SPD). Analysis: DHS/SPD felt that they were left out of the planning loop for vaccine distribution. For example, seniors have always been told to get their seasonal flu shots because they are usually the ones at highest risk, but with the 2009 H1N1 outbreak seniors were not considered a priority group. DHS usually is very good at communicating to this group but they were left out of the planning loop and communication to this target group was poor. Local public health or emergency management does not seem to have a good understanding of DHS/SPD roles and responsibilities. There are targeted groups that are served by DHS/SPD in group homes with ventilator dependant children and/or adults. These high risk groups were not taken into consideration for vaccine distribution. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 10 OREGON Recommendations: 1. Include DHS/SPD in planning efforts 2. Include DHS/SPD in State and local preparedness training and exercises Activity 3: Alert and Dispatch Observation 3.1 (Area of Improvement): Conference calls were not always well structured and/or accurately informative. Analysis: Many respondents feel the State Public Health (PH) Preparedness conference calls and Immunization conference calls could have been combined. Many participants reported in the various hot washes, Survey Monkey, and phone interviews that the Immunization conference calls were well organized, followed an agenda, and were informative, consistent, efficient, and better structured than the PH preparedness conference calls The less populated areas had limited dedicated staff to conduct their own response operations and found that having to attend both calls took them away from their important work. There was redundant information if participants needed to listen to both calls. The larger organizations were able to staff different personnel to each call, but noted some of the information received from one call conflicted with information received from the other. Many felt that the conference calls could have been combined with a strictly followed agenda. Even though an agenda was sent out prior to each conference call, there was frequent scope creep from the purpose of the Preparedness conference calls. The calls did not consistently provide information about new media releases which resulted in local health department (LHD) staff being unprepared for the local media. If separate calls are necessary, the two programs should crosswalk their information to prevent conflicting information. Some hot wash attendees indicated they felt that participation in all conference calls was imperative\u2014they might miss something important to them\u2014but would like an agenda for the call. Some felt a daily briefing on HAN would have been sufficient. Some felt that use of a webcast rather than a teleconference format at least part of the time would allow for the use of visuals (incident action plan [IAP] objectives, epidemiological graphs, etc.) that could facilitate better understanding of details being presented. It was also suggested that posting notes or minutes shortly after the calls to HAN would be helpful, especially if someone had to miss all or part of a call. Many felt there was too much individual problem solving during the conference calls. These topics should be noted and followed up with a phone call after the conference call conclusion. Recommendations: 1. Consider combining Preparedness and Immunization into one conference call 2. Review/revise conference call protocols to ensure assigning a good facilitator, developing agenda for each call, establishment of criteria for who should attend each conference After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 11 OREGON calls, better coordination of information among various regular and special conference calls, providing follow-up report or Sit Stat of conference call minutes on HAN 3. Provide timely notes of all conference calls to all stakeholders. 4. State may consider asking the LHDs and local jurisdictions to send in their questions via email at the end of each day 5. Consider the use of webcast for at least some of the conference calls Activity 4: Provide Emergency Operations Center Comm unications Support Observation 4.1 (Strength): Multiple communication methods were accessed and found to be helpful to the healthcare providers. Analysis: Multiple methods of information delivery provided individuals with options\u2014 teleconferences, in-person conferences, e-mail, websites, HAN, and other information portals\u2014 and made it easy to access any needed information. The information and processes seemed more organized during the second wave than the first. The Survey Monkey asked respondents to indicate which methods of communication they found were most valuable (they could select all that apply): HAN Alerts (77.2%), Immunization Program conference calls (39.2%), Public Health Preparedness conference calls (48.1%). One hundred three survey respondents indicated that, for their primary resource for official guidance information, they used the CDC website (30/1%), flu.oregon.gov website (35.0%), HAN (28.2%), and their local government website (6.8%). The almost instant creation of the H1N1 website with documents was appreciated. The Q&A concerning vaccine was helpful, especially since it was updated frequently. The efforts to have the hotlines were appreciated as they alleviated some of the burden for the local healthcare responders. Because questions posed by the public were logged public information personnel could consider improving or adding to information provided to the media. The conference calls were helpful to the widespread group and consolidating the \"regular\" conference calls and the immunization conference calls was appreciated and saved everyone valuable time. The conference calls allowed everyone an opportunity to participate in decision- making. HAN alerts were timely, informative, well-written, concise, and useful. Almost 72% of the 76 individuals answering the survey question stated that the HAN alert messages were good, very good, or excellent. Although more needs to be done, the attempts to provide outreach to non-English speakers was helpful. Recommendation None Observation 4.2 (Area for Improvement): Local health departments have not fully integrated State Alert Technologies OPS Center, causing limited effectiveness for support of the After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 12 OREGON statewide response. Analysis: Many of the local emergency management agencies expected the State Office of Emergency Management (OEM) to activate and make it easier to communicate with local emergency operation centers (EOCs). OEM offered to support these counties in sending staff to assist them in training/support of OPS Center, but few, if any accepted this help. The Agency Operations Center (AOC) and joint information center (JIC) had on-site support from OPS Center staff, which was very effective. While several counties successfully navigate the use of OPS Center, there are some counties who do not. This causes a lack of transparency in statewide resource requests, distribution timelines, etc. There are one or two counties that use WebEOC, but the two systems do not communicate with each other. There is a plan for the State to roll out more sites to include more counties and to create a patch for communication between OPS Center and WebEOC. Some tribes have and use OPS Center as does the University of Oregon. Not all LHDs participate in planning and training with their county emergency management. Those who have limited prior training with community partners experienced greater frustration in all aspects of this response. Those who consistently trained and exercised with their partners had more positive response activities. Agencies that do have OPS Center indicated that it is a good system that provides good documentation and paper trail. Local emergency managers, who have not been involved with their LHD in past training and exercising, felt that State PH was not aggressive with pushing Sit Stats out to local agencies and, although these were posted on the HAN, not everyone involved with response had access to HAN and some response organizations did not know HAN existed. Those emergency managers who routinely train and exercise with their LHD had good situational awareness of their communities health needs. For local emergency managers, most received and reviewed the Sit Stats that were posted routinely on OPS Center. The frequency of Sit Stat posting depended on the changing environment of the H1N1 surveillance and epidemiological data. These postings initially occurred weekly, then changed to daily, then twice a day, then back to weekly. There are continued Sit Stats posted through June of 2010. Recommendations: 1. Provide on-going training on use of OPS Center 2. Conduct an exercise using OPS Center 3. Hire a full-time OPS Center administrator 4. Stand up State ECC when OPS Center is needed to support local operations 5. Create and implement an interface between OPS Center and WebEOC 6. Work with local jurisdictions to establish use of either OPS Center or WebEOC CAPABILITY: EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE AND INVESTIGATION After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 13 OREGON Capability Summary: The Epidemiological Surveillance and Investigation capability is the capacity to rapidly conduct epidemiological investigations. It includes exposure and disease (both deliberate release and naturally occurring) detection, rapid implementation of active surveillance, maintenance of ongoing surveillance activities, epidemiological investigation, analysis, and communication with the public and providers about case definitions, disease risk and mitigation, and recommendation for the implementation of control measures. Activity 1: Direct Epidemiological Surveillance and Investigation Operations Observation 1.1 (Strength): 911 call centers have the ability to assist in surveillance by tracking influenza-like illness (ILI) calls. Analysis: At least one 911 call center maintained a log of ILI and flu calls which assisted the county in determining how many people were ill with some type of flu or flu-like illness. Recommendation: None Observation 1.2 (Area for Improvement): Changes to surveillance data collection criteria made consistent information gathering challenging. Analysis: It was difficult for local health departments (LHDs) to be consistent in collecting data with the changes in guidance. The smaller-population based LHDs were unable to collect all of the necessary data due to limited staffing and lack of training on the forms. Some LHDs were uncertain how data were being collected at the colleges\u2014was it separate or combined with other local information. Epidemiological data was not consistently available on State websites, Health Alert Network (HAN) or situation status (Sit Stats). LHDs and local health officers need accurate epidemiological information with which to make healthcare decisions for their communities. Recommendations: 1. Establish clear guidelines for data collection to local jurisdictions 2. Review/revise procedures regarding the flow of epidemiological information 3. Determine where epidemiological data is recorded, stored, and disseminated Activity 2: Surveillance and Detection Observation 2.1 (Area for Improvement): There was confusion between published H1N1 surveillance and epidemiology data and real time disease rate. Analysis: State Epidemiology did a good job with defining cases and working with the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory (OSPHL) about changes in the criteria for who needed to be tested to meet epidemiology needs. They did not communicate well to partners or the public that this was the purpose of the testing versus diagnosis. Local media tended to look at this data as After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 14 OREGON real time information, and sent conflicting information to the public. This caused many to feel the epidemiology data published for their area did not accurately represent the rate of disease. The counties in southwestern Oregon felt that the rapid rise and peak of H1N1 was not recognized in a timely manner to assist in response efforts in those communities. In one county absenteeism had significantly increased, but H1N1 numbers were very low because clients were not being tested making the incidence level distorted. Some respondents felt that school absenteeism could indicate the rate of illness while hospital data indicate the severity in an area. There was a perceived gap in the case numbers because data was gathered for only individuals admitted to the hospital. If someone was ill but did not seek medical care they were not included in the statistics. It was difficult to assess the prevalence and its relationship to other influenza- like illnesses that were circulating. This caused a great deal of frustration both for the local public health staff but also the public\u2014they could see higher absenteeism and illness than was shown by the case count. Although the State was aware that the numbers did not accurately reflect what was going on, there was not adequate public messaging explaining this discrepancy. Recommendations: 1. Review/revise protocols for case numbers 2. Review/revise public messaging protocols to more accurately report case numbers with an explanation of what it means 3. Consider posting more current preliminary cases instead of only the confirmed cases of H1N1 4. Create statewide school absenteeism database for more accurate rates of illness Observation 2.2 (Strength): Surveillance information and epidemiological support by the State was helpful to many jurisdictions. Analysis: At least one county received direct assistance with epidemiological surveillance and investigation from the State Epi team as there was insufficient local staff to collect the data. Early case identification and the management of OSPHL specimens assisted local health departments prioritize response activities in their counties. Published information was helpful to county-level staff and healthcare providers. Statewide statistics allowed counties to see the impact of H1N1 in the State. Flu Bites was an excellent resource for some counties and much appreciated by stakeholders. It was well formatted, informative, and well analyzed. Hospital reporting was helpful to the counties. The ability of eSentinel to provide information so a local health department could ascertain that the county had residents hospitalized in another county helped to provide timely, accurate data on H1N1 in the county. Reporting from hospitals participating in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) hospitalized flu surveillance in the tri- county area for several years went well and gave a better overview for Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington counties. Recommendation: None After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 15 OREGON Activity 3: Monitor Containment Observation 3.1 (Area for Improvement): There is a need for comparison of surveillance data of colleges/schools in each county. Analysis: School absenteeism rates were not easily accessible to LHDs, nor did they give accurate information of why students were absent (either actual illness or parents wanting to keep students out during high illness rates). There were schools and LHDs that were interested in the statistics collected for colleges/schools in their county. Some wondered how that compared with what was happening in their region and around the State; were there any trends that should be recorded and evaluated. There may have been a more timely or accurate way to determine if schools should be closed or kept open. One college health service received vaccine quite late in the response. Student health clinics were concerned because of the vulnerable age of that population and the close living quarters and health habits of the colleges' population created a situation that put them at high risk. The healthcare providers could not get vaccine for Student Health Service staff from the county during a time when they were seeing multiple H1N1 flu cases a day in clinic. This caused anxiety among the health providers that could have been prevented. Recommendations: 1. Identify or adopt systems within the Oregon school districts to accurately track reasons for absenteeism 2. Conduct an analysis of schools, including colleges, rate of illness CAPABILITY: LABORATORY TESTING Capability Summary: The Laboratory Testing capability is the ongoing surveillance, rapid detection, confirmatory testing, data reporting, investigative support, and laboratory networking to address potential exposure, or exposure, to all-hazards which include chemical, radiological, and biological agents in all matrices including clinical specimens, food and environmental samples, (e.g., water, air, soil). Such all-hazard threats include those deliberately released with criminal intent, as well as those that may be present as a result of unintentional or natural occurrences. Activity 1: Develop and Maintain Plans, Procedures, Programs, and Systems Observation 1.1 (Area for Improvement): While protocols for specimen collection were not always clear to providers, Oregon State Public Health Laboratory (OSPHL) staff was helpful in educating and training local jurisdictions on procedures for test samples. Analysis: Private providers stated that they were told to send specimens to OSPHL but did not receive adequate guidelines or instructions on how to obtain and send these specimens. Because After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 16 OREGON of this guidance gap some of the specimens were not accepted and tests needed to be retaken. Initially, there was insufficient numbers of lab testing kits that hospitals had on hand. There was also confusion about who was to be tested. Occasionally hospitals contracted with private labs to do H1N1 testing because patients did not meet the State criteria. Many wondered why the lab could not have opened up testing to a larger target group. More accurate epidemiological surveillance and investigation data may have been available using a wider target base for conducting tests. Although most respondents commented favorably on the turn-around time for lab results, the local health departments (LHDs) sometimes learned about their lab-confirmed cases during the daily conference calls. Many respondents stated that OSPHL staff responded quickly to questions about the process (e.g., obtaining and transporting specimens) and results interpretation. This helped to ensure understanding of lab procedures at the local level. Recommendations: 1. Review/revise guidance for private providers to include more, clearer instructions on specimen handling and results notification 2. OSPHL and the State should consider the impact on epidemiological data if a larger number of tests are done by the lab 3. Based on lessons learned all LHDs should consider county-level tracking system for testing records Activity 2: Provide Surveillance Support Observation 2.1: (Strength and Area for Improvement) OSPHL provided support to county health departments and hospitals. Analysis: OSPHL began testing protocols two weeks after the outbreak began. Over the course of the response the turn-around time for results significantly improved. This allowed more appropriate actions to be taken at the State and local levels. Results and sub-typing data were adequate. Limiting the testing to positive samples from hospitals provided adequate information for treatment. With regards to the rapid flu tests, initially the hospitals and LHDs did not know who to send them to or when results would come back to them. At times, OSPHL was overwhelmed with specimens to be tested. During the fall peak of H1N1 OSPHL had a backlog of tests to conduct. There were comments during the regional hot washes that Oregon should have more than one lab that can do the testing. If the pandemic had been as bad as anticipated the lab would have been even more overwhelmed. There needs to be a better mechanism to surge the lab testing ability. Recommendation: 1. Consider establishing or authorizing other labs to conduct the testing in a pandemic CAPABILITY: EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER MANAGEMENT After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 17 OREGON Capability Summary: Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Management is the capability to provide multi-agency coordination for incident management by activating and operating an EOC for a pre-planned or no-notice event. EOC management includes EOC activation, notification, staffing, and deactivation; management, direction, control, and coordination of response and recovery activities; coordination of efforts among neighboring governments at each level and among local, regional, State, and Federal EOCs; coordination public information and warning; and maintenance of the information and communication necessary for coordinating response and recovery activities. Similar entities may include the National (or Regional) Response Coordination Center (NRCC or RRCC), Joint Field Offices (JFO), National Operating Center (NOC), Joint Operations Center (JOC), Multi-Agency Coordination Center (MACC), Initial Operating Facility (IOF), etc. Activity 1: Develop and Maintain Training and Exerci se Programs Observation 1.1 (Strength and Area for Improvement): Incident Command System (ICS) structure was used in managing the Agency Operations Center (AOC) and the State's joint information center (JIC) during this emergency. Analysis: Significant efforts were made over the past years to provide ICS training to State Public Health (PH) Preparedness staff and other Department of Human Services (DHS) staff in anticipation of a public health emergency, such as a pandemic. The trained cadre in the AOC was able to mentor and orient other AOC staff that was unfamiliar with their roles. Opportunities were available for new AOC staff to shadow an experienced person prior to assuming the role themselves. Over the course of both waves of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic the majority of State PH and DHS staff received hands-on training. Even though just-in-time training was on-going it was observed that there was still a tendency for staff to revert back to daily roles. When staff worked outside their ICS chain of command, this caused confusion, miscommunication and duplication of efforts. Except for Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) staff, most of the other PH staff working in the JIC had no ICS training or familiarity. The pre-JIC training was well-organized for the initial staff that reported to work, but as the response operations continued it was evident that there were significant gaps in understanding of JIC roles and responsibilities. Recommendations: 1. Provide on-going ICS position-specific training for AOC and JIC section chiefs 2. Provide on-going training of JIC personnel to ensure understanding of roles and responsibilities 3. Conduct public information exercise that includes a JIC Observation 1.2 (Area for Improvement): There was confusion on AOC roles and responsibilities. Analysis: Respondents mentioned inconsistent management in the AOC. At times there was not clear situational awareness of the issues being addressed by each section as well as the tasks After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 18 OREGON that have been accomplished. Although incident actions plans were being created on a regular basis, there were frustrations with the development of these documents. Many respondents working in the AOC felt that a large focus of the Logistics Section was for AOC staffing issues. There was confusion on new protocols for procurement of resources, and limited training provided on these protocols. Because few understood these new protocols the process for procurement was extremely slow and led to local agency frustration. The AOC has a robust staff to pull from in supporting state agencies. There is just-in-time training (JITT) for each position, with mentoring capabilities. Some of the AOC staff reported on the survey monkey that they did not utilize the JITT specific to their role and became frustrated in their roles. Those in charge of staffing initially had limited understanding of how to staff ICS positions. These issues became less problematic as the response activities continued. Not all AOC staff has been trained on the roles and responsibilities of their positions. Some that have had past training, needed a refresher on what their position duties required. This caused less productivity by the newly assigned staff or decreased the size of the labor pool because an individual was available but untrained. There were position-specific manuals available throughout the AOC with roles and responsibilities outlined for each position, but much of the information was not operationalized, and thus, had little real-time use. Time spent training before an AOC activation allows the agency to have a larger labor pool and personnel that are more prepared for a role in the AOC. AOC staff was sometimes assigned a project without any guidance even when they were unfamiliar with the tasks to be completed. Time spent ensuring that an employee understands the work to be done will save time in the long run and produce a better project. Recommendations: 1. Consider past training, exercise, and background as they fill the AOC positions. 2. Provide on-going ICS position-specific training for all DHS and OHA Communications staff and JIC Section Chiefs. 3. Consider designating contract specialists for emergency procurement 4. Provide Job Action Sheets for just-in-time training of all AOC positions 5. Train every agency with solid emergency procurement ability 6. Train on new protocols for procurement 7. Consider a separate staffing coordinator that reports to Logistics Chief Observations 1.3 (Area for Improvement): AOC staff had difficulty operating information technology (IT) equipment. Analysis: AOC staff had trouble with the phone system, proxy e-mails, and computers throughout the response. Staff reported that there was good IT support in the AOC but prior routine staff training and exercise on all equipment would have helped prevent frustrations. Recommendations: After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 19 OREGON 1. Provide routine training with all IT equipment for AOC staff 2. Conduct AOC IT equipment drill 3. Provide manuals with just-in-time training for all IT equipment and have it readily available to AOC personnel Activity 2: Direct Emergency Operation Center's Tact ical Operations Observation 2.1 (Area for Improvement): State AOC incident management teams (IMTs) have inconsistent membership. Analysis: There were many respondents who commented that State PH does not have consistent incident management teams for staffing the AOC. For example, there was one team assigned that was fully trained in AOC management, but not all team members were allowed to work consistently together, some were pulled to another team making holes in staffing. There were recommendations that the AOC trains, exercises, and staffs the IMT in 4 teams. For example: Team A works days during weeks 1 and 3, Team B works during weeks 2 and 4, Team C works during nights week 1 and 3, Team D works night during weeks 2 and 4. This will allow team building, institutional knowledge, and easily allow mentoring to continue. Suggestions from the survey and phone interviews consistently asked that there be a trained cadre of IMTs with a depth to staff 24/7 in 2 shifts. The managers had conflicting ideas about this. Some wanted four separate teams that would assume one week on and one week off for two 12-hour shifts. These teams would train together, deploy together as a team to either staff the AOC, or assist a local jurisdiction in running their local operation center. Other managers felt that there shouldn't be a designated team, that there should be overall training of all public health personnel to staff AOC positions. In the event that members of one of the IMTs were unable to fulfill their role, it would be easier to assign another into the IMT. At the very least, all managers felt there needed to be more discussion regarding the role and best utilization of staffing the IMT. In other comments surrounding local department operation centers (DOC), local health departments (LHDs) reported they were confident in managing operations, but many stated they were not good at the overall ICS management in their DOC. Some county emergency management agencies stood up to assist the LHDs and reported great success. The local emergency managers were able to run the facility as an operation center while the LHDs were able to respond as providers to their communities. More in-depth ICS position training, such as Finance, Logistics, Planning and Core IMT training is needed. Recommendations: 1. Convene working group to determine how best to staff IMT to include consideration of designating a depth of AOC IMTs to staff prolonged response 24/7 2. State public health management commit to IMT training/positions 3. Consider designated team of IMT 4. On-going training and exercise between emergency management and public health 5. Consider providing a mobile State IMT ready to deploy and assist county LHD After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 20 OREGON Observation 2.2 (Area for Improvement): OPS Center website is not a secured website, which limits its use for public health operation centers. Analysis: IT technical support noted that the OPS Center website is not a secure site and they had several discussions on what they could upload. They cannot put up sensitive issues such as where supplies from Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) are being kept, vaccine storage, etc. Oregon Office of Emergency Management (OEM) sent a liaison to the AOC to help with uploading data onto OPS Center. Recommendation: 1. Consider OPS Center files that can support secured information Observation 2.3 (Area for Improvement): There is confusion on emergency management's role in a public health emergency. Analysis: Many county emergency managers stated that OEM needed to stand up their Emergency Coordination Center (ECC) to assist the county emergency managers in supporting H1N1 response efforts. Several stated that a \"ripple affect\" occurred with county emergency management agencies, since State OEM did not stand up, several county emergency management agencies did not stand up to assist local response. At least one county emergency operations center (EOC) activated 24/7 to support LHD field operations. In doing this, the LHD DOC did not need to be fully staffed, which allowed the limited number of PH personnel to respond to the crisis. This also provided all community partners a good situational awareness as county emergency management is very experienced with compiling and disseminating situational awareness. A few county emergency managers stated that an issue may be that emergency management and LHDs were not usually co-located during response and that this would allow for better communication and coordination. Recommendations: 1. OEM should consider review/revision of policies and procedures regarding ECC activations to support AOC in public health emergencies 2. County emergency management should consider co-locating emergency management and public health operation centers during a public health emergency Observation 2.4 (Area for Improvement): AOC staffing assignments were unclear, confusing and not always developed in a timely manner. Analysis: The Deputy Director of Oregon Public Health Division (OPHD) worked closely with the Logistic Chief in assigning OPHD staff to fill roles in the AOC. Still, communicating staffing assignments, schedules, and roles and expectations, especially to those outside the emergency preparedness staff, were not clear. When scheduling assignments for the AOC not all PH and DHS supervisors were asked about their staff's availability and some of the agency personnel who were initially scheduled for certain shifts found their names removed without being notified of the change. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 21 OREGON Clarity and frequency of communications within PH regarding staff to be scheduled in the AOC needs to be improved. There was a perception that some offices or programs in PH were asked more frequently than others to provide staff for the AOC and that they were scheduled for longer periods of time than other offices' staff members. Many supervisors had issues with this. As the second phase progressed staffing was less of an issue due to the supervisor's ability to influence the staffing. Some felt that the incident command process was undermined. AOC staff were frequently pulled off their mission outside their AOC chain of command and assigned to other functions. In a prolonged response it is important for the staffing plan to be prepared in advance which allows supervisors to be contacted for approval and the individual employees to be notified of the schedule. If just-in-time training or shadowing is needed there is time for this to occur without it interfering with actual job performance after the shift has begun. A minimum of one week advance notice of the staffing plan should be considered. Recommendations: 1. Review/revise procedures for developing the AOC staffing plan to ensure that the process is completed at least one week in advance and supervisors are included in the process 2. Revise roles and responsibilities for AOC positions 3. Provide training to all personnel potentially assigned to the AOC regarding roles and responsibilities 4. Utilize materials developed for AOC positions as part of training tools Observation 2.5 (Area for Improvement): It was unclear who had authority to make decisions and approve changes in response operations. Analysis: There was confusion on who had authority to approve guidelines, procedures and changes in response operations. It was not always clear who had delegation authority, and how they could be reached when not in the AOC. There were comments given that the AOC incident manager needs to be able to devote full attention to the emergency and that they should delegate the approving authorities to Section Chiefs or a higher level policy group. There were delays in OPHD providing guidance about personal protective equipment (PPE), who will receive the vaccine, and how the vaccine will be distributed to local jurisdictions. Also, respondents reported confusion about what was mandated and what was a guideline, and they did not have a clear distinction between the two. Recommendations: 1. Develop guidance tracking system, to more accurately keep track of timelines for guidance development, approval and dissemination. 2. Review procedures for assigning AOC incident managers 3. Provide written delegation of authority to the incident manager (IM). 4. Provide advanced ICS training for incident managers After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 22 OREGON Observation 2.6 (Area for Improvement): Although most respondents were familiar with the resource requesting process, there were many suggestions for improving the system. Analysis: The majority of the Survey Monkey respondents were familiar with the process for requesting emergency resources, 26 of 40 believed that the process was clear, 29 of 41 believed that it was consistent, but only 15 of 34 believed the new Office of Public Health Division (OPHD) forms worked well. Some counties struggled with obtaining supplies, such as masks, and had to use some very creative sourcing to meet their needs. Many had very limited funds to assist with expenses related to the H1N1 response. All counties, but especially the less populated counties, felt they needed the support from the State to provide supplies and guidance as well as funds to provide services to the State's populations. OPHD had written standard operating procedures (SOPs), procedures and policies that were used to request ESF #8 resources. Some of the county emergency management organizations were un-prepared to assist their LHD. One respondent did not appreciate the creation of special procedures and resource request forms unique to public health. They did not know if the new forms were optional or required. During the Governor's Summit, there was training of use of request forms, and information was disseminated out to counties for this information. Still, LHD and hospitals reported confusion regarding what forms from which sites were needed to process requests. Because of this confusion, some supplies were inaccurately provided\u2014one box of gloves rather than the case of gloves that was ordered and supplied needles were unusable for vaccinations. Recommendations: 1. On-going training on request forms 2. Review/revise procedures to ensure follow-up with local agencies regarding process understanding and include steps to provide training as needed Observation 2.7 (Strength): Key State level strategic planners met weekly. Analysis: There were weekly in-person or teleconference meetings that consisted of the Governor's policy advisors, school superintendents, military representatives, OEM, Oregon State Police (OSP), and Dr Kohn and/or Dr. Goldberg. These meetings were to discuss what was happening in response to the H1N1 pandemic statewide. There was also daily communication between senior leadership either by phone or VIP email list serve that included the daily Sit Stats. State Police maintained situational awareness of response efforts for H1N1 response. They were delegated the task of security for the SNS medical assets during this crisis and felt they were well informed about what was going on throughout the State through the daily conference calls. Recommendation: None Activity 3: Gather and Provide Information After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 23 OREGON Observation 3.1 (Area for Improvement): AOC requests for information from local agencies were sometimes unclear and often duplicated. Analysis: Local agencies commented that AOC requests for data were often unclear on what was needed, no timeline for response, and duplicate requests by other AOC staff requesting the same information. Request recipients in the AOC were unaware that another section in the AOC was gathering the same information. Recommendations: 1. Review/revise protocols to ensure a clear communication structure for information requests exists and tasks/responsibilities in the AOC are clearly stated to eliminate duplication requests 2. Develop status board visible in the AOC to capture what requests have been made and what data has been obtained Observation 3.2 (Strength): Majority of survey respondents felt State Immunization / Vaccine Distribution group was very responsive and supportive to local needs. Analysis: Many of the survey respondents stated that the immunization/vaccine distribution group was responsive to local questions and concerns. The group took the time to investigate what happened to missing vaccine orders for partners as well as the LHD. The content of their conference calls was timely and appropriate to local working needs. Recommendation: None Observation 3.3 (Area for Improvement): Local schools were frustrated with frequent changing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, and vaccine availability. Analysis: Many counties were informed that they were getting a finite number of vaccine doses on an established date. They arranged vaccine clinics at schools in their area but frequently had to make changes due to vaccine not arriving as scheduled. There was miscommunication of vaccine allotment and shipment between State and local public health which compounded the confusion. At least three schools reported frustration in frequent changes, especially when the messages did not get relayed in a timely manner for schools to get the messages out to their students and families. The schools did not have a database mechanism with which to report absenteeism to PH. This information would have been helpful in the epidemiological surveillance efforts by local and State staff. Recommendations: 1. Review/revise plans and procedures so school liaisons meet routinely with LHD and emergency management groups during a response After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 24 OREGON 2. Assign State/local point of contact for schools 3. State should develop/use a database that monitors school absenteeism rates so they have a bigger and better picture of what is happening with illness trends Activity 4: Identify and Address Issues Observation 4.1 (Area for Improvement): There is no requirement for local jurisdictions to adopt State or CDC guidance regarding PPE, sub-prioritizing the priority groups, and vaccine distribution allotments. Analysis: It appeared to many of the survey respondents that LHD had difficulty determining whether to follow State or CDC guidance regarding PPE, subdividing the priority groups, and vaccine distribution allotments. Each local jurisdiction has the ability to accept or decline State guidance regarding sub-prioritizing the priority groups, OPHD does not direct what the county should adopt. Counties that followed the guidance reported public concerns. Routinely television would show LHDs restricting who could receive the vaccine and preventing a pre-planned priority group from receiving vaccine. Other LHDs or hospitals that followed the more traditional priority guidelines had people coming from all over the State to their clinics. This caused chaos, frustration, and confusion among many communities. Recommendations: 1. Encourage collaboration of counties to adopt consistent guidelines Observation 4.2 (Area for Improvement): There is a lack of clarity at the state and local level on emergency declarations in response to a public health emergency. Analysis: Daily senior leadership meetings, which included OEM, OPHD, Oregon Military Department (OMD) and risk management, provided statewide situational awareness on H1N1 activities. Based on data collection and surveillance activities, there were no triggers to elicit a State declaration of emergency. There was agreement to recognize health care workers registered in SERV-OR as state registered emergency service workers in case there became a need for emergency healthcare workers. While there were some local advantages to having a State Declaration, such as state provision of liability for State registered emergency service workers, use of Oregon Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT), and the potential for supporting altered standards of care policy for licensed healthcare facilities, a need for these assets during the response was not clearly identified or communicated. Local emergency declarations were discussed and considered by 3 counties, Deschutes, Jackson and Josephine. OPHD representatives participated in lengthy conference calls with these counties when they were considering emergency declarations. Only one of them, Josephine County made a local declaration to access local resources they couldn't access otherwise. While there is a clear and tested process for local and state declarations due to natural disasters, this process for public health emergency declarations is unclear. Recommendations: After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 25 OREGON 1. Establish a workgroup composed of members from OPHD, OEM, local emergency management, local public health, and tribal health and emergency management agencies to work together to identify triggers that would illicit both local and state declarations in response to a public health emergency 2. Once triggers at the local and state levels have been identified and documented, training and clear communication about those triggers need to be shared so state and local partners are operating with a common understanding and common expectations 3. Conduct an emergency exercise to evaluate the process for state and local declarations for a public health emergency Observation 4.3 (Area for Improvement): Frequent changes in guidelines were frustrating to local agencies. Analysis: Although 62% of the 93 respondents answering the survey question indicated that the State made timely decisions, there was a perception that communicating the decisions sometimes took too long. In addition, it seemed that it took the OPHD leadership a long time to respond to LHD requests for policy decisions. For example, after being asked to provide a State hotline during weekly staff meetings, it still took months to set up a hotline even though the planning had been done. Local health department and health systems staff have requested clarification on the criteria used to determine whether a public health emergency would be declared at the state level, so they could use this information in their subsequent planning efforts. There were many comments about the lack of timely decision making at the senior leadership level. It was quicker to get policy and guidance information directly from CDC. There seemed to be a significant time lag between when the information became available through CDC and when it was posted on HAN or flu.oregon.gov website. There appeared to be no transparency with State-level decision-making to local public health and emergency management agencies. OPHD was perceived to be slow to adopt or counter CDC guidance. The most important decisions the survey respondents identified were preparing a mechanism to distribute antivirals if the need arose, changing vaccine recommendations when the supply was less than 50% of expected doses, and the timing and coordination of media campaigns. There did not appear to be capacity or process for addressing emerging issues if they arose, including altered standards of care and distribution of scarce resources. Recommendation: 1. Review/revise procedures to ensure that requests and inquiries from local jurisdictions are recorded, assigned as a task, given to the appropriate ICS branch in the AOC, given a timeline for completion, and have follow through back to the local jurisdiction Observation 4.4 (Strength): Local public health agencies made timely decisions. Analysis: Of the 60 Survey Monkey responses, 78.5% indicated that local public health agencies made timely decisions. These decisions included, but were not limited to, a local emergency declaration, staging of vaccine distribution and point of distribution (POD) operations, creation and implementation of a local multi-agency coordination (MAC) Group, regular meetings with appropriate -mail communications between meetings, and staffing to After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 26 OREGON address the different phases of the response. Some of the decisions were made as a plan prior to the actual flu season which allowed everyone to be better prepared within the county. This ability to function at the local level with the information available allowed the local agencies and organizations to serve the population to the best of their abilities. Recommendation: None Activity 5: Support and Coordinate Response Observation 5.1 (Strength and Area for Improvement): LHDs coordinated efforts successfully with community partners. Analysis: Respondents commented that communication between the LHD and community partners was good. In many rural areas, the immunization process at the schools and with the underserved populations, including seasonal and migrant farm workers, was well-planned and executed. Clinics were able to provide vaccine to most of the people who wanted immunizations. Those LHDs that regularly trained and exercised with local emergency management had a better level of coordination during the response. Past LHD POD training for clinic staff was effective in vaccine distribution. Respondents stated that because of the relevant past and just-in-time training they were able to conduct successful distribution of vaccine. For some areas communications between the LHD and partner agencies needs to be improved. This is especially true for those who have knowledge of and access to the vulnerable population groups in the county. In some areas support or partner agencies were not utilized to assist the LHD. This placed the entire incident response with the LHD when help was available. Because LHD was working independently the support agencies were not included in the action plans. Using partner agencies can be a great asset. Recommendations: 1. Review/revise the local command structure to consider a joint operation for public health emergencies 2. Review/revise plans to more effectively use partner agencies 3. Consider including colleges as a vulnerable population 4. Encourage the coordination of vaccine management with local pharmacies CAPABILITY: RESPONDER SAFETY AND HEALTH Capability Summary: Responder Safety and Health is the capability that ensures adequate trained and equipped personnel and resources are available at the time of an incident to protect the safety and health of on scene first responders, hospital/medical facility personnel (first receivers), and skilled support personnel through the creation and maintenance of an effective safety and health program. This program needs to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) \"HAZWOPER\" standard (29 CFR 1910.120, as implemented After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 27 OREGON by EPA or State authorities) and any other applicable Federal and State regulations. The program also needs to be integrated into the Incident Command System (ICS) and include training, exposure monitoring, personal protective equipment, health and safety planning, risk management practices, medical care, decontamination procedures, infection control, vaccinations for preventable diseases, adequate work-schedule relief, psychological support, and follow-up assessments. This capability identifies the critical personnel, equipment, training, and other resources needed to ensure that all workers are protected from all hazards, including fire (heat and products of combustion), CBRNE (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive) materials, electrical hazards, collapsed structures, debris, acts of violence, and others. The Responder Safety and Health capability is a critical component of safe overall emergency management. First responders include police, fire, emergency medical services (EMS), and other emergency personnel, as well as emergency management, public health, clinical care, public works, and other skilled support personnel (such as equipment operators). This extended definition includes a very broad set of workers and a wide range of likely response-related activities, resulting in an increased number of potential hazards and exposures. Building the ability to protect all responders from all hazards is a substantial undertaking that involves prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. This capability supports both the Safety Officer position identified in the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/incident command system (ICS) and the Worker Safety and Health Support Annex to the National Response Plan (NRP). The Type 1 Safety Officer described in this capability has yet to be fully defined (to include managing all of the hazards that first responders are likely to face), but the concept used is the same as the \"Disaster Safety Manager\" described in Protecting Emergency Responders: Safety Management in Disaster and Terrorism Response (NIOSH, 2004). In addition, the list of services that are critical for this capability is consistent with the actions specified under the Worker Safety and Health Support Annex and in the Guidelines for Hazmat/WMD Response, Planning and Prevention Training (FEMA, 2003). During the response to any incident, employers are responsible primarily for the safety and health of their employees. However, the ICS creates a unified safety and health organization under the Safety Officer. In large-scale incidents, because of the number and varieties of hazards and workers, the Safety Officer would be used more as a Safety Manager. This technical capability therefore does not prescribe a certain level of preparedness for any particular organization; rather, it specifies the need for personal protective equipment (PPE), Safety Officers, and so forth and allows local entities to determine the best way to obtain the needed resources (e.g., through mutual aid, State resources, or Federal resources) for the first 72 hours from the \"initial response\" operations. Activity 1: Identify Safety/Personal Protective Equi pment (PPE) Needs and Distribute PPE Observation 1.1 (Strength): State public health successfully collaborated with OR- OSHA for PPE guidance. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 28 OREGON Analysis: Oregon Public Health Division (OPHD) and Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OR-OSHA) reviewed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Federal OSHA guidelines for Respiratory Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Collaboratively, they made recommendations that were approved by agency subject matter experts. These guidelines were disseminated to all state and local jurisdictions in a timely manner. It was determined that N-95 masks were not needed by all healthcare workers. CDC guidance given during the H1N1 response stated that healthcare workers should use N-95 masks. Oregon realized that, in a pandemic, this was not feasible\u2014too many masks would be needed and the cost would be very high. The definition was determined to be too loose. Also, there were a limited number of N-95 masks throughout the country and large demands would be placed on the inventories if all healthcare workers were wearing N-95 masks. OPHD worked with OR-OSHA to establish guidelines regarding the use of masks for healthcare workers. Recommendation: None Observation 1.2 (Area for Improvement): Healthcare providers, first responders and critical infrastructure workers were not in the initial priority group for vaccination. Analysis: First responders and healthcare workers considered themselves high risk for exposure to the H1N1 virus. In prior pandemic flu planning, these groups were considered priority for early vaccination. CDC did not include critical infrastructure workers as a priority group for vaccine during the H1N1 response. Statewide planning for a pandemic influenza included this group as priority to receive vaccination. During a pandemic many of these workers believed they should be protected. For example, they must enter areas that could be contaminated or be exposed to ill persons while performing the tasks essential to providing critical infrastructure operations, maintenance, and repair. The changes to State and federal guidance caused anxiety and frustration to these groups. Many local agencies were competing for scarce vaccine to protect their front line staff, especially fire departments and emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. Receiving adequate supplies after the epidemic was over was inappropriate and not appreciated by anyone\u2014responders, healthcare providers, or the public. One Medford hot wash attendee reported that the State had denied their request for more vaccine for staff. Recommendation: 1. Review/revise pandemic flu guidelines for priority group identification, the distribution of vaccine and other appropriate PPE to responders and healthcare providers Observation 1.3 (Strength): The Pandemic Influenza Coordinating Committee (PICC) was implemented as a means of evaluating and making policy recommendations. Analysis: Prior to the April outbreak PICC existed solely on paper. . Although some aspects of this process need improvement, it allowed input on policy from multiple stakeholders as well as After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 29 OREGON providing diversity of views. Recommendation: None CAPABILITY: EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION AND WARNING Capability Summary: The Emergency Public Information and Warning capabil ity includes public information, alert/warning, and notification. It involves developing, coordinating, and disseminating information to the public, coordinating officials, and incident management and responders across all jurisdictions and disciplines effectively under all hazard conditions. (a) The term public information refers to any text, voice, video, or other information provided by an authorized official and includes both general information and crisis and emergency risk communication (CERC) activities. CERC incorporates the urgency of disaster communication with risk communication to influence behavior and adherence to directives. (b) The term alert refers to any text, voice, video, or other information provided by an authorized official to provide situational awareness to the public and/or private sector about a potential or ongoing emergency situation that may require actions to protect life, health, and property. An alert does not necessarily require immediate actions to protect life, health, and property and is typically issued in connection with immediate danger. (c) The term warning refers to any text, voice, video, or other information provided by an authorized official to provide direction to the public and/or private sector about an ongoing emergency situation that requires immediate actions to protect life, health, and property. A warning requires immediate actions to protect life, health, and property and is typically issued when there is a confirmed threat posing an immediate danger to the public. (d) The term notification refers to any process in which Federal, State, local, tribal, or nongovernmental organization, department, and/or agency employees and/or associates are informed of an emergency situation that may require a response from those notified. Activity 1: Developing and Maintaining Plans, Proced ures, Programs, and Systems Observation 1.1 (Area for Improvement): Media and public information pre- p lanning occurred during the summer; however there was little transparency at the local level. Analysis: Respondents stated they did not realize public infor mation materials were being developed by the State in preparation for the second wave of H1N1. Appendix J shows what documents were produced. During the Governors Summit, information was given on media bites and posters available on the website. By the end of September/early October, the State Communication Plan was presented to and approved by CLHO and PH leadership. This document provided the current public information and media plan for the state. It was to be disseminated from CLHO to its members at that time. Local jurisdictions who did not receive After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 30 OREGON this document created their own materials without a consistent message or \"one voice\". Schools wanted information as they opened their doors for students at the end of summer break. Local health departments (LHDs) that did not receive the Communication Plan commented that the media sought out information during the summer, but, since their plans were not in place to provide that information, the media would obtain information from other sources. Recommendations: 1. O PHD should continue to create/review/revise public information and media plans for pandemic flu including local needs and rural communities 2. OPHD should continue to work with the LHDs to create public information documents for pandemic flu in English and Spanish, written for sixth grade or lower, with some material appropriate for primary grade students Observation 1.2 (Strength and Area for Improvement): Social media was u sed in some areas of the State. Analysis: Many counties and State agencies did not use social media, such as Face Book and Twitter. The reasons were that there was not enough dedicated staff time for updating/reviewing the sites, a concern about misuse of the sites by staff, or that these sites were not allowed by local rules. However, JIC staff used Twitter to post news announcements, send on CDC tweets, and respond to public tweets. This system worked well for response activities. Some organizations, such as Indian Health Service (IHS), used Facebook in at least a limited capacity. The organizations that did use social media had success in reaching the younger populations with their messages. It was uncertain how effective this media could be on a broader basis, but some feel it must be considered since the trend to use it continues to grow. There is a perception that the State should use Facebook as a method to reach the public, which they do. Oregon Public Health created a page: www.Facebook.com/FluOregon. When flu activity slowed, the Flu Oregon Facebook page was receiving 900 or more page visits each month. In the summer months, people continued to visit the Flu Oregon Facebook page, with more than 200 visits per week in June and July 2010. Many found Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Twitter to be beneficial. Recommendation: 1. S tate and local public health organizations should consider a wider use of social media during future responses which will require dedicated staff and funding Observation 1.3 (Strength): Flu.oregon.gov was useful and should be used in future incidents. Analysis: The majority of respondents from the hot wash attendees, Survey Monkey, and phone interviews indicated that the flu.oregon.gov website was considered a major resource for them, as well as a public place to post information. Several jurisdictions and agencies, such as hospitals and LHDs posted links to this website on their own websites to encourage the public to seek information from the site. Recommendation: After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 31 OREGON 1. Review/revise public information protocols to include development of incident-specific websites during future responses Observation 1.4 (Area for Improvement ): LHDs established hotlines before the State hotlines were functioning. Analysis: Many counties had established their own public infor mation or triage hotlines long before the State had established their hotline\u2014as much as one month earlier. Citizens were seeking information much sooner than the State was prepared to have a hotline system in place\u2014 a proposed plan for the hotline was submitted to leadership in July with a decision made to activate in mid September for this had occurred during the summer. The local jurisdictions and organizations realize that they need to assess how they can better provide the service in the future if the State does not provide it quickly. Counties that needed help from the State did not receive it soon enough to provide good public information for their citizens. At least one county utilized their 211 system which the State had also considered but not all counties have a 211 system in place. Tribes referred callers to the State hotline. Their clinics were overwhelmed with calls both during hours and after hours and were relieved to have the State hotline to which they could refer the callers. A few counties had hotlines that only contained a recorded message referring callers to the State hotline and some included a separate number if the caller wished to speak with a nurse. The majority of the public wanted to speak with a person and not listen to recorded information. The majority of respondents reported that when the State's hotline was available, was good\u2014it provided access for professionals who needed guidance as well as someone to answer questions from the public and to provide vaccination clinic information once the vaccine was available. The respondents were public health professionals (not the general public.) However, it was reported by some special populations groups that they experienced long waits on the phone and inadequate information. Of the 65 responses regarding the General Public Hotline, 58 rated the hotline as good, very good, or excellent. The Health Care Provider Hotline received 40 good, very good, or excellent ratings (45 responses). The Triage Hotline which addressed questions about symptoms or the illness received 45 good, very good, or excellent ratings from the 52 responses. Even though there were relatively high ratings for these hotlines, several respondents indicated that improvements are needed. Many local citizens still called the LHD to speak with someone in their own county. Recommendations: 1. E xamine various approaches for hotline or other systems, such as 211, to provide information to the public during a pandemic or similar incident where public information, especially health related, is critical 2. Establish procedures and have contingency contracts in place to expedite services activation 3. OPHD should consider a more timely system for establishing hotlines to provide critical assistance to the LHDs and the State's citizens After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 32 OREGON 4. Establish a timeline to open hotlines at beginning of response operations including specific triggers indicating the need for activation 5. Ensure that the hotline is of high quality for all populations. When doing quality testing, have those that speak other languages do quality control tests. Ensure that those in charge of evaluation of the activities also are not coordinating the program Activity 2: Conduct Joint Information Center Operati ons Observation 2.1 (Area for Improvement): The State JIC faced challenges in o rganizational structure and leadership. Analysis: JIC operations were organized around senior leadersh ip meetings, document production, situational status update, and media briefings. The JIC staff was comprised of Department of Human Services (DHS), including Communications, Public Health, and Emergency Preparedness staff. There was confusion on JIC roles and responsibilities. Staff who had prior Incident Command System (ICS) training, reported higher level of understanding of their job functions while staff with little or no ICS training or experience approached JIC operations as \"work as usual\". This role confusion disrupted the collaborative effort needed to function efficiently and effectively in the sometimes chaotic environment of a JIC. During the summer of 2009, there was significant remodel of JIC procedures, roles and responsibilities. JIC staff used the summer for planning and training efforts. This allowed a more coordinated JIC response during the Fall H1N1 public messaging campaign. New procedures put in place by DHS Communications after the JIC opened created many new steps in the document production process. These new steps changed frequently, and with inconsistent document control, documents were not tracked as effectively. The plan and systems as designed were to follow a document from development assignment to publication. There were many incidents when no one knew where a particular item was in the process and others that were simply lost. Another obstacle for the JIC was that the time it took for the average fact sheet in English to make it from development to publication was 56 hours. With the rapidly changing H1N1 situation, there were many times when the information published was no longer useful or accurate. Many of the steps that were newly required provided questionable utility to partners. For example, one step for many of the materials was the DHS Office of Communications Resources' branding of documents. Staff to support local jurisdictions with this process was insufficient to meet the demand. Few were able to get their documents revised by the state graphic designer in a timely manner. There became quite a backlog waiting for this internal DHS Office of Communications Resources branding process and more editing checks were needed after to make sure that nothing had been lost in the conversion. It often took days for a document to return to the JIC in its new branded form. Early in the event, (through November), there was an overall lack of coordination between the OPHD PIOs and local public health department PIOs. It was felt by many of the local jurisdictions that the State JIC needed local agency PIO representation. A list of all county health After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 33 OREGON department PIOs and associated agency PIOs was used to push through HAN an invitation to the PIO Conference Calls. Since not everyone accessed HAN, some didn't know about these calls until later in the fall. Recommendations: 1. R eview/revise plans to establish leadership and support roles of the various State agencies involved in the JIC 2. Notify AOC incident manager immediately if problems occur in organizational structure 3. Ensure all PIOs have updated ICS training, understands their roles/responsibilities, with the ability to adapt to the long days and extensive hours of a sustained event 4. Ensure all jurisdictions PIO/Communication Officers are signed up in HAN Observation 2.2 (Area for Improvement): Not all PIOs were prepared for the a mount of information that needed disseminating. Analysis: Although it was felt that the initial H1N1 messages got out to the public and local communities in a timely manner, some local PIOs became quickly overwhelmed with increasing amount of information from the State and Federal agencies. Although a common occurrence in any disaster, the frequently changing messages in the initial response caused many to become frustrated by the lack of a common operating picture. In preparation for the Governor's Summit, the State PIOs worked on messaging programs for state and local use. This caused some delays in real world public information assistance to LHD. The JIC was not activated during the summer, but became fully activated following the Governor's Summit. Recommendations: 1. I dentify a core team to review job action sheets, processes and procedures to incorporate lessons learned and improve efficiency and productivity 2. Pre-identify OPHD staff that can be used to expand JIC staffing as the event accelerates/expands 3. Ensure the Lead PIO in the State JIC has appropriate ICS training (i.e.: ICS 100, 200, 300, 400, 700, 702, 800) Observation 2.3 (Strength): The Portland UASI activated a regional JIC in the m etropolitan area to support the Cities Readiness Initiative (CRI) efforts in the UASI counties. Analysis: The Portland UASI JIC was activated during the resp onse. This allowed the UASI to send a communications plan to all jurisdictions ahead of the response. The plan delineated roles between the State and county. It allowed relationships to be established in a short period of time and contributed to smoother communications throughout the metropolitan UASI area. Although many considered this successful, not all agencies in the UASI area were aware of the plan. The Portland UASI had issues unique to the metropolitan areas and felt they needed a more After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 34 OREGON focused JIC for their region. A regional JIC was established with emergency management for Washington County providing the initial staff for the regional JIC; eventually all five counties from the UASI area were represented. The regional JIC was able to collaborate and even support the State JIC and Portland Office of Emergency Management (POEM) with media campaign, public information, and recommendations. Recommendation: None Activity 3: Issuing Public Information, Alerts/Warni ngs, and Notification Observation 3.1 (Strength): Weekly flu update press releases ( F lu Bites ) and flu.oregon.gov public website were helpful to healthcare providers and the general public. Analysis: The posting of guidance on the flu.oregon.gov websi te was a single location that any person or organization could refer to for the most current information and guidance. As soon as the CDC gave out new information regarding who could receive which vaccine it was uploaded onto the flu.oregon.gov website. Many providers were able to access reliable information and protocols to forward to their client base. All of the local response communities agreed with the guidelines for personal protective equipment (PPE) and appreciated the way OPHD \"did not succumb to the CDC requirements regarding protective equipment, e.g., regular masks are okay per HPD versus CDC wanting N-95s\". There were many positive comments on the frequent updates and guidance on all issues. The information was kept up-to-date and it was easy for community partners and the public to navigate when they were looking for additional information. Recommendation: 1. Develop specific JIC position dedicated solely to graphic design and web posting Observation 3.2 (Area for Improvement): There was limited non-English m aterial available. Analysis: The translation process in place for Spanish and oth er languages was inadequate due to quality and timeliness for the H1N1 response. For example, to translate a publication- ready fact sheet from English to Spanish took an average time of 56 hours from origin to publication, then an additional 80 hours for the translation time, which averaged 136 hours for completion. Staff used as Spanish translators did not have medical backgrounds. Sometime later documents were discovered with one word mistakes that completely shifted the meaning of sensitive recommendations. These documents had been widely distributed and had been posted on the H1N1 Flu website. In addition, five fact sheets were budgeted and approved to be translated into Russian, Vietnamese, and two Chinese languages. There were delays in getting documents through the review process and approved by the office of communication resources. Some of these documents were never translated although the process had begun in September and October. There are plans to convene a Lean Transformation Rapid Process Initiative (RPI) team to address translation process for emergency communications. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 35 OREGON Recommendation: 1. R eview/revise plan and public information templates to ensure material is provided for dissemination to non-English speakers Observation 3.3 (Strength and Area for Improvement): State-level c ommunications and paid advertising was effective in the metropolitan areas but some of the less populated areas of the State and smaller agencies/jurisdictions had limited use for it. Analysis: The State used paid advertising to assist all areas of the state in their campaign for infection control and other H1N1 information. The state also provided paid television commercials in English and Spanish; radio commercials in Spanish; and print advertisements in English; they shared this information with CLHO, who could disseminate information to local jurisdictions. Later in the event, the Oregon Partnership to Immunize Children funded H1N1 vaccination ads that were placed in buses in several areas of the state and in diverse print publications across the state. Local jurisdictions also used paid advertising successfully. For example, billboards and bus signs were effective. Some of the smaller communities felt that the State did not consider their needs, especially when these jurisdictions were not using HAN to receive the latest information on H1N1 activities. Some of the smaller communities, such as Coos County, reported that they used the local Public Access station to put their messages out, and that was perceived as very effective, from their LHD survey. Some counties have a good relationship with the local media, which assisted them in working around the lack of paid advertising in the community Several smaller institutions, such as small private colleges and schools, reported a lack of assistance from the State in available resources and media materials to provide to their organizations. These institutions would like to be included HAN messages about the various list serves, conference calls, etc., that are provided throughout the state. Recommendations: 1. R eview/revise protocols to ensure that all areas are included information sharing and paid advertising plans. Continue to share paid advertising plans with CLHO 2. Encourage broader use of HAN to obtain emergency information and guidance documentation Observation 3.4 (Strength): Tribes had success with community information and warning. Analysis: One Oregon Tribe disseminated information about 2009 H1N1 and the value of vaccination for priority groups through a reservation-wide \"Knock-n-Talk\" program. The tribal culture of emphasizing personal interaction between leaders and their community fostered the success of using a door-to-door approach to disseminate information on the H1N1 response. IHS had six of their trained staff become trainers for a cadre of tribal volunteers. This group of volunteer were given written handouts with scripts of \"what to say\" to each household. They went to every residence on the reservation (1200 people in 3 districts, over 30-40 mile radius) within 72 hours. They distributed handouts and training on indicators of H1N1, PPE use, and After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 36 OREGON other preventative measures. They also passed out PPE and hand sanitizers to those who requested them. The volunteers were able to speak with children and the elderly, the most vulnerable of the groups, to ensure good preventive practice information was provided. Recommendation: None Observation 3.5 (Strength and Area for Improvement): There were many w ays in which State and local agencies successfully issued public information and warning during the 2009 H1N1 response. Analysis: Respondents reported several successes in dissemina ting public information to their stakeholders. The use of local phone banks, newspapers, and radio and television stations were the biggest avenues to disperse information. There were some isolated issues where newspapers did not run the press releases about immunization clinics, but most of the time this was successful. Regular news releases to local print media were frequent and concise, which led most local newspapers to include repetitive and clear information about at-risk population groups, methods of infection prevention, and availability of vaccine. In some communities the local PH staff visited different locations (schools, doctors' offices, churches, etc.) explaining what H1N1 was, how to protect yourself, what the priority groups were and why they had been established; the outreach was perceived as a big public relations event. Some counties had a single point of contact with the K-12 schools for the H1N1 response. Others provided letters were provided to various agencies, organizations, and businesses and websites were developed that contained county-specific information\u2014but there was not guidance from the State to assist the counties. Hotlines were established to help the public on where to receive vaccinations, etc. Local 911 centers received daily updates from the LHDs to help the call takers answer questions. Counties prepared printed materials concerning preventive measures and information about the vaccine which were helpful. Many developed and distributed these flyers and publications to the public. Local phone bank answering staff was given a list of frequently asked questions to answer public questions and information regarding vaccination clinics improved public confidence. Many counties expressed excellent coordination between their PIO and LHD. There was a strong team effort for the consistent, relevant information that met local needs. Recommendations: 1. U se local media on a consistent basis for disseminating updated information 2. Create media messaging that would clearly target 20-30 year olds 3. Develop redundant methods to immediately notify private providers and health clinics when the State protocols changed as to who is now eligible to receive vaccine and updates on other changes in response After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 37 OREGON Observation 3.6 (Area of Improvement): There was delayed messaging from S tate and/or CDC about the safety and effectiveness of FluMist. Analysis: Throughout the State many agencies had difficulty c onvincing people to use the FluMist. Hospitals, first responders, and other response staff refused this initially because they did not trust it. There was conflicting information disseminated on national news which caused confusion on how safe or risky this treatment was. Little was done on a State or Federal level to counteract these misconceptions. Many first responders were told that if they took the live virus they would not be able to work for seven days. Therefore, in some communities first responders were not given the mist. Eventually, this misconception was cleared up by the State. Some hospital workers were convinced that they could not use the live virus and could not be convinced that it was safe to use until their facilities began to receive H1N1 patient admits. A directive that first responders should not receive the mist vaccination caused a problem in at least one county\u2014emergency medical services (EMS) wanted the vaccine shot but there was none available for them to receive. At least one hospital in southwestern Oregon received pressure to vaccinate critical care nurses during the vaccine shortage. Recommendations: 1. R eview/revise vaccine distribution for first responders and healthcare providers 2. Review/revise public information plans to identify rumors and swiftly respond with accurate information; disseminate accurate information and guidance on new treatments; and send out Federal guidelines via redundant communications to all health providers on any new treatments proposed Observation 3.7 (Area of Improvement): State level public service a nnouncements (PSAs) were not provided until December. Analysis: After a presentation on the coming media buys and ad vertising development, CLHO authorized radio PSAs to be produced in Spanish-only, due to budget limits. Television public service announcements were made in English. Many were expecting radio PSAs in English to be available for the fall response, late September or beginning of October. Development of PSAs was discussed at CLHO meetings, and their minutes reflected documentation of what was being developed. All PIOs or Communications Officers may not have been aware of the paid media plan, which was posted on HAN. IHS independently developed their own PSA for their jurisdiction. They found it easier to go to the CDC website for consistent information. IHS found that the use of Face Book was a successful way to notify or update their communities because most of their people got their initial information from Face Book. They will continue to use this venue in the future. Recommendations: 1. W ork with CLHO and State agencies to provide more timely PSA to the public 2. Evaluate benefits of English radio PSAs After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 38 OREGON 3. Ensure all PIOs and Communications Officers have access to HAN to retrieve the Paid Media Plan Activity 4: Conduct Media Relations Observation 4.1 (Area for Improvement): Many people receive their news on t elevision from the national networks not local stations. Analysis: There were \"pockets\" of communities that received li mited local information about the H1N1 response activities; one reason was that these citizens have satellite television receivers' not local cable service. The national news was telling people to get the vaccine even though the LHDs had not yet received the vaccine. This caused frustration and confusion for the public as well as the healthcare providers and LHDs. There are some local areas that do not have access to any local news except what is in the weekly (or less frequent) newspaper. PIOs used multiple communication channels to reach as many of the population as possible, but there were still infrequent gaps. Recommendation: 1. Identify communities/locations with limited access to public information and develop bridges to these gaps Activity 5: Provide Public Rumor Control Observation 5.1 (Area for Improvement): Rumor control was not consistently o perationalized in the State JIC. Analysis: One of the issues that impacted communities was rumo r control. For example, the early epidemiological data surrounding Native American death rates was taken out of context. There was inconsistent and erroneous information in regards to Native American deaths from H1N1. Many tribal groups considered this a \"race' issue at the beginning. False reports were given that Native Americans had an 80% greater chance to die of H1N1 than the rest of the population. This data came from a central Oregon report using a qualifier of race in their reporting but not using pre-existing medical problems as a qualifier. These issues brought physicians into media briefings after more reports of deaths in the Native American communities became exaggerated. Rumors spread among the tribes and people thought this outbreak was bigger than the actual numbers supporting the data. IHS provided weekly updates on local radio to help control these rumors. Recommendations: 1. E nsure that rumors are identified and information disseminated to appropriate agencies/jurisdictions immediately 2. Ensure the Lead PIO is responsive when rumors are identified, and develops plans for rumor control After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 39 OREGON CAPABILITY: MEDICAL SURGE Capability Summary : Medical Surge is the capability to rapidly expand the capacity of the existing healthcare system (long term care facilities, community health agencies, acute care facilities, alternate care facilities and public health departments) in order to provide triage and subsequent medical care. This includes providing definitive care to individuals at the appropriate clinical level of care, within sufficient time to achieve recovery and minimize medical complications. The capability applies to an event resulting in a number or type of patients that overwhelm the day-to-day acute-care medical capacity. Planners must consider that medical resources are normally at or near capacity at any given time. Medical Surge is defined as rapid expansion of the capacity of the existing healthcare system in response to an event that results in increased need of personnel (clinical and non-clinical), support functions (laboratories and radiological), physical space (beds, alternate care facilities) and logistical support (clinical and non-clinical equipment and supplies). Activity 1: Develop and Maintain Plans, Procedures, Programs, and Systems Observation 1.1 (Area for Improvement): Some hospitals and provider clinics did not have sufficient staffing or equipment to handle the surge in illness during the fall response. Analysis: During the second wave of H1N1 more illness was seen in all areas of Oregon. Many hospitals have a limited surge capability during normal activity. As staffing issues were identified plans were revised to address these new issues. Many healthcare facilities mentioned that their current staff and volunteer contact information either did not exist or was out of date. The first priority was to develop or update contact lists into more than one format (e.g., electronic and hard copy). It was also noted that pediatric clinics were overwhelmed with patients in some areas and the staffing coordinators realized that they had insufficient staff and no backup plan. From subsequent discussions and debriefings these organizations are in the process of identifying people in the community who could be used in a future staffing crisis. Many hospitals have identified extra surge beds to be used in an emergency, but there was confusion regarding the 1135 waiver on how to relax the licensing regulations. Most hospitals had times during the fall H1N1 response when the extra beds would have eased their crowding since few hospitals had the capacity for patient transfers. Recommendations: 1. State to provide guidance on how unlicensed beds can legally be used during an undeclared emergency 2. Identify community volunteers to assist during medical surge crisis 3. Update and maintain current contact list of credentialed staff and volunteers Observation 1.2 (Area for Improvement): State guidance for altered standards of care for healthcare facilities needs development. Analysis: Although it was not needed for this response, several hospitals were aware that it After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 40 OREGON might be necessary to implement altered care standards, such as relaxing the nurse to patient ratio, Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) restrictions, alternate care sites/triage sites, etc. Many hospitals were confused on who makes the decision to implement altered standards of care\u2014Office of Emergency Management (OEM), Oregon Public Health Division (OPHD), LHDs, or an individual facility. There is the general understanding that unless there is a State declaration of emergency, the current standards of care remain. OPHD sent out information on Section 1135 of the Social Security Act [42 USC \u00a71320b-5]. This states that waivers are permitted only to the extent they ensure that sufficient health care items and services are available to meet the needs of Medicare, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) beneficiaries in the emergency area during the emergency period. The \"emergency area\" and the \"emergency period\" are the geographic area, in which, and the time period, during which, the dual declarations exist. Permitted actions include the waiver or modification of conditions of participation, other certification requirements, program participation requirements, pre-approval requirements for health care providers; waiver of sanctions for certain directions or relocations and transfers that otherwise would violate the EMTALA; waiver of sanctions related to Stark self-referral prohibitions; modifications to deadlines and timetables for the performance of required activities; and waiver of sanctions and penalties arising from noncompliance with certain Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy regulations. Many hospitals are concerned about liability issues surrounding use of volunteer staff or supplies and equipment not purchased through their vendor contracts without a declaration of emergency. Some hospitals were not successful in conveying to OPHD that they were overwhelmed and needed assistance. They felt the mechanism for communicating their needs to the State was not successful. It was mentioned in both the regional hot washes and the phone interviews that having their State Local Health Department (LDH) Liaison in their region would have been beneficial instead of using them as Agency Operations Center (AOC) staff. Recommendations: 1. State to provide training to LHD and healthcare organizations on Section 1135 of the Social Security Act 2. State to develop guidelines for altered standards of care 3. State to develop guidelines for implementing altered standards of care 4. Revise procedures to assign State LDH Liaisons as field support Activity 2: Imp lement Surge Patient Transfer Procedures Observation 2.1 (Area for Improvement): Some hospitals were uncertain on procedures for transferring patients to other hospitals when they reached capacity. Analysis: Hospital respondents commented that they were having difficulty triaging current and incoming patients to determine who gets transferred to another facility. Section 1135 of the Social Security Act permits sanctions for certain directions or relocations and transfers that otherwise would violate the EMTALA. Hospitals were either unaware of this waver or there was little understanding of how to apply it to meet their needs. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 41 OREGON Many of these hospitals have not exercised a surge capacity drill, and some of them do not have a completed surge plan. There has been a need identified that each facility should develop, train, and exercise their surge plan, to include types of patients that could be discharged, what services must be closed or cancelled (e.g., elective surgeries), who will be contacted to assist with actual patient transfers, the appropriate documents to use when transferring patients, etc. Recommendations: 1. Further development of medical surge plans to ensure that patient transfers is adequately addressed with protocols to be followed 2. Train hospital staff and emergency response groups on the hospital surge plan 3. Conduct hospital medical surge exercise Activity 3: Implement Surge Staffing Procedures Observation 3.1 (Strength and Area for Improvement): Surge staffing plans were implemented successfully at many facilities. Analysis: During the fall H1N1 response staff absenteeism was almost 10% in many hospitals. Since this is a common absenteeism rate for the seasonal flu, hospitals were able to adequately staff their facilities. Many relied on using part-time and ancillary staff. Depending on the county and/or the hospital, it was difficult to hire personnel to assist with the response. The hiring process at some locations made it impossible to hire temporary help while others were able to use a personnel commission to hire staff who would work less than 20 hours per week. This created a streamlined process and was beneficial to the hiring organizations. LHDs have good relationships with nursing schools in some communities and the nursing students were used for back fill in public health surge situations. LHDs also used a cadre of volunteer nurses who have trained and exercised with them in the past. Also, LHDs used these volunteers and students for flu clinics in past years. The hospitals did not use these students and volunteers in their facilities due to liability issues in absence of a declaration of emergency. In the absence of a declaration hospitals are identifying gaps in staffing plans to develop solutions. Recommendations: 1. Hospitals and other organizations should consider revising hiring procedures to allow hiring temporary staff during an emergency such as a pandemic 2. State should review the response assistance they provided to all facilities, large or small, during the response and revise protocols accordingly 3. Draft temporary Oregon Administrative Rules to address some predictable emergency situations involving hospitals Observation 3.2 (Area for Improvement): Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) was utilized in some areas but not statewide. Analysis : There was a good response from the MRC in many counties in the first wave of After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 42 OREGON H1N1 but it became more difficult to obtain MRC assistance as the response continued into the fall wave. There were concerns at some facilities about how MRC could and could not be used; for example, how are training and skill levels of MRC maintained and documented? Many did not know if the State had a level of quality control for this group. There were also issues regarding liability\u2014for what services are they covered and who is the responsible party? At least one county stated that they do not have liability coverage for MRC unless there is local or State declaration of emergency; thus the MRC was not used in that county while other counties \"own\" the MRC and provide liability coverage for them when they are activated. Some counties used MRC volunteers at call centers and clinics doing non-clinical tasks but did not allow them to provide vaccinations. Those MRC volunteers felt they were not used to their capacity. Lane County's MRC is composed only of physicians but they were not activated due to the need for nursing staff; they activated a group of reserve nurses instead. Lane County has pre-existing liability coverage for its volunteers. Several counties indicated that they do not have a local MRC but most have a reserve group of nurses and volunteers that they were able to use. Recommendations: 1. State to develop guidelines for liability coverage for MRC when there is no State- declared emergency 2. Develop and communicate realistic expectations for MRC use, for volunteers, and end- use agencies CAPABILITY: MEDICAL SUPPLIES MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION Capability Summary: Medical Supplies Management and Distribution is the capability to obtain and maintain medical supplies and pharmaceuticals prior to an incident and to transport, distribute, and track these materials during an incident. Activity 1: Develop and Maintain Plans, Procedures, Programs, and Systems Observation 1.1 (Area for Improvement): Mass vaccinator contracts did not work well for most local communities. Analysis: Many respondents stated that the mass vaccinator contract process took too long to set up and institute and did not meet the needs of most jurisdictions. Several commented that there should be a way the State can expedite contracts during an emergency. By the time the contracts were signed in December most areas were experiencing a decrease in H1N1 activity. These contracts were made with three providers (it was difficult to learn who the contracted providers were), and the counties were responsible for a $700 set-up fee that would have a After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 43 OREGON patient through-put of 700 people. Some counties did not want to pay the set-up fee so they declined the contract. Some of the contracted providers did better than others causing frustration to the jurisdictions using them. Some contractors were not interested in providing services in the more rural areas. Many of the contract staff were unable to meet the expectations of the contracts\u2014most were unfamiliar with set up and operation of points of distribution (PODs); many needed to find and set up a facility in which to do the clinics. Local health department (LHD) staff was still needed at the POD sites to ensure that it was setup correctly and all steps in the vaccination process were accurately completed. Contract expectations need to be very specific about what must be provided by the contractor (e.g., facility, security, traffic control, and other non-medical personnel); is contractor familiar with POD process\u2014in other words, what of all the needed functions will you provide and for what cost per vaccination. The contracts did not allow support staff. The Oregon Public Health Division (OPHD) did not verify contractor qualifications that were stated in the contracts. For example, the mass vaccinator had to have a medical director to authorize vaccinations. Contracts must include inventory and vaccine use as allocated as well as the return of unused doses. Procedures were not always followed by both contractor and LHD\u2014scanable H1N1 forms processed incorrectly; forms incorrectly completed; incomplete or inaccurate rosters for billing; contractor invoices sent to LHD instead of the State. There was confusion on the financial part trying to determine where monies should go; what the LHD could use the money for, and where the revenue would go. Many felt it was difficult to track the money and the paperwork was confusing. Money was spent before guidance was received. A few counties stated they were not interested in using this type of contract again\u2014stating that there was a loss of control of the vaccine and paperwork with more confusion about the process than was necessary. Some survey respondents were interested in either their own organization or OPHD developing mass vaccinator contracts during future responses. One county contracted separately with an organization with which it already had a good working relationship and provided the vaccinations in malls. Recommendations: 1. Conduct a hot wash with Immunization staff and contracts and procurement personnel to identify gaps, overlaps, and barriers in the contract process 2. State Office of Emergency Management (OEM) and OPHD should review/revise procedures to ensure more rapid contracts during an emergency 3. OPHD should review/revise protocols for vaccinator contract needs to ensure that they contract with qualified personnel 4. Provide funding for those counties who choose to run their own mass vaccination sites After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 44 OREGON Observation 1.2 (Area for Improvement): There was no mechanism to redistribute supplies, especially vaccine, between counties after they were received from the State or the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). Analysis: Some very small counties were not given an adequate amount of vaccine\u2014 distribution was based on population not number of individuals in the priority groups. There should be some changes in the way allocations are determined. Counties were not allowed to share because it was necessary to track lot numbers and have product accountability. Collaboration should be allowed between entities. It was frustrating at the county level to have vaccine that was not needed, but must be kept even when another county desperately needed the vaccine to provide to everyone in the priority groups. Recommendation: 1. Review/revise distribution and accountability plans to allow vaccine sharing when appropriate notification and documentation have been done Observation 1.3 (Area for Improvement): There was local confusion on who had control of state record keeping for vaccine distribution. Analysis: Although there full time staff supported the state recordkeeping for vaccine distribution, there was limited transparency with local public health. They mentioned that having transparency into the statewide distribution of vaccine would have helped them with rumor control and partnering with their surrounding jurisdictions for sharing resources. Recommendations: 1. Review/revise vaccine distribution plan to ensure that public health is in control and can complete accurate records 2. Clarify to whom private providers are responsible for the vaccine use and recordkeeping Activity 2: Direct Medical Supplies Management and D istribution Tactical Operations Observation 2.1 (Area for Improvement): There was local frustration about medical caches, SNS supplies, and delays in delivery. Analysis: Some survey respondents expected the State to provide more equipment and supplies, or increased funding to purchase locally. Some respondents stated that this forced the LHD to purchase \"less than ideal products\" from \"less than ideal vendors\". SNS Supplies are the property of the county/tribe/state agency, and they were able to distribute them as they saw fit within state supplied guidance. Some counties stated they received the wrong needles/syringes. The shipped needle size was too large for the general population. The extra long needles (2\" and greater) as well as the large needle gauge (23 G and greater) were not helpful and increased costs. SNS respirator kits did not come with qualitative fit testing kits. Those were very difficult to get early in the pandemic. There were band-aids that were no longer sticky (too old and/or stored improperly) and masks that were not the sizes for which staff had been fit tested. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 45 OREGON Some felt that OHPD was not timely in distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) and that PPE should be distributed based upon where it will produce the most benefit. There should also be consistent standards of using PPE because organizations practicing a far higher standard (e.g., frequently changing gloves) would burn through PPE and create localized shortages when all organizations should be conserving a scarce resource. One metropolitan jurisdiction policy was to use fresh gloves for vaccinating each patient. That was more stringent than the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OR-OSHA) standard. The distribution plan for vaccine or antivirals with contractor support was activated after most of the H1N1 activity decreased. In addition, local agencies had difficulty requesting a State cache or SNS supplies through their emergency operations center (EOC). If the local agencies were requesting supplies not on a pre-determined plan, the request would come back denied and the local agency was required to resubmit the request with the State's pre-determined amounts. Also, there was confusion of what the pre-determined asset requests were and how those assets should be requested. Recommendations: 1. Build local caches for emergency medical supplies and equipment 2. Review/revise procedures to ensure clear guidelines on what and how to request medical assets to local agencies 3. Include future planning between local emergency management, healthcare facilities, and public health for requesting resources 4. Develop and test state process for rapidly finalizing large contracts with national distribution companies, e.g. for medial supplies and antivirals 5. Review/revise procedures to ensure that processes are in place to use professional distributors or delivery and storage of SNS or other government assets Observation 2.2 (Area for Improvement): Survey respondents had varying beliefs about the success of the immunization program. Analysis: The majority of survey respondents stated that the immunization program was well organized and had effective communications. The Immunization / Vaccine Distribution group was responsive to questions and concerns; they took the time to find missing vaccine orders. Conference calls were timely and appropriate. Others commented positively on the logistics process by the SNS Program for taking Tamiflu and personal protective equipment orders. The Portland metropolitan counties had the ability to work in their Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) region due to prior Cities Readiness Initiative (CRI) planning. They had the authority to allocate vaccine regionally to physicians' offices, clinics, and hospitals. They also had regional supply ordering capabilities Hospital respondents stated mixed results on the success. Depending on the county of hospital some did well, some did not. If the hospital was in a community that had coordinated preparedness activities (with emergency management, hospital, Health Preparedness Program After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 46 OREGON [HPP], and/or public health) they did better. They stated a need for better coordination between hospitals and Public Health (PH) in vaccination distribution planning. Some hospitals did mass vaccination clinics, while others relied on PH to provide. Some counties gave more H1N1 vaccine than seasonal flu vaccine and thought the process was very successful A small number of respondents felt that allocation and oversight needed improvement. There was no assurance that the vaccine was administered and not stockpiled. Many felt there was no clear direction on prioritization before adequate vaccine was available\u2014especially for first line responders. Because there was not a State declaration of emergency some clinics and hospitals did not want to provide vaccine to persons that were not their patients. Healthcare groups in general were not considered priority groups and hospital staff were frustrated that they were not able to get vaccine. Special needs populations had very high risk groups, such as pediatric cardiac patients and immunocompromised patients. OPHD, SPD, and pediatricians from many communities worked together to encourage priority vaccination of such individuals in their homes, and distributed this guidance to public health nurses and other providers serving this population. However, the perception from hot wash respondents was that most of these high-risk special needs patients had to wait in line with everyone else. Many respondents felt that hospital staff and healthcare workers in general, should have had vaccine available to them. Not all hospitals had vaccine to give to staff. For example, one large healthcare system's employees got vaccine, but not all medical staff that practice in those hospitals were employees so many were not eligible to receive vaccine. This fostered a feeling of discrimination and anger. Few doctor clinics were given vaccine. Their staff and patients also had to stand in line with the general public whether they were ill or healthy. This made many nervous about contracting the virus from the vaccination clinics. Physicians have identified their high risk patients\u2014this was talked about extensively in prior planning\u2014and it was in the plans to have these children as a priority, but they felt these plans were not followed by the state. They felt that State Public Health leadership took too long to establish priority groups and then those priorities changed mid-stream. These medically fragile children had to stand in the same line as everyone else, and those who were immune compromised were at risk for other infections. Standing in line did not guarantee that they would get the vaccine; when the vaccine ran out many were sent away to stand in another line on another day. This caused complaints from parents who were very frustrated. The majority of respondents stated there was not enough vaccine at the time it was needed, and the priority groups were so limited that few of the general public that wanted the vaccine were able to obtain it. Now there is vaccine left over, but after the frustrations of the first few months many feel that the public has become cynical and no one wants it during this recovery phase. One respondent stated it was impossible to get vaccine for Oregon's Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) members, since they were not on the priority list for vaccine. The Oregon DMAT could have been sent as assistance to locals/State as a State resource, knowing that other States used their DMATs successfully while using Federal dollars to pay for it. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 47 OREGON Recommendations: 1. OPHD should review/revise immunization program procedures and protocols to ensure prioritization, ordering, distribution, and oversight are included and clear 2. OPHD and SPD should work with public health nurses and clinicians of children at highest risk of flu complications/death to facilitate in-home vaccination Observation 2.3 (Strength): Overall respondents were satisfied with local health agency response for vaccine. Analysis: Survey respondents had favorable responses to five questions regarding H1N1 vaccine: Questions Total Responses Agree Strongly Agree I was satisfied with the level of responsiveness from the local public health agency for my requests for H1N1 vaccine. 46 18 17 The process for requesting H1N1 vaccine from the local public health agency was easy to understand. 46 21 13 The process for requesting H1N1 vaccine from the local public health agency was well communicated. 50 21 18 Changes to the process for requesting H1N1 vaccine were clearly communicated. 47 19 16 The process for requesting vaccine from the local public health agency improved throughout the response. 47 27 12 Different communities utilized various groups, including volunteers, to assist with vaccination clinics. Student nurses\u2014healthcare related roles, community emergency response teams (CERT)\u2014traffic control, local American Red Cross chapters\u2014food at the points of distribution, and a fire department\u2014tents and personnel for a freeway clinic (on Interstate-84 [I-84]) were some of the creative ways in which groups assisted with the clinics. Long-haul truck drivers were asked to spread the work via radio and face-to-face about the freeway clinic on I-84. One pharmacy in southwestern Oregon has a contract with foster homes and disabled adult facilities to provide vaccinations. Some smaller counties brought in retirees to handle the paperwork shuffle. Other sources, such as churches, were not widely utilized. Recommendation: 1. Based on lessons learned and best practices review/revise pandemic flu plans to refine the vaccination clinic process Observation 2.4 (Area for Improvement): The Vaccine Tracker System has limited utility and usefulness for local providers. Analysis: The registration process for H1N1 providers was very taxing. Providers had to register with both the county and also with the State. The process for providers to get listed on After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 48 OREGON the H1N1 vaccine tracker took days to weeks. Information about the number of doses delivered to providers in their county was timely, but administration data was frequently delayed. This made it difficult to obtain clear or reliable data about actual target population coverage. Some counties had no data at all about this before priority criteria were changed. Some reported getting information from local health departments versus looking at the database. Other problems associated with the vaccine tracker were that doses entered into the Alert column were rarely updated. Approved providers took weeks to show up in the Tracker. It was suggested local jurisdictions would register new providers on the tracker rather than having to submit the list to the State and then wait for the state to update the tracker. Some respondents stated the database was developed late in the response and was inadequately resourced and supported. They felt, in retrospect, the database became a barrier because there was few OPHD staff trained to use it. Recommendation: 1. Identify appropriate leadership and end-users and establish a work group to discuss solutions for vaccine tracker issues Observation 2.5 (Area for Improvement): The 100-dose minimum allotment request for vaccine was not appropriate and did not meet the needs of some jurisdictions. Analysis: The 100 dose per capita distribution was not completely understood, especially by the public. When the State was questioned about the policy or asked to clarify the responses were limited and the public information was almost non-existent\u2014possibly due to inadequate staffing by the State for these tasks. For the hospitals it was not an issue, however, for the LHD it was an issue when they only received one or 2 vials in the beginning. The decision had to be made on who would receive the vaccine, and they had many small sites in the county come to the LHD to pick up vaccine in amounts under 100 which created more work for the limited personal at the LHD. It put a burden on LHD to redistribute. In come cases, it would have been helpful for both LHD and the site to have had the vaccine shipped directly to them. Many counties reported that vaccine was sitting at the State, while LHD did not have all direct patient care workers vaccinated and could have done that if more vaccine was released. Less populated counties would order the 100 doses and redistribute it with other local providers as another measure. This system worked well in getting vaccine to physician clinics. If they had no plans to split the doses, the more rural areas had to wait until allocation reached 100 before receiving vaccine, making it easier to get higher population-based areas vaccinated sooner, but leaving the rural areas feeling that they were not as important to protect. Some private providers' allocation information did not get back to the State until February and After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 2 - ANALYSIS OF RESPONSE 49 OREGON then it was still unclear what they had done with the vaccine\u2014was it used or stockpiled. LHDs had to use a different system for H1N1 rather then the \"normal\" system creating what appeared to be an unnecessary learning curve. Many did not understand why the records needed to show dose for dose data; it created more work. The various regions did not know what their partners were doing with the vaccine allocations. It was beneficial when the State decided that public health entities should retain 30% of the vaccine. But this was not in the original plan\u2014fortunately it was decided fairly soon before entities had less than 30% still available. There was frustration throughout the school districts that had designated schools to be vaccination clinics. The biggest issue centered on the ever changing dates of clinics and amounts of doses they would be receiving. Each time there were changes the schools had to reschedule clinics, thus disrupting school and community events. A clinic associated with a Portland-area hospital followed protocol by ordering vaccine through the hospital. The hospital decided to keep the vaccine rather than forward to the requesting clinic in their system and it was an additional 10 days before the clinic received the vaccine for their patients. Similar distribution errors occurred with some of the counties' orders\u2014vaccine was shipped to the wrong county and was not corrected until the county contacted the State to inquire about the status of the order. Survey Monkey respondents were mixed in their response regarding whether OPHD's vaccine allocation method (population based) was appropriate. Twenty-nine respondents indicated it was appropriate while 11 respondents selected \"no\". Since Oregon State Hospital received a special allotment a respondent questioned how many other similar situations existed. Another respondent questioned if State institutions really are special. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in Roseburg received distribution for VA and other Federal employees through one distribution / allocation plan and the patients through another which meant two different reporting processes including forms. And then the VA distributed the patient vaccine across county lines. If the 100-dose minimum is a continued practice, some rural areas will not receive enough vaccine. The process did not consider the number of cases in a region, just population; this should be considered no matter the county's population. Healthcare workers and responders should not have to compete with the public for the same vaccine. Recommendations: 1. Review/revise vaccine and antiviral requesting and distribution system to allow flexibility in dose minimum to consider smaller population bases 2. Consider sharing of resources between counties After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response CHAPTER 3 - CONCLUSION 50 OREGON CHAPTER 3: CONCLUSION The Oregon (OR) 2009 Fall H1N1 Response was a real time response to the worldwide outbreak of H1N1. Although the number of confirmed cases in Oregon remained low, the OR 2009 Fall H1N1 Response provided a unique real world assessment of the current State and local pandemic influenza response plans and capabilities. This was the first time State and local responders had implemented the Pandemic Influenza Plan during a real time response. During the response, agencies demonstrated flexibility in their operations by adapting to the frequent changes in the scope and severity of the H1N1 virus and subsequent changes to federal guidance. During and after the response, changes needed in the Pandemic Influenza Plan were identified and revisions are on-going. As stated earlier, Oregon activated the full capabilities of the State's public health response forces to address the event. The four primary areas of focus, namely providing treatment and prophylaxis, managing medical supplies and assets, providing accurate information for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and providing accurate, timely information for all stakeholders and the general public, remained consistent throughout the event. The information received during the after response review process highlighted strengths and areas for improvement in these four primary areas. Using the Target Capabilities List (TCL) this report aligns observations to their associated capability in the TCL to provide a road map to build on strengths, enhance identified areas for improvement, and build required capabilities. Based on the AAR findings the Improvement Plan focuses on areas to improve the State's capabilities to respond overall. Clarification of roles and responsibilities, improving communications protocols, integrating planning elements into multi-agency planning teams, conducting training including National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command System (ICS), organizational structures, communication channels, WebEOC, OPS Center, Hospital Capacity (HOSCAP) and other supporting communications tools, and cross- training for as many individuals as possible at all levels of the response are all areas that will allow stakeholders to build on the strengths of the response to ensure a more robust statewide posture for future public health events.

Response APPENDIX B: OPHD NOVEL H1N1 PLANNING JUNE 2009 APPENDIX B: OPHD NOVEL H1N1 PLANNING ASSUMPTIONS JUNE 2009 29 June 2009 Overarching Goals \u00bb Reduce mortality and morbidity (protect citizens) \u00bb Ensure continuity of state and local government agencies to provide essential services \u00bb Sustain critical infrastructure and key resources \u00bb Mitigate the economic impact of a pandemic Planning Assumptions* \u00bb Overall estimated attack rate may be as high as 35%, ranging from 20% among working adults to 40% among school-aged children; \u00bb Of those who become ill, up to 50% will seek medical care; \u00bb Based on current data (1 June 2009), children and young adults and those with compromised immune systems are likely to be at higher risk; \u00bb Incubation period will be 1-7 days (most likely 1-4); \u00bb People who become ill may shed virus for up to one day prior and 7 days after onset of symptoms; children may shed for longer periods; \u00bb Individual outbreak \"waves\" will last up to twelve weeks, separated by weeks to months over a period of up to 18 months; \u00bb Outbreaks will occur throughout the US, limiting the potential for mutual aid; \u00bb Virulence of the virus is unpredictable, and could range from that of seasonal influenza (as with the outbreak seen spring 2009) to CDC Severity Level 5 (case fatality ratio >2.0%); \u00bb Even if virulence is similar to seasonal influenza, the number of hospitalizations and deaths will be greater than seasonal influenza because of susceptibility of the population; \u00bb Based on information in late May, vaccine for the Novel H1N1 virus is predicted to be available in mid to late fall 2009, and will require 2 doses at least 21 days apart; \u00bb Although Novel H1N1 is currently (1 June 2009) susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, but there is no guarantee of their effectiveness against the strain in the future; \u00bb Novel H1N1 is resistant to the adamantane antiviral medications amantadine and rimantidine; \u00bb Antiviral medications will not be available for widespread prophylaxis; \u00bb In general, antiviral medications will be used for treatment, and depending upon the severity of the pandemic, may be used for limited post-exposure prophylaxis for those at high risk for complications and very rarely may be used in other settings for prophylaxis; \u00bb Early targeted use of non-pharmaceutical measures (e.g., social distancing) to control disease spread is an important mitigation strategy and would be considered if there is evidence of increased severity from novel H1N1 infection in the coming months; \u00bb Data regarding numbers of persons with severe illness will be needed to guide public health decision making; \u00bb Continuity of operations planning is essential for state and local government and private businesses to maintain essential services and critical infrastructure during a pandemic; \u00bb Worker absenteeism could reach 40%; \u00bb Coordinated public communications will be essential to promote effective use of mitigation strategies (e.g., vaccine, antivirals and non-pharmaceutical interventions) among members of the public. *Note: Theses assumptions will be updated as we receive new information on the situation After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009

CMS is in the process of providing more details on the process for a hospital to request some legal requirements be waived that could otherwise limit its ability to respond to the H1N1 pandemic. CMS plans to have formal guidance available by the end of the week, but below are a few items from the conference call we felt were important for you to know now. 1) CMS wants to be directly notified of all waivers, so when a hospital requests a waiver through the process described in the HAN alert Oct 29, 2009, in addition to sending it to the state through Ops Center, a copy should also be sent by fax or e-mail to one of the contacts listed below at the CMS Regional Office. 2) CMS may at its discretion decide to issue blanket waivers for a region or a health system. However, this will be at the initiation of CMS - not by outside requests. Waiver requests should be for an individual facility and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 3) No anticipatory waivers will be approved. A facility must be experiencing a situation that actually requires a waiver of regulations and should not be based on speculation of what the future may bring. 4) Waivers may only be granted if the jurisdiction where the hospital is located has activated its emergency preparedness plan for the H1N1 pandemic. Since Oregon has activated its plan statewide, this should not present any barriers. Additional information can be found on the following website: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/H1N1/ Any questions regarding the 1135 waiver process should be directed to Ron Prinslow, Manager, Health Care Licensure & Certification (the State Agency) at 971-673-0540.

These recommendations are based on: 1. The extent (number and location) of confirmed or probable cases in Oregon. 2. The severity of disease in the United States. Current Recommendations: Everyone should pay special attention to hygiene inc luding, frequent hand washing, covering their cough, disposing of contaminated tissues, etc. Individuals with acute febrile respiratory illness s tay home for 7 days after the start of illness and fever is gone ( isolation ). Well people exposed to those with probable or confir med H1N1 (Swine Flu) should avoid close contact with others as much as possible. Individuals with concerns regarding illness or trave l should consult their medical provider, local health department or call the Oregon Public Health Division Swine Flu Hotline at 1- 800-978-3040. Additional Community Mitigation Measures for Schools: Dismissal of students will be considered in schools with confirmed cases. Decision to dismiss classes will be made based upon the extent and severity of disease in the local area by the local health department in consultation with school officials and the Oregon Public Health Division. If the school dismisses students or if a childcare f acility closes, they will also cancel all school- or childcare-related gatherings and encourage parents and students to avoid congregating outside of the school. (Note: The CDC defines \"childcare facilities\" as centers and facilities that provide care to children in a nonresidential setting or family childcare homes that provide care for children in the home of the provider.) Schools and childcare facilities will dismiss studen ts for a period of time to be determined depending upon extent and severity of illness. Schools and childcare facilities in unaffected areas should review their contingency plans in the event that there is a future need for closure in their jurisdiction. \"Assisting People to Become Independent, Healthy and Safe\" An Equal Opportunity Employer After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX E: COMMUNITY MITIGATION E-2 OREGON Additional Community Mitigation Measures for Childcare settings The CDC defines \"childcare facilities\" as centers an d facilities that provide care to children in a nonresidential setting or family childcare homes that provide care for children in the home of the provider. As young children are at particular risk of complica tions from influenza, closure will be strongly considered if there is a single confirmed or probable case of H1N1 (Swine Flu). If the school dismisses students or if a childcare f acility closes, they will also cancel all childcare-related gatherings and encourage parents and students to avoid congregating outside of the school. The facility will remain closed for seven days after the onset of the case's symptoms and the fever has ended. Home Care Guidelines of a Person with H1N1 (Swine Flu) in the Home The ill person should be kept away from others in th e home as much as possible (for example, in a separate bedroom with a separate bathroom). In addition, if possible, only one adult in the home should take care of the ill person (pregnant women should not care for ill persons). Persons in home isolation and their household member s should wash hands frequently with soap and water (or use alcohol-based hand gels containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty). The ill person should not have visitors other than c aregivers. Household Cleaning, Laundry, and Waste Disposal Throw away tissues and other disposable items used b y the sick person in the trash. Wash your hands after touching used tissues and similar waste. Keep surfaces (especially bedside tables, surfaces i n the bathroom, and toys for children) clean by wiping them down with a household disinfectant according to directions on the product label. Linens, eating utensils, and dishes belonging to tho se who are sick do not need to be cleaned separately, but importantly these items should not be shared without washing thoroughly first. Wash linens (such as bed sheets and towels) by using household laundry soap and tumble dry on a hot setting. Avoid \"hugging\" laundry prior to washing it to prevent contaminating yourself. Clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub right after handling dirty laundry. Eating utensils should be washed either in a dishwas her or by hand with water and soap.

Two conditions must be met for the Secretary to be able to issue such \"1135 waivers\": first, the Secretary must have declared a Public Health Emergency; second, the President must have declared a National Emergency either through a Stafford Act Declaration or National Emergencies act Declaration. If these conditions are met, then healthcare facilities may petition for 1135 waivers in response to particular needs, and only within the geographic and temporal limits of the emergency declarations. Under Section 1135: The Secretary may tailor authorities granted under Section 1135 waivers to match the specific situational needs, but the requirements that may be waived include those related to Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). These requirements provide important protections for patients during normal day-to-day operations, but they may impede the ability of healthcare facilities to fully implement disaster operations plans that enable appropriate care during emergencies. For example, requirements under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) would prohibit hospitals from certain rapid triage or sorting activities and prevent the establishment of off-site, alternate care facilities that could off-load emergency department demand. Waivers are permitted only to the extent they ensure that sufficient health care items and services are available to meet the needs of Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP beneficiaries in the emergency area during the emergency period. The \"emergency area\" and the \"emergency period\" are the geographic area, in which, and the time period, during which, the dual declarations exist. Permitted actions include the waiver or modification of conditions of participation, other certification requirements, program participation requirements, pre-approval requirements for health care providers; waiver of sanctions for certain directions or relocations and transfers that otherwise would violate the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA); waiver of sanctions related to Stark self-referral prohibitions; modifications to deadlines and timetables for the performance of required activities; and waiver of sanctions and penalties arising from noncompliance with certain Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy regulations. Examples of use of waivers: Hospitals request to set up an alternative screening location for patients away from the hospital's main campus (requiring waiver of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act-EMTALA) Hospitals request to facilitate transfer of patients between ERs and inpatient wards between hospitals (requiring waiver of both EMTALA and HIPAA regulations) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX H: PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY H-2 OREGON DECLARATION Critical Access Hospitals requesting waiver of 42 CFR 485.620, which requires a 25-bed limit and average patient stays less than 96 hours Skilled Nursing Facilities requesting a waiver of 42 CFR 483.5, which requires CMS approval prior to increasing the number of certified beds in a distinct part Past instances where authority to grant Section 1135 waivers was enabled for recent disaster events include Hurricane Katrina (2005) 56th Presidential Inauguration (2009) Hurricanes Ike and Gustav (2008) North Dakota flooding (2009) Q: Why do this now; why can't we wait until a hospital or region needs these 1135 Waivers? A: The H1N1 epidemic is moving rapidly. By the time regions or healthcare systems recognize they are becoming overburdened, they need to implement disaster plans quickly. 1135 Waivers still require specific requests be submitted to HHS and processed, and some State laws may need to be addressed as well. Adding a potential delay while waiting for a National Emergency Declaration is not in the best interest of the public, particularly if this step can be done proactively as the President has done today. Q: Has the authority to grant 1135 waivers been granted before? A: Yes, there are several instances where 1135 Waiver authority has been granted under the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (vice National Emergencies Act) to help healthcare facilities cope with large patient burdens. Recent examples include Hurricane Katrina (2005), Hurricanes Ike and Gustav (2008), and the North Dakota flooding (2009). In addition, 1135 waiver authority has been granted previously as a precautionary measure, as in the case of the recent 56th Presidential Inauguration (2009). Q: Specifically, what will this NEA Declaration enable and what will this allow hospitals to do, if a waiver is requested and granted? A: An NEA Declaration fulfills the second of the two conditions required for the Secretary of HHS to be able to grant 1135 waivers. If requested, and HHS grants an 1135 waiver, healthcare facilities will be able to utilize alternate care sites, modified patient triage protocols, patient transfer procedures, and other actions that occur when they fully implement disaster operations plans. Q: Is the HIPAA Privacy Rule suspended during a national or public health emergency? A (from the HHS Office of Civil Rights website): No; however, the Secretary of HHS may waive certain provisions of the Rule under the Project Bioshield Act of 2004 (PL 108-276) and section 1135(b)(7) of the Social Security Act. What provisions may be waived If the President declares an emergency or disaster and the Secretary declares a public health emergency, the Secretary may waive sanctions and penalties against a covered hospital that does not comply with certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule: 1. the requirements to obtain a patient's agreement to speak with family members or friends involved in the patient's care (45 CFR 164.510(b)) 2. the requirement to honor a request to opt out of the facility directory (45 CFR 164.510(a)) 3. the requirement to distribute a notice of privacy practices (45 CFR 164.520) 4. the patient's right to request privacy restrictions (45 CFR 164.522(a)) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX H: PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY H-3 OREGON DECLARATION 5. the patient's right to request confidential communications (45 CFR 164.522(b)) When and to what entities does the waiver apply If the Secretary issues such a waiver, it only applies: 1. In the emergency area and for the emergency period identified in the public health emergency declaration. 2. To hospitals that have instituted a disaster protocol. The waiver would apply to all patients at such hospitals. 3. For up to 72 hours from the time the hospital implements its disaster protocol. When the Presidential or Secretarial declaration terminates, a hospital must then comply with all the requirements of the Privacy Rule for any patient still under its care, even if 72 hours has not elapsed since implementation of its disaster protocol. Regardless of the activation of an emergency waiver, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits disclosures for treatment purposes and certain disclosures to disaster relief organizations. For instance, the Privacy Rule allows covered entities to share patient information with the American Red Cross so it can notify family members of the patient's location. See 45 CFR 164.510(b)(4).

After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Executive Summary 5 O regon EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Th is after-action report evaluates the activities of Oregon's Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) Program in receiving, inventorying, distributing, and storing pandemic influenza assets during the second wave of pandemic H1N1 influenza. The observations and recommendations in this report are based principally on two SNS debriefings; one with Oregon Immunization Program (OIP) staff and the second with SNS partners from other agencies. SNS response activities were initiated on the morning of September 14th with an email n otification of nationwide shortages being reported of Tamiflu oral suspension due to the reemergence of pandemic H1N1 influenza. The SNS program made inquiries to the Division of the Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) as to the possibility of requesting Oregon's remaining 25% allocation of Tamiflu oral suspension. On September 29th, the SNS program began a series o f SNS partner conference calls to coordinate shipment and receipt of the medication if it was distributed. The Oregon SNS Program received three deliveries of DSNS assets. On October 1st a n email notification from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) DSNS informed the SNS program that the CDC was preparing to ship remaining allocations of Tamiflu oral suspension as a result of the reemergence of H1N1 and the limited market availability of the medication. The Oregon SNS program received the medication on October 8th. On October 27th, t he CDC also distributed Oregon's remaining allocation of N95 masks in response to the pandemic and limited market availability. On November 6th, the CDC shipped Oregon its r emaining allocation of Tamiflu oral suspension. The Oregon Public Health Division (OPHD) made the decision to receive the assets, which set in motion the two major logistical actions that are evaluated in this report. The Oregon Immunization Program, which is responsible for the SNS, and the Oregon Agency Operations Center oversaw these actions. The first was the receipt and storage of Oregon's federal allocation of Tamiflu oral suspension, and N95 masks, and the second was the distribution of OPHD's allocation of the Tamiflu oral suspension and personal protective equipment (PPE) to those counties, tribes, and state agencies that requested it. The N95 masks continue to be stored in Oregon's backup receipt stage storage (RSS) site as immediately following their distribution to Oregon, the market availability of N95 masks regained momentum. The Oregon SNS response was successful because of the dedication, expertise, and professionalism of SNS partners and it is to them that this after-action report is dedicated. These agencies include the Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP), the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), the Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC), and the Oregon State Police (OSP). Broader Public Health Response The SNS response took place within the context of a broader public health response during which the OPHD agency operations center (AOC) was operational from September 8, 2009 through January 20, 2010. After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Executive Summary 6 O regon Overriding Objective, Activities and Critical Tasks The overriding objective for the SNS H1N1 response was to effectively and efficiently oversee the receipt, distribution, and storage of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. As such, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) target capability, Medical Supplies Management and Distribution, forms the foundation of this evaluation under the mission Response . The activities and critical tasks examined in this report and associated with this target capability are listed below: Ac tivity 1.0: Develop and Maintain Plans, Procedures, Programs, and Systems DHS Definition: none provided 1. 1 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 1.1.1) In coordination with the appropriate agencies, d evelop processes for ensuring the distribution of medical supplies Activity 2.0: Direct Medical Supplies Management and Distribution T actical Operations DHS Definition: In response to a need for medical assets, provide ov erall management and coordination for Medical Supplies Management and Distribution 2. 1 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 3.1) Provide medical supply management and distribution s upport to incident response operations according to Incident Management Team (IMT) assignments in the incident action plan (IAP) Activity 3.0: Activate Medical Supplies Management and Distributio n DH S Definition: Upon identification of medical resource shortfalls an d/or SNS deployment, activate warehousing operations 3. 1 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 4.2) Activate warehousing operations for rec eipt of medical assets Activity 4.0: Repackage and Distribute DHS Definition: After delivery of medical assets to warehouse facilit y, repackage pharmaceuticals and other assets and distribute to Points of Distribution (PODs) and other health facilities. 4.1 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 6.3) Inventory medical supplies warehouse resource levels 4 .2 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 6.2) Assemble medical supplies warehouse teams 4 .3 Critical Task: (Rec.C1c 6.6) Distribute medical supplies to PODs, he alth facilities, and shelters After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Executive Summary 7 O regon Activity 5.0: Demobilize Medical Supplies Management and Distributi on DHS Definition: Inventory, reorganize, and reconstitute stockpiles to return to pre- incident levels, and release personnel from Medical Supplies Management and Distribution duties. 5 .1 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 8.1) Execute plan to reduce medical supplies warehouse operations, as distribution needs ease The purpose of this report is four-fold: to analyze the response; to identify strengths to be maintained and built upon; to identify potential areas for further improvement; and to pursue corrective actions. Presented below is a brief overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the SNS response. Corrective actions will be initiated using the Improvement Plan template in Appendix A of this report. M ajor Strengths The major strengths identified during the SNS Response to wave two of the H1N1 pandemic w ere: Communications between SNS partners went smoothly and the response benefited from t he flexibility of the SNS plan and its partners. OIP and the AOC showed unity, support, flexibility, and efficiency in responding to l ocal agency requests for assets. OIP updated the SNS planning elements for ordering state assets and coordinated d istribution of updated guidance related to use of state supplied assets. OIP staff responded quickly and efficiently to orders, including visits to the backup R SS and the PSOB for pick pack. Use of the communication systems HAN and OpsCenter to coordinate resource r equests of state supplied pandemic influenza assets. Ordering resource request troubleshooting and training of AOC logistics team, c ounties, tribal health centers, and area hospitals. Bidirectional use of email to successfully communicate updates and changes among S NS partners. Communications with the CDC's DSNS team room were excellent; this team room is a ttached to CDC's Department Emergency Operations Center (DEOC). OIP staff had 24/7 access to program consultants who were prompt in responding to messages and requests for information. After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Executive Summary 8 O regon Primary Areas for Improvement During the response, a number of opportunities for improving the SNS program's capabilities w ere identified. The primary areas are as follows: The decision by the State Public Health Director not t o distribute the federal assets to local jurisdictions and the lack of contingency plans for the short- and long-term storage of assets resulted in an inefficiency during the SNS response. Contingency contracts for asset storage and distribution should be in place before a pandemic response. The SNS Plan should be built upon a tiered response t hat reflects the range of situations in which pharmaceuticals and medical supplies might be distributed throughout the state, including tiers of RSS response. Resource request ordering process through OpsCenter c an be streamlined to be more 'user friendly.' Recommend an increase in training of local agencies; i ncluding counties, tribes, state residential agencies, and area hospitals on ESF 8 resource request order form.

A separate OPHD AOC after-action report covers the time period during which the OPHD AOC was operational and evaluates other response activities such as public information, epidemiological surveillance and investigation, and laboratory testing is still in process. Activation The DSNS directed the manning of the DSNS Team Room to support H1N1 shipments and activities. This DSNS Team Room operation supported the CDC EOC in H1N1 response operations and related matters. Additionally, the DSNS Team Room was staffed to support states with regional desks as we did in the initial deployment of assets. The operations section regional point of contact for H1N1 actions in Region X was Dr. Ed Murdock. The operations section of the DSNS Team was not only activated to support the CDC EOC, but to also consolidate H1N1 information, requests and reporting requirements. SNS response activities were initiated on the morning of September 14th with an email n otification of nationwide shortages being reported of Tamiflu oral suspension due to the reemergence of pandemic H1N1 influenza. The SNS program made inquiries to the DSNS as to the possibility of requesting Oregon's remaining 25% allocation of Tamiflu oral suspension. On September 29th, the SNS Program began a series of SNS Partner conference calls to coordinate s hipment and receipt of the medication if it was distributed. On October 1st an email notification f rom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) DSNS informed the SNS program that the CDC was preparing to ship to States their remaining allocation of Tamiflu oral suspension as a result of the reemergence of H1N1 and the limited market availability of the medication. The SNS Program received the medication on October 8th and another allocation on N ovember 6th. The CDC also distributed Oregon's remaining allocation of N95 masks in r esponse to the pandemic and little to no market availability. OPHD made the decision to receive the assets, which set in motion the two major logistical actions that are evaluated in this report. The Oregon Immunization Program, which is responsible for the SNS Program, and the Oregon Agency Operations Center, oversaw these actions. The first was the receipt and storage of Oregon's federal allocation of Tamiflu Suspension, and N95 masks, and the second was the distribution of OPHD's allocation of the Tamiflu Suspension and personal protective equipment to those counties, tribes, and state agencies who requested it. The SNS Program and its partners began preparations to receive the assets at the Portland State Office Building (PSOB) backup RSS site. Weekly conference calls were held to provide updates about the incident and to coordinate activities. Daily meetings in the AOC occurred which included finalizing the Incident Command Structure (ICS) for RSS activities, addressing staffing, and other logistical needs. During this time, the SNS Program and its partners also began to develop contingency plans for short- and long-term storage of the federal assets given the following three factors: 1) the pending decision as to whether the materiel would be pushed out to local jurisdictions; 2) the assessment that the primary RSS was a soft security target for short-term storage; and 3) the need to locate a climate-controlled, secured location for the antiviral medication that were to be After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Section 2: Response Summary 1 4 Oregon received. A secure, climate-controlled short-term location was the PSOB backup RSS site. A long-term term storage location belonging to the Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC) was also identified. SNS Shipments from DSNS On October 1, the SNS Program received an email from CDC DSNS about release of Oregon's remaining allocation of Tamiflu oral suspension. On October 6, the decision was made to receive Oregon's allocation. A general ETA was given of about a week for delivery. On October 7, the DSNS provided the SNS program with a FedEx tracking number for the antiviral medication en route. The PSOB backup RSS site was made ready to receive the shipment. The SNS program received the shipment of Tamiflu oral suspension without incident on October 8, 2009 at approximately 9:57am. The SNS program received 201 cases, 2 and one quarter pallets, or 3,618 bottles. On November 6th at 10:00am, the SNS program received 164 cases, 2 pallets, o r 2,952 bottles of Tamiflu oral suspension without incident. In late October, the SNS Program was asked if it would like to receive Oregon's remaining allocation of N95 masks. The decision was made to accept it. On October 27, the DSNS shipped Oregon its remaining allocation of N95 masks. The DSNS had communicated to the SNS Coordinator that the PPE trucks could be tracked, and tracking numbers were sent. In a follow up email, the DSNS noted that the tracking numbers were incorrect, therefore there was no way to track the trucks. Also, what was sent included an over shipment of N95 masks. Initially the CDC requested that they be sent back. Following a series of phone calls, the CDC allowed Oregon to keep the over shipment. The lack of tracking numbers and inaccurate inventory counts created some inefficiencies in SNS management. Receiving Inventory Once DSNS shipments were received, a physical inventory was completed at each receiving site. OIP staff developed an allocation spreadsheet in the event that the SNS assets would be pushed out to local agencies, including local health departments, tribal health centers, and state residential institutions. Storing the SNS Assets The SNS assets were stored at the ODOC and the PSOB. The antiviral medication sent during the first wave of H1N1, combined with the medication sent during the second wave, were stored at PSOB and at a secure pharmaceutical warehouse. During the second wave, a contract was signed to have a portion of the state antiviral assets stored with a major pharmaceutical distributor, who would also take orders and deliver the assets if approved by the SNS Program. Due to temperature control concerns, the remaining medication stored at PSOB was moved in Spring, 2010 to another secure pharmaceutical warehouse. After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Section 2: Response Summary 1 5 Oregon Statewide Distribution of SNS Assets The decision was made to distribute the assets statewide to provide local agencies with a re- supply as there was a shortage of the Tamiflu oral suspension and N95 masks in the market supply. OIP staff developed a population-based algorithm for allocating the cache equitably among 36 counties, 11 tribes and three state residential institutions (Oregon Youth Authority, the State Hospital, and the Oregon Department of Corrections). Earlier in the week, in anticipation of sending out the SNS assets to the local level, OIP staff had also begun to work with the local agencies on identifying ship-to-sites. This process was completed and SNS-supplied antiviral medication and PPE were available to local agencies upon request. All distributors of state- supplied antiviral medications were required to electronically sign a provider agreement and provide an active email address for listserv notification. Guidance for use, distribution, and reporting were distributed through email, HAN posting, OPHD website posting, and the antiviral provider listserv. Response Capabilities and Activities C apabilities-based planning allows responders to evaluate outcomes through a framework of specific action items that are derived from the DHS Target Capabilities List (TCL). The mission and target capability, Response: Medical Supplies Management and Distribution, best capture the overriding objective for the SNS H1N1 response, which was to effectively and efficiently oversee the receipt, distribution, and storage of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. This target capability, along with its associated activities and critical tasks, form the foundation for the evaluation of the SNS H1N1 response. Activity 1.0: Develop and Maintain Plans, Procedures, Programs, an d Systems DHS Definition: none provided 1. 1 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 1.1.1) In coordination with the appropriate agencies, d evelop processes for ensuring the distribution of medical supplies Activity 2.0: Direct Medical Supplies Management and Distribution T actical Operations DHS Definition: In response to a need for medical assets, provide ov erall management and coordination for Medical Supplies Management and Distribution 2. 1 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 3.1) Provide medical supply management and distribution s upport to incident response operations according to Incident Management Team (IMT) assignments in the incident action plan (IAP) After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Section 2: Response Summary 1 6 Oregon Activity 3.0: Activate Medical Supplies Management and Distribution DH S Definition: Upon identification of medical resource shortfalls an d/or SNS deployment, activate warehousing operations 3. 1 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 4.2) Activate warehousing operations for rec eipt of medical assets Activity 4.0: Repackage and Distribute DHS Definition: After delivery of medical assets to warehouse facili t y, repackage pharmaceuticals and other assets and distribute to Points of Distribution (PODs) and other health facilities. 4.1 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 6.3) Inventory medical supplies warehouse resource levels 4 .2 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 6.2) Assemble medical supplies warehouse teams 4 .3 Critical Task: (Rec.C1c 6.6) Distribute medical supplies to Points o f Distribution (POD), health facilities, and shelters Activity 5.0: Demobilize Medical Supplies Management and Distributi on DHS Definition: Inventory, reorganize, and reconstitute stockpiles to return to pre- incident levels, and release personnel from Medical Supplies Management and Distribution duties. 5 .1 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 8.1) Execute plan to reduce medical supplie s warehouse operations as distribution needs ease The next section of this report analyzes how well the SNS Program and its partners met the standards of these capabilities and activities. The observations and recommendations in this report are based principally on two SNS debriefings; one with OIP staff and the second with SNS partners from ODOT, ODOC, SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Section 3: Analysis of Capabilities 17 Or egon SECTION 3: ANALYSIS OF CAPABILITIES This section of the report reviews the performance of the SNS Program and its partners on c ritical tasks that fall under the DHS capability Medical Supplies Management and Distribution . Presented here are the observations from the debriefings, which are grouped under Strengths and Areas Needing Improvement. Under each critical task, there is also a listing of relevant references, an analysis of the observations, and recommendations for addressing any weaknesses. Mi ssion: Respond Ca pability: Medical Supplies Management and Distribution Ac tivity 1.0: Develop and Maintain Plans, Procedures, Programs, and Systems 1.1 Critical Task: (Res.C1c 1.1.1) In coordination with the appropriate agencies, develop processes for ensuring t he distribution of medical supplies Strengths Observation 1: The SNS Plan and the Oregon Immunization Program's (OIP) business continuity procedures provided the flexible structure needed to effectively respond to unanticipated circumstances surrounding the response. OIP staff appreciated how smoothly the Immunization Program continued to function despite the additional response workload. Observation 2: Although the main RSS site did not stand up, members of all RSS teams had the opportunity to contribute to the SNS response and provided SNS and AOC staffing coverage as needed. Areas for Improvement Observation 1: The need to store assets on a long-term basis was not a planning assumption in the OPHD Pandemic Influenza Plan and, therefore, procedures were not in place to do so. Staff scrambled to come up with solutions but the process felt inefficient and likely strained partner relationships. Observation 2: The SNS plan would benefit from outlining response actions within tiers (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3). These tiers could be defined in a matrix of, for example, medical timeliness by demand/interest in the assets. Partners could determine the tier during the initial briefing. Use of these tiers should avoid spinning up resources too fast. Observation 3: The SNS Plan should focus more on natural events such as pandemics and earthquakes and less around remote incidents such as bioterrorism attacks. Observation 4: Additional trained backups are needed for the SNS and Ship-to-Site Coordinator positions. Observation 5: Short- and long-term storage plans, including the procurement of an RSS with temperature control, are required in the event that assets are not pushed out to local agencies. After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Section 3: Analysis of Capabilities 18 Or egon Observation 6: The original SNS Plan (and Pandemic Influenza Plan), in which assets are delivered to multiple sites in a county, is not realistic. New plans need to be drawn up in which counties identify one ship-to-site at which assets can be received. References: 1) OPHD SNS Plan 2) OPHD Pandemic Influenza Plan Analysis: The OIP was efficient with regard to staffing and job duties as a result of having developed and tested the SNS Plan and business continuity procedures in the past, however the multiple job duties assigned to OIP needs retooling. The need for long-term storage of assets had not been a planning assumption in the OPHD Pandemic Influenza Plan. In addition, current SNS procedures are too focused on dramatic yet low-likelihood situations such as a bioterrorist attack. Recommendations: 1) At the beginning of an incident, subject matter experts should brief decision-makers, who may be unfamiliar with the content of various response plans, on critical assumptions and significant decision-making points within those plans. 2) Incorporate a tiered response model in the Concept of Operations section of the SNS Plan 3) Review the Pandemic Influenza Plan for any planning assumptions around medical supplies management that may require contingency plans. 4) Review the plan to use OIP staff as the main RSS staff, possibly in conjunction with procurement of an additional RSS site whose staff may be available to work the emergency. Ac tivity 2.0: Direct Medical Supplies Management and Distribution T actical Operations Definition: In response to a need for medical assets, provide ov erall management and coordination for Medical Supplies Management and Distribution Cr itical Task 2.1: (Res.C1c 3.1) Provide medical supply management and distribution support to incident r esponse operations according to Incident Management Team (IMT) assignments in the incident action plan (IAP) Strengths Observation 1: OIP staff reported that they were given clear instructions on what their specific roles were, what they need to do, and when they need to do it. Observation 2: HAN worked very well for alerting OIP staff and SNS partners. HAN drills and subscriptions to folders were beneficial in this regard. Observation 3: Regular updates for OIP staff involved in the response were appreciated. After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Section 3: Analysis of Capabilities 19 Or egon Observation 4: SNS partners found the weekly briefings to be very beneficial. Observation 5: IT Unit personnel were very helpful with OpsCenter and computer issues in the AOC. Observation 6: The OIP pan flu asset allocation spreadsheets worked very well. Observation 7: Communications with the DSNS Team Room was excellent. The SNS Coordinator was able to talk with a program consultant 24/7 and these consultants followed up on messages and requests in a timely fashion. Areas for Improvement Observation 1: Although it is beneficial to have the SNS Coordinator or Ship-to-site Coordinator located in the AOC for coordination purposes, the AOC is a physically and emotionally taxing environment to work in for more than a couple of hours. Additional staff should be trained to backup the Coordinators so that they may take a break. In addition, more team members should be assigned to Logistics, as it seemed to be the busiest section during the event. Observation 2: The SNS team should monitor only the SNS proxy email address. It is not realistic to have the SNS team also monitor the email for the AOC Logistics Branch. Observation 3: It would benefit state actions if the DSNS Team Room worked with its carriers on improving the \"visibility\" of trucks that are en route. Observation 4: It would be beneficial to have electronic inventory with the DSNS shipped assets instead of a paper copy of the inventory for ease of uploading purposes. Observation 5: OpsCenter and the ESF 8 Resource request form were difficult to manage because the OEM never fully activated. References: 1) Job action sheets for SNS Coordinator, Ship-to-Site Coordinator, AOC Logistics Chief Analysis: Although the SNS program now has a solid tactical foundation in place, the program would benefit from additional fine-tuning in this area. Recommendations: 1) Develop procedures to ensure adequate SNS staffing in the AOC during an event. 2) Design and conduct a tabletop and functional exercise to work out coordination and communication issues within the Logistics Unit regarding SNS activities. 3) Conduct a workshop with Logistics personnel and then a training of local agencies in order to streamline the PPE/Antiviral ordering process through the ESF 8 Resource Request form and OpsCenter. 4) Provide feedback to CDC DSNS Program consultant regarding the need for truck visibility. After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Section 3: Analysis of Capabilities 20 Or egon Activity 3.0: Activate Medical Supplies Management and Distribution De finition: Upon identification of medical resource shortfalls an d/or SNS deployment, activate warehousing operations Cr itical Task 3.1: (Res.C1c 4.2) Activate warehousing operations for rec eipt of medical assets Strengths Observation 1: PSOB worked well as a backup RSS site for receiving and distributing single-item (e.g., antivirals) shipments. Observation 2: ODOC worked well as a backup RSS site for receiving and distributing PPE shipments. Areas for Improvement Observation 1: Issues around RSS site selection need to be resolved. These include: 1) Having site options that can accommodate various storage and security needs; 2) Selecting one site at the beginning of a response and sticking with it unless there are significant extenuating circumstances; 3) Determining whether the Clackamas ODOT compound, or other identified sites, should serve as the primary RSS site instead of the Salem RSS 4) Reinforcing the fact that Oregon National Guard RSS sites are backup sites only; 5) Establishing one primary RSS site with multiple, possibly regional RSS sites strategically located around the state. References: 1) SNS Plan - Tabs on RSS sites Analysis: The flexibility of the SNS partners and the adaptability of the current SNS plan resulted in the successful movement and temporary storage of the assets. However, finding the time to identify, create plans for, and exercise backup RSS sites has been a challenge for the SNS Program and this weakness was apparent during the H1N1 response. Recommendations: 1) Hold a meeting with SNS partners to discuss next steps in the identification, plan development and exercising of backup RSS site locations. 2) Connect with the SNS List Serv on ideas for RSS site locations. 3) Develop an SNS presentation and identify areas to present using Chamber of Commerce and other methods in the hopes of finding backup RSS sites. After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Section 3: Analysis of Capabilities 21 Or egon Critical Task 3.2: (Res.C1c 6.2) Assemble medical supplies warehouse teams S trengths Observation 1: The OIP staff selected for inventory also have other jobs to do in the event of a pandemic influenza when vaccine is also available, although having a fairly large pool of people to draw from within OIP was very beneficial to the response. Areas for Improvement Observation 1: Emphasize in SNS Plan that ODOT staff have the skills to support OIP staff in managing materiel. Use ODOT to add depth to the inventory teams and manage the more difficult tasks of reconfiguring and stacking pallets, etc. Observation 2: Although OIP has three teams of people to draw from for staffing, many of these individuals still require training or are very busy during a pandemic where vaccine distribution is their primary concern. References: 1) SNS Plan - Tab on staffing Analysis: While staffing for inventory activities is fairly robust, OIP staff require additional hands-on training and possibly some alternatives. Also, OIP and ODOT staff would benefit from functional exercises on inventory control procedures to learn about each others strengths and to build strong teams for RSS activities. Recommendations: 1) Hold functional RSS exercises to train 2nd and 3rd teams. 2 ) Identify additional RSS staff outside of OIP that may be able to help in a pandemic influenza situation. Ac tivity 4.0: Repackage and Distribute Definition: After delivery of medical assets to warehouse facilit y, repackage pharmaceuticals and other assets and distribute to Points of Distribution (PODs) and other health facilities.

Observation 2: LHDs, tribes and designated state agencies reported their ship-to-sites to the state in a timely fashion. Areas for Improvement Observation 1: The inventory information (e.g., multiple spreadsheets, pan flu asset guidance) provided by the CDC was difficult to read. Column headers were vague and abbreviated, and poor information was provided on how items were packaged (e.g., a single glove versus a pair of gloves), quantity per unit, etc. Observation 2: The materiel had to be inventoried by hand to reconcile what was received with what CDC said it would send. References: 1) SNS Plan - Inventory Control SOP Analysis: Although the inventory of the DSNS shipments were difficult to decipher on occasion, overall the deliveries went as planned with no incidents. Recommendations: 1) Procure an inventory management system that will assist OIP with the inventory and management of SNS assets. 2) Provide CDC with feedback on the inventory sheets received. Activity 5.0: Demobilize Medical Supplies Management and Distribut i on Definition: Inventory, reorganize, and reconstitute stockpiles to return to pre-incident levels, and release personnel from Medical Supplies Management and Distribution duties. C ritical Task 5.1: (Res.C1c 8.1) Execute plan to reduce medical supplies warehouse operations as distribution needs ease Strengths Observation 1: None mentioned Areas for Improvement Observation 1: RSS Documentation Team procedures for managing paperwork and electronic files as a part of demobilization procedures lack depth due to limited practical experience with the topic. Observation 2: Procurement of an inventory management system will help with the process of demobilization. References: 1) Demobilization sections of SNS job action sheets (JAS) 2) Documentation Team JAS After Action Report/Improvement Plan SNS H1N1 Response FOUO Section 3: Analysis of Capabilities 23 Or egon Analysis: Current demobilization procedures do not adequately address, for example, what paperwork and/or electronic files should be saved, where these items should be stored, how response documents should be summarized, and how the demobilization should be managed. Recommendations: 1) Determine whether a standard operating procedure (SOP) on demobilization should be created or if the Documentation Team JAS just needs to be revised to address the limitations noted above. 2) Develop and execute a tabletop exercise specific to SNS demobilization procedures. 3) Procure an Inventory management system that will assist in management of state assets. SECTION 4: CONCLUSION The SNS Program and its partners successfully met the overriding objective for this mission, w hich was to effectively and efficiently oversee the receipt, distribution and storage of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies within the state. This success was due in large part to the flexibility of the SNS Plan and that of the dedicated personnel who carried out the work. Despite the challenges encountered, the SNS partners communicated well with each other, and when obstacles were identified or concerns were raised, they came up with workable solutions. As with any response, weaknesses or planning gaps ar e inevitably revealed. The most significant of these arose when delayed decisions about the distribution of assets intersected with the lack of contingency planning for short- and long-term storage of the medical materiel. Without a doubt, however, the benefits of having participated in this response far outweigh any of its negative aspects. The SNS Program now understands that it has a solid foundation in its plan, and that this plan can be strengthened and built upon. Individuals also recognize the value of participating in drills and exercises to gain greater comfort and confidence in carrying out procedures. The experience of this response has made previously abstract concepts concrete, and the SNS Program is better for it.

After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-2 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Introduction Oregonians rely on multiple local, state, and federal health departments during a widespread health emergency, to work together to promote safety and prevention practices, suppress the spread of infection or contamination, coordinate and announce treatment options and locations, and evacuate communities if necessary. Considering the complexity and often emotionally-charged nature of these tasks, communication coordination between partners is key to success before, during and after a public health emergency. From a communications perspective, the Fall 2009 H1N1 pandemic response was an effective collaboration, despite significant challenges: a new Public Health Communications Officer without prior emergency preparedness experience or training; the retirement of the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Communications Officer early in the event; patient group prioritization categories that caused confusion; inconsistent messaging; and a vaccine shortage that left many Oregonians frustrated. These challenges have provided the Oregon Public Health Division (OPHD) with opportunities to improve communications tactics to better serve our partners and our communities. This study represents an effort on OPHD's part to reach out to local communications professionals and find ways to me more helpful and responsive during a public health emergency. Shortly after deactivating the State H1N1 Agency Operations Center, OPHD began this study for recommendations to review the following inter-governmental communication issues identified during conversations and conference calls with Public Information Officers (PIOs) across Oregon: 1. Every local and tribal health department has different capacities for communication. For example, some suburban counties have their own dedicated, full time communications staff. In rural and frontier counties, communications responsibilities may make up only one of several duties filled by a program manager, administrative assistant or public health director. As a result, communications planning After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-3 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT competes with other priorities, leaving the quality of communications or alignment of messaging with OPHD during an emergency vulnerable. Problem statement: How can OPHD make communications easier for small local communications teams, while also meeting the needs of larger communications departments in urban and suburban communities? 2. Community based organizations (CBOs) such as neighborhood business associations, centers for independent living, faith based institutions, nonprofits serving the homeless or low income households - can be effective partners in distributing public health messaging, particularly to special populations. However, not every local health department has had the opportunity to form strong partnerships with CBOs, often because they lack the time or resources. Problem statement : How can OPHD help local health departments develop partnerships with community-based organizations, when help is needed and requested? 3. OPHD Communications occasionally received feedback from local health department staff that interagency communication was fragmented or delayed. Some found it confusing to locate a central point of contact in OPHD to discuss communications issues with, or did not receive responses. These perceptions lead to an erosion of trust and confidence in OPHD from some local health departments. Problem statement: How can OPHD simplify and enhance the quality of interagency communications networking, and enhance teamwork with local health departments? After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-4 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Recommendations The following recommendations highlight the perspectives OPHD heard during the survey and interview process in May and June of 2010. These recommendations target the most pressing questions and problems raised. In order to ensure that these general recommendations represent the perspectives OPHD gathered from local PIOs, the researcher e-mailed the first drafts of them to 34 informants for review. Nine returned suggestions for slight changes, but felt overall that they hit the mark. The raw data from their review appears as Appendix ? of this report. 1. OPHD Communications should provide a single point of contact for communications issues during a public health emergency. That contact should proactively provide their contact information to communications officers in county and tribal health offices before the next emergency. Rationale : Several respondents indicated that they were unsure who at OPHD Communications and Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) they should talk to during the Fall H1N1 pandemic. Navigating the OPHD bureaucracy can be frustrating and time consuming, and tracking down the correct contact person can be difficult (especially during an emergency, when time is at a premium). Many other respondents found no trouble navigating the bureaucracy, and found OPHD communications officers very helpful. However, other informants did not find OPHD always responsive when they attempted to reach lead communications officers during the fall months. It is possible that revisiting how well OPHD used the JIC e-mail system and making corrections could resolve the issue. 2. During a public health emergency, PHEP and OPHD should consider combining the different teleconferences/meetings (such as for immunization, emergency preparedness, and communications) into a single, joint teleconference with a scheduled agenda. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-5 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Rationale : PHEP organized a number of different teleconferences in addition to the regular AOC briefings (for example, different teleconferences each for immunization, communications, and emergency preparedness) during the H1N1 pandemic. Because staff in most rural and frontier counties take on several different roles during an emergency (and during regular operations), it became challenging to attend the many different meetings; and when they did, they found much of the information redundant. A better way forward may be to plan for a single meeting with scheduled \"time certains\" for each area of interest. Under this system, a PIO would know when to join the communications segment of a conference, and would have the option of staying for other parts. A PIO who also serves as a vaccine coordinator would need to plan on attending one meeting instead of two, with less chance of redundant information. 3. A routine, voluntarily attended statewide public health PIO teleconference would give county and tribal communications professionals an opportunity to network and establish working relationships. Rationale : The great majority of respondents indicated an interest in better opportunities to network for purposes of professional development, sharing best practices, and interagency relationships (which would help participants work together more efficiently and effectively). However, many also pointed out that such meetings work best if highly structured and if they took place infrequently (quarterly was often suggested). The meetings could include presentations (or webinars) on communications strategies from different communications professionals, brief trainings, \"fishbowl\" discussions on communications topics, etc. The calls would also correspond to an electronic, opt-in health communications newsletter that would recap each teleconference. The e-mail list for this newsletter or bulletin would also serve to keep the roster of PIOs with OPHD up-to-date. At its current state, OPHD does not have the capacity to undertake this recommendation. In order to implement, OPHD would either need to increase staff, or consider the idea of hosting quarterly teleconferences \"on rotation\" from local health department to local health department. 4. OPHD, including PHEP, should develop a communications \"toolkit\" to help local and tribal health departments quickly develop consistent messaging during a public health emergency. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-6 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Rationale : A communications \"toolkit\" would reduce the time it takes health departments to develop their own materials and messaging and to help ensure communicators deliver consistent messaging. Several respondents noted that materials from the state were well designed, but would have been more helpful if available in a format they could themselves modify so as to include local information where appropriate. A toolkit would include templates and boilerplate messaging, \"tweets\" for Twitter accounts, files of printable materials and brochures, graphics, ad templates in multiple languages, outreach and communication strategy information, media relations guides, and more - all from a single online location (see the NACCHO toolkit for a proposed model: http://www.naccho.org/advocacy/marketing/toolkit/ind ex.cfm ). Ideally, HAN could host a c ommunications toolkit with the changes to HAN OPHD is working on at the time of this writing. 5. Some local health departments would benefit from assistance developing outreach plans to special populations. Rationale : Most respondents felt comfortable in their outreach efforts to special populations, but some indicated that it was a gap in their communications strategy and would be interested in assistance developing an outreach plan to special populations. Sample outreach plans could be included in the \"communications toolkit\" discussed in recommendation number four (above). OPHD should request the assistance of Multicultural Health and Diversity to develop plans if they have the capacity to do so. 6. OPHD should continue to offer the media relations training, and expand it to include social media. Rationale : Respondents found the media relations training helpful. Though many respondents have taken it, they expressed interest in a refresher, or wanted some of their staff to take the training. While existing state staff time and funding is limited, local public health departments expressed an interest if training is available in the future. Furthermore, many respondents would like training in social media (such as Twitter and Facebook) and other web-based communication technologies (such as Skype). Sharing information on training opportunities would be an option to help provide this to staff at tribal and local health departments. 7. Share information in a timely manner. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-7 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Rationale : PIOs have reported that they received information from other sources long before receiving it from the JIC/JIS. The state could consider process improvements to move messaging, news releases and other information from the state to LHD communications staff more quickly. After requesting feedback on the recommendations, OPHD asked respondents to rank each of the recommendations in terms of importance. With nine responses, informants ranked as follows (note that four recommendations tied): 1. Combined teleconferencing (one meeting for all subject areas during public health emergency); 2. Communications toolkit 2. Routine statewide PIO conference call ; 2. Media relations and social media training; 2. Share information in a more timely manner; 3. Single point of communication at PHEP; 4. Outreach plans to special populations. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-8 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Methodology OPHD undertook research for these issues in three steps. First, OPHD Communications crafted a survey to gather input on from local health department communications professionals who worked with OPHD and PHEP during the H1N1 pandemic, or other health emergencies. OPHD designed the survey with input from PIOs at Multnomah and Umatilla counties. OPHD then contacted at least one person who functions in a communications capacity from each tribe and county (and more than one in larger jurisdictions). In all, OPHD contacted 44 local health departments, and received responses back from 35 (this includes five of eight tribal offices contacted). In some instances, more than one PIO from an LHD responded. A total of 45 individuals responded to the survey. After the first round of surveys, follow-up interviews took place with one respondent from each of the 35 offices responding. Interview questions were designed to further understand tribal and local health department needs, and to follow up on survey responses that warranted further discussion. Finally, general recommendations were drawn from the survey and interview responses, then forwarded to respondents for review. The refined recommendations appear in the following section. The appendices of this report include the survey and interview questions. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-9 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Survey/Interview Questions and Findings This section presents questions asked in the initial survey or interview, the question's rationale and general findings. This data produced the more general recommendations on page X. The questions are divided into three sections: about the respondent, the respondent's communication team/department, and the H1N1 response. The total response rate is included for each question. 45 respondents answered survey questions, while 35 also participated in one-on-one follow-up interviews. The maximum response rates differ between interview and survey questions. Several of the survey questions were asked during the interview to \"flesh out\" answers where more detail was needed. The first set of questions identified the respondents, the level of participation in the survey and the level of each respondent's professional development and networking. The survey had a high response rate. Of the 44 offices contacted for feedback (one for each county and tribe), a 34 of took the survey (77% response rate), and also participated in a follow-up interview. In addition, another eleven respondents took the survey, for a total of 45 respondents. Five of eight tribal offices took part. The typical survey and interview respondent has a high level of training and personal experience with emergencies (H1N1 and other events). Many of them have received some kind of formal training, though rates of NIMS and CERC training are relatively low (37% and 23%, respectively). The typical respondent also is not just the communications lead for their health office. Many respondents, particularly in rural and frontier counties, wear multiple \"hats\" and have other important (and sometimes competing) priorities. Communications networks inside health jurisdictions are generally very strong across the board: most respondents reported regular interaction with local schools, hospitals and community based organizations (CBOs). While local health offices are strongly networked with CBOs, OPHD should work closely with local health Section A analysis After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-10 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT offices to broadcast public health messaging through CBO networks. The majority of rural and frontier respondents reported a low frequency of intergovernmental networking between PIOs; usually, they collaborate only during an emergency. Regular collaboration between health PIOs is more common in urban and suburban communities, and respondents from those offices consistently rate established networks very highly (such as UASI). Finally, there were conflicting impressions about regular contact with OPHD PIOs. Many reported frustration with navigating the State's bureaucracy and could not locate (or could only after a lot of trouble) a consistent point of contact. There were also reports of that locating a point of contact was not challenging, but that OPHD was not always responsive. Finally, many gave high praise for OPHD communications staff for their accessibility and responsiveness. In the second set of questions, communications capacities and resources were explored. Almost half of the respondents (44.4%) do not have a secure backup plan for PIO responsibilities (when asked if they have a backup for their PIO responsibilities, most answered \"sometimes\"). This is an important issue for OPHD to be aware of, considering that many PIOs in rural areas (which make up the majority of Oregon administrations) and frontier areas often have more than communications responsibilities to tend to in an emergency. Though PIOs are generally well trained, experienced, and feel confident working with their local media, backup PIOs in rural and frontier areas often have less experience and training. Further media and crisis risk communications training for backup PIOs could be considered. LHDs put their local CBO networks and relationships with other government offices to good use reaching special populations, and have also arrived at creative methods for distributing public health messages. Social media is commonly used in higher density areas and in tribal areas. Many respondents would like training on social media for communications. The survey addressed the quality of translations available to health offices. Most offices need material translated in Spanish, with some suburban and urban offices needing Russian, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Korean. The opinion of respondents when discussing the speed and quality of Spanish translations varied widely, but the most positive ratings came from offices that have someone on staff who speaks Spanish. Section B analysis After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-11 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Most of all, local health offices and tribes would like modifiable templates: graphics, press release templates, brochures and posters. Many respondents expressed frustration with OPHD because the material they received could not be modified to include locally relevant information. The final section of questions was designed to gather more details about the resources that health departments need during an emergency. It also explores the impressions LHDs and tribes have of OHPD's communications team and their work. Local health departments rely on OPHD as their primary source of information during a public health emergency. But respondents felt frustrated with OPHD because information arrived sporadically or not soon enough. Sometimes a message would be obsolete by the time PIOs received it. Many smaller offices talked about their need for more communications staff during a public health emergency. There are some resources the state could provide to make communications efforts more efficient for local public health. For example, a communications toolkit with modifiable templates, outreach plans, and graphics would allow them to respond faster. Most respondents, though not all, are also interested in more opportunities to network. Conversations in interviews suggested that an optional, quarterly statewide PIO call for health PIOs could foster professional relationships and professional development. Questions also targeted perceptions of two important OPHD resources during the H1N1 Fall pandemic: the Oregon Flu Hotline and the Health Alert Network (HAN). Two thirds of the respondents said that they promoted the Hotline only \"sometimes\" or \"not at all\". When probed in interviews, they elaborated by saying that the Hotline did not begin operations soon enough, and/or that their constituents insisted on speaking with local staff instead of a centralized State hotline. For these reasons, local offices sometimes started their own hotlines. OPHD should revisit this feedback when planning future hotlines. Opinions on HAN were sharply divided. Roughly half of the respondents rated HAN highly and thought of it as a great resource. The other half felt that HAN was not user friendly and so difficult to navigate that they could not use it to find information. Section C analysis After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-12 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Section A: Questions about the respondent 1.) Introductory questions: name, e-mail, phone numb er Survey question Rationale Basic \"vital data\" questions to help identify participants and contact them for follow-up interviews. These questions also encouraged respondents to identify other communications professionals who might have important feedback for OPHD. Findings Contact information is kept confidential and not provided here, as agreed to through survey statement. Seven respondents provided referrals to other PIOs for follow-up surveying. 45 respondents (100%) 2.) What jurisdiction do you represent? Survey question Rationale Track which jurisdictions participated, how many individuals from each participated and verify that the proportion of tribal offices participating. Findings Twelve respondents (27%) represented an office with more than one survey respondent (for example, two representatives from Marion County answered the survey). Five of eight tribal offices participated. 45 respondents (100%) 3.) What is your title/position in your organization? Survey and interview question Rationale Assess whether the primary points for communications during H1N1 in each office were primarily or exclusively PIOs. Findings The job titles of fifteen respondents (33%) indicated communications responsibilities of some kind - e.g. public information officer, public educator or outreach specialist. Of that group, the titles of ten connoted communications responsibilities exclusively , while the remaining five acted as communications specialists in addition to other responsibilities (program coordinator, emergency management director, paramedic, etc). Of the 30 respondents who did not have communications responsibilities included in their titles, seven were public health directors or administrators for their jurisdiction, and three were assistant directors. Seven respondents supervised their own division or program (such as environmental health or emergency preparedness). Among other respondents, job titles varied widely, though all worked in some health or emergency preparedness field. 45 respondents (100%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-13 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 5.) Have you ever worked in a communications capacity during an emergency or crisis? If yes, was it during the H1N1 pandemic or during a different emergency? Survey question Rationale Gauge the level of experience in responding to emergencies among public communication contacts at local health departments. Findings 39 (87%) answered \"yes\", 13% answered \"no\". Of \"yes\" respondents, 28 indicated they worked during the H1N1 pandemic, but most respondents named many other events as well (most frequently: inclement weather, other disease outbreaks and chemical spills). 45 respondents (100%) 4.) What communications or public information responsibilities do you have (e.g. are you a PIO, do you write press releases only, act as a spokesperson when needed? Survey question Rationale To verify that respondents had common or similar understandings of communications responsibilities, and to ensure that questions asked during the interview had relevance to the respondents' duties. Findings Most respondents write press releases or act as the department's health spokesperson and media relations contact. A few respondents also develop printed materials, use social networking or develop web pages. Only one respondent mentioned direct public outreach, though other survey/interview questions (see xx) indicated that many respondents work through community based organizations to spread public health messages. 45 respondents (100%) 6.) Have you taken any communications training in the past and if so, what was it and did you find it helpful? Survey question Rationale Assess the level of formal training PIOs have received, and particularly the frequency of ICS/NIMS and CERC training. Findings Four respondents (13%) reported having had no communication training (conventional or emergency). Eleven respondents (37%) have NIMS communications certifications, and seven (23%) completed the CDC'ss CERC training. Respondents described CERC training as most helpful. Other training discussed: OPHD's media relations training, military PIO training, and academic communications training. 45 respondents (100%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-14 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 7.) Do you have regular contact with other PIOs in the State or with State Public Health communications? Interview question Rationale Indication of the level of networking that takes place between communications professionals at the state and local levels. Findings Generally, rural and frontier counties do not have regular contact with other local or tribal PIOs, or OPHD PIOs. However, they do often have strong networks with PIOs in local schools, hospitals, public safety agencies and other organizations. Many of them also had an established relationship with the former PHEP Communications Officer before her retirement. After the departure of the PHEP Communications Officer, respondents frequently reported that they rarely correspond with OPHD Communications because they do not know who to talk to (though they may frequently correspond with their PHEP liaison). Most tribal PIOs have regular interaction with the communications staff at the nearest county. They rarely talk directly with OPHD Communications officers. PIOs in urban counties and nearby suburban counties generally reported regular communications with OPHD PIOs, and with each other. Many urban/suburban counties have established regional communications caucuses that meet (or teleconference) in emergency situations - such as the Portland Urban Area Strategic Initiative (UASI), which includes Clackamas, Multnomah, Clark, Washington, and Columbia counties. 30 respondents (86%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-15 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Section B: Questions about the respondent's communic ations team/department 8.) Would you describe your jurisdiction as: urban, suburban, rural, or frontier? Survey question Rationale Different \"types\" of jurisdictions have different communications issues, problems and Rural: 60% Urban: avoid skewing the results, this report counted a total of 37 respondents - one from each participating health office - as 100%. 9.) How many people, including yourself, have communications responsibilities in your office/department? Survey question Rationale Build perspective on the level of support the respondent has for communications responsibilities in his/her office. Findings Average staff, according to jurisdiction type: Urban: 4 Suburban: 2.5 Rural: 3 Frontier: 2 44 respondents (98%) 10.) Do you have a backup for your PIO or communications responsibilities? Survey question Rationale Measure the frequency of backup plans between local and tribal health offices (a designated PIO with multiple responsibilities may have to pass on his/her communications duties if s/he has higher response priorities during an emergency). Findings Yes: 55.6% No: 11.1% Sometimes: 33.3% 45 respondents (100%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-16 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 11.) What is your backup or contingency plan if you are not available to act as PIO? Interview question Rationale Probing for trends in backup plans, and indications of the level of training and experience backup PIOs have. Findings In rural and frontier offices, respondents typically replied that the health administrator is the backup PIO, or if the administrator is already the lead PIO, the responsibility falls to one of the RNs working in the office. Often, but not always, designated backups have little experience and formal communications training. In urban, suburban, and larger rural counties, contingency plans often designate backup PIOs from other programs in the health office or administration. These backup PIOs generally have extensive training and experience. Finally, information about backup communications plans did not consistently appear in PE-12 reports for the counties, or in the Health Alert Network's document library. 31 respondents (89%) 12.) Can you describe for me the process for how you develop information for public release? For example, can you step me through the process of how you produce a press release? Interview question Rationale Identify potential areas of communications assistance and potential bottlenecks during a crisis emergency communications scenario. Findings Respondents reported similar, straightforward processes. In the event of a public health emergency, communications officers begin by researching the issue with the CDC or OPHD, and local subject matter experts if appropriate. The PIO then crafts material from a template and adds relevant local information. In most cases, PIOs have sole discretion to forward the release to their distribution lists. Occasionally, the material would need the final approval of a higher authority (such as the health administrator, or county board or tribal council), and/or the administration's legal department. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-17 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 14.) Do you assess the effectiveness of your communications? Do you ever do message testing or evaluation? Interview question Rationale To learn if tribal or LHDs have the capacity to do message testing or evaluation work. Findings With one exception, no respondent reported undertaking or commissioning formal evaluation. Many reported monitoring constituent feedback and using that to adjust messages. 15 responders (43%) 13.) How do you distribute public information or news once it is ready for release? Do you send it to local print media only, or do you also use television and radio, or other venues? Interview question Rationale Detect trends in distribution methods and media markets most common to the different jurisdiction types. Findings All respondents distribute releases to local papers, and some have The Oregonian included in their e-mail distribution list. Almost all departments distribute through their county or tribal websites. Television and radio stations typically appear on distribution lists, but not universally. In some rural and frontier areas, PIOs also distribute to local cable and satellite networks. Distribution to faith-based organizations appeared less commonly. Social media use is only common in urban, high-density suburban, and many tribal areas. Six rural/frontier counties reported that they still use the blast fax system, though they have little to no capacity keeping their fax lists up-to-date. A few respondents also reported other methods of distribution information. For example, Cow Creek sometimes uses paycheck inserts. Other methods discussed: community reader boards, grocery bulletin boards, and \"snowball\" e-mail distribution (distributing e-mail through personal networks). 31 responders (89%) 15.) Are you comfortable or do you feel proficient interacting with your local media market? Rationale Determine how comfortable communications staff feel working with local media. Findings Yes - 32 (71.1%) No - 1 (2.2%) Somewhat - 12 (26.7%) 45 responders (100%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-18 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 16.) Do you distribute information through (check all that apply): County/tribe/district website; Other subscription lists; Media distribution lists/resources; Other. Survey question 45 responders (100%) Rationale Understanding the distribution channels used by LHDs and tribes, and identify possible gaps in communication strategies, will help OPHD develop tools that respond more precisely to the needs of PIOs. Findings Legend indicates total respondents for each type of jurisdiction represented. Some methods listed as \"Other\" included: direct outreach and community presentations, county-wide mailouts, flyers, and blast faxes. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-19 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 17.) How do you reach special populations? For the purposes of this report, special populations are defined as: Groups whose needs are not fully addressed by traditional service providers or who feel they cannot comfortably or safely access and use the standard resources offered in disaster preparedness, relief, and recovery. These groups include, but are not limited to, those who are physically or mentally disabled (blind, deaf, hard-of-hearing, cognitive disorders, mobility limitations), limited or non-English speaking, geographically or culturally isolated, medically or chemically dependent, homeless, frail/elderly, and children. Survey question Rationale Identify best practices reaching special populations. Findings Most health departments have some plan for reaching special populations. The majority of administrations either partner with community-based organizations working directly with special populations (service providers like meals on wheels, churches, homeless service providers, etc), and through government special needs case workers. Though rare, some LHDs have created registries of people with special needs set up, which they mobilize to deliver health information and services. In smaller communities, particularly in tribes, communications personnel know where people with special needs reside and can reach out to them directly. 43 responders (96%) 18.) Are you working with community organizations to distribute information (such as churches, chambers of commerce, etc)? If yes, which? Interview question Rationale Assess how actively LHDs tap into community resources to distribute information. Findings All county health departments have some level of cooperation with community based organizations and other private entities: daycares, hospitals, faith based organizations and churches, chambers of commerce, rotary clubs, and organizations serving low-income households and the homeless. Counties also spread information through other government organizations that have frequent public contact, particularly: schools and public safety offices. Tribes generally have social resource networks established through the tribal administration, and do not usually have the non- governmental CBO networks found in counties. 28 responders (80%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-20 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 20.) What languages do you typically need materials translated into? Survey question Rationale Evaluate priorities for language translation. Findings 37 (82%) answered \"Spanish\" exclusively. Five replied \"Spanish\" in addition to the following other languages, ranked by need: Russian, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Korean. Respondents did not specify which Chinese or Vietnamese dialects. 45 responders (100%) 19.) Do you have experience interacting with ethnic media markets? Interview question Rationale Determine LHD interaction with diverse media. Findings Ten respondents replied that they have no non-English media market inside their jurisdiction. In rural and frontier areas with a Latino media market (most often a radio station, occasionally print media), respondents confirmed that they include those media outlets in their distribution lists. Morrow County, because of the munitions disposal site, has an established relationship with Univision (Spanish television). No rural or frontier offices identified local media markets other than Spanish-language ones. In urban and suburban communities, PIOs also have relationships with media catering to Russian and Southeast Asian communities. 25 responders (38%) 21.) How do you feel about your organization's capacity to get materials translated (speed and quality)? Survey question Rationale Assess the capacity of LHDs and tribes to translate, or have translated, communications materials into needed languages. Findings Evaluating both speed and quality, answers varied widely. It usually depended on whether or not the department had (or had access to) a Spanish speaking staff member. Most respondents (67%) rated their capacity to receive Spanish translated materials favorably or moderately. Getting materials translated in languages other than Spanish generally (though not always) seemed difficult or frustrating for respondents. 44 responders (98%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-21 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 22.) Are there communications trainings the State could offer that you would find helpful? What would you like to see offered in the future? Examples: media relations training, social media training, etc. Survey question Rationale Hear directly from LHDs and tribes what trainings they would find most helpful. Findings Respondents made the following suggestions: 5. Social media training: 16 (40%) 6. Media relations training: 15 (38%) 7. Crisis and risk communication: 3 (8%) 8. Communication with special populations: 2 (5%) 9. None: 4 (10%) 40 responders (89%) 23.) Besides training, are there other ways the State can support your communications efforts? Survey and interview question Rationale Learn other ways OPHD can provide communications support not suggested in the survey and interview. Findings Several trends emerged from this open-ended question: PIOs would like modifiable templates for fact sheets and other communications materials (several complained that it was frustrating to receive materials from the State they could not modify themselves, for their own needs); Many respondents indicated translation assistance of some kind; often for materials, but one respondent requested phone translation services; In interviews, several respondents talked about struggling with the State's Health Alert Network (HAN) and making it more user friendly. Several PIOs talked about the frustration they felt when the State released information publicly with no prior notification to LHDs and tribes; therefore, they recommend a system to notify local PIOs of media releases ahead of their release. 35 responders, (78%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-22 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Section C: Questions about the H1N1 response 24.) What were your primary sources of information a bout H1N1 during the 2009 outbreak? Survey question 45 responders (100%) Rationale Determine primary sources of information during H1N1. Findings Findings appear in the table below. Respondents had the choice of more than one option. Answer Options Response Percent Response Count State AOC Briefings, CDC or WHO 77.8% 35 Oregon Health Alert (HAN) updates 71.1% 32 Colleagues 60.0% 27 Internet 57.8% 26 National Media 48.9% 22 Supervisor 22.2% 10 Local Media 20.0% 9 Social Media 11.1% 5 Subordinate 8.9% 4 Other (please specify) 17 Answers to \"Other\" included local/regional PIO networks (either inside the jurisdiction with community organizations and other government, or intergovernmental). After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-23 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 25.) What would you have preferred be your primary source of information about H1N1 during the 2009 outbreak, whether an existing source or one that could be used in the future? Survey question Rationale Assess preferred source of information during an emergency. Findings 56% of the respondents indicated the State is their first choice, or their first choice along with the CDC. Other choices included the CDC alone, WHO, and NACCHO. Where regional PIO networks are established, they are also a preferred source. Some respondents expressed frustration with the State when answering this question, replying that information came too slow or it seemed to come from too many, fragmented State sources. 38 responders (84%) 26.) Do you feel your public information team received timely communications information from the State of Oregon during the H1N1 response: yes, no, sometimes? Survey and interview question Rationale Measure perceptions of OPHD's expedience in communication. Findings Yes: 20 Sometimes: 20 (46.5%) 43 responders (95.5%) 27.) Overall, did you feel you had the information you needed in order to communicate effectively with your constituents about H1N1: yes, no, sometimes? If no, what information would have helped? Survey and interview question Rationale Determine if PIOs feel they had as much information as they needed during the H1N1 response. Findings Yes: 25 (55.6%) No: 1 (2.2%) Sometimes: 19 (42.2%) Twelve respondents made suggestions to make OPHD more helpful. Generally, they felt the State was not keeping up with changes in the information quickly enough to keep LHDs sufficiently informed, and this must be addressed. They also noted some information from the State as \"contradictory\" - sometimes contradictory with other information released by the State, sometimes contradictory with information available through the CDC. During interviews, respondents who answered \"sometimes\" also talked about whether they found the State less helpful during the Spring or Fall H1N1 response. 25% felt that communications during the spring were most problematic, while 37.5% indicated the fall, and 37.5% felt that both were inconsistent. 45 responders (100%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-24 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 28.) Overall, did you feel you had the resources you needed in order to communicate effectively with your constituents about H1N1: yes, no, sometimes? If no, what information would have helped? Survey question Rationale Determine if PIOs felt they had the resources - such as materials and staff resources - they needed during the H1N1 response. Findings Yes: 24 (53.3%) Sometimes: 19 (42.2%) No: 2 (4.4%) Respondents who provided more detail generally stated that they needed more staff resources. Others reiterated the importance of timely and consistent communications from OPHD. 45 responders (100%) 30.) Would a State PIO conference call be helpful on a routine basis? Interview question Rationale To build and explore options for PIO networking and resource sharing. Findings Sixteen respondents (76%) felt a routine, statewide PIO conference call could be helpful, but no more frequently than quarterly. They envision networking and sharing best practices as the main objective of the calls. Five (24%) did not think they would find a routine call helpful. 21 respondents (60%) 29.) Did you participate in the statewide PIO call: yes, no? Interview question Rationale Assess local PIOs' level of participation and interest in the statewide OPHD PIO calls during the H1N1 pandemic. Findings Yes: 16 (60%) No: 9 (33%) Sometimes: 2 (7%) Respondents who did not participate in the PIO calls, or participated only occasionally, felt that the information discussed at calls was often outdated or obsolete. PIOs also did not attend because many of them have multiple responsibilities and felt they had little time to attend more conference calls. Finally, some complained that the calls went on too long. 27 responders (77%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-25 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 31.) Was the Oregon Public Health Flu Hotline promoted in your community: Yes - we put a lot of effort into promoting it. Yes - we put some effort into promoting it. No - we did not promote it in our community. If not, why not? Survey question Rationale Assess the utility of the Hotline to LHDs and tribes. Findings Response % Response # Yes - a lot 37.8% 17 Yes - some 60.0% 27 No - 2.2% 1 Those who put \"no effort\" or \"some effort\" into promotion explained that their constituents wanted a local connection and called their office to speak with local health personnel, and that the State hotline took too much time for them to set up (and occasionally, they set up their own local hotlines as a result). 45 responders (100%) 32.) In the future, what communications materials would help you provide public information (e.g. safety, immunization, prevention, resources, etc.) during a health emergency (e.g. posters or flyers, graphics, business cards, etc.)? Rationale Solicit direct feedback about what materials PIOs most need from OPHD. Findings Respondents made the following suggestions: Material Response % Response # Posters 26.5% 13 Flyers/pamphlets/brochures 24.5% 12 Graphics 20.4% 10 Sample press releases 8.2% 4 Copy for radio 8.2% 4 Business cards 6.1% 3 Print ad copy/templates 6.1% 3 Other suggestions included: billboards, bus ads, movie ads, basic talking points/FAQs and translations. 41 responders (91%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-26 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 33.) From a communications perspective, what do you feel your office did best during the H1N1 response? Interview question Rationale Assess what local PIOs considered their greatest strengths during the emergency response. Findings Responses were remarkably consistent. The majority of respondents took the most pride in the speediness of their own response in their local communities, working with local stakeholders, community groups, and local media to disseminate information about H1N1 and keep residents calm. 31 respondents (89%) 34.) From a communications perspective, what do you feel the State did best during the H1N1 response? Interview question Rationale Asses what local PIOs considered OPHD's greatest communication strengths during the H1N1 response. Findings Though many respondents criticized the State conference calls (both for the content and the number of them), a significant number of informants answered that they appreciated the calls, but that they needed to happen sooner and they would have appreciated fewer of them. Several respondents also praised HAN and the resources available through it, though others had criticized it. Several respondents appreciated Mel Kohn's leadership and the press briefings he gave. Local PIOs also found the State flu website of very high quality, particularly after its overhaul in early November. 30 respondents (86%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX L: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL L-27 O REGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 35.) From a communications perspective, where do you feel the State has the most room to improve? Interview question Rationale Determined what OPHD can do to improve communications. Findings Interviews with PIOs pointed to two major areas for needed improvement. First, OPHD should consolidate emergency health messaging from the State. Informants described State communications during H1N1 as \"fragmented\", \"inconsistent\", \"contradictory with its own messaging\", and that \"right hands did not know what left hands were doing.\" Respondents attributed some of this problem by the multiple conference H1N1 conference calls, which they wanted consolidated. Second, timeliness is also clearly important to local PIOs. They felt that messaging arrived too late, and sometimes after its relevance had already passed. This caused great frustration for local PIOs who began to think of the State as an unreliable source for guidance. HAN also received many comments during this part of the interview, with concerns that it is not user-friendly enough and confusing to navigate. 28 responders (80%) 36.) What else can we do to support communications for your health department, district, or tribe? Survey and interview question Rationale Final wrap-up question, to ensure that we have discussed everything the informant finds relevant to communications. Findings Few respondents answered this question. Those who did took the opportunity to reiterate their main points, summed up widely as local PIOs should be involved in communications planning early, consistently and expediently. Two other points from these answers: OPHD has an opportunity, and should, foster relationships and networking between PIOs; and LHDs and tribes should receive any information OPHD releases to the press before it is released to the press. Survey: 25 responders (56%) Interview: 9 responders (26%) After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX M: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL M-1 OREGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT APPENDIX M: PANDEMIC H1N1 IMMUNIZATION INTERVENTIONS : OREGON LOCAL COORDINATOR PERSPECTIVES During the second wave of pandemic H1N1 influenza, local health departments, tribal health clinics, and health clinics within Oregon institutional facilities were responsible for coordinating H1N1 vaccine distribution to populations within their care. The Oregon Immunization Program monitored local H1N1 vaccination planning and implementation through ongoing technical support, funding for H1N1 mass vaccination planning, and coordinating efforts for local H1N1 logistics in October 2009 and again in January 2010. These findings reflect key themes and lessons learned through interviews with local Immunization and H1N1 Coordinators. Our aim was to identify logistic barriers, help resolve challenges when possible, and, finally, capture lessons learned while the experiences were fresh in our minds. This summary is meant to compliment state and local after-action evaluations and inform future pandemic planning and immunization efforts. Successes Despite unanticipated obstacles, many respondents identified communication and partnership strategies that promoted vaccination activities. Consistent Messaging: Consistent messaging concerning priority groups, vaccine safety, and vaccine availability aided in delivering clear and concise information to partners, providers, and the public. Respondents who reported consistent messaging strategies typically had a centralized team of communication officer(s), sometimes spanning multiple agencies. Transparency: State and agency transparency reportedly improved public trust and promoted accountability. Although vaccine availability information changed quickly, partners who received timely situation updates from state and local agencies were better equipped to respond to the changes. Additionally, respondents from local agencies that welcomed feedback from the public regarding their vaccination activities were able to adjust their activities in a timely manner and respond to public concern and needs. Existing Partnerships: Previously established partnerships were heavily relied upon for staff, time, space, and community outreach. Established partners understood and could anticipate each other's capacities, resources, and technical assistance, and could quickly call upon these resources to implement vaccination activities. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX M: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL M-2 OREGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Summary of Recommendations Develop pandemic plans for varied vaccine supply: State and local agencies should develop and practice vaccination plans for limited, adequate, and ample supply; high and low demand; and rural, suburban, and urban communities. Allow for scalable dimension depending on disease severity and variable demand. Develop strategies for reaching diverse and vulnerable populations: Increase capacity to identify and reach diverse and vulnerable populations using best practices, partnerships, and technical assistance. Vulnerable populations should include individuals at increased risk for disease as well as those with limited access to services. Foster interagency partnerships: State and local agencies should cultivate partnerships with government and community organizations that will facilitate access to vulnerable populations and increase organizational support. Develop MOUs with Seniors and People with Disabilities (SPD); Children, Adults, and Families (CAF); and OHSU's Office on Disability and Health to increase local capacity to locate and provide services to persons with disabilities. Strengthen communication and messaging: Oregon Public Health Division should develop timely, clear and concise messaging surrounding vaccination guidance. State guidance serves as a unified and authoritative source of information, which helps reduce public frustrations with local agencies. Maintain consistent policy and guidance: Priority group and vaccine distribution guidance must remain consistent throughout a pandemic response. If change is necessary, sufficient lead time should be given to agencies to allow for notification of partners and the public. Remove prioritization groups based on vaccine supply and coverage: The majority of respondents felt the State's decision to open vaccine to the general public came too late. Weeks before vaccine was open to the public, most respondents had already reached priority populations and felt they could have started vaccinating non-priority group populations. To determine the appropriate time to lift priority group restrictions, the State should continuously monitor vaccine supply and demand across all agencies. Improve systems for transferring vaccine from agencies with ample supply to those with limited supply to increase coverage rates. Improve logistical systems: Vaccine ordering, allocation, and tracking systems must be improved to facilitate smooth distribution to diverse providers. Ideally, it should provide timely data feedback for quality and process improvement during the course of a pandemic response. I. Project Description In Fall 2009, local agencies submitted mass H1N1 vaccination plans targeting six priority groups: pregnant women; people 6 months to 24 years old; household contacts and caregivers of infants under 6 months old; adults 25 to 64 years old with chronic conditions, health care workers, and frontline law enforcement/public safety workers. These plans also included specific strategies to ensure equitable access to vaccine by After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX M: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL M-3 OREGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT vulnerable populations - groups of people whose demographic, geographic, health or socio-economic characteristics hinder regular access to health care services. Using telephone interviews conducted with Immunization and H1N1/Preparedness coordinators of local health departments, tribes, and state agencies, the project objectives included: Documenting initial H1N1 vaccination plans, implementation challenges, and strategies that were adopted to overcome obstacles. Understanding efforts to facilitate access to vaccination for vulnerable populations including: transients, non/limited English speakers, individuals with transportation challenges, individuals living in institutionalized settings, individuals with chronic medical disorders, individuals with disabilities, children and youth with special health care needs, individuals from minority cultures, and pregnant women. Developing recommendations for improvements in future emergency response scenarios II. Methods Forty-nine agencies (34 Local Health Departments, 11 Tribes, and four State Agencies) were contacted to participate in this study. Immunization, H1N1, or Public Health Emergency Preparedness Coordinators from 39 agencies (80%) completed telephone interviews following a semi-structure interview guide. Each interview was conducted by Figure 1: EIP Lab-Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations in 2009 020406080100120 Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington Counties only S ource: ACDP, Public Health Division, Oregon DHSNumber of Hospitalizations Wave 1 Spring 2009Wave 2 Fall 2009 After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX M: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL M-4 OREGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT one of five interviewers and took approximately 45 minutes. Public health preparedness liaisons were invited to join the discussions. III. Results Agency pandemic H1N1 vaccine responses varied slightly, but generally executed the same strategies on a similar timeline. After clinical cases began to decline in Spring of 2009, agencies began preparing for Wave 2. These initial planning activities included: Convening Decision Makers/Stakeholders: Medical Advisory Committees, coalitions, community and government partners, community advisory boards, and regional groups convened early on to determine a plan of action, and make critical planning and communication decisions. Identifying Priority Groups: Agencies relied on epidemiological data, ILI surveillance, healthcare provider population estimates, and daily school attendance reports to identify priority group populations and develop preliminary plans to reach those populations. Many tribes worked to identify and locate tribal members belonging to priority groups and sent them reminder notes to get vaccinated. Communication: Concerted efforts to develop appropriate messaging and methods of communication occurred prior to Wave 2. Outreach activities were targeted to priority groups, and prevention/harm reduction education messaging was released through agency websites and informational postings, as well as through public media channels. After federal priority groups were defined, agencies submitted detailed mass vaccination plans. Planned mass vaccination strategies included: Large PODs: Most counties planned to implement large scale PODs either in the community or in schools. Based on years of implementing practice PODs during preparedness exercises, as well as continued implementation of seasonal flu public clinics, they initially felt this strategy was well tested, effective, and appropriate for their population. Provider Focused Delivery: Respondents reported that some agencies planned to vaccinate predominantly through providers. These respondents felt large PODs would not effectively penetrate priority groups, whereas distributing vaccine through providers would reach those most at risk in a more efficient method. Tribes who regularly service the majority of their population through tribal clinics or home visits planned to utilize the same methods for administering pandemic H1N1 vaccine. Focused Interventions: Walk-in clinics targeting specific groups were often planned in conjunction with vaccination strategies described above. Some of the special clinics that agencies and their partners planned on implementing included small schools, casinos, in/out patient treatment facilities (i.e., drug and alcohol clinics), group homes, WIC, and corrections facilities. These clinics were mostly conducted on-site; however, some agencies set-up special clinics at local health departments or community clinics to provide services. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX M: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL M-5 OREGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Sub-Prioritization: Because priority groups included populations ranging in location, age, and density, many agencies opted to focus initial vaccination efforts on those believed to be at greatest risk. The most commonly cited groups were pregnant women, children with special health care needs (CSHCN), and health care workers (HCWs). When limited quantities of Pandemic H1N1 vaccine became available in the Fall, all agencies faced obstacles to implementing their vaccination activities as planned. To overcome these challenges, agencies adjusted mass vaccination strategies and activities. Although some agencies faced more challenges than others, all respondents reported changing or delaying planned vaccination activities. The most commonly cited challenges , local response activities , and future recommendations are outlined below. 1. Low Vaccine Supply and High Demand: Initially, vaccine supply was limited and public demand was high which caused problems for agencies that developed plans based on the assumption of adequate vaccine supply. Community mass vaccination clinics ran out of vaccine. School clinics were cancelled. Extensive coverage of the vaccine shortage perpetuated public concern and increased demand. Respondents were concerned that those who wanted, but didn't receive vaccine, would not return when there was ample supply. Local Response Future Recommendations Vaccine administered through providers and focused interventions: Coordinate vaccine allocation process with State OIP Distribute vaccine through small, focused interventions and prioritize primary care providers (WIC, birth centers, group homes) Offer appointment-only public clinics Ensure predictable vaccine supply Incorporate local estimates in vaccine allocation Develop vaccination plans for limited, adequate, and ample supply scenarios for periods of high and low disease incidence, and high and low demand. Public education: Messaging that vaccination is important throughout the flu season Worked with media to disseminate accurate vaccine availability information Pace media campaigns with vaccine supply Develop state and local messaging to support vaccine receipt throughout the flu season Increase prevention messages when vaccine demand exceeds supply Increase vaccination messaging when demand starts to decline 2. Identifying Priority Groups: Priority groups were loosely defined. No early guidance was given to local agencies regarding subprioritization. Seniors did not fully understand why they were not included, which was partly fueled by confusion about the difference between Pandemic H1N1 vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccines. Tribes reported the exclusion of tribal elders from priority groups spread a misunderstanding among tribal members that the vaccine was not important. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX M: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL M-6 OREGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Shifting priority groups for a short time was very difficult for most respondents. Respondents felt they did not have enough lead time to adequately educate the public and providers on the change. Some respondents found they had already covered high risk children prior to the guidance change and consequently were sitting on excess vaccine. Local Response Future Recommendations Clear, timely state guidance on priority group definitions, especially HCW. Data driven support of vaccine safety and efficacy. Agencies developed consistent messaging for the public to explain why priority groups were being used and the rationale for these prioritizations. Messaging tailored to seniors explaining why they weren't included in priority groups. Work with media channels to accurately report priority group definitions. Develop culturally sensitive resources and educational messaging targeting special populations. Agencies heavily relied on TV, radio, and print media to dispel misinformation concerning priority groups and educate the public on disease prevention strategies. Develop state-initiated messaging on the rationale for priority groups, and changes to priority group structure. Continued following requirements outlined in provider agreements. Allow greater time for agencies to change communications and messaging surrounding State required guidance changes. Respondents responded quickly to changing prioritization guidance and tried to strategize clinics appropriately Allow agencies to transfer unused vaccine to agencies in need. Priority group education: Messaging tailored to seniors explaining why they weren't included in priority groups. Agencies heavily relied on TV, radio, and print media to dispel misinformation concerning priority groups and educate the public on disease prevention strategies. 3. Vaccine presentations: Initial vaccine shipments were primarily intranasal live, attenuated monovalent vaccine (LAMV), a presentation that many individuals in the priority groups were not eligible to receive, including: pregnant women, CSHCN, and adults with chronic conditions. In addition, misinformation regarding the safety and efficacy of LAMV was circulating among residents, employers, and providers which resulted in many eligible individuals choosing not to receive LAMV, particularly among HCW and EMS/Police personnel. More broadly, respondents discussed vaccine safety and efficacy concerns for all Pandemic H1N1 vaccine presentations, as well as specific to LAMV. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX M: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL M-7 OREGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT Local Response Future Recommendations Refocused use of LAMV: Used on families of high risk children and applicable priority groups. Client education on vaccine safety Promote use of LAMV among healthy adults and children and include information on vaccine safety Direct vaccine safety education toward HCW and their management Vaccine safety education: Providers were trained on vaccine safety Clients were educated about vaccine safety Work with media channels to accurately report vaccine safety Review safety and efficacy issues when vaccine recalls occur to temper public concerns 4. Limited Ancillary Supplies: Most respondents reported receiving ancillary supplies felt to be unsuitable for Pandemic H1N1 vaccine administration. Ancillary supplies varied among several brands, syringes types, and needle lengths. Local Response Future Recommendations Used different supplies: Some agencies used their own ancillary supplies Donated CDC supplies to hospitals or other facilities Verify types of supplies needed prior to sending to avoid wasting supplies and costs for shipping Provide commonly used ancillary supplies 5. State Communication and Guidance: Respondents believed that the State conducted too many conference calls. Respondents perceived a lack of communication between the Oregon Preparedness and Immunization Programs and were split on whether or not they felt the State's involvement in local decision making was adequate. Although each agency was given the authority to make their own decisions about vaccine distribution, some respondents felt they would have preferred more specific guidance from the State while other preferred having sole discretion. Local Response Future Recommendations Followed guidance: Attended Immunization Program conference calls and reviewed meeting minutes. Consistent contact with Immunization Program staff for guidance clarification and technical assistance. Condense new information into fewer and local calls. Improve communication between the Preparedness and Immunization Programs. Post conference call minutes to HAN. Provide agencies with best practices tools to assist planning. Develop state-initiated messaging on the rationale for priority groups, and changes to priority group structure. Provide technical assistance to agencies indicating need. 6. Developing New Partnerships: The logistics of late partnering with to SPD to immunize homebound and residential facilities caused the most frustration with After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX M: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL M-8 OREGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT respondents. Communication between the State and local coordinators concerning SPD contract nurses was unsuccessful. Local Response Future Recommendations Relied on established relationships: Agencies relied heavily on established partnerships for staff support, outreach, storage and administering vaccine. Foster relationships and sign agreements with partners during non- emergency situations Provide organizational charts and quick informational sheets on partner organizations for new staff Did not use contract nurses Create Memorandum of Understanding templates that can be tailored for specific partnerships Worked with local SPD programs to identify/locate and vaccinate high risk clients. Some agencies served homebound and SPD populations without SPD support. Develop a working partnership with SPD 7. Vaccine Allocation and Reporting: Vaccine ordering and distribution systems were appreciated, but were time consuming and awkward. Regional health care groups and some agency were not able to use the ordering system, making vaccine distribution coordination between agencies and regional health systems complicated. Minimum dose ordering requirement caused irregular supply for smaller counties and tribes. Agencies with many providers were unable to ship small amounts directly from the vendor. Therefore, agencies had to provide storage and distribution from their own facilities. Vaccination reporting forms did not contain information on priority groups, which prevented many agencies from collecting priority group information from clients. With a lack of priority group data collection, agencies were unable to determine coverage and reach among priority groups and vulnerable populations. Local Response Future Recommendations Developed tracking, distribution, and reporting protocols: Created regional group to provide vaccine to health care organizations. Expanded local agency storage capacity by partnering with organizations with vaccine storage capacity. Worked closely with MAC to reach consensus on and align allocation and distribution strategies Some agencies developed new forms for collecting priority group information. Used ALERT online data entry for reporting. Improve ordering and distribution systems to work for all agencies - regional, population specific and local jurisdictions. Organize regional health system allocations at the state level Reduce minimum dose ordering requirements, particularly for smaller agencies Revise reporting forms to increase quality and efficiency of data collection. Collect data points on client inclusion in priority groups and vulnerable populations. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX M: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL M-9 OREGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT 8. Limited Staff: Because agencies were expected to carry on with regular activities while addressing the H1N1 pandemic, most felt overwhelmed and understaffed. Staff burnout and high turnover made keeping up daily business and fostering existing partnerships difficult. Local Response Future Recommendations Increase Organizational Strength: Hired new staff Foster relationships and complete paperwork/administrative activities with partners during non-emergency situations Relied on volunteers and partnerships including student nurses, job corps, community groups, police, fire districts, EMR teams, WIC, other county and city departments Provide funding for increasing staff capacity or provide services to relieve current staff responsibilities. 9. Access for Vulnerable Populations: Lack of Culturally Appropriate Resources - Minimal development of culturally diverse resources limited access and outreach to racial and ethnic minority groups. Tribes felt they did not have adequate resources with appropriate literacy levels or with cultural sensitivity towards tribal elders. Limited bilingual/bicultural staff - Some counties had a bilingual Spanish speaking staff member or partner; however, availability was limited. Limited vaccine supply drove decisions to provide focused interventions, in effect sub-prioritizations of vulnerable population- Due to limited vaccine, some respondents reported offering focused interventions among vulnerable populations to those easiest to reach and most at risk including pregnant women, people with chronic health conditions, and institutionalized individuals. Local Response Future Recommendations Translation and outreach: Spanish translation services were provided at most clinics and Latino community leaders and organizations partnered with counties for outreach. Forms were provided in Spanish. Provide translation and culturally appropriate services for a variety of cultural groups Partner with community organizations and leaders who have credibility in racial and ethnic minority cultures to promote vaccination services. Remind public about public health mandate and servicing vulnerable populations in an effort to address public upset over efforts specifically targeted toward vulnerable populations. Culturally appropriate education strategies: Tribes developed culturally sensitive Create informational resources targeting low literacy and non-medical populations. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX M: OREGON PUBLIC HEALTH FALL M-10 OREGON 2009 FLU HOTLINE AFTER-ACTION REPORT messaging about priority groups towards elders. Counties developed messages targeting seniors and priority groups. Provide technical assistance to agencies for developing culturally appropriate outreach strategies and materials. Sub-prioritized and delayed outreach activities: Administered vaccine through specialized providers (i.e., OB/GYNs, FQHCs, pediatricians, Babies First/CaCoon) to reach pregnant women, CSHCN, and adults with chronic conditions. Delayed clinics at shelters, low-income apartments, etc. until increased vaccine supply. Provided transportation or home visits for homebound individuals; clinics/PODs were placed on easily accessible routes and geographically diverse locations Increase staff/partner capacity to conduct home visits, mobile clinics, and otherwise provide vaccine in settings for vulnerable populations with transportation and access challenges. After Action Report / Improvement Plan State of Oregon Fall 2009 H1N1 Response APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-1 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Oregon Department of Human Services contracted with Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc., to conduct a telephone survey to evaluate Oregonians' actions and attitudes related to the spring 2009 response and to conduct four focus groups to assess participants' attitudes about the H1N1 vaccine which validated and elaborated on the telephone survey. Their reports are contained on the following pages: H1N1 Vaccination Survey .................................................... N-2 H1N1 Vaccine Focus Groups Report and Appendices....... N-38 APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-2 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS April 26,2010 To: Oregon Department of Human Services From: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM) Re: H1N1 Vaccination Survey I. INTRODUCTION & METHODOLOGY Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM) conducted a telephone survey to evaluate Oregonians' actions and attitudes related to the recent H1N1 pandemic flu outbreak. This study will assist in evaluating the effectiveness of public messages about vaccinations and prevention, and guide the development of future message campaigns. Research Methodology . Between April 8 and 11, 2010, DHM conducted a telephone survey of 600 Oregon residents averaging 18 minutes in length. We oversampled Hispanic households to reach 2001 total interviews. This sample size is sufficient to assess the opinions of Oregonians in general and Hispanic households specifically (reporting when there are notable differences) and to review findings by multiple subgroups including area of state, gender, age, education, and children in household. For a few questions, the sample was split as noted in the report. In gathering responses, DHM employed a variety of quality control measures, including questionnaire pre-testing and validations. Quotas were set to assure a representative sample. Bi-lingual interviewers were on hand to capture Spanish speaking households. Computer abstracts for the survey accompany and are referenced throughout this report, and the annotated questionnaire is appended for exact wording of questions. A sampling of verbatim responses to open-ended questions also is appended. Percentages in the report may not add up to 100% due to rounding. Statement of Limitations . Any sampling of opinions or attitudes is subject to a margin of error, which represents the difference between a sample of a given population and the total population (here, all Oregon residents). For a sample size of 600, the margin of error is +/-4.0%.2 For a sample size of 200, the margin of error is 6.9%. 1 6% (n=36) came from the random statewide population; an additional 164 were completed using targeted lists of Hispanic households. 2 These plus-minus error margins represent differences between the sample and total population at a confidence interval, or probability, calculated to be 95%. This means that there is a 95% probability that the sample taken for this study would fall within the stated margins of error if compared with the results achieved from surveying the entire population. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-3 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS II. OBSERVATIONS & CONCLUSIONS Oregonians clearly know about the H1N1 flu virus The message about H1N1 clearly got through - out of the 600 surveyed, only six report that they had not read or heard about the swine flu, or H1N1. However, free associations with vaccinations have very little specific mention of H1N1, and more about the flu vaccine generally. There is general and wide awareness of who had prior ity for the vaccine. Oregonians have many positive associations with vacc inations; but send mixed messages about how they perceive vaccine safety, including concern about the safety of the H1N1 vaccine Over six in 10 strongly agree that vaccines prevent and keep us safe from disease. Nearly eight in 10 believe vaccinations improve heal th a great deal or some. About eight in 10 strongly or somewhat agree that va ccines are safe and are tested for safety, but about one-third agree that vaccines contain harmful chemicals. Nearly two-thirds strongly or somewhat agree that va ccines have caused problems in some children and people. For the H1N1 vaccine specifically, nearly three-quar ters believe it is very or somewhat safe. Yet Oregonians express concern about its safety in both free association and closed ended questions; Hispanic households show even more concern about safety. Older, more educated Oregonians tend to view the safety of H1N1 vaccine more positively. General confidence in vaccine effectiveness and safe ty, and in institutions providing information about H1N1, is often higher among older Oregonians and those with the most education. H 1N1 vaccine shortage was brought up most in Tri-County, concern about safety was highest in Southern Oregon, and Central and Eastern Oregon residents rely more on public health departments Availability or shortage of the vaccine came up more often for Tri-County residents and those with the most education. Vaccine safety seems to be more of an issue in South ern Oregon. Public health departments are more important to Cent ral/Eastern Oregon residents and Hispanics for getting the H1N1 vaccine. Oregonians are motivated by several reasons for getting - or not getting - the H1N1 vaccine Those who got the H1N1 vaccine for themselves or som eone in their care most often mention prevention generally and protecting persons who are at high risk. When we look at what would make Oregonians more like ly to get the H1N1 vaccine, reasons ranking the highest are health professionals, CDC, or school recommendation; knowing someone who has H1N1; and knowing you can pass H1N1 on to someone else. Those who did not get the H1N1 vaccine mention most often that is was unnecessary, unsafe, and unavailable. A majority didn't believe they would get sick from t he H1N1 virus. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-4 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS There are areas where Hispanic households differ from Oregonians overall: Hispanics are not as clear about the role vaccines p lay in disease prevention. Fewer Hispanics knew they could get the H1N1 vaccine . Hispanics knew less about the priority group for H1N 1 vaccine. Hispanics are more likely to believe the H1N1 vaccin e was only for high risk individuals. Hispanics are somewhat more concerned about H1N1 vac cine safety and somewhat less concerned about availability. Hispanics are more likely to get H1N1 vaccine in a h ealth care clinic, and less likely at a doctor's office. Hispanics are more trusting and rely more on their p lace of worship. Future communications need to address the doubt abou t vaccine safety, take advantage of trusted messengers and sources, reinforce positive attitudes and address skepticism, and consider demographic differences Oregonians will require additional convincing to tak e advantage of the next seasonal vaccine with H1N1 o Key messages need to focus on: \"yes, you can get sick,\" \"it's safe,\" and \"it's available.\" o Future message need to address a possible \"credibility gap\": six in 10 agree that the H1N1 outbreak was less serious than they were led to believe and half didn't believe they would get sick from the H1N1 virus. There are ample trusted and effective messengers and information sources o Public health departments get high marks for informing the community about H1N1, and they are considered trusted messengers on this topic. o Health professionals (especially doctors) have a consistently positive, trusted influence. o The Centers for Disease Control and schools are also trusted messengers. The news media is a key delivery vehicle for informa tion about H1N1 o Even though TV news is not at the top of trusted messengers, it is clear from other responses that Oregonians rely heavily on news media, especially TV, for information. Findings suggest that communications need to be tail ored to Hispanics, less educated, younger, households with children, and different areas of the state. Special challenges include: o T hose up to age 54 who are less likely to get the next seasonal flu vaccine - when the H1N1 vaccine is included, numbers drop from about half to 44% or less. o Households with children who are not as likely to get the next seasonal flu vaccine, especially when H1N1 vaccine is included, possibly reflecting concerns about safety. o Hispanics who believe the H1N1 vaccine is only for the priority group or people at high risk, and are less sure about whether the H1N1 vaccine is recommended for them. C ompared to national findings (Harvard Public Opinion Research Program), Oregon shows similar numbers on perception of vaccine availability, but a higher likelihood of getting the next flu vaccine 35% of Oregonians say the H1N1 vaccine was not avail able when they wanted it; the most recent Harvard poll in December cites a similar 34%. 53% of Oregonians say they are very or somewhat like ly to get the next seasonal flu vaccine which will include the H1N1 vaccine. The national Harvard poll indicates that 55% of adults say they do not intend to get it. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-5 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS III. KEY FINDINGS A. Overall Views About Health Nearly all Oregonians (91%) consider themselves to be in excellent (31%) or good (60%) health (Q1). Chart 1 Personal Health Assessment Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 We asked how much they believe five different things improve their overall health (Q2-Q6). Chart 2 How Much Each Improves Health Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 Nutrition and physical activity clearly rank at the top, with virtually everyone saying that these improve health, and at least 80% agreeing that these improve health a great deal . Females say a great deal more APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-6 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS than males for all but physical activity . People with the most education say a great deal or some for all but physicals and medical exams , and vitamins . Looking specifically at vaccinations, which rank the same as physicals and medical exams, the only additional subgroup variation is among households with children under age 18, who report 84% combined great deal and some , compared to 76% for other households. B. Vaccinations Generally Oregonians offered on their own what comes to mind when they think about vaccinations (Q7). season.\" \"Just a way of preventing a disease or anything going around.\" Table 1 Associations with Vaccinations Response Statewide Population N=600 Hispanic Households N=200 The flu virus vaccination 26% 3% All (DHM), April 2010 Oregonians' free associations with vaccinations are generally positive (e.g. healthy living/prevention), descriptive (e.g. injections/needles/shots), or a specific type of vaccination (e.g. flu virus, measles, polio). Hispanics are less likely to mention childhood and other specific types of immunizations, and are more likely to mention measures for healthy living, as shown in Table 1. The flu virus vaccination is mentioned more often by ages 55+ (39%) and households without children (32%). Females (32%), ages 25-34 (31%), and households with children (28%) mention childhood inoculations/immunizations more often than their counterparts. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-7 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS The highest negative mentions are unnecessary measures (5%) and side effects (3%). All other negative mentions are at 2% or less. There is minimal mention of H1N1, specifically. We asked Oregonians for their level of agreement with six different statements about vaccinations (Q8- Q13). Chart 3 Agreement with Statements about Vaccinations Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 Consistent with their positive associations with vaccinations, the four statements with the highest level of agreement are also all positive. Fewer Hispanics strongly agree that vaccines prevent disease (48% compared to 62% general population) and vaccines are necessary to keep us safe from disease (54% versus 62%); however, all other findings for these statements are overall very similar for Oregonians and Hispanic households. Means (scale 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree) for the top four statements range from 4.5 for vaccines prevent disease to 4.1 for vaccines are safe , showing a high level of agreement . Oregonians with the most education are generally more likely than those with the least education to agree with these four statements, and females agree more often than males with the top two statements. Tri-County residents have higher levels of agreement that vaccines are tested for safety (4.4 v. Willamette Valley and Southern Oregon: 4.0) and vaccines are safe (4.2 v. Willamette Valley: 4.0). Southern Oregon residents agree more often than Tri-County residents that vaccines have caused problems in some children and people (3.9 v. 3.6) and that vaccines contain harmful chemicals (2.9 v. 2.6). We also note that, even though vaccines are safe has the same combined strongly and somewhat agree as vaccines are tested for safety, the latter has a higher strongly agree (45% v. 36%). APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-8 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Over eight in 10 (84%) say they, or someone in their care, has gotten a flu vaccine (Q14). Yes responses are higher among females (87% v. males: 80%), ages 55+ (87% v. ages 35-54: and some college or more (some: 88%, college graduate: 87%, high school or less: 76%). C. General Awareness of H1N1 Flu and Vaccine All but six respondents (99%) report that they had read or had heard about the swine flu, or H1N1 (Q15). We then asked them whether the information they received about H1N1 was the right amount, too much, or not enough (Q16). Chart 4 Amount of Information Received about H1N1 Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 Those more likely to say not enough information include Hispanics (24% v. general population: 13%), Southern Oregon residents (20% v. Tri-County: 11%), and those with some college or less (high school or less: 16%, females: 16%) more often say too much information. After clarifying that H1N1 is the new strain of flu virus, we asked, without prompting, who they recalled was in the priority group for getting the H1N1 vaccine (Q17). APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-9 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Chart 5 Priority for H1N1 Vaccine Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 The highest don't know responses are among Hispanics (30%), Central/Eastern Oregon (21%), males (19%), and the least educated (22%). As shown in Chart 5, Hispanics are less likely to identify the priority group of young children, pregnant women, and people with chronic health conditions. Tri-County residents (73% v. 55+: graduates (73% v. high school or less: 62%) are more familiar with the priority group. Most Oregonians (60%) do not personally know someone who got sick with H1N1; fewer than four in 10 (39%) say yes (Q18). Hispanic household responses are about 10% lower - 29% know someone who got sick with H1N1 and 69% do not. Females (46% v. ages (43% v. high school or less: 33%), and households with children (53% v. households without children: 28%) say yes more often. By area of residence, Southern Oregon (47%) knew more people with H1N1 than Central Oregon (34%) and Tri-County (38%). Respondents offered, unprompted, what comes to mind when they think about the H1N1 vaccine (Q19). \"How quickly they got it out and available to the public.\" \"Trouble locating a place to get it.\" \"Probably helps save lives.\" \"Too much hype, they created a near hysteria about the need for the vaccine and it wasn't the epidemic they thought it was.\" APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-10 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Table 2 What Comes to Mind Thinking about H1N1 Vaccine Response Statewide Population N=600 Preventative medicine against infection 20% Issues surrounding the availability of the vaccine 16% Connection to the H1N1 virus/flu strain 12% Positive measure for overall health 13% Unnecessary to take/alternatives to keeping healthy 12% Unproven/ineffective/unsafe treatment 9% Media hype/over exaggerated situation 8% Needing vaccination/being sick 7% Apprehension surrounding the virus/issue itself 6% Need more information/education on the subject 5% Encouraged for high risk individuals 3% Proven/effective/safe treatment 3% Preparation against possible epidemic 3% Severity of the disease 3% All other responses 2% or less None/Nothing/Refused 7% 5% Source: Davis, & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 As with vaccinations in general, many associations with the H1N1 vaccine are positive. However, negative comments (e.g. lack of availability, unnecessary, unproven, over exaggerated) are higher for the H1N1 vaccine. Issues surrounding vaccine availability are mentioned less often among Hispanics (5% v. general population: 16%) and more often among Tri-County residents (25% v. rest of state: range of 8%-13%) and college graduates (21% v. high school or less: 12%). APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-11 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS We then asked Oregonians how they view the safety of the H1N1 vaccine (Q20). Chart 6 How Safe is the H1N1 Vaccine Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 As shown in Chart 6, overall, Oregonians are slightly more likely than Hispanics to say very safe (32% v. 22%), with similar combined very/somewhat safe (75%/ 71%). Also more likely to say very safe are ages 55+ (41%), college graduates (41%), and White residents (34%). A fairly high 15% say don't know , with no notable variations among subgroups. D. H1N1 Vaccine Use About half (46% general population; 53% Hispanic households) say they or someone in their care got the H1N1 vaccine (Q21). APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-12 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Chart 7 Did You or Anyone in Your Care Get the H1N1 Vaccine Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 Females (52% v. males: 40%) and households with children under 18 (54% v. households without children: 40%) more often say yes, that they or someone in their care got the H1N1 vaccine. Those who say they or someone in their care got the H1N1 vaccine (general population n=279) offered why they got the vaccine (Q22). \"My doctor thought I should.\" \"Because we were in the high health risk category because we are older.\" \"Required by work.\" \"Because being sick for two weeks with any kind of flu is preventable and not worth it. Too much down time.\" Table 3 Why You or Someone in Your Care Got the H1N1 Vaccine Response Statewide Population N=279 Hispanic Households N=105 Preventative measures taken for safety 41% 51% Persons were at high risk for infection 30% 20% Work in a sensitive occupation 19% 13% H1N1 vaccine was conveniently available 13% 8% Recommended by physician 10% 8% Have small children/children school APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-13 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Hispanics more often mention preventative measures taken for safety (51% v. general population: 41%), 32%). Ten percent (10%) fewer Hispanics mention persons were at high risk for infection . Ages 35-54 are more likely to mention work in a sensitive occupation (26% v. 55+: 11%). Recommended by a physician comes up more often among Tri-County and Southern Oregon residents (16%, 13% v. Willamette Valley: 4%). Ages 18-24 have a fairly high don't know response, at 12%. We asked the same group where they or those in their care received the H1N1 vaccine (Q23). \"At our public health my son's school.\" Table 4 Where You or Someone in Your Care Got the H1N1 Vaccine Response Statewide Population N=279 Hispanic Households N=105 care 4% Kaiser health clinic 2% 4% All other or less Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 As shown in Table 4, overall, Oregonians are more likely than Hispanic households to mention at a doctor's office , as are those ages 25-34 (49%), and college graduates (40%). Hispanic households are more likely to mention a healthcare clinic (28% v. general population: 13%), as are households with children (19% v. households without children: 8%). Ages 25-34 mention the school system and place of work more often than ages 55+. School system is also mentioned more among the least educated and households with children. Tri-County (11%) and Willamette Valley (12%) residents mention a pharmacy more than Central Oregon (4%) and Southern Oregon (0%). A high percentage of Central/Eastern Oregon residents (17%) say public health department , compared to 1%-3% in other areas of the state. Those who report they did not get the H1N1 vaccine (general population n=306) were asked if they ever considered getting it for themselves or someone in their care (Q24). APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-14 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Chart 8 Did You or Anyone in Your Care Consider Getting the H1N1 Vaccine Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 About four in 10 say yes, however, six in 10 say no, with males more likely than females to give that response (68% v. 57%). We asked the same group why they or someone in their care did not get the H1N1 vaccine (Q25). \"We don't believe in it.\" \"From what I heard about it, it was unsafe.\" \"I wasn't in the recommended age group to get it.\" \"Just never got around to it.\" \"Lack of availability.\" Table 5 Why You or Someone in Your Care Did Not Get the H1N1 Vaccine Response Statewide Population N=306 Hispanic Households N=92 Didn't my area 12% 7% 11% 2% Expensive 3% 1% Shortage get 2% 2% All other responses 1% or less 1% or Don't know 2% 11% Midghall, APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-15 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Hispanic households mention that it was unnecessary notably less often than Oregonians, overall, (46% v. 60%), and Hispanics also are a bit more likely to say they didn't think it was safe (20% v. 14%). They also have a higher don't know response (11% v. 2%). While only 2% specifically mention a shortage of the vaccine, combining this response with wasn't available in my area raises the number to 14%. E. H1N1 Attitudes We asked Oregonians their level of agreement with nine statements about H1N1 (Q26-Q34). Chart 9 Agreement with Statements about H1N1 (Scale 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree) Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 Males are more likely to agree (3.9 v. females: 3.4) with the statement having the highest level of agreement overall - the H1N1 outbreak was less serious than I was led to believe . I didn't believe I would get sick from the H1N1 virus has more agreement among males (3.4 v. females: 3.1) and households without children (3.4 v. households without children: 3.1) . Hispanic households show more concern about H1N1 vaccine safety (3.4), as do the least educated (3.5), and households with children (3.2). There are no variations for the statement that the H1N1 vaccine was only for high risk individuals and it wasn't available when I wanted the vaccination. Agreement about non-availability is higher among Tri- County residents (2.9 v. Willamette Valley: 2.6). Males agree more often that H1N1 is like every other flu APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-16 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS virus (2.9 v. females: 2.5). Convenience was more of an issue for the least educated (2.7). Agreement that the H1N1 vaccine was not for healthy individuals is higher among Southern Oregon residents (2.6 v. Tri-County: 2.2), and ages 18-24 (2.9 v. 55+: 2.3). Hispanic households (2.2 v. general population: 1.6) are more likely to agree with the statement having the lowest level of agreement - I didn't know I could get H1N1 - as are the least educated (2.0 v. some college and college educated: 1.5). Southern Oregon residents respond don't know more often for all but the highest and lowest ranked statements. We asked Oregonians whether 15 different factors would make them more or less likely to get vaccinated for H1N1, or if they would make no difference (Q35-Q49). APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-17 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Table 6 More or Less Likely or Make No Difference in Getting H1N1 Vaccine Response Sample More Likely Less Likely Makes No Diff DK State 70% 6% 22% 1% The health professional you normally see for care recommends you get vaccinated you don't get sick, you could pass H1N1 to someone who could get seriously 58% 7% 32% 3% State 50% 8% B) A death or hospitalization related to H1N1 in your local or state public health recommends you get vaccinated (DHM), April 2010 * Hispanic Households We find some notable differences between the general population and Hispanic households, as detailed in Table 6. Overall, more Oregonians than Hispanic Households, say people you know were getting sick with H1N1 would make them more likely to get vaccinated for H1N1 . On the other hand, Hispanic households more often say recommendations by the following would make them more likely to get vaccinated: your school for your child, your public health department, your local or state public health official, and your place of worship. Hispanic households also are more influenced by news stories about people getting sick with H1N1 and someone you trust got vaccinated. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-18 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Looking at the five statements where half or more Oregonians, overall, say each would make them more likely to get the H1N1 vaccine, we find a number of subgroup variations. For your health professional recommends you get vaccinated , Tri-County and Southern Oregon residents (74% v. high school or less: 63%) more often say this would make them more likely to get vaccinated. People you know were getting sick with H1N1 has more of an impact on Tri-County residents (66% v. Central/Eastern: 50%), 57%), while this statement is more likely to make no difference to the least educated (38% v. college graduates: 28%). Females (67% v. males: 52%) households with children (64% v. households without children: 56%) say more often that the statement even if you don't get sick, you could pass H1N1 to someone who could get seriously ill would make them more likely to get vaccinated. This statement has the highest don't know response, although it is still quite low, at 8%. The only significant subgroup variation for the Centers for Disease Control recommends you get vaccinated is by education, with college graduates more often saying this would make them more likely to get vaccinated (59% v. high school or less: 47%). Your school recommends your child get vaccinated has more influence on Tri-County, Southern, and Central/Eastern Oregon residents (56%, 51%, 52%) than it does on residents of the Willamette Valley (38%), people ages 25-34 (58% v. 35-54: 53%, 55+: 43%), households with children (56% v. households without children 44%). Right around half of Oregonians (49%) also say a death or hospitalization related to H1N1 and your public health department recommends you get vaccinated make them more likely to get vaccinated. For death or hospitalization related to H1N1 , Willamette Valley residents (55% v. Central/Eastern: 36%) and households with children (56% v. households without children: 42%) more often say this would make them more likely to get the vaccination. A public health department recommendation has more impact on females (54% v. males: 44%). We asked a split sample how likely they are to get the next seasonal flu vaccine (Q53) or the next seasonal flu vaccine, which will now include H1N1 (Q54). Table 7 How Likely to Get the Next Seasonal Vaccine Response Next Seasonal Flu Vaccine N=308 Next Seasonal Flu Vaccine Containing H1N1 N=292 Very likely 42% 38% Somewhat likely 16% 15% likely 14% Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 A majority of people say they are very or somewhat likely to get the vaccine. Results are similar for both questions, with about four in 10 saying they are very likely to get the next seasonal vaccine, whether or APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-19 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS not reference is made to H1N1. Looking at both versions of the question, those ages 55+ are more apt to say they are very or somewhat likely to get the next seasonal flu vaccine. Even though ages 18-54 more often say they are not too or not at all likely to get the next seasonal flu vaccine, at least half or more in this age range say they are very or somewhat likely to get the seasonal flu vaccine (Q53). However, those numbers go down to a range of 32% to 44% when H1N1 is referenced (Q54). Six in 10 college graduates (60%) more often say they are very or somewhat likely to get the next vaccine including H1N1, compared to 48% of high school graduates and 42% of those with some college. Interestingly, the findings indicate that households with children are not as likely to get the next seasonal flu vaccine, especially when the question includes the vaccine containing H1N1 ( not too or not at all likely : 55%). F. Messages and Communications Oregonians told us, unprompted, where they saw or heard about H1N1 (Q50). \"I heard about it at work and on the news.\" \"Everywhere, radio news mostly.\" \"My doctor told me about it.\" \"From my family, news, the school.\" Table 8 Where Did You See or Hear About H1N1 Response Statewide Population N=600 TV News 56% News/media - 6% Schools 5% Everywhere/all sources - unspecified 4% All other responses 2% or less Don't know 0% Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc.

Tri-County (37%) and Willamette Valley (36%) residents mention news/media more often, as do ages 25-34 (44%), and households with children (37%). Males (40%), ages 55+ (46%), and college graduates (40%) are more likely than their counterparts to mention newspapers/magazines . APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-20 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Of the sources Oregonians listed, we asked which they believe the most (Q51). \"Just the news on television.\" \"My healthcare provider.\" \"The news.\" Table 9 Which Source Did You Believe the Most Response Statewide Population N=600 TV news 14% News/media - unspecified 6% All other responses 3% or less Don't know 0% Source: Davis, Hibbitts, & Midghall, Inc. April 2010 Overall, the news, including TV, general media, and newspapers are at the top, with a combined 36% of responses. Ages 35-55+ are more likely than ages 25-34 to say TV news , while high school graduates or less more often mention the media in general. Central/Eastern Oregon residents are least likely to say my doctor , as are males and ages 18-54. We then asked what was the most helpful piece of information about the H1N1 vaccine (Q52). \"Where the vaccination was available and for who.\" \"This brochure from my health plan.\" \"Knowing about the symptoms.\" \"List of what you should do if sick.\" \"To sanitize your hands, house, and shopping carts.

(DHM), April 2010 Helpful information is spread across many areas, including vaccine availability, symptoms, prevention, and specifics about the vaccine. Information about availability was more helpful to Tri-County residents (16%). Hispanic households are notably more likely to mention preventative measures (17% v. general population: 7%), as are females (9% v. males: 4%). We asked Oregonians to indicate their level of trust in specific organizations and individuals when it comes to information about vaccinations (Q56-Q71). See Chart 10. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-22 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Chart 10 Trust in Organizations/Individuals for Information about Vaccinations (Scale 1=no trust at all to 5=great deal) Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 For most of these individuals and organizations, the level of trust is similar between all Oregonians and Hispanic households. The top seven trusted messengers, as shown in Chart 10, are trusted a great deal or some by a high of 94% for a doctor to 77% for the Oregon Public Health Division. We find a number of subgroup variations by means. A doctor is trusted even more by ages 18-24 (4.8 v. ages 35-54: 4.4) and college graduates (4.6 v. high school or less: 4.4). The Centers for Disease Control has more credibility among females (4.3 v. males: 4.1), ages 25-34 (4.3 v. 35-54: 4.1) and college graduates (4.4 v. high school or less: 4.0). APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-23 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS A nurse is trusted more by Willamette Valley residents (4.3 v. Central/Eastern: 4.0). Females (4.2 v. males 3.9) and college graduates (4.1 v. high school or less: 3.9) have more confidence in the local public health department. College graduates (4.0 v. high school or less: 3.8) are also more likely to trust a local or state public health official. There are no subgroup variations for the Oregon Public Health Division or pharmacists. When we look at percentage responses for a great deal and some combined, we find that Hispanic households are notably more likely than Oregonians, overall, to trust their employer (66% v. 54%) and a religious leader (54% v. 42%) and slightly more likely to trust schools (73% v. 67%), local government (68% v. 61%), the federal government (67% v. 60%), and TV news (68% v. 59%). We read two statements about public health departments informing the community about H1N1 and asked respondents which came closer to their view (Q55). Chart 11 Which Statement about H1N1 Information is Closer to Your View Source: Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM), April 2010 As Chart 11 demonstrates, Oregonians, overall, and Hispanic households give public health high marks for informing the community about H1N1. There are very few variations. College graduates are more likely to agree with the good job statement (83% v. high school graduate or less: 74%). There are no variations to report for the second statement.

(DHM) Re: H1N1 Vaccine Focus Groups Report I. INTRODUCTION & METHODOLOGY Davis, Hibbitts & Midghall, Inc. (DHM) conducted four focus groups for the Department of Human Services. The primary purpose of these groups was to assess participants' attitudes about the H1N1 vaccine, to better understand what has or what will motivate them, or someone in their household, to get the H1N1 vaccine, and to learn how to best communicate with people about the vaccine. The research validates and elaborates on findings from an earlier statewide survey of Oregonians, which had an over sampling of Hispanic households. This memo has a summary and observations from the focus groups, along with an explanation of key findings. The summary relates the key focus group research findings to the survey research. Each section reviews a major topic from the group discussions and includes representative quotations as well as evaluative commentary. The quotes and commentary are drawn from both written exercises and group discussion.3 Research Design : The four focus groups were conducted in April 2010. The Portland group (n=9) was mixed men and women representing the population as a whole. The Pendleton (n=9), Medford (n=10), and Bend (n=10) groups were composed of women who are mothers or caregivers. The Bend group also was all Hispanic. The Bend discussion was conducted in Spanish, and in deference to cultural differences, participants were not asked to complete demographic information or any written exercises. For the other three groups, Appendix A has participant demographic information and Appendixes B-N have responses to the written exercises.4 Although research of this type is not designed to measure with statistical reliability the attitudes of a particular group, it is valuable in giving a sense of the attitudes and opinions of the populations from which the samples were drawn.5 3 Quotations were selected to represent the range of opinions regarding a topic, and not to quantitatively represent the expressed attitudes. 4 Similar topics are grouped together when written questions varied among the different groups. 5 The results of some ratings and rankings are included in the Appendixes. Although these are not a statistically valid measurement of views, they help illustrate the range and extent of consistency of views from group to group, and within each group, when read in combination with written and other comments. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-38 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS II. SUMMARY & OBSERVATIONS Those most open to getting the H1N1 vaccine believe in the benefits of vaccines, and took the H1N1 outbreak seriously. Understand the historic benefits of vaccines for dis eases like polio Value protecting both themselves and the community Took the advice of health care providers, schools, a nd others Did not have concerns about H1N1 vaccine safety Others, even those with doubts, were motivated to ge t the H1N1 vaccine for themselves, or someone in their household, for many different reasons. Were caregivers who did not want to expose themselve s or the person for which they provided care Urged by schools to get their children vaccinated Advised by their health care provider to get the vac cine Had substantial contact with children or other membe rs of the public Were required or strongly encouraged by their employ er Were members of a high risk or other priority group Encouraged by a spouse or other family member Knew or heard of someone who had died from the virus While the H1N1 vaccine shortage was a big obstacle t o people getting vaccinated, others centered more around personal opinions and experience. General belief that vaccines are unsafe and can caus e serious side effects, such as autism, in children; an attitude that carried over to the H1N1 vaccine Questioned whether there was adequate time to test t he H1N1 vaccine Had prior experience with bad side effects or reacti ons from flu and other vaccines Felt the vaccine was generally unneeded Thought the vaccine would not be effective Believed the vaccine was for others, not them P arents, and mothers in particular, struggle with balancing what they see as the benefits and risks of getting their children vaccinated. Their children and family are extremely important to them; the safety of their child trumps concerns for the overall community As with adults in general, attitudes toward vaccines in general carry over to the H1N1 vaccine Many parents are aware of reports that vaccines can cause serious side effects, such as autism With informal parent networks and the Internet, the strong counsel of health care providers is not always convincing There were some clear, consistent themes throughout the focus group discussions. The H1N1 outbreak was \"over hyped\" The public got mixed messages - they were convinced to be scared of contracting H1N1 and then told there was an inadequate supply of vaccine A lack of a sense of urgency among many to get the v accine APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-39 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Message content needs to resonate with the public, build public trust, and push back against doubts. Use imagery around protecting and keeping children s afe; participants expressed strong preferences for written and visual ads with this message Personalize the consequences of contracting the viru s Leverage the concern for children and other vulnerab le populations by directly talking about the impact if a caregiver or someone who comes in contact with these populations exposes them to the virus Meet head-on what many thought was the overuse of sc are tactics, acknowledging the disconnect between the anticipated versus actual scope of the outbreak Meet head-on the disconnect between urging people to get vaccinated when there was a vaccine shortage Respond to request for a more straightforward presen tation of what is known about the H1N1 virus and vaccine - both pros and cons - while at the same time maintaining the appropriate level of urgency for getting vaccinated Coach health care providers, and pediatricians in pa rticular, on how to deliver consistent advice and how to best talk with parents about vaccinating their children Focus on those who are still trying to make a decisi on, as some parents and others will never be convinced; explore whether parent to parent communication channels can be used to influence attitudes Message delivery needs to use trusted messengers and mechanisms that will reach different populations. Trusted messengers include health care providers and schools Opinions differ about local public health department s; in communities like Pendleton and Bend where they are highly regarded, information from them is trusted and remembered While television may not be viewed as the most credi ble messenger, it is clearly the most effective way to reach large numbers of people Bend participants in particular want bi-lingual writ ten materials sent through the mail or home from schools T he focus group findings are strikingly similar to the survey findings, down to demographic differences; in addition to validation, the focus groups offer elaboration on some aspects, such as: How much concerns about vaccines in general carry ov er to the H1N1 vaccine Learning more forcefully than in the survey how esse ntial mothers and other caregivers are to ensuring their children get vaccinated Parents are especially susceptible to misinformation about vaccine risks to their children, including the \"cumulative effect\" of so many vaccines and the link to autism The influence of informal parent to parent informati on networks in shaping changing attitudes toward vaccines The strong negative influence of past personal exper ience with or knowledge of someone who had flu vaccine side effects How much some people lacked a sense of urgency about either contracting the virus or getting the vaccine APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-40 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS III. KEY FINDINGS A. Associations with H1N1 Vaccine \"The shot is unneeded.\" (Portland) \"Was constantly in the news, but there was a severe shortage of doses.\" (Portland) \"Did not become a pandemic like they said it would.\" (Medford) \"Scary - everyone worried about it; \"I believe in [vaccines], but didn't have the normal trial research and study.\" (Medford) When asked what came to mind when participants thought about the H1N1 vaccine, much of the imagery was similar (Appendix D). Words and terms that came up most often were: unsafe, scary/frightening, unnecessary/unneeded, overblown/over hyped, and shortages. The imagery, often on the negative side, reflected to some extent participants' attitudes toward vaccinations in general. Many are conflicted about how to balance what they understand are the benefits and risks. This is especially true for parents of children, who have heard about the relationship between vaccines and autism and are uncertain and conflicted about the cumulative impact of what one described as \"...giving children too many vaccines too quickly.\" A small minority of people do not believe in vaccines. Some participants, unprompted, brought up the success of past vaccines for diseases like polio, whooping cough, and other childhood diseases. While acknowledging past benefits, as noted in the recent Frontline special there seemed to be a loss of a \"community recollection,\" in large part due to the success of vaccinations - people don't see these diseases anymore. They also seemed less convinced about more modern vaccines, noting flu vaccines can fail to target the right virus and may cause side effects. The Portland group recorded their written ideas about vaccines in general (Appendix B) and their contribution to health (Appendix C). Initial associations were mixed, with more either descriptive or negative. Positive associations focused on disease prevention, while negative associations mentioned side effects, cost, and whether or not they are necessary. Only three in nine people said vaccinations improve health a great deal. B. Who Did Get the H1N1 Vaccine, Where, and Why \"Being around a lot of elementary kids, there are a lot of germs...I wanted to prevent myself from getting it.\" (Pendleton) \"My son [and] I got it...his pediatrician said he needed it.\" (Pendleton) \"My mom because she's older and sick.\" (Medford) \"My wife had the disease when the vaccine became available.\" (Portland) \"Heard it at school. They sent me something they were going to vaccinate kids, but that was it. They got vaccinated.\" (Bend) APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-41 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Some participants had gotten the H1N1 vaccine themselves (Appendix F). The main reasons included thinking it was the right thing to do, having a lot of contact with children or the pubic, and being caregivers to a child or someone else they did not want to either expose to the disease or risk being unable to care for if they got the H1N1 virus. Many more reported that someone in their household had gotten the vaccine (Appendix F). Children were by far the most likely to have received the vaccine. Bend participants in particular mentioned schools requesting permission to immunize their child. Others reported personal doctors and pediatricians advising them to get the shot, or just knowing they were in a high- risk group. Some in the high- risk group felt the vaccine might not be safe for them. The main places they or someone in their household received the vaccine were at school, their doctor or pediatrician's office, county health department, health clinics, or a local pharmacy. Setting their personal views aside, participants identified on their own reasons why someone would want to get the H1N1 vaccine (Appendix G): Contact with lots of children or members of the publ ic Care providers Members of a high risk or vulnerable group Doctor's request/advice Employer request/requirement Sense of security/safety Not transmit to others A nother less tangible reason was either knowing someone personally or learning of a community member who had died from the H1N1 virus. Pendleton participants in particular noted the impact of that kind of information. For some, especially parents on behalf of their children, the decision to get the H1N1 vaccine was a difficult balancing act. As a Bend participant said, \"I debated [whether] or not to do it. I kept reading the pros and cons. I was not really sure what to do.\" Asked what affected the decision, one Bend participant said, \"Because I kept seeing a lot of kids dying and I didn't want to see that happen to my kids.\" Unprompted, participants covered the prepared reasons for getting the H1N1 vaccine. When asked to rank the best, second and third best prepared reasons, the following came out on top (Appendix I): Persons were at high risk for infection Have small children/children exposed at school The Pendleton group also ranked \"preventative measures taken for safety\" fairly high. In the discussions about reasons to get the H1N1 vaccine, concern about one's own child and, to a lesser degree, someone else requiring care, was more important for many than concern about preventing the disease from spreading in the community. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-42 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS There were varied levels of awareness about who had priority for getting the H1N1 vaccine. Some believed the elderly were in that group, and others were unsure. However, many were able to identify that pregnant women, children, health care workers, and emergency medical personnel had priority for the vaccine. Several also identified those at risk due to other health problems. Very few participants had personally contracted the H1N1 flu virus, although many had family or friends who had. Some were frustrated trying to reach their health care provider, and when they did, they were told to stay home without a confirmed diagnosis or got inconsistent information. C. Why Didn't People Get the H1N1 Vaccine \"I tried to get it, but I didn't meet the criteria on the pharmacy screening list.\" (Pendleton) \"How effective is it. You hear in the media every year get a flu shot...then that's not the strain of flu going around.\" (Pendleton) \"We felt it was unnecessary and we were both in agreement.\" (Portland) \"When I have a choice, I don't get shots.\" (Medford) \"I just don't do shots...have had only one flu shot in my whole life and I kind of got the flu...\" (Pendleton) \"I wanted to get the vaccine also. I went to a health center, and they said they didn't have enough for adults.\" (Bend) Participants offer, unprompted, reasons why someone would not get the H1N1 vaccine (Appendix H). Not a member of a high risk group/not needed Unsafe/Concern about side effects (e.g. getting sick from the shot; autism) Not available/shortage Untested Ineffective H1N1 \"blown out of proportion\" Cost M any of those not in a priority group did not seem to have a sense of urgency; they believed the vaccine was for others. As a Pendleton participant commented, \"I didn't feel a need to do it. I felt like [there were] other people out there who needed it...I didn't have enough concern.\" They also often noted that the vaccine wasn't available to them when H1N1 was at its peak; when the vaccine became available it seemed like everything had blown over. Some had heard of the idea that some were much less at risk because of earlier exposure in past years. Participants also ranked prepared reasons for not getting the H1N1 vaccine, with the following coming out on top (Appendix I): Vaccine shortage Didn't think it was safe APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-43 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Medford participants ranked both \"didn't think it was safe\" and \"didn't need it/unnecessary\" higher than in Pendleton, reflecting concerns expressed during the group discussion. There was discussion in the Portland group as well that the vaccine was not needed. A few Portland and Medford participants went so far as to call concerns about the H1N1 outbreak \"a hoax\" or \"sham.\" Vaccine safety issues came up unprompted in all groups, but very little in Bend. They mostly centered around the relationship to autism in children, flu vaccines causing the flu, other bad reactions to vaccines, and not enough time to test the H1N1 vaccine for safety and effectiveness. Participants who had perceptions about, knowledge of, or personal experience with these safety issues had far more entrenched negative opinions about both flu and other vaccines, including H1N1. Many comments reflected misinformation about the autism issue, similar to what was explored in a recent Frontline special on vaccines. A couple of participants described how their opinions had evolved over time, starting out positive or accepting toward vaccines and becoming more negative or resistant as they heard about safety issues from a variety of sources such as friends, the Internet, and the media. D. Information and Messages Received \"Nightly news portraying it as an epidemic.\" (Pendleton) \"Heard [the vaccine] was very limited; that had access.\" (Bend) \"A stop sign [at school]; something like, if you feel you have the flu, stay home and don't pass it on.\" (Medford) \"It could be so terrible; wipe out whole communities; how bad it was going to be.\" (Portland) \"Have to be in a high risk group to get it .\" (Pendleton) Some of the key messages they identified hearing were: Potential for a pandemic Vaccine shortage Possible death among high risk groups Can make you seriously ill Have to be in a high risk group to get it Prevention tips T here was an underlying sense that the public was getting mixed messages. Part of this was due to the strong message about how dangerous H1N1 could be, and then being told there wasn't any vaccine. As expressed in an exchange in the Pendleton group: \"I think it was over hyped\" and \"... then they turn around and tell you there's no vaccine available.\" Issues related to a shortage of the H1N1 vaccine and which groups had priority were discussed in all groups (see also Appendix E). Nearly all said there was a shortage, especially in the Portland and Pendleton groups. Many agreed that they had changed habits like hand washing/sanitizing and how they sneezed as a result of messages they received. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-44 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS While most seemed to think they had gotten enough (and sometimes too much) information about the H1N1 virus, a notable number would have liked more objective, straightforward information about the pros and cons of getting the vaccine (Appendix J). They especially wanted this type of information about how the vaccine was tested, possible side effects, and the consequences of not getting it. Many objected to what they described as \"scare tactics.\" On the other hand, many were not clear about why people were dying from H1N1. While there was some confusion, especially in the Bend and Medford groups, many participants were able to identify one or more categories of people who had priority for the vaccine. Unprompted, they offered: pregnant women, children, health care and emergency medical workers, those who have contact with children, and at-risk adults. Several, especially in Portland and Pendleton, included the elderly in the priority group. The news, especially TV, was a pervasive source of information. Pendleton and Bend participants in particular identified their county health department as a source of information. Some mentioned flyers they had received in the mail and information provided by their doctor or employer. Bend participants were more likely to get much of their information about H1N1 from schools their children attended, and were less likely to say they had gotten enough information. They were clear that they wanted information in Spanish and preferred mail far more than the other groups, in part because many do not have cable TV. As one commented, \"Through the mail would be the most effective way...if I see information in writing I can take the time to read it thoroughly.\" Nearly all Bend participants did not use the Internet. Many said they would watch an informational DVD sent by mail or through the schools, and would be motivated to attend an informational session if there was free food or some other small gift: \"Anytime there's free food, we'll be there.\" E. Best Messages - Written and Visual Participants were presented with both written (translated orally in Bend) (Appendix K) and visual messages. The following written message ranked high: \"Protect yourself and those you care for. Get the vaccine, not the flu.\" Reasons why they liked this message included: \"Short and to the point.\" ( Portland) \"It start out as a command.\" ( Medford) \"The emphasis is on getting the my family is my life.\" ( Medford) \"Better talk to me about protecting myself and my ki ds.\" (Bend) Another written message that ranked high was: \"Get your flu shot. Protect yourself, your family, and those in your community from the flu.\" Reasons why they liked this message included: APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-45 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS \"Because when you don't have protection you contamin ate everybody.\" (Medford) \"Because you are protecting the ones you care for mo st as well as doing a public service by not allowing the disease to spread.\" (Portland) \"If the community gets infected, then we get infecte d too.\" (Bend) Some were far more receptive than others to the need to protect their community. The far stronger priority focused on those closest to them, especially children. For the visual ads, the image with the mother and child was the most preferred by far. Reasons why they liked this image included: \"If I see a photo of a kid like that, I would probab ly pay attention to it.\" (Bend) \"Clearly communicates you have to protect and take care of and love your kids.\" (Bend) \"I like it because it is inviting and warm.\" ( Pendleton) \"It affects me more personally as I have a wife and kids.\" (Portland) \"Children catch your eye.\" ( Medford) \"Because the picture gives you a sense of wellness, peace, and calmness about something that is scary.\" (Pendleton) There were some, however, who either strongly preferred the Superman image or felt both should be used. Reasons why they liked this image better included: \"It stands out, it reaches all age groups.\" ( Pendleton) \"Because it shows that even the strongest can become ill.\" (Portland) \"I t [Superman] would be attractive to kids, too .\" (Bend) The opinion expressed in Bend - \" the whole idea about superman doesn't do it for me\" - was more common. F. Final Advice for Public Health Officials \"Share as much of the facts as possible to gain the public trust.\" (Medford) \"Explain the pros and cons about the vaccine.\" (Pendleton) \"Don't try to scare people into getting the shot. Show more positive ads that encourage people to follow through.\" (Medford) \"Don't encourage people so heavily to get the vaccine if the production isn't up to speed! Otherwise, it just feels like a scare tactic.\" (Portland) \"I want the truth. I want facts. I don't want drama.\" (Pendleton) \"Give as much information as you have .\" (Portland) \"Distribute information through trusted advisors.\" (Pendleton) Much of the final advice for health officials centered around straightforward presentation of accurate and complete information (Appendix M). Many either directly or indirectly felt it important to counter what they felt overstated the dangers of the outbreak and did not adequately present the benefits and risks of getting the H1N1 vaccine. Several commented they felt they were not getting consistent APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-46 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS information; that they would hear something different from different sources, like their doctor and the local health department. Many talked about \"restoring public trust\" and talked about the credibility gap in communications. Much revolved around the \"hype\" about the dangers, and then no vaccine. Underlying some comments was the distrust of government that is pervasive right now. As a Medford participant said, \"They talked about doing it [getting the vaccine] to prevent for safety reasons and not give to someone else, but yet you couldn't get it - it was gone.\" In Bend another noted the apparent contradiction by saying, \"If in reality this is something you really, really need, but the government isn't even sure [because it's not available].\" Asked about credible messengers, the following were high on their list: Personal doctor/pediatrician Schools Local health department I n spite of the high rating for health care providers, parent participants did not always take the advice of their child's pediatrician. This issue was more fully explored on the recent Frontline show on vaccines. Parent comments indicated they were susceptible to other influences like the media, the Internet, and more informal parent-to-parent communications. It was clear from the discussions that participants got a great deal of information from television, even though they did not always see it as one of the more credible messengers. Some also relied on the Internet. To close the discussions, we asked for participant associations with health care reform (Appendix N). Comments ranged widely from very positive - \"Needs to happen. Health care is too expensive.\" to very negative - \"Dangerous for government control.\" Many were either unsure or undecided.

Group 1 Not needed.//Vaccines target a specific virus that may or may not be the virus causing the illness or disease. So, the H1N1 vaccine may not prevent swine flu. Sham and scam.//Outdated virus that mutates with each infection. Vaccine is often a year or several generations behind. The shot is unneeded.//The vaccine will be likely to make me sick. Spread of disease not as protected. NR//Government should have more funding to promote dosages for more people. Sickening disease. For more people. Unsafe. Unclear ingredients.//So many ingredients and there was not conclusive evidence that it was safe. Pregnant women and elderly were not to take it and only a small section of the population could have caught it and it could make people sicker. Bird flu.//Large risk worldwide. Highly publicized. Maybe over-hyped. I got vaccinated against it. My wife had it. Big scare, but not so bad.//It was so new and I would have waited a while to see or hear if there were any immediate negative side effects, but we were so scared by publicity that we took it immediately. Overhyped and skeptical.//Was constantly in the news, but there was a severe shortage of doses. By the time it became available it seemed like the worst of the swine flu was over. Freak out.//Seemed like there was so much fear and anxiety and this vaccine and its availability and effectiveness. Group 2 Scary. My son.//I think about my son and all the little kids and older people that can't fight it off. Overblown.//A lot of hype. Vaccine distribution was poorly handled. I had H1N1 and was given medication. Made me very nervous. Don't like new shots. Never had any shots until I was older. Autism. Flu vaccine.//It is against the flu, prevents infection, prevents us from getting sick, and against contamination. Disease, frightening sickness.//Media. Medicine sometimes can strike too much fear, however, our advancements in medicine and media can save lives. Don't need it.//It was scary when news, etc. talked about deaths. When it comes to vaccines are they really sure on long term side effects? Was it really any worse than the regular flu? Scary, people wearing masks.//News media, people walking around with a mask on their faces, hoping to avoid it. A little scary for me and my son. Looking into it with the doctor and got one shot for him and for me. Unnecessary, government scam.//I feel that this is a very unnecessary vaccine, it has not been around long enough or had enough research for me to test. I did not get the vaccine, neither did my kids and we're still here. I believe it may have been a government plot to scare people. Illness prevention.//Didn't get me, more for middle aged people and I probably didn't need it. Big hoax.//Did not become a big pandemic like they said it would. Glad I didn't chance getting the shot. Maybe made up to scare people to begin with. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-52 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Group 3 Oh no, what next.//There are so many new diseases going around and no one can know what, where, or when because we do not know where it came from and why. Disease\u2014scary.//Probably because I don't know a lot about it and usually it was given to the elderly and those that had medical issues first. Then it was made available to the public. Not sure how effective it is.//Some shots do not affect the virus going around. I personally do not take flu or such shots because I did once and was sick all winter. I'm sure it does help some people. It was craziness.//Scary\u2014everyone worried about it, not enough vaccine. When first came out it was always on news\u2014craziness. Many people getting vaccinations.//First group to receive vaccines\u2014children, pregnant women, people with respiratory issues. Also, people with exposure\u2014health care field. Second group\u2014 opened up to other people in the population. Hard to get initially, but glad.//I was very frustrated at how long I had to wait to get it but as a substitute teacher, I'm glad to finally have the protection. Available to everyone.//Information was incorrect at first\u2014panic for kids, young people. Actually too much hype. It turned out to be similar to other diseases. How much the world is changing and the dangers we don't see.//We live in the best possible country on the planet yet we still have little to no control on all the different possible viruses/diseases. Bad news.//I would like to know more about it and what it is going to do in the long run. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-53 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Appendix E Was the H1N1 vaccine always widely available or was there a shortage?//H1N1 vaccine was first available to select people called a priority group.

Group 1 Specific locations that were announced in my doctor's office.//No.//*Thought it was useless. My wife thought it could cause a more serious problem. Local clinic, pharmacy, county health offices.//No!//*Ineffective. Hype! Side effects. The reality of a pandemic never surfaced. Only at locations that were offered or broadcasted.//No.//We felt it was unnecessary and we were both in agreement. Lots of pharmacies at many places like Safeway or Fred Meyer, and at doctor's offices.//No.//*Not necessary. Expensive. Drugstores, medical clinics, doctor's offices, hospitals, and other places.//No.//*I'm allergic to eggs and cannot get flu vaccines and would probably not get it anyway because I was concerned that the vaccine was not safe because there was not enough information about it.

I would not have gotten it because I did not consider it a serious threat. It's better to contract it and have the immunity. No, but my daughter did.//When I have a choice, I don't get shots.

OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Appendix L Which ad is the best ad and why? Group 1 Ad with woman and child. It affects me more personally as I have a wife and kids. Neither ad is best. Why vaccinate against a virus several generations ago? Get you and yours. To protect my family and friends. Get you and yours. It seems best because it shows another caring for her infant. It shows emotion. Get you and yours. It is better because it's not offensive. The language is inclusive of family and does not exclude anyone. I like the recommendation to stay at home if you're sick and to wash your hands. The picture is good. Superman. Because it shows that even the strongest can become ill. The other one shows two healthy and happy people. The mother and child. I think best because it shows \"caring\" for your loved ones and \"protecting\" the ones you love. Superman. Superman was always impervious to bad things and he was a pillar of strength. Woman with child. It's about caring/emotion which appeals to me. Group2 The Mom and baby. That's why I didn't want to get it because of my son and family. The Mom and baby. It is touching with an emphasis on caring. The family one. Get you and yours vaccinated\u2014not to contaminate everybody and your children. I like them both. Mother and child because it appeals to emotions as a mother. Superman because it appeals to my comical side. The woman and the baby. Because people relate to protecting children. It also tells you what to do if you get sick. Mother and child. It is the best because it hits home\u2014what wouldn't a mother or father do for their child? The mother with the baby. It is better to me because it speaks to me like saying love your baby like she does and get vaccinated. Superman. It's funny, but doesn't make fun of a serious subject. It's memorable. Good detail\u2014 I love the teddy bear touch. It also says that even strong people shouldn't be embarrassed about getting the vaccine. Mother and child. It gets your attention. Group 3 Mother and child. Because the vaccines are to protect you and your family and the people around you that you care for. Mom and baby. Brings more personal touch into the home. More touchy/feely. Women and child. More feeling, reality to family and child. More impact to me. Superman. It stands out, it reaches all age groups. It says no matter how tough you are, you can get it. Mother and baby. I like it because it is inviting and warm. It makes you want to protect the baby. The Superman one is funny. Superman. It's less emotional, generic character drives home the message. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-67 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Mother and child. It appeals to core, sincerity, and responsible to others especially those who are helpless and need protection. Mother and child. Because the picture gives you a sense of wellness, peace, and calmness about something that is scary. Images of a mother is always comforting so it reinforces a positive message rather than helplessness. Superman. It is good because kids can relate to him. As an adult I think the other one is best. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-68 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Appendix M What final advice do you have for health officials about how to communicate with people about the importance of getting vaccines like H1N1 or the swine flu vaccine? Group 1 Give as possible, the most exact and scientifically accurate information regarding the risks of spreading the disease, effects of the disease, and what effect the vaccine will have, both positive and negative. Save your money and health. Boost your immunity through nutrition\u2014antioxidants. Wash your hands frequently. Sanitize your keyboard, door handles, and common surfaces. Cover your mouth when sneezing. Use something that the person will be concerned with. Something that will touch them. Something close to their hearts. Do not dramatize. Have more information on side effects, cause of the disease/virus origin and an information pamphlet. Talk about the ingredients in depth. Have informative meetings, Internet, and TV sports that explain the ingredients. Consider those who should not get the vaccine and talk about them and what ingredients in the vaccine would have adverse effects. Have debates\u2014public and open with other healthcare officials and scientists about the benefits and detriments of the vaccine because people don't want to do their research. Doctors need to give their patients frank advice on the pros and cons of getting the vaccine. Tell the patient the risks in a statistical form, e.g. one in 10 million. Give as much information as you have already. Explain how it works and why it is important. The pros and cons so that people can make up their own minds. Don't encourage people so heavily to get the vaccine if the production isn't up to speed! Otherwise, it just begins to feel like a scare tactic. State the information honestly. How it was tested, potential side effects, and alternatives to the vaccine. Don't use fear to motivate, please. Group 2 I think they did a good job of getting it out there. Distribute information through trusted advisors\u2014doctors. Emphasize stopping the spread at pandemic. Offer website info with research sources to back claims. NR Communicate with other people through television, notice in the mail, and news. Have a pamphlet ready to go for the people to read. Have signs all over the community. To go about communicating the best I believe is to share as much of the facts as possible to gain the public trust. Once you have trust, you are more likely to have a better response in marketing and making it available. Make a brochure on the issue. List the symptoms. Tell about stats on how many deaths have occurred and how many deaths could possibly be prevented if you have the vaccine. Mail it, put them at the grocery store bulletin boards\u2014post it everywhere! Communicate with people. Create emphasis on the people (physicians, doctors, pediatricians) to talk to their patients about vaccines. Their patients will tell others\u2014word of mouth marketing. Physicians provide pamphlets of websites, etc. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-69 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS It is important to offer advice to people that they understand. I would like to know more facts about the specifics of the vaccine. I need to know when it was approved, how it was tested, side effects long and short term. Use a variety of messages\u2014not just one. Everybody else likes the ad with the baby, but I liked the ad with Superman. Different audiences are receptive to different messages. Find out how different messages hit different groups of people, parents, youth, and different ethnic groups. Use a variety of media also. Don't try to scare people into getting the shot. Show more positive ads that encourage people to follow through. Group 3 Please get the facts before the shot. How people refer to different websites for facts. Be aware of all health facts before you get any vaccination. They maybe give you something you don't need. Be up front with us. Get accurate information out there. Make it more available. Less expensive. More advertising on all vaccines. Make a universal symbol for the poster so it is recognized\u2014so you know what it is\u2014like the pink ribbon for breast cancer. Need to inform public true pros and cons of disease. Don't make conflicting statement or data and scare everyone when the vaccine is not available. Advertise places like CDC or such whose research can be done by individuals. Make sure doctors have up to date data for people not able to have computer access. Get correct and accurate information. Explain pros and cons about the vaccine. More resources and availability. Do your own research. Make information easily available/accessible for general population. The information needs to be clear and concise. Easy to understand and remember. Use multi-media to access different populations\u2014Internet, television, newspapers, pamphlets, town hall meetings, doctor's emphasis, etc. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-70 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Appendix N What comes to mind when you think of health care reform? Initial thoughts and elaboration. Group 1 Impossible.//There are so many different groups juxtaposed to a particular type of plan that it cannot happen. Government takeover.//All this is a power grab to have more control over people in order to dominate them. You control where and when they can go for treatment. It is good for those who need it.//Some of us have good health care, but there are many people that don't. A big concern is children. Needs to be done, but it is stressful.//Medical care is not available to enough people. Reform will be a huge hassle to many. Assertive. Diet.//People being engaged and able to get medical care and changing their lifestyle with information that allows them to live a life of preventative measures to protect their health. Simple charge scale.//Why do insurance companies pay less for medical charges than an uninsured person. Look at EOB charges vs. allowed. We need it!//Should be everyone's right to be healthy! Makes our society stronger. Finally! Long way to go, though.//It's been long overdue. Implementing the new law will be difficult and interesting to see as time goes along. Obama.//A priority\u2014finally for our current president. Group 2 Not sure.//There's all different kinds of things. Negative.//Vote for candidates who understand limited role of federal government and original intent of writers of the Constitution. Undecided. Be educational. Scary/chaos.//I do not feel that this would be less organized. Enthusiastic\u2014a way to get health care for people.//Government stepping in to force things. Hoping now my husband's employer will have to provide health insurance for its employees. Not completely sure.//We needed it for so long, but now it is too late. Satisfied.//I worry about how much it will cost our country. It causes a great deal of stress because we cannot afford to pay for it or have millions uninsured. Yes! Now!//Health care is too expensive\u2014my husband and I pay $10,000 a year in insurance premiums with a $7,500 deductible. I don't know what this will go up to in the next 3 years. I am self-employed and this is a major problem for us. Government intrusion\u2014angry.//The government is intruding into too many things in our life. Stay out of the relationship between me and my doctor. Group 3 Satisfied.//The health oh no great. I don't want them to tell me what I can and cannot do. Oh my gosh!!!//What is our country in for now? Will it work? Are we going to go into debt? Will it actually help people? Needs help.//Needs to work to help the public as a whole. Things seem to miss groups of people in real need. Sometimes it feels too political. APPENDIX N: VACCINATION SURVEY AND N-71 OREGON VACCINE FOCUS GROUPS REPORTS Opinionated.//Everybody has a different view on how things should be run and what needs to happen with the future of health care\u2014opinions. Needs to happen. Health care is too expensive. Many people are going bankrupt due to healthcare bills. Also, many people not getting care they need due to costs. Insurance companies are making major profits. Make it available to everyone.//It shouldn't be inaccessible to any citizen. No insurance should price you out of receiving care. Pool plan! We need help and this will not deliver what has been promised.//It is poorly conceived\u2014we have been told everyone will get it, not enough doctors, etc for facilities. Needs work. Dangerous for government control.//Our government has demonstrated that they can do what people want in many areas of our lives. You never know who you can actually trust. Even though they are elected officials it seems our government is constantly contradicting themselves. Who's going to truly be accountable for the ups and downs? Money, money.//Insurance is going up out of control. It needs to be capped off.
