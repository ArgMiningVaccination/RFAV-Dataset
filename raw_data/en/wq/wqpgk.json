Their vision became The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS). Forty years ago, President Nixon signed the National Cancer Act, elevating curing cancer to a national priority. Since then, we have gone from talking about cancer, to talking about cancers \u2014 from cure to cures. With microscopes, researchers saw different types of leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. Then, with amazing technologies that took decades to develop, researchers found molecular abnormalities that can cause cancers, and thereby found more subtypes, and even more cancers. With this information, we've gone from killing every dividing cell, including healthy cells, to putting cancer cells in the bullseye. State-of-the-art molecular tests can find specific abnormalities and new molecularly \"targeted\" therapies can selectively kill cancer cells. LLS-funded researchers have led the way with advances like Rituxan \u00ae, Gleevec\u00ae and Velcade\u00ae. LLS is still funding academic scientists to make the discoveries that can provide every blood cancer patient a safe and effective therapy. In 2011 alone, LLS funded hundreds of scientists around the world. In this report, you will read five of their stories, showing we are closer to cures than ever. As the researchers say, it's just a matter of time and money, and LLS is providing the dollars that can shorten the days. For some blood cancers, the knowledge base is so great that LLS can now drive lab advances to clinical trials, even faster, through strategic alliances. One of these stories is here too. LLS is partnering with a biotechnology company to accomplish the clinical trial that may lead to approval by the Food and Drug Administration of a new drug for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Importantly, scientists have begun to find similarities between cancers too. Drugs that were first approved to help patients with a specific subtype of blood cancer, are showing promise or are already approved as treatments for patients with other blood cancers and even solid tumors. This is a critical time. We are on the threshold of amazing new breakthroughs. We present to you, our 2011 top stories. John e. WaLter President and CEO Scott carro LL Chair2 Beating pediatric cancer S iS anything But kid S' Stuff Step By Step, from the LaB to cLinica L tria LS to Saving LiveS Susan Rheingold, MD, is conducting clinical and translational research focusing on acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in children and adolescents. \"Research has already led to improvements in outcomes for young ALL patients \u2014 80% of pediatric patients are cured with frontline therapy,\" says Rheingold. Rheingold adds however that some young patients still succumb to their cancers, or pay for their cures lifelong owing to the toxicities of standard treatments. In the past several years, Rheingold's ability to predict which ALL patients are at high risk of relapse has improved, based upon cutting-edge molecular tests. Rheingold says, \"Using those same tests, we can develop better anti-leukemia drugs that will target the abnormalities that make some children's ALL more aggressive.\" New therapies that specifically inhibit cancer-promoting molecules can be safer and more effective than today's treatments. \"Ideally these new, designer drugs will lead to increased cure rates for these young patients.\" of mice and chi Ldren A molecule called mTOR has been implicated in multiple cancers. \"My colleague, Stephen Grupp, MD, PhD, and his laboratory showed a drug that inhibits mTOR can kill ALL cells and increase survival in leukemic mice. With LLS funding, we translated this exciting laboratory finding into a Phase I clinical trial of an oral mTOR inhibitor (called sirolimus) for children and adolescents with relapsed acute leukemias and lymphomas,\" says Rheingold. Rheingold goes on to explain, \"We performed laboratory studies in 'real time' with leukemia cells collected from the children who enrolled in the clinical trial. This is giving us important clues as to which combinations of drugs might work even better than mTOR inhibitors alone.\" 3 triaLS, tria LS and more tria LS Rheingold is currently leading a Phase II trial of sirolimus combined with oral methotrexate for young patients with relapsed/refractory ALL or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. And more good news: a successful trial led to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of another mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus. To try to get even better outcomes, a new trial combining this drug with a standard ALL chemotherapy will be done through the Children's Oncology Group (COG). And another early-phase clinical trial will combine temsirolimus with a standard chemotherapy for pediatric patients with relapsed cancers. the LLS impact Rheingold explains, \"I care for patients every week. Without the money from LLS to do the research, write and run clinical trials, this work would not get done. The impact LLS has on my patients and families as far as emotional support, education conferences and materials, family connections and outreach programs is invaluable. LLS provides it all.\"one moLecuLe: up cLoSe and per SonaL inSight S cou Ld Be the key to Saving LiveS Katherine Borden, PhD, is working to develop new therapies that target specific molecular abnormalities in cancer cells. She is using multiple high-tech approaches to understand one particular molecule in great detail. \"We discovered that too much of a factor called eIF4E can cause cells to become cancerous and that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells typically have a lot of it, especially M4 and M5 AML cases. This molecule normally controls when and how much RNA is turned into proteins,\" notes Borden. \"But we think this molecule can be a key to controlling at least some types of AML.\" Something o Ld, Something ne W, Something recyc Led RNA is the critical intermediary step between genes and the functional proteins they encode, and abnormalities that change the levels of specific RNAs have long been associated with cancer formation. Other LLS-funded investigators have shown that many blood cancers harbor anomalies in networks of molecules that normally control specific RNA production, including the mTOR molecule. New designer drugs that inhibit these molecules are being tested as anti-cancer drugs. Borden clarifies, \"We are instead focused on eIF4E and on re-purposing an old anti-viral drug called ribavirin that blocks viral replication by blocking eIF4E activity. 4 a BuLLSeye for ne W targeted treatment S Zeroing in on the achiLLe'S heeL in mu LtipLe cancer S Robert Orlowski, MD, PhD, is focused on helping patients with multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas. He uses laboratory models to validate new molecular targets and test new targeted therapies. \"Our laboratory studies led to a more detailed understanding of myeloma and lymphoma biology, allowing us to make clinical advances with new molecularly targeted therapies,\" says Orlowski. \"We helped show that bortezomib, now known as Velcade \u00ae, potently inhibits the proteasome and can safely and effectively kill myeloma cells.\" The proteasome is an enzyme complex that degrades damaged or otherwise defective proteins. Cancer cells in particular depend on proteasomes because they are so full of abnormal proteins; inhibiting the proteasome can kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Orlowski and colleagues went on to show that Velcade works especially well when combined with another drug called Doxil \u00ae, leading to the FDA approval of this combination for myeloma patients. And it looks like proteasome inhibitors will work against a wide range of cancers. Velcade is also FDA approved for certain lymphoma patients and is showing promise in clinical trials for patients with other blood cancers as well as solid tumors.eIF4E has never been targeted in a cancer therapy before, but we showed it can stop the growth of leukemia cells in the laboratory.\" With her clinical colleagues, Borden just completed a clinical trial of ribavirin for patients with M4 and M5 types of AML.Ribavirin was well-tolerated, consistent with decades of its safe use to control viral infections. And, there were substantial clinical benefits, including remissions. Borden says \"I am currently leading a Canada-wide clinical trial, supported by LLS, to test ribavirin in combination with low dose cytarabine for AML patients. There's hope that the combination will be even more effective than either drug alone.\" She goes on, \"It's important to note that roughly 30% of all human cancers are characterized by eIF4E abnormalities, so there are implications beyond leukemia for our work.\" partnering With LLS Three back-to-back Translational Research grants from LLS and support from the Therapy Acceleration Program took Borden from early laboratory clues to clinical trials. Explains Borden, \"The advice I've received from the LLS Research Department staff and Medical & Scientific Committee members has been instrumental in the design and interpretation of my clinical trials.\" \"Without LLS support, none of this work would have been possible at all. I am deeply grateful to LLS and its many supporters,\" says Borden. 5 9 on the Way to he Lping even more patient S Orlowski notes, \"My lab is now working on even more effective proteasome inhibitors, as well as drugs that target other myeloma- and lymphoma-associated molecules, including a lymphoid growth factor known as IL-6.\" Orlowski's laboratory results have advanced carfilzomib, which the FDA recently put on the \"Fast Track\" for full approval. And, he and his colleagues are testing the IL-6 blocking antibody drug, siltuximab, for patients with newly diagnosed, symptomatic multiple myeloma.They are using the new drug to improve a common drug combination that just doesn't work well enough for many patients. LLS and orLoWSki After first receiving funding from LLS in 1999, Orlowski studied the experimental drug now known as Velcade. Orlowski points out, \"Most recently, LLS funded our studies of carfilzomib. We showed potent activity against multiple myeloma cells in 2007, and now the drug is helping patients.\" \"The many supporters who help fund LLS research are the reasons that I can do the work I do.\"cLoSing in on vaccine S to prevent reLapSe heLping immune ce LLS BLock cancer Larry Kwak, MD, PhD, is on a mission. He's learning how to help a patient's own immune system deal cancer a deadly blow. \"Blood cancer patients actually have cancer in their immune systems,\" explains Kwak. \"And, most of today's chemotherapies further weaken these important cells.\" There's actually a weak immune response at the onset of cancer that is somehow shut down. Kwak is developing vaccines that can bolster these anti-cancer responses and help blood cancer patients live longer, healthy lives. outSmarting cancer Kwak first worked on a cancer vaccine for patients with a B-cell cancer called follicular lymphoma. \"To make the vaccine, we purified unique, 'idiotype' protein from each patient's malignant B cells. In a very large clinical trial, these customized vaccines were given back to patients after they had achieved remissions with a multi-drug therapy that was standard at the time,\" says Kwak. 6 The customized vaccines prevented relapses, but not for every patient. So, Kwak went back to work. In Texas, Kwak and his LLS-funded team are working on vaccines for leukemia, myeloma and lymphoma patients, to be used after or even instead of chemotherapy. \"Our work tells us that vaccines will be part of the therapeutic answer to many cancers. A vaccine has been approved for prostate cancer patients and my old colleagues at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) are making great progress on an anti- melanoma vaccine.\" \"educated\" immune ceLLS and What they're teaching u S In one of his LLS-funded projects, Kwak is developing a vaccine in which healthy donors are immunized with purified myeloma proteins and then the educated immune T cells are collected and given to myeloma patients along with a stem cell transplant. A first clinical trial has just been successfully completed, with no clinical complications. To make the approach more broadly useful, Kwak says, \"We are doing additional laboratory studies to learn if we can effectively immunize healthy T cells in the laboratory rather than in the donor.\" Kwak and his team are also learning which tumor-derived proteins can be successfully used in vaccinations for leukemia and lymphoma patients. And, in two other projects, they're testing antibodies that can reinvigorate immune cells that have been deactivated by the very cancer cells they should be fighting. A Phase II clinical trial is already underway using one approach to help follicular lymphoma patients. LLS \u2014 Steadfa St for re Search In 2007, LLS funding helped Kwak improve those lymphoma vaccines. In 2008, he received a prestigious, multi- million dollar grant from LLS, allowing Kwak and his team to work on myeloma and leukemia vaccines as well. And this year, Kwak received another grant from LLS to move a promising targeted therapy forward. \"We would not be making as much progress, or as fast, without LLS support,\" says Kwak. 7 Melnick worked with LLS-funded collaborators in Chicago to engineer an unusual, protein-based BCL6 inhibitor. By including a piece of a viral protein, this new drug can get into the nucleus of cancer cells where it kills them from the inside out. The drug, called RI-BPI, kills lymphomas growing in mice. And, it can help kill leukemia cells that are not sensitive to standard drugs, as Melnick has shown with yet another LLS-supported researcher in San Francisco. \"That's great news,\" says Melnick. \"And with additional financial help from LLS, we are getting the drug ready for clinical trials with the hope of helping patients with lymphoma and leukemia, and maybe even more than that.\" It turns out that BCL6 abnormalities are found in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer.croSS-country coLLaBoration caStS a Wider net for Succe SS neW drug for Lymphoma patient S iS Shining Light for other cancer patient S aS WeLL Ari Melnick, MD, is learning how to target master regulator molecules, or transcription factors, that can cause cancers when hyperactivated. He's focused on the BCL6 molecule in particular, a molecule which LLS-funded colleagues in New York found in aggressive cases of B-cell lymphoma. \"When we learned that the molecule must attach to certain co-factors to cause lymphomas, we discovered an entirely new way to kill lymphomas,\" says Melnick. \"In fact, transcription factors such as BCL6 play a central role in many cancers, but have proven difficult to target with typical drugs.\" neWLy diScovered epigenetic aBnorma LitieS can cau Se BLood cancer S too Genes can be mutated to cause cancers, but can also be changed by the addition of very small chemical groups in a process called methylation. In addition to his work with BCL6, Melnick is developing tests that can find these epigenetic abnormalities in specific cancer cases. He and his team have shown that aberrant DNA methylation occurs almost universally in leukemias and lymphomas, and occurs in genes that are not commonly mutated. Melnick points out, \"This new information will provide clues as to which patients need higher doses of standard therapies, and is also revealing potential targets for new therapies.\" Melnick believes that epigenomics will be just as critical as genomics to developing optimal treatments for patients with many different cancers. LLS \u2014 partner in progre SS LLS has been an avid supporter of Melnick and his work. \"All the research grants that I have received from LLS have helped me develop my research program, including the grant that helped me launch my BCL6 research. In fact, without LLS, we would simply not have gotten this far so fast. And, we're still going.\" 8 Seeing huge potentia L in a drug that StopS cancer in it S track S BLocking progre SSion to acute Leukemia Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company based in Newtown, PA and Princeton, NJ. It discovers and develops new drugs that target molecules involved in cellular processes that can go wrong in cancer cells. Scott Megaffin is senior vice president. Currently, Onconova is conducting clinical trials in the US and abroad for three candidate drugs. One of these, Estybon \u00ae , is a drug that inhibits multiple enzymes that many cancers especially need to proliferate. Early phase clinical trials have shown that Estybon can be safely used, with clinical responses in patients with solid tumors and blood cancers, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). eStyBon: reSiStance i S futi Le LLS already knew about Estybon through its support of a research team at Stanford University, led by Beverly Mitchell, MD. Team member Peter Greenberg, MD, led a Phase II clinical trial that showed the drug can be well-tolerated and help MDS patients at high risk of progression to AML. When these secondary AMLs evolve, they are usually undeterred by standard therapies. Estybon also helped patients whose disease had failed to respond to drugs known as hypomethylating agents, including Vidaza \u00ae and Dacogen\u00ae.LLS is now partnering with Onconova to advance Estybon as a treatment for MDS patients whose cancers are not controlled by available drugs and/or are likely to progress to AML. LLS will provide up to $10 million to support a multicenter, randomized, Phase III clinical trial that could lead to its approval by the FDA. \"Because MDS remains difficult to manage and options are very limited for patients who have a drug-resistant disease, new treatments are urgently needed,\" says Megaffin. acceLerating advance S LLS has committed substantial, multi- year funding to support this collaboration as part of its Therapy Acceleration Program. By partnering directly with biotechnology companies like Onconova, LLS is working to shorten the time it takes for potentially breakthrough therapies to obtain FDA approval, and reach the patients who need them. Megaffin says, \"We will be able to expedite this important clinical trial of Estybon due to the support we receive from LLS.\" Michael B. Hoffman, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Onconova, recently said in the press release describing this partnership, \"We are honored that LLS recognizes the potential of Estybon and is making a substantial investment with Onconova, in what we hope is a pivotal trial.\" 9 on the fo LLoWing page S are examp LeS of the progre SS We made in 2011 to WardS achieving our mi SSion to cure BLood cancer S and improve the qua Lity of Life of patient S and their fami LieS. 9 to Be toLd that you have cancer and to undergo cancer treatment i S tremendou SLy StreSSfuL...many peop Le find in retro Spect on Ly that the experience WaSn't a LL Bad...the 'neW norma L' can in Some WayS Be more re Warding and more gratifying than the o Ld norma L WaS.

Nearly 11,600 viewers gained insights on coping with fatigue, anxiety, depression and pain. Over 251,000 patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals attended LLS national telephone/web education programs, including new programs that were offered simultaneously in Spanish and Portuguese. More than 51,000 participants attended community-based LLS chapter education programs. More than 16,000 primary care providers, hematologist/oncologists and other healthcare providers participated in Strategies for Shared Care of Patients With Hematologic Malignancies. This online professional education activity, developed in partnership with Medscape Oncology, explores a multidisciplinary approach to managing hematologic cancer. information, referra L and financia L Support A diverse group of nearly 70,000 patients, family members and healthcare professionals communicated with master's-level information specialists about treatment decisions, advances in blood cancer management, financial matters and life after a cancer diagnosis. Information specialists worked with individuals representing many diagnoses and stages from communities across the US and Canada. And a record-breaking 6,100 customized clinical trial searches were conducted using the blood-cancer specific search tool Trial Check \u00ae. Nearly $38 million was awarded through the LLS Co-Pay Assistance Program to help patients with prescription drug co-pays and insurance premium obligations. The LLS Co-Pay Assistance Program has been rated number 1 in the nation by oncologists in response to the 2011 Kantar Health national survey question: Which of the following co-pay foundations do you consider best regarding helping your patients? community Support More than 3,200 school personnel, healthcare professionals and parents attended the LLS program Welcome Back: Working Together to Support the Cancer Survivor at School . More than 13,100 survivors attended 452 family support groups offered by LLS chapters across the US and Canada. Chapter staff and volunteers continue to strengthen relationships and build new ones with community-based organizations serving Latino/Hispanic, African-American, rural, and other underrepresented cancer patients. In all, 32,833 cancer patients and caregivers participated in 479 activities and programs, made possible by the outreach and collaborative efforts of LLS chapters to underrepresented groups across the US and Canada. In addition, we're proud to report that 5,094 Patti Robinson Kaufmann First Connection matches were made between patients, their family members and trained peer volunteers.1010reSearch grant S LLS continues to support the development of breakthrough cancer therapies, committing substantial funding to researchers around the world. This fiscal year, we made 83 new awards, including 45 Career Development grants. Seventeen of 36 new Translational Research awards were responsive to specific requests for proposals in four underdeveloped but promising areas of research, including novel strategies to target: 1 AML and myelodysplastic syndromes 3 High-risk cases of myeloma; 4 Long-term and late effects of today's cancer therapies.Two multi-million dollar grants were also awarded through our Specialized Centers of Research (SCOR) program. Frederick Alt, PhD, and his SCOR team have been funded by LLS since 2006. They are learning how B-cell lymphomas evolve and which molecules can serve as targets for new lymphoma therapies. Anthony Green, MD, PhD, and his team also received their first SCOR award in 2006. They are developing better diagnostics and therapeutics for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Biotech aLLiance partner ShipS LLS partners directly with biotechnology companies to more quickly develop potential blood cancer therapies. This fiscal year, we forged three new alliances: 1 LLS will provide up to $1.7 million to Ascenta Therapeutics for the clinical development of AT-406, a drug that promotes cancer cell death, as a treatment for patients with poor risk AML. The drug entered a Phase I clinical trial in March 2011. 2 In a partnership with Acetylon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., LLS will provide up to $4.85 million for the clinical testing of ACY-1215, a drug that inhibits a specialized epigenetics enzyme. A Phase Ia clinical trial began enrolling patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in August 2011. 3 In an agreement with Epizyme, LLS will provide up to $7.5 million for pre-clinical and Phase I clinical testing of a new targeted therapy for patients with Mixed Lineage Leukemia, including adults and children. The therapy inhibits another epigenetics enzyme that plays a central role in these leukemias. progre SS in cLinica L triaLS LLS also continued to support progress through five ongoing partnerships: 1 Memgen reported results of their Phase I trial of a novel immune-stimulating treatment, ISF35, with 56% of high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients achieving a complete response. 2 Avila Therapeutics completed a Phase I study in healthy volunteers that identified an active starting dose for the Phase Ib study of A VL-292. This oral drug inhibits a growth-promoting enzyme that is abnormally active in many cases lymphomas, CLL and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The Phase Ib study was initiated in July 2011 for patients with these cancers.thiS fiScaL year, LLS made 83 ne W aWardS, forged three ne W aLLiance S, and Supported progre SS through five ongoing partner ShipS. 11 11 3 The University Health Network in Toronto opened a Phase I clinical trial of the repurposed anti-fungal drug, ciclopirox olamine, as a treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory AML. This project originated in LLS grant-funded results of Aaron Schimmer, MD, PhD, FRCPC. 4 Celator Pharmaceuticals reported promising results for their Phase II clinical trial of CPX-351 for older patients with newly diagnosed AML, with an improvement in overall survival for patients with cases of secondary AML. This drug is a novel lipid formulation of two standard anti-cancer drugs. 5 Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. opened a large Phase III clinical trial of a new drug for adult MDS patients who have relapsed and/or become resistant to available drugs (Vidaza\u00ae, Dacogen\u00ae). This trial could lead to FDA approval of Estybon\u00ae, a drug that selectively inhibits multiple enzymes involved in cancer cell proliferation. It is also being tested for patients with lymphoid cancers and various solid tumors. LLS advocate S greW to more than 56,000 voLunteer SoraL chemotherapy coverage Leading coalition campaigns in New York and Illinois, LLS advocates were successful in increasing patient access to oral cancer treatments by requiring insurance companies to provide coverage for oral chemotherapy at a cost equal to what is charged for intravenous (IV) treatment. This coverage is now required by 14 states and the District of Columbia. Forging ahead, LLS advocates are also diligently leading similar efforts in South Carolina and Wisconsin. cord B Lood Banking and donation LLS volunteers successfully advocated for passage of legislation in Florida during the 2011 legislative session that requires physicians and hospitals to inform expectant mothers of the importance of cord blood banking and donation. A similar bill passed the Iowa State Senate this spring, and LLS will work tirelessly to pass the bill in the Iowa House of Representatives during the 2012 legislative session. Passage of these bills will increase umbilical cord blood resources and expand the resources available for stem cell matching and transplantation for the treatment of blood cancer patients. LLS advocates continue to lead coalition efforts to pass this legislation in states around the country. for patient S and their famiLieS LLS stormed Capitol Hill in June when more than 80 high-level advocacy delegates conducted meetings with more than 100 congressional offices. Vital issues to blood cancer patients included: increased funding for cancer research at the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute; continued funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Blood Cancer Education Program; the initiation of the Cures Acceleration Network; and a fix to the ongoing drug shortage issue plaguing patients with cancer and other chronic diseases. the groWing famiLy of LLS LLS advocates grew to more than 56,000 volunteers, an empowered voice for patients and their families. Advocates now have more choices as to where and how they'd like to exercise those voices, including participation in LLS's Advocacy Center, LLS's Call for Cures website, the LLS Facebook page, a new advocacy-specific Twitter feed [http://twitter.com/LLSAdvocacy] and a new LLS Advocacy Community [http://community.lls.org/ community/advocacy]. The voice of LLS continues to touch more issues and communication points than ever before. the voice of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society heard in 20111212 man & Woman of the year www.mwoy.org This spirited campaign continues to bring together dynamic volunteer community leaders with the single goal of raising as much money as possible in 10 weeks to benefit LLS's mission. 690 honored candidates participated in 62 campaigns around the country this year \u2014 including 6 new campaigns. All candidates who confirmed their participation were formally thanked in a full-page USA Today advertisement. We continue to focus on increasing volunteer leadership through nominating committees and candidate campaign teams. Our 2011 National Man & Woman of the Year are a testament to the power of a campaign team. Man of the Year Ian O'Malley and Woman of the Year Kelley LaFontaine both formed campaign teams. Together, their campaigns raised over $340,000. In fact, of the 690 participating candidates, 82 raised enough funds to qualify for the top fundraising recognition program.team in training www.teamintraining.org Team In Training (TNT) continues to be the industry leader in charity endurance training programs with over 2,300 coaches across the United States and Canada delivering the \"best in class\" training program to get our 40,000 participants across the finish line. This year LLS saw great success with its TNT Corporate Team Program growing to 21 national teams. Deloitte led the way with recruitment and was the top national corporate team raising over $475,000 with nearly 250 employees participating. In addition to being a part of the TNT Corporate Team Program, UnitedHealthcare, America's preeminent healthcare company, became the newest Presenting Sponsor of Team In Training. Many TNTers who participated in signature events and on corporate teams did so as a part of the TNT Flex team. TNT Flex was created in order to provide great customer service and flexibility for participants who are not be able to do the traditional TNT in-person program.

Thanks to their efforts, kids participating in School & Youth Programs raised a record-breaking $26 million to fund blood cancer research and patient services. The colorful, individual collection boxes for students played a big role in their fundraising success, along with an increase in school visits and educational assemblies conducted by LLS staff. A special thank you goes out to Olive Garden, who for 18 years has been supporting LLS through the Pasta for Pennies program. During Pasta for Pennies, the top fundraising classroom in participating schools receives a celebratory, Hospitaliano pasta lunch from a local Olive Garden restaurant. This year, Olive Garden supported over 6,000 schools in their fundraising efforts! targeted giving and Beque StS Just as researchers focus on specific targets to develop better blood cancer treatments, some donors focus their giving to be more effective philanthropists. To facilitate targeted support for donors making gifts of $10,000 or more, LLS offers a dozen different research portfolios. Nine are focused on specific blood cancers and three address broader research themes: immunotherapies, stem cell transplantation and long-term and late effects of treatments. Each portfolio contains a mix of projects across multiple, leading research institutions. By directing support to one of these groupings, donors can focus their philanthropy on a topic of concern while extending their reach and diversifying charitable giving, just as investors might do using sector mutual funds. This year, 40 donors invested more than $2 million in research-specific portfolios. 13Another group of valued supporters \u2014 members of our Legacy Circle \u2014 looked into the future and included LLS in their wills or designated the organization as a partial beneficiary in their retirement plans or insurance policies. Their tax-wise decisions, which have no impact on their income today, can significantly improve how blood cancer patients will be treated tomorrow. This year, research was supported by $7.7 million in legacy giving.14research grants the Marshall a. licht Man specialized center of research The Specialized Center of Research Program funds multi-disciplinary research by teams of leading-edge academic investigators that hasten the discovery and development of better treatments for leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma patients.

YormarkMark Zafra26independent auditors' report The Board of Directors The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. (LLS) as of June 30, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of activities, functional expenses, and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of LLS's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. The prior year summarized comparative information has been derived from LLS's 2010 consolidated financial statements and, in our report dated September 15, 2010, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of LLS's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. as of June 30, 2011, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies Organization The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. (LLS) is an international not-for-profit health agency dedicated to seeking the cause and cure of leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and myeloma and improving the quality of life of patients and their families. LLS's principal activities include: awarding research grants; facilitating psychosocial support groups; providing financial aid to patients; answering phone requests for blood cancer information made to LLS's Information Resource Center; and disseminating educational information about blood cancers in the form of publications, internet sites, conference calls, and symposia sponsorship for both the medical community and the general public. Tax-Exempt Status LLS qualifies as a charitable organization as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and, accordingly, is exempt from federal income taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(a). Additionally, since LLS is publicly supported, contributions to LLS qualify for the maximum charitable contribution deduction under the Internal Revenue Code. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada, Inc. (LLSC) is registered as a charitable organization under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and is, therefore, not subject to income taxes if certain disbursement requirements are met. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LLS, which encompasses the Home Office of LLS and its fifty-five chapters in the United States, LLSC and its four chapters in Canada, and LLS's not-for-profit affiliates, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Programs, Inc. and The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Foundation. All significant intercompany and intra-LLS accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires LLS's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The significant estimates made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements include the fair value of alternative investments, the allowance for uncollectible accounts, and the allocation of expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Risks and Uncertainties LLS invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, fluctuations in market security values, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the statement of financial position. Summarized Financial Information The consolidated financial statements are presented with 2010 summarized or comparative information. With respect to the consolidated statement of activities, such prior year information is not presented by net asset class and, in the consolidated statement of functional expenses, 2010 expenses by object are presented in total rather than by functional category. Accordingly, such information should be read in conjunction with LLS's 2010 consolidated financial statements from which the summarized information was derived. Subsequent Events LLS evaluated subsequent events after the statement of financial position date of June 30, 2011 through September 15, 2011, which was the date the consolidated financial statements were issued, and concluded that no additional disclosures are required. Net Asset Classifications To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resources available to LLS, funds that have similar characteristics have been classified into three net asset categories as follows: Unrestricted net assets: Consist of funds that are fully available, at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors, for LLS to utilize in any of its programs or supporting services. Temporarily restricted net assets: Consist of funds that are restricted by donors for a specific time period or purpose. Permanently restricted net assets: Consist of funds that contain donor-imposed restrictions requiring that the principal be invested in perpetuity and that only the income be used. Income earned on these funds are recorded as temporarily restricted net assets and are released from restriction when the donor stipulated purpose has been fulfilled and/or the amount has been appropriated in compliance with the Board-approved spending policy (note 9). Foreign Currency Translation LLSC uses the Canadian dollar as its functional currency. Accordingly, the currency impact of the translation of the financial statements of LLSC to U.S. dollars is included as a translation adjustment in the consolidated statement of activities. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. LLS follows the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), for certain alternative investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, including hedge funds, limited partnerships, and other funds. This guidance allows, as a practical expedient, for the estimation of the fair value of investments in investment companies for which the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value, using net asset value per share or its equivalent, as reported by the investment managers. Most investments classified in Levels 2 and 3 consist of shares or units in investment funds as opposed to direct interests in the funds' underlying holdings, which may be marketable. Because the net asset value reported by each fund is used as a practical expedient to estimate the fair value of LLS's interest therein, its classification in Level 2 or 3 is based on LLS's ability to redeem its interest at or near June 30. If the interest can be redeemed in the near term, the investment is classified as Level 2. The classification of investments in the fair value hierarchy is not necessarily an indication of the risks, liquidity, or degree of difficulty in estimating the fair value of each investment's underlying assets and liabilities.32Contributions and Deferred Revenue Contributions are recorded as revenue, at their fair value, when received or promised unconditionally. Contributions received with donor restrictions that limit their use are reported as either temporarily or permanently restricted revenue. When a donor restriction is met through the passage of time or fulfillment of a purpose restriction, temporarily restricted net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the consolidated statement of activities as net assets released from restrictions. Conditional contributions are recognized as revenue when the conditions have been substantially met. Deferred revenue includes amounts received for special events that will be held subsequent to the fiscal year-end. Donated Services LLS has determined that certain of the donated services it receives meet the criteria for recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the donated services of family support group facilitators and research grant reviewers in the amount of $5,983,000 in 2011 and $6,819,000 in 2010 have been valued and are reported as both revenue and expense. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase, except for amounts held for long-term purposes reported as investments. Investments Investments are stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices, except for the fair values of funds of hedge funds and limited partnerships, which are based on net asset values provided by the fund managers and general partners, respectively, based upon the underlying net assets of the funds consistent with the concepts of ASC 820. These values are reviewed and evaluated by management. Fixed Assets and Depreciation Fixed assets, which consist principally of equipment, software, and leasehold improvements, are recorded at cost, if purchased, or at fair value at date of donation, if contributed, and are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the leases, if shorter. Income Taxes LLS recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Income generated from activities unrelated to LLS's exempt purpose is subject to tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 511. LLS did not recognize any unrelated business income tax liability for the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. Professional Fees Professional fees included in the consolidated financial statements principally include fund-raising counsel fees, data processing services, contracted software development, and legal and auditing fees. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, inc. / June 30, 2011 (with comparative amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2010) 2. Legacies and Contributions Receivable LLS's legacies and contributions receivable at June 30, 2011 and 2010 consist of unconditional promises to give and legacies for which the underlying wills have been declared valid by the probate court and no other conditions are required to be met.

LLS invests in certain alternative investments, through \"funds of hedge funds\" investments, which invest in multiple strategies through a portfolio of hedge fund managers to provide diversification and reduce manager risk. These strategies create indirect exposure to LLS through short sales of securities, trading in future and forward contracts, and other derivative products. Derivatives are investment contracts used to hedge risk. While these financial instruments may contain varying degrees of risk, LLS's risk with respect to such transactions is limited to its capital balance in each investment. The underlying holdings of the limited partnership equity indices are principally domestic and international marketable securities. LLS's alternative investments contain various redemption restrictions with required written notice ranging from 70 to 95 days. As of June 30, 2011, the following table summarizes the composition of such investments at fair value by the various redemption provisions (in thousands): ReDemPTion Pe RioD Amoun T Monthly $ 17,901 Quarterly 32,737 Total $ 50,638 As of June 30, 2011 and 2010, LLS has no unfunded commitments on its alternative investments.The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, inc. / June 30, 2011 (with comparative amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2010) The following table presents a reconciliation for all Level 3 assets measured at fair value as of June 30, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands).

LLS has interpreted the relevant law as allowing LLS to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of an endowment fund as LLS determines is prudent considering the uses, benefits, purposes and duration for which the endowment fund is established, subject to the intent of the donor as expressed in the gift instrument. LLS has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment funds while seeking to protect the original value of the gift. Under this policy, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results consistent with LLS's overall investment strategy.
