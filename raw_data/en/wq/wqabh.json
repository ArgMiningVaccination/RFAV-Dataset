But wouldn't it be nice if you could use other natural supplements to get your energy levels up? These supplements are sure to get your energy levels rising. Ashwagandha Ashwagandha is one of the most important medicinal herbs in Indian Ayurveda, one of the world's oldest medicinal systems. It is thought to increase energy by enhancing your body's resilience to physical and mental stress. Strengthening these findings was a review of five studies examining the effects of ashwagandha on anxiety and stress. Woot woot! Rhodiola Rosea Rhodiola rosea is an herb that grows in certain cold, mountainous regions. It's widely used as an adaptogen, a natural substance that enhances your body's ability to cope with stress. In one study, researchers combined and analyzed the results of 11 studies that examined the effects of rhodiola on physical and mental fatigue in more than 500 people. Of the 11 studies, 8 found evidence that rhodiola can enhance physical performance and ease mental fatigue. There were also no major safety risks associated with rhodiola supplements. CoQ10 CoQ10, which stands for coenzyme Q10, is made naturally in the body. CoQ10 comes in a few forms, including ubiquinone and ubiquinol. They are ubiquitous in the body, meaning they're found in all cells. All cells contain CoQ10, although the heart, kidneys and liver have the highest levels. Cells use CoQ10 to make energy and protect themselves from oxidative damage. Vitamin B12 Along with the other B vitamins, vitamin B12 helps transform the food you eat into energy that your cells can use. It also keeps your body's nerves and blood cells healthy and helps prevent a type of anemia that can make you weak and tired. Vitamin B12 is found naturally in a variety of animal proteins, such as meat, fish and dairy products. Many foods are also fortified with B12, allowing most Americans to meet their vitamin B12 needs by consuming a balanced diet containing foods rich in B12. Iron The body needs iron to make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen from your lungs to the organs and tissues throughout your body. Without adequate levels of iron, your red blood cells cannot effectively carry oxygen to the body's tissues. This results in iron deficiency anemia, which may leave you feeling fatigued and weak. Creatine Creatine is a compound that is naturally found in red meat, pork, poultry and fish. It acts as a source of quick energy in your body. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency of life. When your body uses ATP for energy, it loses a phosphate group and becomes adenosine diphosphate. Therefore, when your body needs a quick source of energy, creatine lends its phosphate to ADP and becomes ATP. Citrulline The name \"citrulline\" comes from Citrullus vulgaris, the Latin word for watermelon, from which it was first isolated. Citrulline works to increase nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide acts as a vasodilator, causing the inner muscles of blood vessels to widen and thus increasing circulation. This allows blood, oxygen and nutrients to travel to all areas of the body. But when the ability to produce nitric oxide is limited, physical weakness and lack of energy may occur. Beetroot Powder Beetroot powder is made from the beetroot vegetable and contains a high amount of nitrate. Similar to L-citrulline, nitrate produces nitric oxide in the body, which relaxes blood vessels and increases blood flow and oxygen delivery. This allows your body to produce energy more efficiently, particularly in regards to exercise. Melatonin Melatonin is a natural hormone that plays a role in sleep. It's produced and released depending on the time of day \u2014 rising in the evening and falling in the morning. Supplementing with melatonin may be an effective way to help with insomnia, a sleep disorder that affects approximately 30% of adults around the world. Chronic insomnia can make you constantly tired and low on energy. Symptoms include difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, waking up too early and poor sleep quality. Tyroisine Tyrosine is an amino acid that is naturally produced by your body. It is found in most high-protein foods, including chicken, eggs and dairy products. Tyrosine is important for producing neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that transmit messages in your brain. These neurotransmitters are thought to decline with mentally and physically demanding activities, which can negatively affect concentration and energy levels. Ready to feel energized?
