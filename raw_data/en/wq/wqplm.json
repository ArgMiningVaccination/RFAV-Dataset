The Mantras they use can move you deeply with a profound vibration that creates a bridge from heart to heart, connecting us with the universe, balanced mind, body and soul. We have a decades long tradition of hosting community rituals to acknowledge the change of season here at Osmosis. We do this with the intention of connecting with the spirit of nature, Celestial influences, and to honor those who came before us in stewarding this special place on Salmon Creek.
