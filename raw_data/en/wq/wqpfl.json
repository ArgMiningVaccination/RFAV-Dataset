I want to add to my ability to help others. In addition to Mind/Body therapy, the modality that impacted my health the most was Homeopathy. Out of my passion for the medicine and for the potential of my clients to heal, I want to offer Classical Homeopathy. I believe in the body's ability to heal. I have seen amazing results when working with a variety of modalities. For example, I remember a man almost unable to move after having 3 failed back surgeries for the same pain. He was on pain relievers and steroids. After a week of intensive body work with emotional release, he was off pain medication and crying as he expressed gratitude. He was able to get on the floor to play with his grandchildren for the first time in years. I, in turn, felt so grateful to be able to help. I help people in my community who are in pain or stressed be able to do the things that they love to do. To help them feel fulfilled and engaged in their life. I want to do more. My experience with Homeopathy was nothing short of miraculous. I was sickly in my childhood and continued until I was in my thirties. As an adult, I suffered with severe bouts of bronchitis for months out of the year. The last time I had a severe case of bronchitis I was 31. I was young and physically fit; but, at that level of illness, I could not climb a single flight of stairs without resting to catch my breath. I was sick for 4 months. Antibiotics were not working. A rescue inhaler was not consistently helping. After 2 days on a Homeopathic Remedy, I was well. I believe the Osteopath that prescribe it was as surprised as I! I can't begin to describe the relief. To be completely well after months of being so sick. I had to learn more and have periodically studied remedies on my own. I continued on my own healing journey which often included Homeopathic remedies to address acute illness and strengthen my constitution. I am now healthy and have more resiliency not just in my immune system but my emotional health as well. I give much credit to my success to the power of Homeopathy. There are very few classically trained Homeopaths and 2 practitioners practicing in my home town are retiring. Naturopathic Colleges are no longer offering extensive training. I am afraid the practice of classical Homeopathy will be lost. Homeopathy is a practice of using 'like cures like'. The idea is your body expresses symptoms as an attempt to regain balance, restoring health. If you support the symptoms, you support the body's healing. People get well without the side effect of pharmaceuticals. There is a 2 year full program in homeopathy. The tuition is 20,000 over the 2 years. I am asking for 4,000 for the tuition to be able to start in September. You can link to see more about the program at I am Cindy Bloom. I want to offer more healing and less suffering by becoming a Homeopath. Thank you for your help!!!! I believe in the body's ability to heal.
