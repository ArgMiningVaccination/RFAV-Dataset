PV3(S ): the P1 domain harbours only 2 nucleotide changes resulting in only 2 amino acid changes. Mutations in the P1 domain of both viruses confer a tsphenotype to the vaccine viruses and they are now considered the most important determinants for modified foot and mouth disease (1962 ).

Our research showed attenuation was to due to increased levels of UpA / CpG dinucleotide frequencies -notcodon -pair bias Tulloch,F ., N.J., Simmonds, P . The attenuated replication phenotype of codon pair de -optimised RNA viruses is an artefact of increasing CpG and UpA dinucleotiude frequencies -implications for the design and safety evaluation of future live attenuated vaccines.
