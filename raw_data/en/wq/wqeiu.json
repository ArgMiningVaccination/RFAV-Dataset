Scientific studies have shown that a majority of North Americans are deficient in many essential nutrients. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), more than 80% of women and 70% of men consume less than two-thirds of the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) for one or more nutrient (essential vitamins and minerals). To bring more clarity to this problem, consider that the RDI merely represents the amount of a nutrient that is required daily to avoid a deficiency disease, such as scurvy (results from a vitamin C deficiency) or pellagra (results from a B3 deficiency). It is most certainly NOT a recommended dosage required to achieve optimal health! Even people who feel they have a well-balanced diet, or that small percentage of people who actually meet the RDIs, may not realize their true potential for vibrant health without nutritional supplementation. Read on to learn why this is. Indeed, we live in a land of plenty and have a variety of foods at our fingertips. How is it that we eat more, yet get fewer nutrients? There are two main reasons why: - Much of the soil used to grow our fruits and vegetables is nutrient depleted. Many agricultural practices strip the soil of nutrients. Advances in science play a negative role in this problem. People are often more interested in inexpensive food then they are in wholesome nutrient-rich food. Big businesses in the food industry strive to fulfill this demand. The result is the use of pesticides, herbicides, improperly rotated crops and genetically modified (GM) food. GM foods are better at resisting harsh weather, pesticides and herbicides, and they have higher drought tolerance. The problem is that introducing foreign genes into food plants may have negative impacts on health such as increases in food allergies (e.g. peanuts), the transmission of antibiotic-resistant genes and many other unknown long-term negative effects on human health. - The majority of us eat \"empty calories\" - foods that contain little nutritional value. Common sources of empty calories include heavily processed and refined foods, baked goods, soda, candy and desserts. Also consider that many common aspects of daily living can deplete your body of the nutrients it needs to function properly. Nutritonal supplementation is becoming essential. How Do You Know What You Need? Here's a Start: - Are you a lacto-ovo- vegetarian or a vegan? - Do you eat less than 1 serving of fish/week? - Do you eat two or fewer meals per day? - Do you have any dietary restrictions? Do these restrictions affect your intake of meats, dairy products or fruits and vegetables? - Do you normally eat alone? - Have you involuntarily gained or lost more than 10 pounds in the past six months? - Do you ingest three or more alcoholic beverages per day? - Do you spend under 30min in the sun each week? - Do you frequently experience muscle cramps? - Do you have restless leg syndrome - Do you take any over-the-counter or prescription medications per day? If you answer yes to more than 5 of these questions, you will likely benefit from the use of dietary supplements. However, this choice should be made with the input of a knowledgeable healthcare practitioner such as a registered Naturopathic Doctor. Watch for Supplement Quality, Though Not all supplements are created equal! And when it comes to your health, quality should be your number one priority. Have you ever supplemented with a no-name vitamin and barely noticed a difference in your symptoms, or even a worsening of symptoms? This may be because the supplement was of poor quality, and the quality in most cases will have a direct relationship with a supplement's effectiveness. It is also important to know that nutritional supplement manufacturers are not held to the same standards as pharmaceutical companies. This results in many companies offering cheap supplements of questionable quality that have not undergone third party testing (testing by outside companies who confirm that the ingredient amounts listed on the label are in fact found in the product). So what can you do? Fortunately, many credible companies exist. To know whether or not this is the case, make sure the company does either in-house but ideally third party testing and that they follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) - government standards that ensure purity and consistent quality. Also, you should consider consulting with a licensed Naturopathic Doctor who can recommend a safe and effective product for you that is produced by a company with history, longevity and respect in the marketplace.

Frequently Asked Questions About Naturopathic Medicine A: Naturopathic Medicine is a unique and comprehensive approach to improving health and treating illness. Focusing on prevention, and using natural substances and treatments, naturopathic doctors support and stimulate the body's ability to heal itself. The primary goal of naturopathic treatment is to address the cause of illness, rather than simply treat or suppress symptoms. The patient is seen as a whole person and the naturopathic doctor takes the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions into account when diagnosing and developing a treatment plan. A: Naturopathic doctors take a minimum of three years pre-medical studies at university, followed by four years at one of four recognized colleges of naturopathic medicine. The only two in Canada are the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (North York, ON) and the Boucher Institute of Naturopathic medicine (British Columbia). The education encompasses basic medical sciences, naturopathic principles and therapeutics, and 1,500 hours of supervised clinical experience. In regulated (or licensed) provinces and states across North America , graduates must also pass rigorous standardized exams to qualify to practice. In Canada, naturopathic doctors are regulated in British Columbia , Manitoba , Ontario and Saskatchewan . Legislation is pending in Alberta and Nova Scotia. A: The difference is twofold: First of all homeopaths only use homeopathy as a treatment tool, whereas Naturopathic doctors use homeopathy as one of several treatment tools. The second major difference is that homeopaths are not regulated and licensed in the province of Ontario . Therefore anyone can call themselves a homeopath regardless of training, whereas only those individuals following the steps outlined above can call themselves Naturopathic Doctors. A: A Doctor of Natural Medicine (DNM) is not regulated and licensed in Ontario. Anyone, regardless of training and education, can call themselves a Doctor of Natural Medicine in this province. There is no independent regulatory body that ensures that these individuals have appropriate training, or that standards of practice are being maintained. If a patient/client has any concerns their only recourse is a court of law. Most insurance companies only cover practitioners that are licensed. The regulatory board for Naturopathic Doctors in Ontario is the Board of Directors of Drugless Therapy - Naturopathy (BDDT-N) see www.boardofnaturopathicmedicine.on.ca/. This board is a government-appointed board that is independent of any of the naturopathic associations and its job is to protect the rights of the public and to ensure a standard of patient care. A: The Board of Directors or Drugless Therapy maintains an up-to-date list of registered naturopaths in the province of Ontario at: [http://www.boardofnaturopathicmedicine.on.ca/doctors_list.html](http://www.boardofnaturopathicmedicine.on.ca/doctors_list.html) About Dr. Slipacoff, N.D.
