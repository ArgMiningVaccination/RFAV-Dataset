Based on clinical experience, the World Health Organization lists more than 40 conditions that could benefit from acupuncture, including fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, osteoarthritis, tennis elbow, low back pain, carpal tunnel, and postoperative dental pain. It can also be used for allergy elimination, anxiety, depression and insomnia. Practiced for over 5,000 years, acupuncture is a highly effective treatment in traditional Chinese medicine, and involves the process of inserting fine, sterile needles into various points of the body. Moxibustion is a form of heat therapy in which dried herbal material is painlessly burned near or on the body. Many cultures attribute the success of acupuncture and moxibustion to its ability to restore the human body's natural flow of energy, called Qi (pronounced chee). Correcting the balance of Qi in the body helps activate our natural, self-healing abilities. Acupuncture is used to open the channels where the Qi moves, reducing pain as it diminishes blockage and swelling. It also reduces pain by relaxing muscles, calming nerve irritation, releasing natural, pain-killing opiates, and improving the blood and Qi flow that speeds the healing process. Recent research has shown acupuncture to release central nervous system endorphins, as well as the chemical that activates the adrenal glands. It also affects chemicals that are known to be involved in mood and pain perception, and influences one of the body's pain-generating messengers. Acupuncture is particularly effective for treating chronic conditions, which typically involve areas or organs that are undernourished. Using acupuncture, often along with specific formulas of herbs, we can assist in healing the root cause of your condition, while reducing the intensity and duration of your pain. "}
