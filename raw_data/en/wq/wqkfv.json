Dr. Paddock and Dr. Runde are both East Coast natives who experienced a dramatically different health care system\u2014one where holistic medicine is much more integrated into the mainstream\u2014 when they attended naturopathic medical school in Seattle. CCNH is their attempt to offer more holistic medicine to Baltimore residents. Marylanders, used to having the very best in conventional medical care, can now draw on the best that natural medicine has to offer. Our naturopathic doctors, psychologist, and acupuncturist, work with patients of all ages, from infants just a few months old to seniors well into their 80s and 90s. We use a range of natural therapeutic tools, including diet and lifestyle changes, nutritional supplements, herbal medicines, homeopathy, counseling and health psychology, and acupuncture. As experts in natural medicine, we have a wide range of tools to use in addressing our patients' health needs. Located in scenic Roland Park, right off Interstate 83, we serve patients from all over the greater Baltimore area, including Baltimore County, Howard County, Harford County, Anne Arundel County, and beyond, even all the way to York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.
