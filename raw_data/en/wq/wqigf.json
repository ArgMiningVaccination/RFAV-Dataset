Founder, Licensed Clinical Psychologist, BCBA-D, LMHC BCBA Front Office Assistant BCBA BCBA I can't say enough about Crystal Minds New Beginnings as a center for ABA and their Social Skills Class! My son is 2 years old with Autism, and it is so great to have somewhere where I can bring him on Saturday Mornings, that he can learn, play, and enjoy. Highly Recommend them as a whole! I have not met one staff member that I have not loved, and I feel completely comfortable leaving my son with them. My son has been attending the social skills group every Saturday & we have seen such great improvement in his behavior & sharing skills. He truly enjoys coming and is so happy here. The entire CMNB therapy team has transformed our lives! Moreover, he has a behavioral therapist that works with him 5 days a week & she has completely accelerated his learning, social, and behavioral skills. We are so thankful! We got you covered While parenting is certainly the most rewarding job inthe world, it can also be the most exhausting - and that's okay. Naturally, looking after little ones and keeping them safe, healthy, and engaged is tough onthe body and mind. As much as we love keeping our kids protected in abubble, they need to be made independent (you aren't going to be here forever, right?). Being independent will help kids make them confident and instill a sense of responsibility. "}
