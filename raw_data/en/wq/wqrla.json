We aimed to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent mortality and reduce the risk of developing severe disease after the 1st and 2nd doses. From conception to 28 June 2021, we searched PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCO, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, WHO-ICTRP, and Google Scholar. We included both observational and randomized controlled trials. The pooled vaccine efficacy and effectiveness following vaccination, as well as their 95 percent confidence intervals (CI), were estimated using the random-effects model. In total, 22 of the 21,567 screened articles were eligible for quantitative analysis. Mortality 7 and 14 days after full vaccination decreased significantly among the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group (OR = 0.10, ([95% CI, 0.04-0.27], I2 = 54%) and (OR = 0.46, [95% CI, 0.35-0.61], I2 = 0%), respectively. The probability of having severe disease one or two weeks after 2nd dose decreased significantly (OR = 0.29 [95% CI, 0.19-0.46], I2 = 25%) and (OR = 0.08 [95% CI, 0.03-0.25], I2 = 74%), respectively. The incidence of infection any time after the 1st and 2nd doses diminished significantly (OR = 0.14 [95% CI, 0.07-0.4], I2 = 100%) and (OR = 0.179 [95% CI, 0.15-0.19], I2 = 98%), respectively. Also, incidence of infection one week after 2nd dose decreased significantly, (OR = 0.04, [95% CI (0.01-0.2], I2 = 100%). After meta-regression, the type of vaccine and country were the main predictors of outcome [non-mRNA type, \u00df = 2.99, p = 0.0001; country UK, \u00df = 0.75, p = 0.038; country USA, \u00df = 0.8, p = 0.02]. This study showed that most vaccines have comparable effectiveness, and it is purported that mass vaccination may help to end this pandemic.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-02-23", "cleaned_text": "Efficacy and Effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines: A Systematic Review and The second virus emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and was called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), with more than 2500 cases and a CFR of about 33% [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-00350), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-00350)]. Following the appearance of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, many vaccines were developed with live-attenuated, DNA-based, and recombinant viral vectors vaccines [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-00350), [5](#B5-vaccines-10-00350), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-00350)]. However, the development of clinical trials to test these postulated vaccines was abandoned when the outbreaks subsided due to the limited number of infections [ [7](#B7-vaccines-10-00350), [8](#B8-vaccines-10-00350)]. [9](#B9-vaccines-10-00350)]. The emerging virus causes a disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Even though the great majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients have mild to moderate symptoms, the illness killed a considerable number of patients [ [10](#B10-vaccines-10-00350)]. A hyperinflammatory process is known as \"cytokine storm\" is thought to be the cause of much of the serious disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [11](#B11-vaccines-10-00350)]. On 11 February 2022, 407.6 million got SARS-CoV-2 infection with 5.8 million deaths [ [12](#B12-vaccines-10-00350)]. The CFR varied across countries from less than 0.1% to more than 25% [ [13](#B13-vaccines-10-00350)]. [14](#B14-vaccines-10-00350)] has granted Paxlovid from Pfizer an emergency use license for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age) who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. Paxlovid is only accessible by prescription and should be started as soon as possible following a COVID-19 diagnosis and within five days of the onset of symptoms. [15](#B15-vaccines-10-00350)]. The vaccination process against COVID-19 started in December 2020 with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna mRNA vaccines, and the Astra Zeneca/Oxford Chad Ox vaccines, as well as the Chinese Sinovac, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and Russian Sputnik V adenovirus vaccines, and hundreds of vaccines at different stages of development and different mechanisms, including protein subunits with adjuvant, non-replicating viral vectors, RNA, virus-like-particles (VLP), DNA, inactivated, and live-attenuated virus [ [16](#B16-vaccines-10-00350), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-00350)]. On 23 August 2021, the FDA has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to protect from COVID-19 for people above 16 years old. The vaccine's previous emergency use authorization will continue for 12- to 15-year-olds [ [18](#B18-vaccines-10-00350)]. Recently, Pfizer-BioNTech was approved for use among children aged 5-11 years [ [19](#B19-vaccines-10-00350)]. In total, 61.7% of the population in the world has got at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. About 10.32 billion doses have been provided worldwide, and about 26.74 million are now administered each day [ [19](#B19-vaccines-10-00350)]; however, only 10.6% of people living in low-income countries have received at least one dose. Until February 2022, less than 12% of Africans were fully vaccinated [ [20](#B20-vaccines-10-00350)], while more than 62% of the population in Asia [ [21](#B21-vaccines-10-00350)], 62% in South America, 63% in North America [ [22](#B22-vaccines-10-00350)], and 70% in Europe were fully vaccinated [ [23](#B23-vaccines-10-00350)]. [24](#B24-vaccines-10-00350)]. [25](#B25-vaccines-10-00350)]. Most COVID-19 vaccines have mild side effects, such as pain at the site of injection, tiredness, headache, fever, or shivering for 1-2 days after vaccination. Very rare side effects include allergic reactions and blood clotting problems, the latter affecting a small number of people who had the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine [ [26](#B26-vaccines-10-00350)]. Vaccine efficacy is defined as the degree to which a vaccine prevents disease, and possibly, also its transmission under ideal and controlled circumstances; this is determined by comparing a vaccinated group with a placebo group in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Vaccine effectiveness also refers to how well the vaccine performs in the real world based on observational studies [ [27](#B27-vaccines-10-00350)]. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to shed light on different studies evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines after phase III trials. 2. Materials and Methods [28](#B28-vaccines-10-00350)]. All steps were performed with strict compliance to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis [ [29](#B29-vaccines-10-00350)].

Data Collection and Extraction [Supplementary Materials](#app1-vaccines-10-00350)of eligible articles were also reviewed for relevant data and the extracted data were checked and confirmed by a third author (Y.E.). 4. Data Analysis [34](#B34-vaccines-10-00350)] and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's quality assessment tool for cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies [ [35](#B35-vaccines-10-00350)]. D.M. and N.H. reviewed the quality of the studies and any disagreement was resolved by R.M.G. and S.H. - Visual inspection of the forest plot was carried out to analyze the consistency of intervention effects across the included studies. If the same intervention effect is estimated, there should be an overlap between the confidence intervals for each effect estimate on the forest plot. However, if the overlap is weak, or there are outliers, statistical heterogeneity is likely to be present. - Statistical test for variation: heterogeneity was assessed by inspecting the forest plots to detect overlapping confidence intervals (CIs) and the I2 statistic used to denote levels of heterogeneity as defined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [ [30](#B30-vaccines-10-00350)]. - 0% to 40%: might not be important. - 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity. - 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity. - 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity. 5. Results 5.1. Study Selection Process [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-00350-f001)). List of papers rejected and causes of rejection are provided as [Supplementary Table from 268 [ [48](#B48-vaccines-10-00350)], to 6,538,911 subjects [ [49](#B49-vaccines-10-00350)]. Among the included studies, two studies were conducted across countries [ [30](#B30-vaccines-10-00350), [39](#B39-vaccines-10-00350)]. We found that studies assessed the efficacy or effectiveness of vaccination after the 1st dose that ranged from 60 to studies assessed the efficacy or effectiveness of vaccination after 2nd dose that ranged from 21.1 to of BNT162b2 (Pfizer vaccine) was reported in 15 [43](#B43-vaccines-10-00350), [52](#B52-vaccines-10-00350), [51](#B51-vaccines-10-00350), [53](#B53-vaccines-10-00350), [55](#B55-vaccines-10-00350), [56](#B56-vaccines-10-00350)], and the Johnson and Johnson vaccine was studied in one study [ [30](#B30-vaccines-10-00350)] ( [Table 1](#vaccines-10-00350-t001)). 5.2. Publication Bias [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-00350-f002)) and by conducting Egger's test (t = 0.844, p = 0.43). We found that data was symmetric with low risk of publication bias. 6. Quality Assessment [Figure 3](#vaccines-10-00350-f003)). The quality assessment of observational studies is included in [Supplementary Table Materials](#app1-vaccines-10-00350). 6.1. Primary Outcome Mortality after 7 and 14 Days after 2nd Dose - A total of six studies (4 RCTs and 2 observational studies) assessed mortality due to COVID-19, 7 days after the 2nd dose of vaccination. Mortality among vaccinated subjects decreased significantly (OR = 0.14, [95% CI, 0.05-0.41], I2 = 63%). After conducting sensitivity analysis, the study of Logunov et al. [ [40](#B40-vaccines-10-00350)] was removed, heterogeneity decreased to 54%; and the odds ratio became 0.10 [95% CI, 0.04-0.27], p < 0.001 ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-10-00350-f004)A). It is important to note that in the study of Khan et al. [ [51](#B51-vaccines-10-00350)] deaths due to COVID-19 were not separated from other causes of death. - Four studies addressed mortality 14 days after 2nd dose, all of which were observational, except for the study by Sadoff et al. [ [30](#B30-vaccines-10-00350)]. The overall mortality among vaccinated population decreased significantly (OR = 0.34, [95% CI, 0.26-0.44], I2 = 85%). After conducting a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, the study of Khan et al. [ [51](#B51-vaccines-10-00350)] was omitted. The observed heterogeneity dropped to 0% with an odds ratio of CI, < 0.001 ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-10-00350-f004)B). - Main findings: COVID-19 vaccination significantly decreased deaths 7 and 14 days after 2nd dose. 6.2. Secondary Outcomes Severe COVID-19 Infection 7 Days after the 1st and 2nd Doses - Seven papers studied the incidence of severe COVID-19 infection 7 days after the 2nd dose. In total, 213 of 480,7683 vaccinated people developed severe COVID-19, compared to 3298 out of 191,5476 unvaccinated subjects. The odds ratio of developing severe COVID-19 among vaccinated subjects was 0.08 [95% CI, 0.03-0.25], I2 = 74%. After subgrouping the included studies into RCTs and observational, the heterogeneity dropped to 0%. The difference between observational and interventional studies was not significant (p = 0.46). The odds ratio of severe COVID-19 among vaccinated population in RCTs was 0.14 (95% CI, 0.03-0.75), I2 = 30%, p 0.001 observational - Main findings: COVID-19 vaccination significantly decreased severe COVID-19 after vaccination with either 1 or 2 doses 6.3. Efficacy and Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccine in Reducing Infection Incidence after the 1st Dose 6.3.1. Cases Reported within 7 Days of 1st Dose (Total Cases, Symptomatic and Asymptomatic) - Two studies evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic) within 7 days of the 1st dose. Dagan et al., [ [46](#B46-vaccines-10-00350)] reported that 1965 of 596,618 vaccinated subjects got infection compared to 2362 of 596,618 unvaccinated subjects, OR = 0.83 [95% CI, 2362 596,618 unvaccinated subjects, OR 0.83 [95% CI, 0.78-0.88]. Hall et al. [ [50](#B50-vaccines-10-00350)] highlighted that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was 140 out of 20,641 unvaccinated subjects; it was lower than cases reported among unvaccinated (977 out of 2683), with OR = 0.01 [95% CI, 0.01-0.01]. Due to the significant heterogeneity, we could not pool the findings of these two outcomes. - Bernal et al. [ [52](#B52-vaccines-10-00350)] reported that 346 out of 864 vaccinated subjects versus 8988 out of 24,706 unvaccinated subjects got symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, OR = 1.17 [95% CI, 1.02-1.34]. However, Dagan et al. [ [46](#B46-vaccines-10-00350)] found that the COVID-19 vaccine had a protective effect, with an OR of 0.78 [95% CI, 0.72-0.84]. Among 596,618 vaccinated individuals, about 1103 subjects developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, while among 596,618 unvaccinated individuals, about 1419 subjects developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Due to the significant heterogeneity, we could not pool the findings of these two outcomes. - No studies reported asymptomatic cases within 7 days of the 1st dose. 6.3.2. Cases Reported within 14 Days of 1st Dose: - Four studies assessed the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines within 14 days of the 1st dose. In total, 3909 of 637,142 vaccinated subjects developed SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) within 2 weeks after the 1st dose, compared to 5087 of 614,989 unvaccinated subjects. The odds ratio of getting SARS-CoV-2 infection decreased significantly (OR = 0.17 ([95% CI, 0.02-1.72], I2 = 100%). After we sub-grouped the included studies into RCTs and observational, the heterogeneity decreased to 94%. The difference between observational and interventional studies was significant (p = 0.001). The odds ratio of getting infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the RCTs was 0.79 [95% CI, 0.48-1.3], p = 0.36 while that of observational studies was 0.05 [95% CI, 0.02-0.15], p < 0.001. ( [Figure 6](#vaccines-10-00350-f006)A). - Bernal et al. [ [52](#B52-vaccines-10-00350)] reported 958 symptomatic cases out of 1154 vaccinated subjects compared to 89 out of 8988 unvaccinated subjects, OR = 83.84 [95% CI, 68.07-103.26]. On the other hand, the protective effect of the COVID-19 vaccine was addressed by Dagan et al. [ [46](#B46-vaccines-10-00350)] 1967 out of 596,618 vaccinated subjects versus 2393 out of 596,618 unvaccinated subjects OR = 0.82, [95% CI, 0.77-0.87]. On the same line, Fabiani et al. [ [47](#B47-vaccines-10-00350)] reported that 47 out of 5333 vaccinated subjects versus 89 out of 1090 unvaccinated subjects developed symptomatic diseases, OR = 0.1, [95% CI, 0.07-0.14]. The results could not be pooled due to the significant heterogeneity. - Three studies addressed the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccination in reducing the risk of having asymptomatic COVID-19 within 14 days of the 1st dose (OR = 0.23 [95% CI, 0.06-1.63], I2 = 97%). After conducting a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, the study by Fabiani et al., [ [47](#B47-vaccines-10-00350)] was omitted. The probability of getting asymptomatic infection did not reduce significantly. (OR = 0.73 [95% 0.35-1.53], I2= - Main finding: incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in observational studies decreased significantly after vaccination within 14 days of 1st dose. 6.3.3. Cases Reported within 21 Days of 1st Dose - Five studies assessed the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines within 21 days of the 1st dose. In total, 4621 of 642,572 vaccinated subjects developed SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic) within 3 weeks of the 1st dose, compared to 6318 out of 620,356 unvaccinated subjects. The odds ratio of having infection was 0.19 [95% CI, 0.03-1.17], I2 = 100%. After subgrouping the included studies into RCTs and observational, the heterogeneity dropped to 0%. The difference between observational and interventional studies was insignificant (p = 0.33). The odds ratio of infection with COVID-19 in the RCTs was 0.45 [95% CI, 0.31-0.65], p < 0.001, while the OR in observational studies was 0.13 [95% CI, 0.01-1.49], p < 0.001 ( [Figure 7](#vaccines-10-00350-f007)). - For Dagan et al. [ [46](#B46-vaccines-10-00350)], the odds ratio of catching symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination was 0.73 [95% CI, 0.69-0.77]. Of the 596,618 vaccinated subjects, 2250 developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to 3079 out of 596,618 unvaccinated subjects. Fabiani et al. [ [47](#B47-vaccines-10-00350)] reported that 51 out of 53,333 vaccinated subjects developed symptomatic disease compared to 97 out of 1090 unvaccinated subjects, OR = 0.1 (95% CI, 0.07-0.14). The results could not be pooled due to the significant heterogeneity. - Only the study by Fabiani et al. [ [47](#B47-vaccines-10-00350)] addressed the effectiveness of COVID-19 against asymptomatic infection three weeks after the 1st dose. In total, 15 out of 5333 vaccinated subjects developed asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 compared to 46 out of 1090 unvaccinated subjects, OR = 0.06 [95% CI, 0.04-0.12]. - Main findings: incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 21 days of the 1st dose of vaccination reduced significantly. 6.3.4. Cases Reported within 28 Days of 1st Dose - The total number of cases (symptomatic and asymptomatic) reported 28 days after the 1st dose was reported in two studies; Dagan et al. [ [46](#B46-vaccines-10-00350)] documented 4405 confirmed cases of 596,618 vaccinated individuals compared to 5775 confirmed cases of 596,618 unvaccinated subjects. Hall et al. [ [50](#B50-vaccines-10-00350)] diagnosed 427 cases of 20,641 vaccinated subjects, and 977 cases of 2683 unvaccinated subject. The odds ratios were 0.76 [95% CI, 0.73-0.79] and 0.04 [95% CI, 0.03-0.4], respectively. The research team could not pool the odds ratios due to the significant heterogeneity. - No studies reported asymptomatic or symptomatic cases within 28 days of the 1st dose. 6.3.5. Cases Reported Any Time after 1st Dose - Among 777,171 vaccinated subjects with a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine, 8246 got SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) compared to 58,261 of 1,104,745 unvaccinated subjects (OR = 0.14 [95% CI, 0.07-0.4], I2 = 100%). After subgrouping based on the study design, the heterogeneity dropped to 0%, the odds ratio of RCTs was 0.14 [95% CI, 0.07-0.27], p < 0.001 and of observational studies was 0.15 [95% CI, 0.06-0.4] p < 0.001. The difference between subgroups was not significant, p = 0.88. ( [Figure 8](#vaccines-10-00350-f008)) - Main findings: incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection any time after the 1st dose decreased significantly among vaccinated compared to unvaccinated. 6.4. Efficacy/Effectiveness of the 2nd Dose 6.4.1. Cases Reported within 7 days of 2nd Dose - Six studies reported COVID-19 cases within 7 days of vaccination; two were RCTs and four were observational studies. The number of cases reported decreased significantly among the vaccinated versus non-vaccinated population (OR = 0.06 (95% CI, 0.02-0.21), I2 = 98%). We conducted a meta-regression to explain this substantial heterogeneity, using the type of vaccine and country as predictors [mRNA and non-mRNA]. The output of the developed meta-regression model explained 100.0% of the heterogeneity (variability in our data); [mRNA type, = 3.33, p = 0.028; country UK, = 3.7, p = 0.025; country USA, = 2.03, p = 0.037: Israel was the reference country] ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-10-00350-f009)A). Meaning that vaccination using mRNA decreases the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by 3.33 compared to other vaccines, and vaccination in developed countries like UK and USA decreased the incidence of infection by 3.7 and 2.03 times less than the reference country, respectively. - Incidence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection did not decrease significantly among vaccinated compared to unvaccinated (OR = 0.11 [95% CI, 0.01-1.98], I2 = 77%), p [Figure 9](#vaccines-10-00350-f009)B). - No studies reported asymptomatic cases within 7 days of the 2nd dose. - Main findings: COVID-19 vaccination decreased incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 7 days of 2nd dose. The main predictor of vaccine effectiveness/efficacy were the country where the vaccine was supplied and the type of vaccine. 6.4.2. Cases within 14 Days of 2nd Dose - Three studies highlighted the number of new cases (symptomatic and asymptomatic) reported within 14 days of 2nd dose. Baden et al. [ [37](#B37-vaccines-10-00350)] reported no cases among 14,550 vaccinated subjects compared to 19 cases out of 14,598 unvaccinated subjects. Dagan et al. [ [46](#B46-vaccines-10-00350)] reported 332 confirmed cases out of 187,702 vaccinated subjects and 949 cases out of 186,553 unvaccinated subjects. Hall et al. [ [50](#B50-vaccines-10-00350)] reported 10 cases out of 1607 vaccinated subjects and 977 cases out of 2683 unvaccinated subjects. Pooling of these findings showed significant reduction in incidence of reported cases (OR = 0.05 [95% CI, 0.0-1.34], I2 = 99%). After conducting leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, the study by Dagan et al. [ [46](#B46-vaccines-10-00350)] was omitted, the vaccine was effective in reducing the number of cases reported within 14 days of the 2nd dose (OR = 0.01 [95% CI, 0.01-0.02], I2 = 0%), p 10](#vaccines-10-00350-f010)). - No studies reported asymptomatic or symptomatic cases within 14 days of 2nd dose. - Main findings: incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 14 days of the 2nd dose decreased significantly after vaccination. 6.4.3. Cases Reported 7 Days after 2nd Dose - Among 4,935,355 vaccinated subjects, the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic) 7 days after 2nd dose was 6576, while 111,923 confirmed cases were reported among 2,041,321 unvaccinated subjects. The OR was 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.2], I2=100, p < 0.001, indicating that COVID-19 vaccines had a protective effect. We were able to explain 100% of this heterogeneity by conducting meta-regression analysis. Vaccine type and country were significant predictors of response; [non-mRNA vaccine ( = 2.99, p = 0.0001): mRNA is the reference type, country UK ( = -0.75, p = 0.038), country USA ( = 0.8, p = 0.02); reference country was Israel] ( [Figure 11](#vaccines-10-00350-f011)A). In this case, non-mRNA (the highest OR) vaccine and vaccination in the USA increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by 2.99 and 0.8 times, respectively. On the other hand, vaccination in the UK decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by 0.75 comparing to reference country (Israel). - COVID-19 vaccines were effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection 7 days after the 2nd dose (OR = 0.02 [95% CI, 0.02-0.02], I2 = 0%), p Two studies (recruiting 4,720,118 vaccinated subjects and 1,825,069 unvaccinated subjects) assessed asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection after 7 days of vaccination. Fabini et al. [ [47](#B47-vaccines-10-00350)] diagnosed two cases among vaccinated and non-vaccinated subjects with a statistically non-significant odds ratio (OR = 0.21, [95% CI, 0.03-1.49]). Meanwhile, Hass et al. [ [49](#B49-vaccines-10-00350)] reported 3632 asymptomatic cases among vaccinated subjects and 49,138 among unvaccinated subjects (OR = 0.03, [95% CI, 0.03-0.03]) ( [Figure 11](#vaccines-10-00350-f011)C). Vaccination was protective against asymptomatic infection 7 days after the 2nd dose (OR = 0.06 [95% CI, 0.01-0.41), I2 = 75%), p = 0.04. - Main findings: incidence of SARS-CoV-2 (symptomatic and asymptomatic) reported 7 days after the 2nd dose decreased significantly. 6.4.4. Cases Reported 14 Days after 2nd Dose - We pooled nine studies that addressed the total number of symptomatic or asymptomatic cases confirmed 14 days after the 2nd dose of vaccination. The total number of cases was 4080 out of 4,832,289 vaccinated subjects and 119,829 out of 1,940,635 unvaccinated subjects. The vaccine had a protective effect against getting SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 days after the 2nd dose (OR = 0.08, [95% CI, 0.02, 0.34], I2 = 100%), p < 0.001. Thus, we carried out a meta-regression analysis to understand the main predictors of this heterogeneity. Again, the type of vaccine and the country were responsible for 88.21% of the heterogeneity; [non-mRNA vaccine = 3.519, p = 0.004; country Spain = 2.6256, p = 0.028: Israel was the reference country) ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-00350-f001)A). - Seven studies reported the incidence of symptomatic infection 14 days after the 2nd dose. Vaccination had a protective effect against symptomatic infection. The odds among vaccinated subjects was (0.10 [95% CI, 0.02-0.54], I2 = 100%), p < 0.001. To further explain this substantial heterogeneity, we performed meta-regression analysis that explained 100% of the heterogeneity using type of vaccine and country as predictors; [non-mRNA type, = 3.16, p = 0.0044; country Spain = 2.7, p = 0.0048; Israel is the reference country] ( [Figure 12](#vaccines-10-00350-f012)B). - Regarding asymptomatic cases after 14 days of the 2nd dose, 2294 of 4,773,577 vaccinated subjects compared to 51,271 of 1,881,745 unvaccinated subjects developed asymptomatic infection. (OR = 0.23 [95% CI, 0.03-1.83], I2 = 100%.), p < 0.001. Meta-regression was performed and explain 96.29% of heterogeneity, using type of vaccine and the country as predictors, [non-mRNA type, = 2.9, p = 0.033; country Spain 3.96, p = 0.016: reference [Figure 12](#vaccines-10-00350-f012)C). - findings: incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases (total cases and asymptomatic cases) two weeks after the 2nd dose was significantly reduced. 6.4.5. Cases Reported 7-14 Days after 2nd Dose [46](#B46-vaccines-10-00350)] reported 51 cases out of 108,529 vaccinated subjects and 278 cases out of 107,209 unvaccinated subjects got SARS-CoV-2 infection 7-14 days after the 2nd dose of vaccination OR = 0.18 [95%CI, 0.13-0.24]. Meanwhile, Hall et al. [ [50](#B50-vaccines-10-00350)] reported 4 cases out of 1607 vaccinated subjects and 977 out of 2683 unvaccinated subjects, OR = 0.0 (95% CI, 0.0-0.01). The result could not be pooled due to substantial heterogeneity I2 = 99%. 6.4.6. All Cases Reported after the 2nd Dose - A total of 377 confirmed cases out of 228,715 vaccinated subjects, and 2435 cases out of 224,569 unvaccinated subjects were reported after the 2nd dose, (OR = 0.179 [95% CI, 0.15-0.19], I2 = 98%). The test for subgroup differences suggested that there was no statistically significant subgroup effect (p = 0.98), meaning that the type of study did not significantly modify the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccination. Vaccination decreased the number of cases regardless of the study design, although the protective effect was greater in RCT than in observational studies. There was no heterogeneity between the results of the RCT studies, while the heterogeneity of observational studies was I2 = 99% ( [Figure 13](#vaccines-10-00350-f013)). - Main findings: vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 decreased incidence of infection after the 2nd dose regardless of the duration. 7. Discussion [58](#B58-vaccines-10-00350)]. Although some of the vaccines were approved for emergency use by the FDA in the USA and the respective health departments of other countries across the world, the efficacy and effectiveness should be periodically assessed due to the ongoing antigenic drift. It is worth noting that while vaccinations are still being administered worldwide, the vaccinated population (received at least one dose of vaccine) represents around three-fifth of the entire population [ [59](#B59-vaccines-10-00350)], with safety and effectiveness representing the main concern and points of hesitation for many people [ [25](#B25-vaccines-10-00350)]. Another main concern affecting vaccination coverage is COVID-19 vaccine inequity; vaccine supply will have a long-term and severe impact on socioeconomic recovery in low-and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC) unless immediate action is taken to increase supply and provide equal access for all countries. If LMIC had similar vaccination rates as high-income countries (HIC), an acceleration in scaling up manufacturing and providing adequate vaccine doses might have added costs. A high price per COVID-19 vaccine dose in comparison to other vaccines, as well as delivery costs, including those for the health workforce surge, could put a huge strain on fragile health systems, undermining vaccination programs and essential health services, and causing alarming spikes in measles, pneumonia, and diarrhea [ [60](#B60-vaccines-10-00350)]. [49](#B49-vaccines-10-00350)], while the smallest number was 268 subjects [ [48](#B48-vaccines-10-00350)]. 7.1. Mortality and Severe COVID-19 [61](#B61-vaccines-10-00350), [62](#B62-vaccines-10-00350), [63](#B63-vaccines-10-00350)]. Fiolet et al. [ [64](#B64-vaccines-10-00350)] recently published a review on different COVID-19 vaccines effectiveness; when the strain was not sequenced, the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccination against hospitalization and mortality was over 87-94%. Similarly, inactivated viral COVID-19 vaccine (CoronaVac) was extremely effective against hospitalization (87.5%) and death (86.3%). In addition, if a breakthrough occurs in a vaccinated individual, the events are usually less severe than in an unprotected person [ [65](#B65-vaccines-10-00350)]. Similarly, a recently published meta-analysis highlighted that the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines had the best effectiveness in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. The efficacy of comparing different vaccines in preventing serious illness was not different. Moreover, there was no difference in the efficacy of vaccinations to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 among the elderly [ [66](#B66-vaccines-10-00350)]. Unfortunately, this protective effect wanes with time\u20145 months or more after vaccination\u2014and vaccine effectiveness decreased against hospitalization and deaths (80.0 and 84.8% with the ChAdOx1-S) and (91.7% and 91.9% with BNT162b2), respectively [ [67](#B67-vaccines-10-00350)]. 7.2. Infection after Vaccination [68](#B68-vaccines-10-00350)] hypothesized that if there is a strong adherence to non-pharmacological interventions in the community, the controllable spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be reached sooner than when a substantial part of the population gets vaccinated (e.g., 70-80%). In the current study, COVID-19 vaccines effectively reduced the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. On the same lines, the WHO reported that unvaccinated persons account for the great majority of the current SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [65](#B65-vaccines-10-00350)]. Virus-neutralizing antibodies are principally responsible for the protection provided by presently available vaccinations. These antibodies often inhibit the virus's binding with its cellular receptor or prevent the virus from undergoing the conformational changes essential for fusion with the cell membrane [ [69](#B69-vaccines-10-00350)] We found that vaccination against COVID-19 decreased the number of cases reported within a week of the 2nd dose (OR = 0.06 (95% CI, 0.02-0.21), I2 = 98%). Type of vaccine and country where study was conducted were the main predictors of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. Similarly, the total number of cases diagnosed within 14 days of the 2nd dose decreased significantly, (OR = 0.01 [95% CI, 0.01-0.02], I2 = 0%). In terms of cases reported 7 days after 2nd dose, the total number of cases decreased significantly with vaccination (OR = 0.03 [95% CI, 0.02-0.05], I2 = 73%). About 100% of this heterogeneity was explained by meta-regression (vaccine type and country). Regarding symptomatic cases diagnosed 7 days after the 2nd dose, COVID-19 vaccine was effective in reducing the number of symptomatic cases in comparison to placebo or control group (OR = 0.02 [95% CI, 0.02-0.02], I2 = 0%). The odds ratio of cases reported 14 days after the 2nd dose among vaccinated versus unvaccinated subjects was OR = 0.08, [95% CI, 0.02-0.34], I2 = 100%). Confirmed cases reported after the 1st and 2nd dose regardless of the duration decreased significantly, OR = 0.14 (95% CI, 0.07-0.4) I2 included studies in phase II/III RCTs, the efficacy of mRNA-based and adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines was 94.6% and 80.2%, respectively. After 3 weeks of vaccinations, the adenovirus-vectored vaccine had the maximum efficacy against receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigen after the 1st and 2nd doses (97.6% and 98.2% respectively). Similarly, a review of phase III studies showed a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies with the 2nd dose of the vaccine [ [71](#B71-vaccines-10-00350)]. However, it was also advised that when vaccine supply is scarce, countries should vaccinate with a single dose. This may provide better overall protection in the population than vaccinating half the number of individuals with both doses [ [72](#B72-vaccines-10-00350)]. [73](#B73-vaccines-10-00350)] demonstrated that in the real-world, vaccine effectiveness can be affected by several factors, including population host factors (e.g., those who were not included in clinical trials) and virus factors (e.g., variants) as well as programmatic factors (e.g., adherence to dosing schedules or vaccine storage/handling) [ [74](#B74-vaccines-10-00350)]. Thompson et al. [ [75](#B75-vaccines-10-00350)] reported that under real-world conditions, complete immunization (14 days after 2nd dose) was 90% effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, while partial immunization (14 days after 1st dose but before 2nd dose) was 80% effective. In addition, the effectiveness of vaccination varied according to the types of vaccine; Pilishvili et al. [ [76](#B76-vaccines-10-00350)] stated that vaccine effectiveness for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna (95.6% CI, 70.9-82.7) and 88.9% were 88.8% (95% CI, 84.6-91.8) and 96.3% (95.3-98.4) after the 2nd dose, respectively. Of note, when the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became prevalent, the percentage of completely vaccinated people who got SARS-CoV-2 infection grew higher than predicted [ [63](#B63-vaccines-10-00350)]. The effectiveness of the mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 was 88-100% against Alpha, 76-100% against Beta/Gamma, 47.3-88% against Delta, and when strain was not sequenced. Oxford/AstraZeneca (AZD1222) was 74.5% effective against Alpha and 67% effective against Delta. CoronaVac was effective against the Alpha/Gamma/D614G strain in 36.8-73.8% of cases [ [64](#B64-vaccines-10-00350)]. [77](#B77-vaccines-10-00350)]. It is worth noting that according to a recently published systematic review and meta-analysis, immunization efficacy against severe COVID-19 infection dropped by around 8% (95% CI, 4-15) during the 6-months period in all age groups. Over the same time, vaccine efficacy against serious illness declined by around 10% (95% CI, 6-15%) in individuals over the age of 50. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic illness fell by 32% (95% CI, 11-69%) in individuals over the age of 50 [ [78](#B78-vaccines-10-00350)]. Consequently, WHO has already recommended administering a booster dose of vaccine to people aged 60 years or older as part of the main series to strengthen initial protection [ [65](#B65-vaccines-10-00350)]. Therefore, people should adhere to public health and social measures even though they have received vaccines to avoid COVID-19 infection and its consequences [ [79](#B79-vaccines-10-00350)]. 7.3. Strengths and Limitations [64](#B64-vaccines-10-00350)]. Third, due to scarce of literature, we neither included all approved vaccines nor all age groups (elderly, adolescents, and children). 8.
