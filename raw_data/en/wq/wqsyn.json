I am a Registered Nurse with a BSN. I believe the certificate of need is an attempt at keeping markets closed to alternative choices for healthcare and keeps big pharma in business. I am not willing to subject myself to medical procedures to keep my job. If other opportunities present themselves through more clinics willing to accept natural immunity, I am FOR THAT.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. While this testimony is for myself, I do know many others who have found their way to more allopathic and holistic treatments. The results are often quite astounding and without the side effects that I have felt approximately 50% of the time with pharmaceutical medication. Access and support of these more healthy alternatives should be without question. They would cost insurance companies less and overall be a great compliment to other conventional medical procedures, especially when they cause more pain and suffering. Let be rational and logical and do the right thing for a change. Submission to the leveraging and profit incentives from Big Pharma must stop.WITNESS APPEARANCE DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. As a RN I recognize the importance of informed choice & options when facing an illness. Each individual is not exactly the same & treatment options for individuals should not be treated as such.

I wholeheartedly support HB 1616. This legislation would repeal the certificate of need legislation. Ending CON would empower patients by giving them more choices to serve them and their families rather than supporting the government backed hospitals. CON law restricts healthcare competition by requiring providers to get state approval before entering new markets or expanding what they offer. These restrictions keep newcomers from coming into the market, eliminating competition. We need to end the monopoly here in Missouri!WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

I support the repealing of MO's certificate of need law. This law increases medical costs to all by not allowing for fair market competition in medicine as well as not allowing for medical choice due to the lack of competing health markets/treatments/options. Not only is this putting heavier costs on citizens, but it also jeopardizes peoples health who cannot always be treated by a \"one size fits all\" health care system. It stymies old and new science and is a detriment to our society as a whole .WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. My name is Angelique Chaverri. I am a mom from Springfield and am here today to talk to you about problems that have existed in the healthcare system since long before Covid.My oldest son requires the care of an allergist. It took us 9 months and 8 physicians before we were granted a food allergy diagnosis. The last pediatrician wagged her finger in my 8 month- old's face and told him he was \"doing it on purpose\" as he broke out in hives, vomited and strangled as his airway closed in anaphylaxis. Obviously, we immediately began looking for a different pediatrician. But, after calling 8 different pediatricians, no one in the Springfield hospital system would take us. My son's case was too complicated. We were even told to get all of our medical care through the ER. No one wanted the liability of an 8 month old with food allergies and asthma.We finally found a wonderful independent family practice physician. When my second son was 18 months old, he went into anaphylaxis. Once he recovered, we scheduled the first available appointment we could get with an allergist at a nearby hospital. That allergist refused to test my son saying that the tests he had available were not accurate. An allergist refused to test for a food allergy. There was another allergist in that office that was willing to test and treat my son. However, hospital policy barred us from seeing that physician for 5 years. To keep us from having to drive 3 hours to another hospital, our family physician ordered the tests.Shortly after that, the other hospital in our city hired an allergist. However, we were barred from seeing that allergist in Springfield because we were only approved to see the first allergist at the original hospital. We were, however, allowed to drive to Branson (40 minutes away) to see the new allergist during his twice monthly office hours. Ridiculous.All of this time, both local hospitals were trying to buy our independent family doctor out of business. They finally got their wish. Within 4 months of my youngest son's episode of anaphylaxis, the doctor that had saved both of my children's lives (one during a seizure and the other when he stopped breathing at 4 weeks old) closed his practice and went to work for the hospital system. We have watched as the large conglomerates have gobbled up all of the independent hospitals and doctors' offices in our region until everything is one size fits all. This approach to care does not work for many Missourians.I am here to tell you that these experiences are not rare. As a special education teacher, I hear stories of horrible care from the families I work with all the time.But this isn't just about children. My father is a 100% disabled veteran. I am an only child. My parents live in central Oklahoma and I would really like to bring them here to care for them. I spent several months last year researching assisted living facilities and health care providers in Springfield. Due to my dad's complex health issues, we could not find appropriate placement for my parents here near their grandchildren. After a long wait, we could put my dad in the Veteran's home in Mt. Vernon, yes but then my mom and I would not be near enough to visit him regularly and he and my mom would have to be separated after 53 years of marriage. As it stands, I have to leave my parents in Oklahoma and depend on cousins and aunts and uncles to care for them. We need more innovation in the long-term care sector.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INDIVIDUAL: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. We need choices in our healthcare, as I have aging parents and when you are living on a fixed income, it is very important that they have options on treatments available.

Our current healthcare system is a mess. Even with as many facilities as are available in the metro St. Louis area, people are not able to get quality care, certainly not in a timely manner. Many healthcare facilities have fired their employees over COVID 19 vaccine mandates. Many facilities have implemented policies that violate a patient's right to be supported by family or to have an advocate present. This has caused many people to avoid/delay treatment, sometimes at a detrimental cost to their health. Hospitals are dictating which treatments can and cannot be performed by providers, which has left many people throughout the country having to launch legal battles to get treatments that go against hospital politics. There is no ability for a group of people to come together and open a facility on the area as we would need to provide proof of a \"need\" for such a facility, allowing the existing major health care corporations to have a monopoly on healthcare options in the area. They can dictate the treatments people receive because there is no risk of a competing practice. People need to be able to have the choice to accept healthcare from the well established corporations or to have someone new come into their area. Clearly demographics can't dictate the need for healthcare, as wait times in St. Louis are ridiculous right now, despite having \"plenty\" of hospitals. These hospitals implemented policies that resulted in a large reduction in their workforce, but because of the certificate of need requirement, it is highly unlikely that anyone would be allowed to open a facility that would market to employ these healthcare providers and provide much needed services to the patients that are seeking treatment. Certificate of need allows big healthcare corporations to implement politics into their policies without fear of competition, to the detriment of our communities. People should have a voice and a choice in healthcare. It should not be based on someone else's perception of need based on demographics and a map.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. In October of 2021 my daughter went to the ER in Springfield because of shortness of breath she was seen briefly and then sent back to the waiting room because it was so busy. We sat in the writing room for 10 hours after I made the 2-hour drive down and my daughter was never seen. When we went up to the nurses station she said that there was still seven more people ahead of us and that would continue because my daughters emergency was less complicated than those in front of her and they would continue to put people in front of her because of their complications. There was not enough beds to put the people in and there was not enough staff to deal with all of the patients. It would have been nice to have another choice of a place to go that would have options for treatment.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am in support of Bill 1616 to abolish the certificate of need because it is an archaic backwards requirement for a board filled by Hospital Admin to decide whether we need another hospital or not. We could really use more competition in healthcare, to drive down the costs. my obamacare insurance does not even cover care at my local hospital, I have to either cover the entire costs of an ER visit, or travel 45 mins to a hospital I do not care to use. When I dislocated two ribs in my chest, I was rushed to the local ER, and the visit costs me $2200. I was forced to mask when I already could not breathe from the rib dislocation, and in the end, was referred to my chiropractor to set the ribs. I really could have used some care that was not so expensive, and actually could set my ribs. $2200 for nothing but torment.

I am in support of repealing the Certificate of Need. The only thing it has created is a monopoly of oversized hospitals that no longer cater to the needs of patients, to which we have seen time and time again over the last two years. No longer do they care what is in the best interest of the patients, but to the special interest of big pharma. In repealing the Certificate of Need you would allow competition, which is the only way that patient care will ever take priority. We are country built on competition it's called capitalism and the current system only benefits a few organizations, to whom they alone decide who will be given a Certificate of Need.We need this repealed to allow patients to get the care they deserve.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

Missouri General Assembly MeetingWednesday, January 26, 2022Public Testimony Regarding House Bill 1616The Repeal of Missouri's Certificate of Need Program From Gregory L. Hudson, MHA, MPA, FACHE452 Bluff Meadow DriveEllisville, MO 63021My name is Gregory Hudson, and I am a healthcare and hospital strategic planner and business development professional with twenty-five years of experience. Thank you for allowing me to provide testimony to you today on the importance of repealing the State of Missouri's Certificate of Need law. As for my educational and professional background, I have two Masters degrees - one in hospital administration and one in public policy and management. Most recently, I spent four years with St. Luke's Hospitals in St. Louis as its Chief Strategy Officer. I am here to unequivocally support HB 1616 and the repeal of Missouri's Certificate of Need law. During my twenty-five-year career in healthcare, I have worked for six different multi- hospital healthcare systems that provided regional healthcare services encompassing seven different states, including Ohio, Michigan, Virginia, West Virginia, South Carolina, Missouri and Illinois. In four of these healthcare systems, the responsibility for completing the Certificate of Need applications was mine. I, personally, have completed over 100 CON applications covering three of states above - Michigan, Virginia and West Virginia. These CON applications were for hospital acquisitions, hospital expansions and other large hospital-based capital expenditures, construction of ambulatory surgery centers and purchase of advanced imaging equipment. Most recently with St. Luke's, I did not have executive responsibility for CON development. That responsibility fell to another St. Luke's executive, who utilized the services of outside legal counsel in St. Louis to complete all CON work. In the 100+ CON applications that I personally completed, I only had two applications: both for very valid reasons. During my tenure at my health system in Virginia I served on both the Virginia Department of Health Medical Facilities Plan Taskforce, which was responsible for modifications to Virginia's CON law, as well as the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association's Certificate of Public Need Taskforce. A little history...the first CON law was passed by New York State in 1964. In 1974 and succeeding years, the federal government followed by 49 of the 50 states had adopted CON laws by 1982. More information regarding the history and current status of CON laws and programs can be found on the National Conference of State Legislatures website. The structure of CON review and approval varies state-to-state, but generally a health care facility must seek state approval\u2014through a state health planning agency, department of health or a CON council appointed by the governor or legislature\u2014based on a set of criteria and community need. These state entities often look at criteria such as:? The projected need for the health care service within the area.? Whether a facility has the staff capacity or financing for a proposed activity.? The effects of a proposed project on specific populations (e.g., rural communities).? The effects of a proposed project on health care costs. Once a health facility has applied for state approval, the state may approve, deny or set certain limitations on a health care project. (National Conference of State Legislatures)With the implementationof President Johnson's Great Society Programs, Medicare and Medicaid, the proliferation of new medical technology across America's hospitals and the cost+ reimbursement system with capital project allocations at that time, it was thought CON Programs would help balance the competitive playing field across hospitals and maintain or reduce overall federal and state-level expenditures for healthcare services. With the enactment of the Emergency Medical and Active Labor Act or EMTALA in 1986, hospital administrators noted that their facilities would have to take all comers regardless of the ability to pay for the services they receive. These administrators felt that the CON laws in their states helped them because for-profit ambulatory surgery centers, imaging centers, and other physician- based services were not governed by the EMTALA law leaving the burden of Medicaid and charity care to the hospitals or in other words would allow those entities not covered by EMTALA to \"cherry pick\" very profitable commercially covered patients. In 1987, after several years of the federal government's prospective payment or DRG system in place, the federal CON law was repealed followed by several states. Many other states kept their CON laws in place but have continuously modified them or completed gutted them over the last three decades.During my healthcare planning career, including all the CONs that I have ever written, I have never seen any of the hospitals or healthcare systems for which I have worked be harmed by the entrants of new competitors in the marketplace, including taking on any additional burden for Medicaid and charity care. I know of no hospitals or health systems that have been bankrupted or closed their doors due to the repealing of the CON law in their states. Since the repeal of the national CON law in 1987, there have been a series of national and state- level scholarly whitepapers and analytical reports focused on whether CON laws and programs meet their stated goals. As with many analytical studies, the conclusions often reached were based solely on the sponsoring organization's perspective. I, personally, have come to a single conclusion however...that CON laws and programs are anti-competitive and stifle necessary innovation. Our free- market capitalistic economic system should dictate the successes and failures of market participants...even in our healthcare industry. NOW, let's fast forward to present day and the COVID pandemic. Given President Biden's CMS-based COVID-mandated vaccination for all healthcare workers employed by any provider receiving Medicare and Medicaid, there are potentially thousands of healthcare workers in the State of Missouri who will not get their first vaccination regimen or their booster and will lose their jobs. There is also a significant percentage of Missouri's general population who have decided not to get the COVID vaccination. Given the number of people in Missouri and across the United States that will remain unvaccinated and with the dynamics of the various COVID- related mandates, it is very clear that our state and our Republic are setting up a two-tiered society of the \"Vaxxed\" and the \"Unvaxxed.\" It is inevitable given these dynamics that a parallel economy is beginning to form. When Missouri's CON law and program were written, no one could have imagined what the impact of a global pandemic would have on our healthcare system and the potential for discrimination between the \"Vaxxed\" and the \"Unvaxxed.\" Given the state of affairs today with the proliferation of non-traditional healthcare market entrants like CVS, Walmart, Amazon and United Healthcare's Optum subsidiary and the dynamics of the COVID pandemic, I urge the Missouri General Assembly to repeal the antiquated CON law and allow competition and innovation to work to the advantage of all Missourians. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today and Godspeed!!! National Conference of State LegislaturesCertificate of Need (CON) State LawsCertificate of Need (CON) laws are state regulatory mechanisms for approving major capital expenditures and projects for certain health care facilities. In a state with a CON program, a state health planning agency or other entity must review and approve projects like establishing a new health care facility or expanding a facility's health service capacity in a specified area. CON programs primarily aim to control health care costs by restricting duplicative services and determining whether new capital expenditures meet a community need.Currently, 35 states and Washington, D.C., operate a CON program with wide variation state to state. The following interactive 50-state map lists the health care facilities and proposed activities covered under the CON law for each state as of December 2021. It also includes enacted CON legislation for the past three legislative sessions (2019, 2020 and 2021) as well as whether a state has a moratorium on certain health care facilities or activities.State Actions SummaryIn the past several years, many states have introduced or enacted legislation to modify their CON programs. Changes range from fully repealing an existing CON program to creating a new CON program. However, most state legislation makes targeted changes to CON oversight, such as excluding specific facilities from CON review. ? Currently, 35 states and D.C. maintain some form of CON program. States with CON laws most often regulate hospitals, outpatient facilities and long- term care facilities.? As of 2021, 12 states have fully repealed their CON programs or allowed the program to expire. New Hampshire was the most recent state to repeal its CON program in 2016.? Three states\u2014Arizona, Minnesota and Wisconsin\u2014do not officially operate a CON program, but they maintain several approval processes that function similarly to CON. ? In 2020, at least six states\u2014Michigan, New Jersey, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia\u2014enacted legislation to modify their CON laws in some capacity. Additionally, five states\u2014Michigan, Montana,North Carolina, Tennessee and Washington\u2014and Washington, D.C. enacted CON legislation in 2021. Montana's legislation was the most sweeping of these bills, exempting all facilities except long-term care facilities from CON review. ? Related to CON, at least 13 states have a moratorium on certain health care activities and capital expenditures, meaning they will not grant CON or state approval for a specific activity. Moratoria are most common for long-term care related activities, such as expanding the number of long-term care beds in a facility.History of Certificate of Need LawsNew York was the first state to enact a CON law in 1964; 26 states enacted CON laws throughout the following decade. Early CON programs typically regulated capital expenditures greater than $100,000, facilities expanding bed capacity and facilities establishing or expanding health care services.In 1972, several states adopted Section 1122 waivers, which provided federal funding to states regulating new health care services receiving Medicare and Medicaid dollars. Congress then passed the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974 bolstering federal funding for state and local health planning regulations.The federal law required states to adopt CON laws similar to the federal model resulting in all states, except Louisiana, with some form of a CON program by 1982. This meant states had broad regulatory oversight over several facilities\u2014including hospitals, nursing and intermediate care facilities, and ambulatory surgery centers\u2014as well as the expansion or development of a facility's service capacity. The federal mandate was repealed in 1987, along with the associated federal funding. Subsequently, several states repealed or modified their CON laws.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Competition promotes safer healthcare which is woefully necessary, especially now. Thousands of healthcare workers have been rendered unemployed due to mandates from their employers. In St. Louis alone, hospital capacity is down over a thousand beds from two years ago. Removing Certificate of need requirements provides the ability for these healthcare workers to open their own facilities and service more Missourians. This only benefits the people. The government should not be in the business of limiting healthcare options, and competitors should not be able to lobby the government to maintain their monopolies, especially at the expense of Missourian's health. Vote for the people and vote in favor of removing certificates of need.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. As a physician that has been practicing for 11 years I have witnessed the decline of the health care system. I have lived it as a patient and more specifically I have lived it as a doctor over the last two years. Many patients are terrified of the hospital. Terrified. They will not go in. The citizens of Missouri know the current government-funded healthcare system is not where it needs to be. The lack of competition and choice, the regulatory and insurance agencies dictating care, and the push for Evidence-Based-Medicine effectively eliminating the ability for a physician to think critically about what is best for each individual patient have all led to the current climate where patients are refusing to seek care at a hospital. If they do go they are turned away because they \"are not sick enough\" and told to return when they can't breathe. This is opposite of anything we have ever done in medicine. There are multiple modalities that can be used to treat the illness of COVID and the inflammatory and thrombotic processes that COVID causes. I am willing to bet that most legislators would agree that they do not want themselves or their family to enter a hospital right now. That is the truth of where we are at. The policies in place prevent family from being at your side as an advocate which is all the more necessary due to staffing shortages that have been worsened by the vaccine mandates. The protocols hospitals are using are not only ineffective, but also, as research is showing, are causing much harm, and this is leading to public distrust. Eliminating Certificate of Need would allow for facilities to exist that are not under the stanglehold of the government. This is crucial for our state. We need to protect our citizens from the failures of government policy and allow for independent care facilities that will provide care that works which ncludes attention to emotional, spiritual, mental, and nutritional needs as well as medical needs. Current policies do not meet these needs for our citizens. Please allow for Certificate of Need to be removed in order to change the state of healthcare in Missouri.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Testimony of Jaimie CavanaughAttorney, Institute for JusticeHouse Downsizing Government Committee January 26, 2022Dear Chairman Barker and Members of the Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony. I am an attorney at the Institute for Justice and write to offer my strong support of H.B. 1616. As you may know, the problems with certificate of need (CON) laws abound. They are a remnant of a failed federal program and serve no purpose today. The State of Missouri, this Committee, and the sponsors of this legislation are to be commended for taking action to end these harmful laws. The Institute for Justice is a nonprofit public interest law firm. One of IJ's main focuses is protecting the right to economic liberty\u2014or the right to earn an honest living. For decades, IJ has litigated and supported legislation to end CON laws. CON laws often stand in the way of entrepreneurs who want to provide new services to their communities. And the real losers are the patients who never get to benefit from innovative services or business models. In 2020, I had the opportunity to write a report (https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Conning-the-Competition-WEB- 08.11.2020.pdf) comparing the CON laws across the country. The results showed an incoherent doctrine. For instance, many CON proponents argue that CONs are necessary to keep hospitals in rural areas, but Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Oregon, and Washington exempt rural areas from their CON programs. That's because competition leads to more care, not less. CONs were also originally created to apply to facilities with large capital investments only. Today, CONs apply to everything from imaging scanners to simply adding burn care or neonatal intensive care services at hospitals. There is no reason to limit these services because there is no risk of over utilization. No one will be in a neonatal intensive care unit by mistake. In fact, that is a place everyone wants to avoid.My report also found that 25 out of 39 CON jurisdictions were forced to quickly suspend or loosen CON requirements in 2020 to allow healthcare providers the flexibility to respond to the pandemic. If CON laws provide all the benefits proponents claim, we would need more of them during a pandemic, not fewer. Although the statistics and empirical evidence all paint a clear picture of why CON laws are harmful, I would like to share two personal stories about IJ clients who can't earn a living the way they would like because of CON laws. And it is not just the clients who suffer. Their communities suffer too from the lack of access to tailored and affordable care. Louisville, Kentucky. Dipendra Tiwari wants to provide home health care to refugees around Louisville in a language they understand. But the state won't let him because it says that service isn't needed. How can that be? The answer is a government permission slip called a certificate of need.Nearly 100,000 Nepali speakers have been welcomed to the United States after ethnic tensions forced them out of their homes in the Himalayan country of Bhutan. Thousands of these refugees resettled in Louisville. And, just like anyone else, they need health care as they age. This situation gave Dipendra, a native Nepali speaker, an idea for a valuable service: a home health care agency catering to the refugee population, offering service in their own language. So, last year, Dipendra formed Grace Home Care and paid a $1,000 fee to submit his plan to the state.That'swhen things went wrong. A $2 billion health care conglomerate\u2014Dipendra's future competitor\u2014stormed in to argue that there was no need for another home health agency. Based on some back-of-the-envelope estimates, and ignoring the need for Nepali-language care that Dipendra was trying to address, Kentucky agreed. It refused to issue a certificate of need and rejected Dipendra's application.And that's exactly how certificates of need are supposed to work. Originating in a long-debunked effort to control costs, in practice, all they do is prevent new businesses from competing with established ones. They are why in Kentucky's 120 counties new home health agencies are allowed in only six. They are why Louisville itself has only nine home health agencies for 26,000 patients.And, to be clear, CON laws have nothing to do with ensuring health or safety (which are covered by other laws). Rather, the whole point of current CON laws is to benefit established providers by stifling competition.But giant health care conglomerates don't need the government to protect their business. And entrepreneurs shouldn't lose their shot just because someone else happened to get there first.New Bern, North Carolina. Dr. Singleton's mission is to provide the best possible care for his patients at a price they can afford. He provides comprehensive eye care\u2014everything from routine checkups to treatment for infections or disorders to surgery. He can do most of this at his own facility, Singleton Vision Center. However, he is legally required to perform surgeries, like cataract surgery or corrective surgery, at the local hospital, CarolinaEast, which charges thousands of dollars more in facility fees.Dr. Singleton believes this system is needlessly inconvenient and expensive for his patients. For instance, he can perform a cataract surgery at his office for under $1,800 total (facility and surgery fee included), while CarolinaEast charges almost $6,000 for its facility fee alone. Dr. Singleton would like to perform all of his surgeries at his office and save his patients thousands of dollars. Performing outpatient eye surgeries at Dr. Singleton's facility is also just as safe as performing them at a hospital. The only thing standing in Dr. Singleton's way is a certificate of need (CON). At the moment, Dr. Singleton cannot even begin the process of applying for a CON. Under North Carolina's CON law, providers may only apply for a CON to offer new services or buy new equipment for which there is a predetermined \"need\" in their area for the coming year. Those determinations are made by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services in conjunction with the North Carolina State Health Coordinating Council using an overly simplified formula. There hasn't been a \"need\" for any kind of new surgery center in Dr. Singleton's community for at least a decade, so there is no option for him to even begin the process of applying for a CON.These examples demonstrate just how much power CON gives incumbent CON holders. They also demonstrate how CON laws cause most healthcare companies and entrepreneurs to give up before even applying for a CON. This leads to less innovation, leaving patients with fewer options. As it stands, the current system allows the big healthcare conglomerates to stomp out newcomers. But instead of stacking the deck against newcomers and innovation, I urge this Committee to welcome new providers and services. This will likely decrease costs and give patients more options. Missouri can accomplish that by supporting H.B.1616. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify.

While CON programs were intended to limit the supply of health care services within a state, proponents claim that the limits were necessary to either control costs or increase the amount of charity care being provided. However, 40 years of evidence demonstrate that these programs do not achieve their intended outcomes, but rather decrease the supply and availability of health care services by limiting entry and competition. For policymakers in Missouri, this situation presents an opportunity to reverse course and open the market for greater entry, more competition, and ultimately more options for those seeking care.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

I am in support of this bill. Our healthcare is being regulated way too much. Doctors can't act as doctors anymore, they must do what a data set says they can. No other options. That is wrong. They go to medical school for a long time to learn various treatments. People are different so no plan of care is exactly the same. Doctors and nurses, other healthcare members should be able to decide on their own if they want to open up their own practice or facility of need in the area they live. The government doesn't know everything about every town. The people do. So a healthcare provider would know if something is needed in their town or not. Creating competition to other places could low health care costs if one sees all their patients going away for the same or better care at a cheaper cost.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Doctors, nurses and clinics should not need approval by the State of Missouri to offer treatment, expand services or purchase equipment. I believe hospitals have become an arm of wealthy bankers who are controlling how they want Americans to be treated. Currently hospitals are restricting medications and denying patients requests. Americans should have options to receive treatment at facilities and with care providers that they feel comfortable with for their health. The only reason why they would need permission is because some group wants to control them. Let's not control healthcare but let the people make decisions for the type of care they prefer.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME BUSINESS/ORGANIZATION: WITNESS NAME: JEREMY THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.

As I am writing this, my friend is in the ER. He was taken by ambulance from work. He arrived at Mercy's emergency room in Springfield Missouri today at noon. I was waiting all afternoon for an update. When I left work, I made a call to see if I could find out what was wrong. He is still in the ER. He is still in severe pain. He hasn't seen a doctor or been given pain meds. This is my fear! Needing medical attention, and none to be found. COVID is bad and it concerns me, but I can create a plan for myself when it comes to Covid. I did some investigating and found people in the medical community that helped me prepare for a potential illness as well as preventing an illness. But when it comes to a severe medical emergency, I have no confidence in my 2 local hospitals. They have created an environment that is understaffed and unable to provide medical treatments to their patients in a timely manner. This is a monopoly and should be illegal. I should be able to seek out medical treatments of my choosing. I want to make my health a priority and spend my money on medical professionals who I choose.

Practitioners who would like to open a new facility should be able to do so in a free market society and that process should not be restrictive.

It is time to give patients more choice and to untie the hands of qualified physicians who wish to do what they were trained to do, practice medicine. These hospital systems have tied the hands of good doctors by creating standardized protocols, denying the right of individualized care for patients. We are all different. Different races with different health issues. Yet, everyone is made to follow the same standards. It is time to allow for individualized care which can only come by giving the power back to the doctor/ patient relationship. There should not be a board dictating what treatments a patient receives. People have been denied life saving treatment because protocols must be followed. We are in the greatest country in the world. Yet, we have people being left alone while dying and denied life saving treatments, not to mention nutrition and hydration. We need to make sure that doctors can treat their patients and that patients can get the care they deserve as well as be able to have another doctor come on board for their care without having to jump through hoops and filing lawsuits. It is time for patients to once again feel safe with the doctor and patient relationship, not fear having to go to the hospital. Therefore, I am in favor of HB1616.

Hospital procedures and protocols which tie the hands of doctors and nurses are the reason we don't trust or want big hospital systems to be the only option. Doctors and nurses, especially those given ultimatums this past year want somewhere to go where people are actually being heard and taken care of - I know nurses and doctors who would start their own practice, hospital or ER if they could.

I wholeheartedly support HB 1616. This legislation would repeal the certificate of need legislation. Ending CON would empower patients by giving them more choices to serve them and their families rather than supporting the government backed hospitals. CON law restricts healthcare competition by requiring providers to get state approval before entering new markets or expanding what they offer. These restrictions keep newcomers from coming into the market, eliminating competition.

My name is Meaghan Hagen and my mother Jane Miller died on January 4th, 2022 of COVID, she was only 57 years old. While my mother had comorbidities that contributed to her death, I do firmly believe if doctors and hospital protocols were not what they are, my mother could very possibly be alive today. People like myself and my mother are watching the treatment that others are getting (or not getting) from their doctors and from hospitals. When you are diagnosed with COVID you are told to go home and wait. Wait until you can't breathe and then go to the emergency room, where you can be admitted after waiting for hours, then put on a ventilator, given Remdesivir and left to die alone. I have personally seen people that have tried to get preventative treatment denied. I have seen people who arrive at the hospital with a protocol that they want to use to treat COVID and they are told that their protocol will not be followed. And these are not outrageous requests. These are requests to follow scientifically proven treatments, yet since they are not on the list of 'government approved' treatments, despite the fact that they have shown success in clinical settings they are disregarded. Why would people want to go to the hospital to be degraded, mistreated and disregarded? They won't, and then they end up in the position of trying to treat themselves, sometimes unsuccessfully. We need true patient choice. We need competition. We need people to be able to start early treatments and if that means new clinics, new hospitals, so be it. Now the FDA has removed EUA for monoclonal antibodies there truly is no treatment being offered now outside of ventilation and Remdesivir. Every single person is unique and should be treated as such. Why are we suppressing treatments that are showing success in clinical settings? The answer is MONEY. If we admit we have successful treatments for COVID these vaccines would never have been given emergency use authorization and these pharmaceutical companies would have lost billions in profits. The result of this deception is that real have died because they have been refused life saving treatment and medication. People like my mom. She was a person. She didn't deserve this. Do your job. Protect the citizens of Missouri by eliminating the Certificate of Need and opening up competition.

My name is Nancy Barnes, I am very concerned about Healthcare in Missouri now that Covid is all that is on anyone's mind. Every time I or my family members get sick we are now afraid to go to the ER or ICC for fear that they will not really LISTEN to what is going on or even treat us appropriately. I have allergies 24/7/365 & so does my son. I also have asthma. Other than that our family is very healthy. Last year my mother took my father to Saint Francis because he had blood in his urine and it was getting worse. They would not let my mom go in with dad due to Covid protocol. I met them there but we had to stay in the parking lot. We could not even stay in the waiting room. A few minutes passed and mom got a call from a nurse and was told that dad tested positive for covid and they were admitting him. She then put the doctor on the phone and I asked if they would please retest him because I knew there were issues with false positive tests and they refused (my mother had it on speakerphone so I could hear too). He said due to the condition of his lungs he knew it was covid and pneumonia. So there was no reason to retest him.My father had short term memory issues and my mom was his POA. She advised them of this and they didn't seem to care that she needed to be with him. He would agree to anything they asked of him because he was in pain and wanted to feel better. They would not let her stay with him. They said she needed to go home and quarantine. She advised she would leave but she would be back with his legal documents so they could put them in his file. All which indicated she is his POA and he does not want to be intubated. She went home and returned right away. She took the documents to the medical records department and they copied them and scanned into his record. She then returned home.We had very few updates on his condition from nurses and only a couple calls from the doctors the entire week he was in the hospital. Other than when mom or I would call to check. My mother, my aunt that stayed with them and I never developed covid. Even after being in my dad's face on multiple occasions days prior to his admission. My father's health was not good. He had agent orange exposure from Vietnam, which resulted in peripheral neuropathy affecting his lungs. He was on home oxygen for 2 years prior to this (when he would keep it on because he couldn't remember to put it back on all the time or it bothered him), he was diabetic, and had with his neck fused and degenerative disc disease. Putting him in that covid unit without knowing for certain he had covid was his death sentence. He lived only 1 week. We got to face time with him the day before he passed away. We didn't get to hug him or explain why we couldn't be there and ten minutes later he wouldn't remember anyway. After going thru all that with him I am now afraid to go to the ER, ICC, the doctors office or take any of my family members for fear they will do the same to them or myself. So we take otc meds when needed and I pray we never have to break down and go to the hospital for anything. I feel like they murdered my father and I can no longer trust them.I hope my testimony can help get our state on the right track back to quality Healthcare that everyone can trust.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Desperate patients and their families had limited choices during the covid panic because of rules and protocols issued by federal agencies that local hospitals and nursing homes complied with. This resulted in a disgraceful disregard for the rights and dignity of patients by these entities and their employees. Countless families describe behaviors by medical providers that amounted to false imprisonment, neglect, treating without consent which is assault and battery, medical kidnapping and perhaps even experimentation and murder. These medical care providers tell us they had to comply with federal rules or face fines that could potentially put them out of business. The fallacy of this argument is that federal agencies have no authority to violate a citizen's Constitutional and Civil Rights. None. These medical care providers and their lobbying organizations had to have known this. Their lawyers had to have known this. Yet they did nothing to protect their patients from egregious harm. They didn't challenge the federal agencies' edicts even though they were in the best position to do so. Instead, they accepted federal largesse: overtreating patients in ICU wards, administering toxic treatments according to NIH protocols, refusing alternatives shown effective, denying patients the protection of their families and denying them their rights. They continue to use the excuse of illegal federal edicts to dismiss their conduct. They argue these same illegal edicts will place them in a bind if the state takes any action to protect its citizens from further abuse. Why should the state continue to protect these organizations from competition with certificate of need laws? These organizations have shown their stripes. The people of Missouri deserve better. There are decent, talented healthcare professionals willing and ready to offer quality care.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. I am submitting testimony in support of HB 1616. We desperately need more choice in our healthcare and this would be one way to accomplish that. My family went through a devastating situation last December when my father passed away in a local hospital. We did not want to admit him to the hospital but felt we had no other choice. The hospital denied any visitors and we desperately wanted to take my father out of the hospital and get him the help he needed but were left with no alternatives. Every individual is unique and requires a unique care plan. Hospitals currently have a one size fits all approach that is clearly not working for many people. With the removal of the CON, we would open the door for all types of medical facilities so that people had the choice of which type of care and facility best fit their needs. We are certain that if we had other options, we would have taken our father out of the the hospital he was currently in and tried a different approach. It is unfair to not allow choice in regards to someone's health and well being.WITNESS APPEARANCE 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Please pass this bill.People died because limits on what medicine they could have existed. Or masks and.vxxs demanded to service a patient, which is a DIRECT violation of the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm and the Nuremberg Code. This bill would allow choice on medicines and entry to facilities to get help instead of harm. Masks harm, yet facilities stated they \"had to have them on patients qnd employees\" ignoring how they harmed people. Any hospital, doctor, medical office should still be serving patients masked or not, vxxdd or not.On top of that illogical demand, patients were.denied the medicines that would have brought them back to health, and fast. And some died, killed, murdered by hospitals that denied the medicines they needed, the medical care they needed, the assistance at home they needed.This bill will repeal the artificial virtue signaling and evil procedures of not allowing patients care and medicine they need and doctors know it wouls have helped but were told they could not provide. This is just flat out wrong.Please pass this repeal of the Certificate of Need bill.No doctor or nurse should be hindered from providing medicine or care or facility access they know would help their patient. Having seen such abuse of negligence via the withholding of medicine, care for so many especially these past 2 years since March 2020 until present, the real need is to let medical systems and care givers do their job and well! Having watched my mother suffer from hindered services back in 2017 and 2018 until she died, to see that such hindrances have now become mass overblown victims of a FOREIGN CDC and WHO telling the United States what is good or not and then this Certificate of need being.defined by them to kill and harm people, it needs to be gone and so does any connection to CDC and WHO. Remove these barriers to honoring Hippocratic Oaths and the Nuremberg Code.If you do not pass this, you become just as guilty.

Several states do not have certificate of need and Missouri needs to be added to that list. I feel it is just a way for corporations to monopolize local healthcare. It requires providers and facilities to jump through hoops and spend more money on permits which only directs extra costs to the patient. It does not save money and it is not helping underprivileged receive better healthcare.

My name is Timothy Brockelbank. Some years ago I needed my np knee replaced. My orthopedic surgeon was at Mercy. I did my research and determined the implant I wanted based on the engineering studies which compare all implants with standard wear testing. My surgeon at Mercy told me he could not use that implant because the hospital had an agreement with a different supplier. I ended up having to do significant travel to a different city to have my surgery because of the monopoly which the CON law supports and enables. My surgery was performed by a surgeon operating out of St Luke's hospital in Oklahoma. It is ridiculous that a citizen of Missouri has to look out of state for better options because of this law.

LeadingAge Missouri Written Testimony in Opposition to HB 1616, Repealing Missouri's Certificate of Need LawLeadingAge Missouri (LA MO) is an association of 130 mostly non-profit senior living and healthcare communities across Missouri. LA MO members deliver the full continuum of senior care in different settings, including affordable housing and market-rate independent living units; hospice, adult day care, home & community-based services, nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, residential care facilities and assisted living facilities. Of these senior care settings, the last four require a certificate of need (CON) to become a licensed long-term care (LTC) provider in Missouri. HB 1616 would repeal the certificate of need process. While repeal is intellectually appealing to LA MO members and consistent with free-market principles, LA MO opposes CON repeal at this time. While most LA MO members would like to end the CON process, the flood of LTC facilities into the marketplace - chasing profitable \"private pay\" residents - threatens the viability of nursing homes (that serve MO HealthNet LTC residents) through decreased occupancy. As nursing home occupancy shrinks, the cost of a Medicaid bed rises as costs are allocated among fewer occupied beds. This increases State Medicaid expenditures. The CON process is supposed to help control State healthcare costs, so the CON process needs to do a better job - not go away. LA MO fails to understand how eliminating the gatekeeper and opening the floodgates completely to \"cherry picking new LTC entrants\" - by repealing CON - will help the State, the industry or Missouri citizens in need of LTC. LA MO and its members believe market forces should govern LTC services - and the mission of most LA MO members is a benevolent one - so LA MO members fully accept some level of uncompensated care. That said, non-profit nursing homes are businesses that must cover costs to survive and advance their missions. The State is not currently reimbursing reasonable and adequate costs for MO HealthNet residents in many cases, so nursing homes are not on a level playing field in the competitive marketplace with the \"new entrant cherry pickers\". Until nursing homes are reasonably and adequately reimbursed for the care they deliver to the State's Medicaid beneficiaries, LA MO cannot support CON repeal. Extinguishing all gatekeeping (ending the CON process) will exacerbate an already challenging situation. LA MO believes the State can and should improve the CON process now, as opposed to doing away with it now. The Missouri Health Facilities Review Committee (\"MHFRC\" approves/rejects CON applications) has rule revisions before it to end ex parte communication (lobbying MHRC members) and to adjust the State's CON \"need\" formula to account for occupancy rates and, potentially, to consider staffing availability in service areas. These reforms will improve the CON process.If the LTC market was a normal, competitive marketplace, LA MO would agree that a CON is an unnecessary burden on competition and commerce. However, market forces in the LTC marketplace are disrupted when the largest LTC payor - the State - fails to reimburse nursing homes for the cost of care provided to State Medicaid residents. On average, Missouri reimbursesnursing homes at rates that are more than $20 per patient, per day below average costs. That produces annual losses for nursing homes on Medicaid residents in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. For many LeadingAge members, that cost/reimbursement gap is far higher. Nursing homes subsidize the cost of care delivered to State Medicaid beneficiaries. However, the overwhelming number of new entrants to the LTC marketplace (largely \"private pay\" assisted living facilities) do not - because assisted living facilities do not care for Medicaid patients. But they do attract nursing home private pay residents. Sixty-five percent of Missouri nursing home beds are filled with money-losing or breakeven State Medicaid patients. These nursing homes need to retain their private pay residents to absorb the State's underfunding - or they will fail. In recent years, the overwhelming bed volume growth in LTC has been in private pay assisted living. If no gatekeeper is present, that trend will increase and bankrupt private nursing homes - leaving the State to shoulder all of the burden of care.The burden of bearing some of State's LTC obligation to low-income older Missourians in nursing homes puts nursing homes at a competitive disadvantage in the LTC marketplace. In recent years, thousands of LTC beds have been approved throughout an over-bedded Missouri (according to State \"need\" data). The flood of assisted living facilities and boutique skilled nursing facilities (Medicare reimbursed short-stay facilities) would be even greater without a the MHFRC gatekeeper. That same flood has lowered occupancy rates at SNFs to historically low levels - 10% below National averages. As indicated, lower occupancy drives up the per patient care cost for both providers and the State. The flood has also driven up workforce costs. There's a historic workforce shortage and competition for capable, qualified caregivers is intense. The competition to staff new LTC market entrants and fill beds with private pay residents is costing the State money and is threatening the only place Medicaid residents can receive long-term care - nursing homes. The solution is to start reasonably and adequately reimbursing nursing homes for their Medicaid care costs - something the Governor proposes in his FY 2023 Budget. The Governor is proposing to finance complete rebasing of Medicaid provider reimbursement rates to cover provider costs (essentially close the cost/reimbursement gap). Until this is occurs, and the market stabilizes after years of below-cost reimbursement, LA MO cannot support CON repeal. LA MO supports a CON process that delivers \"needed\" LTC facilities in the short- term to allow CON repeal in the long-term.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME INFORMATION ON THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME BUSINESS/ORGANIZATION: WITNESS THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. My name is Joe Luppino-Esposito and I am the Deputy Legal Policy Director of Pacific Legal Foundation. We are a nationwide nonprofit legal organization dedicated to protecting and defending the constitutional and individual rights of all Americans. I am here today to speak on HB 1616 and the problems with certificate of need (CON) laws. The bill eliminates a practice in the healthcare industry that has led to poor results for patients, fewer options for care, and higher costs to both consumers and government. certificate of need laws are archaic and anachronistic in a state that prides itself on being welcoming to business and resistant to government overreach.We like to call certificate of need laws the \"competitor's veto.\" In practice, it works exactly like it sounds. The already-present members of the industry get to decide if their would-be competition is allowed to enter the marketplace. You will not find it surprising that in most instances, the competition is not welcome. This is the equivalent of needing a permission slip to choose how you earn a living.In their original application, certificate of need laws were used to protect businesses such as railroads and utilities, who made similar arguments to what we hear today: that competition is too difficult to withstand; that rural communities would not be served; and the like. These transportation-industry based version of cronyism have extended to many other industries, including healthcare. This was incentivized by the federal government, offering funding based on the now-evident failure of the policy to achieve its policy goals. The federal government has since removed the CON mandate, but the vestiges remain in several states, including Missouri.The reasoning behind this protectionism is not justifiable from a constitutional standpoint. Current laws often do not consider health and safety or other rational bases for limiting one's right to earn a living. From our perspective, this is a violation of the constitutional right to economic liberty. This is an inherent right to not be deprived of liberty without due process of law, as recognized in the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution. The legal landscape on this is shifting against certificate of need laws. As our research report \"Competitor's Veto: A Roadblock to New Businesses\" explains, \"The U.S. Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits have ruled that the Constitution prohibits economic protectionism,\" though some courts have still found the practices of picking favorites to be permissible. We strongly disagree with the latter group.The reason for this is that the original intentions of certificate of need laws are not being met, and are therefore legally impermissible. CON laws were meant to ensure that hospitals remain open and accessible to more people. In states with certificate of need laws, there are 30% fewer hospitals per 100,000 residents according to the Mercatus Center. The study showed this is true for rural communities as well. CON laws were meant to improve care. Researchers Thomas Stratmann and David Wille found that \"in states where CON laws regulate provider entry into healthcare markets, incumbents tend to provide lower-quality services.\" Further, they found that in states with certificate of need laws that there are more deaths for treatableconditions following surgery and higher mortality rates for common issues such as heart failure, pneumonia, and heart attacks. And only a few days ago, this position was bolstered by a federal district judge in Mississippi who wrote that a challenge to that state's CON laws could move forward because although there is great deference given to government when it comes to regulation, \"nonsensical explanations\" do not suffice. He further wrote that , \"The allegations [by the plaintiff challenging the regulations] reveal that CON laws result in more costly, less accessible, and worse quality health care. What's more, plaintiff claims that the basis for CON laws and the moratoria is pure economic protectionism\u2014an illegitimate government interest.\"With these facts known, all that is left is bald favoritism, a system most Americans reject and that the Constitution does not allow.This is not the first time that Pacific Legal Foundation has been to Missouri to challenge certificate of need laws. In 2012, we filed suit in federal court on behalf of Michael Munie, an entrepreneur who wanted to run his moving company statewide. When he applied for his license, CON laws allowed his competitors to refuse to allow him into the market. As our suit was going forward, this body passed a bill, eventually signed by the governor, that eliminated this anticompetitive practice. The same good reasoning for doing as such in the transportation context equally applies to the healthcare industry.We are currently representing clients in Kentucky and Louisiana and are looking to extend our practice to the states who continue to violate economic liberty. Missouri would take a step in the right direction to affirm this right and eliminate the competitor's veto that is certificate of need laws.WITNESS APPEARANCE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME BUSINESS/ORGANIZATION: THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. Chairman Baker, Vice-Chair Schnelting, Ranking Member Bangert, and members of the House Downsizing State Government Committee: My name is Matthew Mitchell. I am an economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. In recent years, my colleagues and I have been studying certificate-of-need (CON) laws in healthcare. I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss our findings with you today.Today, I will1. offer a brief history of CON laws,2. compare Missouri's CON program to the programs in other states,3. give an overview of the economic evidence that supports the conclusion that these laws harm patients and taxpayers, and4. suggest reforms, including outright repeal, that would improve both patient and overall welfare in the state.Introduction to CON LawsCON laws require healthcare providers wishing to open or expand a healthcare facility to first prove to a regulatory body that their community needs the services the facility would provide. The regulations are typically not designed to assess a provider's qualifications or safety record. Other regulations such as occupational licensing aim to do that. Instead, CON laws aim to determine whether or not a service is economically viable and valuable.The process for obtaining a CON can sometimes take years and cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in preparation costs. These regulations appear to benefit incumbent providers by limiting their competition; their effects on patients and taxpayers, however, have generally been found to be negative. This finding helps explain why antitrust authorities at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and at the US Department of Justice (DOJ) have long taken the position that these rules are anticompetitive. In a joint report from 2004, for example, the FTC and DOJ declared,The Agencies believe that, on balance, CON programs are not successful in containing health care costs, and that they pose serious anticompetitive risks that usually outweigh their purported economic benefits. A Brief History of CON RegulationAlmost five decades ago, Congress passed and President Ford signed the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974. The statute enabled the federal government to withhold federal funds from states that failed to adopt CON regulations in healthcare.New York had already enacted the first CON program in 1964; by the early 1980s, with the federal government's encouragement, every state except Louisiana had implemented some version of a CON program. Policymakers hoped that these programs would restrain healthcare costs, increase healthcare quality, and improve access to care for poor and underserved communities.In 1986\u2014after Medicare changed its reimbursement practices and as evidence mounted that CON laws were failing to achieve their stated goals\u2014Congress repealed the federal statute, eliminating federal incentives for states to maintain their CON programs. Since then, 15 states, representing about 40 percent of the US population, have done away with their CON regulations, and many have pared them back. A majority of states still maintain CON programs, however, and vestiges of the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act can be seen in the justifications that state legislatures offer in support of these regulations.CON Regulation inMissouriMissouri operates an extensive CON program, requiring providers to obtain permission before making changes to equipment, services, facilities, hospital beds, and nonhospital beds. Missouri's application fee is $1,000 or 0.1 percent of the total cost of the proposed project, whichever is greater. Table 1 shows the number of technologies and procedures regulated by Missouri and by the surrounding states. Among all states with CON regulations, the average number of regulated technologies and procedures is 15. Missouri regulates 18 technologies and procedures. Table 1. Certificate-of-Need in Missouri and Surrounding Statesstate number D. Mitchell, Anne Philpot, and Jessica McBirney, \"The State of Certificate-of-Need Laws in 2020,\" Mercatus Center at George Mason University, May 21, 2021.The state requires CONs for services that are unlikely to be overprescribed, such as obstetrics service and neonatal intensive care. The state also requires CONs for facilities and types of care that often go to vulnerable populations, such as intermediate care facilities for those with intellectual disabilities, psychiatric care, and substance/drug abuse services. Some of the regulated services can be provided without expensive capital investments (psychiatric are, for example). The following services and technologies are regulated under Missouri's CON program: Assisted living and residential care facilities Cardiac catheterization Computed tomography (CT) scanners Gamma knives Hospital beds Intermediate care facilities (ICFs) for individuals with intellectual disabilities Linear accelerator radiology Lithotripsy Long-term acute care (LTAC) Magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) scanners Mobile HI technology (CT/MRI/PET, etc.) New hospitals or hospital-sized investments Nursing home beds/long-term care beds Obstetrics services Positron emission tomography (PET) scanners Psychiatric services Rehabilitation Substance/drug abuseThe Economics of CON RegulationUnfortunately, by limiting supply and undermining competition, CON programs may undercut each of the laudable aims that policymakers desire to achieve with these rules. In fact, research shows that CON laws fail to achieve the goals most often given when enacting such laws. These goals include1. ensuring an adequate supply of healthcare resources,2. ensuring access to healthcare for rural communities,3. promoting high-quality healthcare,4. ensuring charity care for those unable to pay or for otherwise underserved communities,5. encouraging appropriate levels of hospital substitutes and healthcare alternatives, and6. restraining the cost of healthcare services. Researchers have ample information to help predict what would happen if Missouri were to repeal its CON regulations because 15 states have repealed their CON programs, and others have pared theirs back. Economists have used modern statistical methods to compare outcomes in CON and non-CON states to estimate the effects of these regulations. These methods control for factors such as socioeconomic conditions that might confound the estimates. Table 2 summarizes some of this research. It is organized around the stated goals of CON laws.Table 2. Summary of Research Addressing the Goals of Certificate-of-Need (CON) Laws in HealthcareQuestion Answer Research1. Do CON programs help ensure an adequate supply of healthcare resources? No. CON regulation explicitly limits the establishment and expansion of healthcare facilities and is associated with fewer hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, dialysis clinics, nursing home beds, and hospice care facilities. It is also associated with fewer hospital beds and decreased access to medical imaging technologies. Residents of CON states are more likely than residents of non -CON states to leave their counties in search of medical services. Regression analysis by Stratmann and Koopman (2016) suggests that a Missouri without CON would have 42 percent more hospitals than it currently has. Ford and Kaserman (1993); Harrington et al. (1997); Carlson et al. (2010); and Russ Baker (2017); and Stratmann and Koopman (2016)2. Do CON programs help ensure access to healthcare for rural communities? No. CON programs are associated with fewer hospitals overall, but also with fewer rural hospitals, rural hospital substitutes, and rural hospice care facilities. Residents of CON states must drive farther to obtain care than residents of non-CON states. Mitchell and Stratmann find that hospitals in CON states were 27 percent more likely to run out of hospital beds during the COVID pandemic. Stratmann and Koopman's research suggests that an Missouri without CON would have 43 percent more rural hospitals than it currently has. Cutler, Huckman, and Kolstad (2010); Carlson et al. (2016); and Stratmann (2022)3. Do CON programs promote high-quality healthcare? Most likely not. While early research was mixed, more recent research suggests that CON is associated with worse outcomes. Zinn finds that nursing home patients are more likely to be physically restrained in CON than in non-CON states. Cutler, Huckman, and Kolstad finds that CON repeal leads to a shift from standard to high-quality surgeons. Stratmann and Wille find that deaths from treatable complications following surgery and mortality rates from heart failure, pneumonia, and heart attacks are all statistically significantly higher among hospitals in CON states than hospitals in non-CON states. Also, in states with especially comprehensive programs such as Missouri, they findthat patients are less likely to rate hospitals highly. Ohsfeldt and Li find that home health agencies were less likely to be rated high-quality in CON states than in non-CON states. Stratmann and Baker find higher readmission rates and more ER visits in CON relative to non-CON states. Fayissa et al. find lower nursing home survey scores in CON states than in non-CON states. And Chiu finds higher heart attack mortality rates in CON relative to non-CON states. Zinn et al. (2020); and Chiu (2021)4. Do CON programs help ensure charity care for those unable to pay or for otherwise underserved communities? No. There is no difference in the provision of charity care between states with CON programs and states without them, and CON regulation is associated with greater racial disparities in access to care. DeLia et al. (2009) and Stratmann and Russ (2014)5. Do CON programs help restrain the cost of healthcare services?No. By limiting supply, CON regulations increase per-service and per-procedure healthcare costs. Even though CON regulations might reduce overall healthcare spending by reducing the quantity of services that patients consume, the balance of evidence suggests that CON laws actually increase total healthcare spending. Bailey's research suggests that an Missouri without CON would spend about $238 less per person per year on healthcare. Nyman (1994); Mitchell (2016); and Bailey (2016)Reform OptionsThe weight of evidence suggests that a full repeal of CON laws would expand access to healthcare in Missouri that is of both high quality and low cost. Repeal might be scheduled to take effect in the near future or at a later date. Alternatively, policymakers might phase in repeal by requiring the CON board to approve an ever-larger percentage of applications over a certain number of years.Short of full repeal, policymakers have a number of options to reform the program and limit its negative effects. For example, the state might eliminate specific CON requirements. Some requirements ripe for reform include1. CONs that restrict access to facilities and services used by vulnerable populations, such as intermediate care facilities for those with intellectual disabilities, psychiatric services, and substance/drug abuse services;2. CONs for services that are unlikely to be overprescribed, such as obstetrics service and neonatal intensive care; and3. CONs for services that require limited capital expenditures, such as rehabilitation Policymakers might also consider a number of options to ease the administrative burden of CON laws. For example, they might reduce Missouri's fees, reduce the administrative burden of the application process, or require incumbents who unsuccessfully challenge an entrant's CON application to pay the entrant's legal and compliance costs.The criteria used to evaluate a CON application might also be changed. For example, a CON application should not be rejected to prevent the provision of duplicative services. Such a rejection would guarantee monopoly status for the current service providers, and healthcare monopolies are associated with high-cost, low- quality care. Utilization rate is another poor criterion. If an existing hospital knows that potential competitors are less likely to obtain CONs if it keeps its bed utilization rate low, then it faces an incentive to acquire more beds than it needs and ensure that many of them remain empty. This is exactly the sort of unnecessary capital expenditure that CON was supposed to discourage.In addition, the state might raise the monetary threshold of an investment that necessitates a CON or apply this threshold to medical equipment. It might also require the CON board to seek input from parties without financial interest in the outcome or from parties dedicated to the preservation of market competition, such as patient health advocates, economists, or antitrust authorities at the FTC.Finally, policymakers might consider a number of options that would increase the transparency of the CON program and make legislative oversight easier. One option would be to require the board to regularly disclose the CON approval rate. The board could also be required to report the share of applications opposed by incumbent providers as well as the different approval rates for opposed and unopposed applications. The board could be required to ask applicants to estimate their costs of applying for a CON and then regularly report these numbers to the public. And finally, the board could be required to follow up with denied applicants to evaluate how the denial has affected their provision of services.Concluding RemarksGiven the substantial evidence that CON laws do not achieve their stated goals, one may wonder why these laws continue to exist in so much of the country. The explanation seems to lie in the special-interest theory of regulation. Specifically, CON laws perform a valuable function for incumbent providers of healthcare services by limiting their exposure to new competition. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that special interest groups are able to use political donations to increase the odds that their CON requests will be granted. This aspect of CON regulation is one reason why economists as well as antitrust authorities have long believed that these regulations are anticompetitive and harmful to consumers.For those who are interested in further details on the effects of CON laws on spending patterns, I have attached my paper, \"Do Certificate-of-Need Laws Limit Spending?\" Like all Mercatus Center research, it has been through a rigorous, double-blind peer review process.Thank you again for the opportunity to share my research with you. I look forward to answering any questions you may have.WITNESS APPEARANCE FORMMISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HB 1616BILL NUMBER: DATE: 1/26/2022 COMMITTEE: Downsizing State Government FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN OPPOSITION TO IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING: WITNESS NAME THIS FORM IS PUBLIC RECORD UNDER CHAPTER 610, RSMo. In July 2020 I had a prescription drug interaction when Presidone was prescribed from Urgent Care that interacted with my Lexapro & Trazodone I took regularly. It landed me in the ER and when I tried to peacefully get up to leave, I was restrained and given another drug, and I woke up in the Psych Ward for two days. After that incident, I immediately stopped the Lexapro & Trazadone. To cope while my body balances itself from those prescriptions (as I clean up my body from the inside). "}
