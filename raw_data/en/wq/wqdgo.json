This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NDHow do you define a RPD? A. A dementia that appears within 6 months of first cognitive sx B. A dementia that appears with in 1 year of first cognitive sx C. A dementia that appears within 2 years of first cognitive sx D. An already diagnosed dementia that progresses more rapidly than expected Definition of RPD No specific diagnostic criteria ! from cognitive \"normality\" to definite dementia within a specified time: in published studies, where a definition is offered, this time period varies from 3 - 24 months or even longer (4 years!) In general, defined as: A condition that progress from the first symptom to dementia in less than 2 years, often less than 1 year (UCSF, CCCDTD) Or...a person with dementia that is declining at an accelerated rate that is not commensurate with the usual course of the diseaseWhat is the main dx to rule out?
