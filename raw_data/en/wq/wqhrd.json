Stinging nettle has been thought to fight urinary tract infections, kidney and bladder stones, and rheumatism1,4. Echinacea is used to prevent colds. This all sounds pretty great! But what are the promoters of herbal supplements not telling us? What is an herbal supplement? An herbal supplement is a product made from plants (\"botanicals\") and can be ingested as a pill, brewed as herbal tea, applied to the skin as gels, or added to bath water4. Herbal supplements are not intended to replace a healthy diet. Herbal supplements typically aim to treat medical problems, maintain health, or offer some physical benefit. However, unlike drugs, supplements are \"not intended to treat, diagnose, prevent, or cure diseases.\" [1](#reference1) How are they regulated? While herbal supplements may look similar to over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications, they are not treated the same by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Herbal supplements fall under the category called dietary supplements under the FDA, and are regulated differently from drugs1. The biggest difference you'll see is that prescription and OTC drugs are strictly regulated before entering the market, but herbal supplements are only monitored after they enter the market. |FDA |[Drug regulations](http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm269834.htm) [MedWatch](http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/), healthcare practitioners, and pharmaceutical companies. If an unexpected drug-related health risk is detected, a Drug Safety Communication may be issued to consumers and healthcare professionals. The FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) [keeps track of all of the reports](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm070434.htm) received for drugs and herbal supplements that cause adverse effects. The total amount of received reports for the year 2014 was 1,289,133. \"Natural\" does not mean \"Safe\" Anything strong enough to have effects like \"enhancing mood\" and \"lowering cholesterol\" is strong enough to have other effects on your body [2](#reference1). Supplements can interact with other medications to make them ineffective, and even harmful, such as certain heart medications like warfarin, digoxin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin6. Some herbs can cause serious damage your organs, such as your kidneys (aristolochia)7 or liver (kava, pennyroyal)8. Be sure to talk to your doctor before you start taking any herbal supplements.

If you are considering buying an herbal supplement [5](#reference1): - Consult with your doctor FIRST. Be sure your doctor knows all the medications and supplements you are taking. - Educate yourself. Learn as much as you can about the herbs before you take them. Are there any interactions with medications you're taking? Are they hard on your kidneys or do you have kidney disease? - Choose a brand that has independent quality control testing. Be on the lookout for USP, NSF, and Consumer Lab labels. These labels assure customers that the product has gone through rigorous testing and meet safety and quality standards. - Follow directions. If you do end up using an herbal supplement, use the recommended dosage on the label. Keep track of what you take so you don't accidentally overdose. - Be alert for allergic reactions. A severe reaction can cause difficulty breathing. - Check alerts and advisories. The FDA and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) have lists on their websites of [supplements that have been reported to cause adverse health effects](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/safety/topics.htm), as well as current [alerts and advisories](https://nccih.nih.gov/news/alerts)for certain supplements. Ask your Doctor before you begin taking herbal supplements if [5](#reference1): - You're taking prescription or OTC medications - You're pregnant or breastfeeding - You're having surgery - You're younger than 18 or older than 65 Take away Just like with your prescription or over-the-counter medications, herbal supplements can produce some powerful effects on your body. While some herbal supplements may have benefits that outweigh the risks, there are certainly many for which this is not the case. Remember, herbal supplements are not intended to replace a healthy, well-balanced diet. For optimal health, talk to your doctor if you are considering taking an herbal supplement.
