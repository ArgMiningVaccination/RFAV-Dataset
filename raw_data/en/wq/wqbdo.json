It looks at both states (health and illness) and attempts to understand the missteps that occur in disease while simultaneously working to optimize health. It looks at concepts like autoimmune disease, inflammatory and autoinflammatory dysfunction, hypersensitivity, and deficiencies, to underscore a few. It is a fabric of studies that is interwoven within the fields of oncology, endocrinology, rheumatology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, psychiatry, and dermatology. However, in and of itself, it is a system within the body with no known location. There are components that might be outcomes but no one variable or variables are the system itself. Therefore, like the mind, it lies somewhere between matter. It plays a major role in the quality of life, as well as the balance of energy our body, mind, and spirit interface with. So, what is this topic addressing and why? Energy, the primary source for life, from chlorophylls (energy from the sun) to Adenine Tri Phosphatase (ATP) coming from the mitochondria, we all know about the need for energy. Low energy is equivalent to fatigue. No energy is akin to death. For our body to function we need energy, to have a thriving immune system it must have energy. For humans, energy is derived from the foods we eat, fats, protein, carbohydrates. The extraction of key molecules in the form of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants are essential for health. Why? So that mechanism known as the Krebs Cycle in the mitochondria can form the ATP we need. This fuels our immunity. The alignment of energy throughout our body is as necessary as the production of energy, its balanced distribution is outlined in part in the Hindu religion as the opening of all chakras (there are 6-7 of them). These portals are aligned in the Hindu paradigms from the Pelvic region to the Crown (head). If all are equally and totally opened, we have what some would describe as an enlightenment ...what we might refer to in western medicine as an optimal mind, body, and spiritual health. Energy and food are certainly a major path to immunity. But what about emotion, thought, and relationships? Do these aspects play a role in immunity? The answer is, absolutely, but they have to do with the less visible form of energy, from the tangible to the less tangible. To the mind, energy is involved as well. Like a flashlight, low battery equals low illumination. What about relationships? We have all felt drained from a difficult day, relationship, person, or situation. We have all needed to \"recharge\" after a challenging time. Why is this? because it takes energy to relate, to emote, to connect. Some of this interaction is restorative, others not so much. So, our loving alignment with ourselves and others is part of our immunity (our system to fend off illness) and in the opening of the self, in forms of gratitude, acceptance, and forgiveness. Blocks to energy can be in the physical form, such as a tumor, or hypertrophy, occlusion, and inflammation. On an emotional-interpersonal level, such as anger, hate, and fear. The medicine can be found in the release of these emotional blocks in the forms of letting go, to accept and forgive. This does not mean one must be okay with pain, but the opposite, to release it, to no longer hold it in place through fear or anger. As for the truly intangible, the space between the molecules, the energy that transcends, heals, and creates harmony, it is an evolving and unfolding form of healing. It is how we open ourselves up through the process of prayer, a mindfulness practice, or through gratitude and acceptance. These two variables are easy to state but challenging to experience. It is not just important to build up our immune system with nutrients, antioxidants, and minerals. But to also align ourselves better through mindfulness practices such as contemplation, or different forms of yoga. Let your spiritual life unfold and evolve, for they are all very much connected as one system. You might be surprised how your world could shift in an evolving, truly unfolding mystery of life and love. "}
