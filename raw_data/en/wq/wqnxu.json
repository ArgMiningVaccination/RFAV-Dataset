Escape pain and have fun again with our proven non-pharmaceutical treatment. Works for all ages. My knees hurt so bad, I wasn't sure I would be able to finish the season. Thanks to Pat, not only did I play the whole season, but I was jumping higher and rebounding better at the end of the season than I was at the beginning. - Michelle, high school basketball player Are you able to participate in all of your activities without pain or discomfort? Whether you are a competitive athlete or \"just\" active, we all need to be able to move pain-free if we are to truly enjoy life. Complete, pain-free movement, great health, and maximum performance aren't just for people born with great genetics. This is something we all deserve. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, pain means there is a blockage of qi (energy.) Acupuncture works with our own bodies to help remove these blockages. It is not only a natural alternative to synthetic pain killers, but it also addresses the underlying issues and allows us to heal quicker. Because the goal of acupuncture is to promote and restore the balance of energy, which flows throughout the body, the benefits of acupuncture can extend to a wide variety of conditions, from emotional disorders (anxiety, depression) to digestive complaints (nausea, vomiting, irritable bowel syndrome). * Individual results vary.
