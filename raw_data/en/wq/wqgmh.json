INTRODUCTION AND POLICY During the two years 1982-84 the Weilcome Trustees have provided W3.5 million for the support of research in human and animal medicine and the history of medicine. This compares with f24.5m for the previous two years and is a 37 per cent increase. Thew funds are mostly derived fmrn the Trustees' shareholding in the Wellcome Foundation Limited and the growth indicates the success of that enterprise. The Trustees offer their congratulations to the Company. Medical research in Britain has been under increasing stress fur several years. This stems mainly from the impact on the universities and research munciis of economic measures taken by various governments. The effect has been feit in a variety of ways. The universities have had to reduce their number of academic posts and their basic provision for research to such an extent that they are no longer capable of providing a \"well found\" base for the dual support system. The research councils have not been able adequately to meet requests for support from the univenities or even to maintain at least some of their awn establishments at an adequate level. The situation is such and the altrition has been so prolonged that aneditorial in Narure in 1984 suggested that Brilain could not look forward to much further participation in the high international awards for research which it has received u, dispropor- tionately over the past 50 years \\';iri.,u. reponr h;wc 1hns situation but dcpan- ments in veterinary schools. Some medical school rationalisation has taken place in London University with the amalgamation of University College and the Middlesex: Charing Cross and the Westminster: and Guy's and St. Thomas's. Within the constraints of the employment regulations the univenities have done what they can to make economies, but with continuing attrition on lheir funds (projected as at least 2 per cent per annum for the next few years) they do not have the free money to take major initiatives with people, new ideasor new technology. This being said, a recent report from the Committee of Vicc Chancellors and Principals suggests that there is room for improved efficiency in the management of those funds available. There is every indication that the dual suppon system - the backbone of university research support - is moribund and that a new system is needed. Such a change cannot come about by natural evolution; a more positive effort must be made. ?he present situation of uncertainty creates an at- mosphere in which short-term projects with easily aminable rernlts are favoured and long-term more fundamental research is neglected. If this situation eanlinucs, the strengths of the university - research council base for research in Britain will be seriously damaged. If the universitiesand research councils are not to receive adequate funding from the government (either to look after university research or research council establishments). funds will have to be found elsewhere if research activityisnat to deteriorate steadily. If the government isunable to what is needed, then there are only two other possible resources, industry and charity. Industry has been approached and it is clear that the universities are, in many cases, forming pannerrhipr which are helping bath sides. There is nalurally some danger that this type of support may lead to university research being directed, too strongly, to profitable short -term ends, but success might, in the longer term, help to provide surplus funds for more speculative research. The charities in the medic~l research fieid have also eolieeted more funds, and the Association of Medical Research Charities was able to repon an annual expenditure of over flOh in support of research in its latest book - let. Of this sum the Wellcome Trust and the two major cancer charities provide some M) percent, sa there is clearly a need for morc public support for the other charities. What we are witnessing isa gradual transition in academic medical research funding from a government monopoly to private enterprise. Medical re- search is an activity that spans a much broader field than is represented by the present membershipof the Medical Research Council. The industrial input into research is large and industrial experience shouid be used in directing the nation's poiicy. Similarly, the charities have valuable eve- rience and knowledge - quite apart from their experience in the flexible thurcforc. fur an orranlntnon responriblc for overall mcdtcalmcarrh policy If induaay and the charities were recognised. not.only for their already considerable financial influence, but also for their potential as a source of poiicy advice and active collaboration, and thus given some incentive to do more, funds might begin ta flow again and we muld look forward to an era of expansion and more vigorous research activity. Meanwhile we work with an outworn system in which measures mntinue to be introduced which may make it more difficult to use the fundsprovided by the public. A recent ex&Imple is the quota for honorary senior registrar appointments being proposed by the DHSS. If too small and inflexiMe a ouota is introduced the oniv effect will he the curtailment of the number df funded by n~n-~ov&nment funds, which seems to be a nonsensical position when government funds are short. The Wellcome Trust, during the last few years, has prnvided supporl for a number of activities whieh shouid help to alleviate the present position. Principal among these is the provision of 45 senior lectureships and 40 lectureships. In ~ddltion, neu schemer have been hdogy slrh rlmiral medluinr. and ncurorcienres xtlh mental health The Trust has also maintained its considerable support for tropical medical rerearch. Plans are also under way for the development of the Wellwme Museum of Medical Science as a major teaching resource for tropical medicine instruction overseas. This Museum together with other activities have been incorporated under the new title \"The Wellcome Tmpical In- stitute\". Over and above there schemes is the continuation of the many ather pro- grammes for support of medical research in the universities of thbmunlry and the maintenancc of eonlact with Eumpe and the Commonwealth. Esoecialiv to be noted are two maior schemes launched for support of Two new Trustees have joined the Wellcome Trust during the period of this report, Dr. 1. Helen M. Muir, whose appointment started on 1st September 1982. and Mr. Roger G. Gibhs, who took up his appointment on 1st February 1983. Dr. Muir's appointment in succession to Profemr R.H.S. Thompsan was described in the 1980-82 report. MT. Gibbs is the chairman of Gerrard and National plc and joins Sir David Steel us the second non -scientific Trustee. He could he said to have \"suc- ceeded\" Lord Armstrong in that position, although strictly speaking he filled the vacancy created by the retirement of Lord Franks. The Trustee appointments are now, therefore, at full strength. With Professor Thompson's retirement. Dr. C.E. GordonSmith became the Senior Scientific Trustee and has succeeded Professor Thompron as Deputy Chairman. Professor Sir William Paton agrecd from 1st September 1983 to succeed Dr. P.O. Williams as Honorary Director of the Wellmme lnstltute for the History of Medicine, as a full-timedirector for that Institute had not yet been found. The Trustees were very pleased that Professor W.S. Pea*, who had been a Trustee since January 1975, was appointed Knight Batchelor in the 1985 New Year's Honours. Dr. BnJlet hl. Ogd\\ie h~s been promoted to Rupen Hall in preparing a history of the first 50 years of the Trust.

SUPPORT OF MEDICAL RESEARCH IN THE UK SPECIAL FELLOWSHIPS LECTURESHIPS AND SENIOR Wellromr Senior Research FrUowship in CUniral Science These Senior Fellowships give young clinical scientists of proven research ability support for up to five years' uninterrupted research on problems related to clinical medicine. Previous reports have emphasised the nn- qualified success of this scheme, and hoiden of these Fellowrhipsmntinue to move into senior clinical academic posts at the completion of their support from the Trust; although the Trustees view with coneern the in- creasing difficulty that some Fellows experience in finding suilable per- manent positions because of the financial constraints on universities and medical schools. Almost all of the 45 previous holders of these posts are now in senior. academic positions in this country or the United States of America. Note- worthy new appointments of farmer Senior Clinical Fellows during the period of this Repod include Dr. Andrew McMichael (Senior Clinical Fellow 1977-1979) Dr. Ste- phen (1977-1980) Chair of Medicine at the MancheJler Royal Infirmary, and Professor Richard Edwards (1971-1976) fmrn the Chair of Human Metabolism at University College London to be Pmfessor of Medicine in Liverpool.

There are eighteen Senior Clinical Fellows currently in port and all the Fellows now meet each year at the offices of the Trust to describe and discuss their work. These meetings have proved valuable and the Trustees have been pleased with the extremely high quality of the work presented. The sum of \u00a31,236,359 has been allocated for there awards during the period of this Report, and these are listed on pages 55-60. Welleame Research Training Fellowships In Pathology and Surgery 81 dc- partment of pathological or surgical science. For the period under review, the Trustees allocated \u00a3350,000 for Fellow- ships in Pathology and \u00a34M),WO for Fellowships in Surgery. Cootinuing recent trends, the latter Fellowships attracted the larger field of candidates; 40 nominations were received and 11 awards made. For the Fellawships in Pathology, 15 nominations were received, and 7 awards were made. The Fellowships awarded are listed on pages (57-59) Wellcame Research Training Fellowships In Clinical Epidemiology Introduced about five years ago. the Clinical Epidemiology Training Fel- lowshim are intended of clinicnl mediclnr. In recent years. there have been few nominations for these awards, and to provide a forum for a discussion of this and other aspects of their epidemiology programme, the Trustees sponsored a meeting of a group of concerned academicrand researchers. Subsequently, theTrustces reviewed the Fellowship scheme and, cognisant of the recommendations of the meet- ing, decided to introduce revised conditions with effect from October 1984. The main effect of the revision will be to discontinue joint departmental 18 sponsorship of candidates and to relax the present requirement for pur- nuance of a specified course of past-graduate study.

The apparent succcssof the scheme, at theend of those four rounds, encouraged the Trustees to support a fifth in the Spring of 1983. and a sixth a year later. From those six rounds 48 awards have been made. However, since then, four people have been promotedout of theranks; two to hcaddepaments of nhvaioloev in the United Kinedom (Dundee and Cardiff). one to a new -~=, U, U. chair of cardiovascular medicine funded bv the British Hem Foundation (St. Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College) and one to a newly adver- tised Readership (Wcstminster Hospital Mcdical School). In addition, two Welleame Senior Lecturers hdvz been promotcd within their departments to Readership (Sheffield and Nottingham). At the end of the sixth round the Trustees felt that they could not accept the rapidly growing financial responsibility for the future of morc than 45 senior lecturers. hut they would maintain that number, filling vamncics as they arose. A complete list appears on pages Mi-66. The novelty of this form of Wellcome Trust support lies in the twin facts lhat the successful candidates take a normal share of departmental duties of ail kinds and that the length of the support is greater: five years in the first instance, with a possibility of extensions of three years at a time if the work is prospering. Total involvement in the department bringr the ad- ditional advantage of freeing all itsmembers togive more time to research. This aim. important to the Trustees, has been emphasised by their contin - ued insistence on the post vacated by an award, in the same department, being filled. The total number of applications for the six rounds was around 450, divided evenly between each round. The succesr rate is therefore about one in ten. So far, 20 have been successful in having their initial iive-year contract extended by three years; apart from those already mentioned as having left by promotion. Ihc datrihutlon throughout the Unlted Kingdom been. cltnncal dcpnnmentr (18) basic sciences (26). From the beginning the Trustees wished that a firm relationship should be built and maintained among the Wellwme Senior Lecturers and with the T~st. To that end regular visits are made by the scientific staff to the lecturers in their places of work and they are encouraged to bring their problems to their appropriate scientific officer at the Trust. There is a meeting, each June, at the Trust which provides a balanced mixture of invited presentations by lecturers and a social gathering. This meeting has been popular and productive of scientific cross -fertilisation between dis - ciplines. A broad assessment of the value of the scheme is difficult at this early stage. However, a great deal of satisfaction continues to be expressed by those who sponsor candidates, and the promotion of six senior lectures may give some indication of success. In 1982 the Trustees responded to the crisis facing the universities by creating a scheme of University Lectureships. Universities and medical schools are invited to make an application far a ie~rurerhip in the basic bio-medical or clinical sciences. The Trustees expect the choice of department to be made an the basis of the significance of such a port in that department for the academic devel - opment of its research and teaching programme. The posts may be used for new developments as well as for the strengthening of departments. The scheme was first advertised at the heginning of 1983 and in that year, ten appointments were made. A second round resulted in eleven lecture - ships being made available in 1984 and a third round was vlmuaced at the end of 1984. The scheme seems to he highly valued by the universities and appears to complement the University Grants Council \"new-bW scheme. The Trustees expect to review the progress of thb scheme during the period of the next report. Details of the awards made under this scheme are listed on pages 78-80 of this report. 2. SUBJECTS SELECTED FOR DEVELOPMENT Mental HdUl The Trustees have given special support for research in mental health and the related basic sciences far nearly ten years and a wmprehensive review of their activities in this field has been undertakenduringtheperiodwvered by this report. When the Trustees first declared their interest in mental health, the er- pressed wish was that the application of the sciences of biochemistry and pharmacology to mental health problems might lead to real advances in this &M. The scientific literature of recent years shows that this hope was not misplaced. The Trust's particular role has been to support mearch chnking basic and clinical sciences relevant to disease of the mind. and to arovide research tramme oostr to develm a , chiatrists. who will move. or indeed have moved. into senior academic and ~. ~ -.-. ~ ~ - -~ .... Lec- and Senior Lecturer posts. Research Suppon Support for od hoc project grans amounted to about M) per cenl of the Trustees' mental health budget. Increasing numbers of applicationsof high quality are received. For some years the Trust has supported the work of Dr. A.D. Smith's group in thc Department of Pharmacology, Univenity of Oxford. Using a combination of sophisticated staining and tracing techniques at both light I and clseaher2 uilh precision and detail not previously possible. Their results may lead to a mare rational and effective approach to the design of drugs used in psy- chotic and other mental disorders. The Trustees were pleased to learn of Dr. Smith's appointment to the Chair of Pharmacology in Oxford and of the Medical Research Council's decision to establish a new Anatomical Neumpharmacology Unit under his direction. The work of the new Unit will be a direct continuation of the projects supported by the Trust. The A~soeiate Director of the new Unit is to be Dr. Peter Somogyi, whose coilsborvtion with Dr. Smith was initiated and supported under the Trust's enchanre agreement with the International Cultural Institute in Budaeest (page i2~).- The Trustees' Mental Health Panel have from time to time advenised competitive major awards in ~pecified subjects in the hope that these will stimulate new collaborations between basic and clinical scientists far re- search into mental disorders: the results of several of there competitions have been announced in earlier reports. During the period of this report a major award far the punuit of experi- mental anddevelopmcntaipsychological researchintothe genesisof mental disorders attracted number of goad appli - cations and was shored between two groups. One is led by Professor J.A. Gray of the Department of Psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry, and the other by Dr. T.W. Robbins of the Department of Experimental Psy - chology at the University of Cambridge. Professor Gray and his collevguer are studying the neurop~ychalogy of Alzheimer's disease and Dr. Robbins' group work on the neuropsychology of both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. One beneficial effect of this advertisement has been an improvement in the number and quality of applications for research using psychological methods, submitted to the Trust for ad hoc project grant suppon. Researcl8 Training Mental Health Fellowships for research training. The success of an appli- cation under this scheme depends not only on the personal qualities and achievements of the candidate but also on the suitability of the propod programme for research training. The Mental Health Pand have on- found that the programme Is the least satisfactory aspect of an application and have sometimes been able to suggest and support improvements. The record of achievement of Fellows at the end of their Fellowship is very satisfactory. Noteworthy recent appointments include Dr. I.N. Ferrier (formerly a Fellow at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School) to a Senior Staff position in the MRC Neuroendocrinology Unit, Dr. S.B. Dunnen to a Demonstratorship in Experimental Psychology in Cambridge. where he continues his pioneering studies of neural tissue transplantation, and Dr. H.M.D. Gurling to one of the Trustees' own Senior Clinical Fellowshipr to continue his work on the molecular biology of mental disorder. In our last report we referred to the scheme operated with Trust support by Professor M.G. Gelder in Oxford, whereby some of the registrars in training in the Department of Psychiatry have been able to spend me time in research. This has been very successful in stimulating interest in research In young psychiatrists, and similar schemer are now being sup parted by the Trust in the depadments of psychiatry in Edinburgh and Manchester, and at the Institute of Psychiatry. Academic Development The Trust has in the past provided appointments in a number of depart- ments of psychiatry to strengthen their academic activities. This is now a smaller pan of the Mental Health programme than formerly, as Trust- supponed staff move into established posts. Lectureship and Senior Lec- tureship appointments in mental health were advertised in 1983 but the response was disappointing and no awards were made. Similar ports have been advertised for appoinlment in 1985 and it is hoped that a bener response will be obtained. The Future Puttern of Suppon The application af pharmacology and biochemistry to mental health re- search, an aim of this programme at its inception, isnowso wellestablished as not to warrant special support. There are, however, other basicsciences whore potential contribution to mental health research has not vet been of interest must include neuroanatomy, molecular and cell biology, and slight. There are a number of reasons for this including the small number some of the newer brain imaging techniques. The Mental Health Panel of academic departments of ophthalmology undertaking serious research, continues to wish to support links between basic and clinical science, and the rigidity of surgical training programmes in ophthalmology, andthe lack looks forward to an increasc in the range of basic sciences being brought of input from the basic sciences relevant to the eye and visual pathways to bear on mental health problems. into ophthalmological research. The training of research workers in psychiatry, as in other disciplines, cannot be divorced from their future career plans or from their earlier The Trustees have recently undertaken a critical review of their support for rwarch in ophthalmology and in other subjects relating to the eye. basic scientific and clinical training. Applicants far senior research posts and hope to be in a position to report new initiatives for the ruppon of may sometimes show evidence of a lack of proper training in research, but research in these subjects before their next biennial report. recipients of such training - for example, as a mental health fellow - may later be thwarted by the lack of a suitable senior position at the end of their Fellowship, especially in the present financial climate. The Trustees Grants awarded for support of research in ophthalmology during the period are conscious of these problems and hope that it may at times be possible of this report are listed on pages 74-75. to make research career development awards for suitable young research workers of outstanding potential.

TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES The Trust has maintained its support for tropical medicine during the two years covered by this report. years of rapidly increasing difficulty for the emnamy and of sharp deterioration in the financial resources available to the academic community in Britain. Despite this general deterioration the Trust has been able to fund all research applicatiane sent to it in the field of tropical medicine and rated by peer review as worthy of support. From this we conclude that ~roiect research in tropical medicine in the UK has not yet been greatly &fled by shortage affunda. This somewhat unex - pected situation probably reflects thc avaiiobiiity of funds not only from the Medical Research Council and Trust in the UK, but also from sources outside the UK such an the WHOtTDR Special Programme, and during the period under rcvrew. of the creation of a research fund far tropical medicine in the EEC from which UK research workers have succeeded in obtaining a high proponion of available funds. bout 60 per cunt of rerearch in tropical biology in non-clinical dcpanments will certainly ensure a continuity of interest. In clinical tropical medicine, however, the number of trained individuals and the future prospects for new entrants are matters for real concern. About 40 per cent of Trust grants are for clinical studies in the human subject but almart ail these projccts are carried out in institutions other tbn the schools of tropical medicine, where the research strength lies in the boric science departments. We hope that the appointment of Professor K.P.W.J. McAdam to the Wellcome Chair of Clinical Tropical Medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine from December 1984. initially with support from the Trust, will alter the position. A special cffort ha3 been made both within and outside the Trust during the period under review to devise ways to strengthen training and, more important, career prospects for medical graduates wishing to enter this field. The training of speciuiists with an interest in clinical tropical medicine is to be linked with those interested in clinical aspects of infectious diseases. At present there are 44 consultants In infectious diseases (26 in England and Wales) and 8 in tropical medicine. A Royal College of Physicians report on future consultant staffing in communicable andiropical dhases recommends that the number of infectiou diseases physicians should be lncreased to W or 70, and that tropicaldisease expertise should be provided by infectious diseases physicians. This means that such physicians should be trained in the management of imported infections including parasitic diseass. The report also ergred concern that few paediatricians bad a special interest and uaining in in- fection. The Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene has also taken the view that special efforts are required to maintain a une d expertise in clinical tropical medicine. In 1981, the Trurtcer selected mfffl~aus dtvars dr a rubje~.t held whtrh thecase increasing the number of cousultants trained in infecliaus disesws was discussed (see above), the Trustees decided to link their interestsin diuical aspects of infectious diseases with those in tropical medicine. With this in mind, from October 1983, the remitoftheTrust'radvirorypaneiin tropical medicine was extended to indude infectious diseases, and Pmfemr H.P. Lambert and Dr. D.A.I. Tyrrell were invited to join the remnstihlted Tropicai Medicine and Infectious Diseases Panel. The new Panel has proposed to enmurage the development of unis in the medical schools in which the clinical speciality of infections diseases would be practised and promoted by funding a limited number of senior lectured lecturer ports. This development requires a close aswreiation between de- partments of medicine andior paediatrics and depmmentsof microbiology to ensure the proper clinical management and study of infectiovs diseases. The Trustees are advised by the members of the Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases Panel who meet four times a year to make decisions concerning grant applications and to advise on policy. At most meetings of the Panel an existing grant-holder is invited to describe his work. Five of these talks during the past two years have concerned work undertden in the tropics and two were given by scientists who had been awarded major grants: Dr. D.A. Broadbent on on'Controlafgenewpression during the malaria life cycle'. 29 To maintain the expertise of scientists in rapidly developing fields such as ~n',lr.cular Bnlogy. the Iruslcc, 11~re agreed lu f~nd one place each ycrr to enable a UK praduilte attuud aiparhritirm. In June 1984. the Trustees aereed to extend the remit of the Pone1 to reflected yet in the activities af the Panel. Occasional meetings are organised to discuss subjects of interest to the Panel. A meeting organised and chaired by Dr. Ogilvie was held in Sep tember 1983, of all UK scientists known to bc interested in giardiasis. Dr. C.E. Gardon Smith arranged and chaired a meeting in October 1983 of scientists working on arboviruscs. Both fields interest only a few people, hut those interested in giardiasis are predominantly young people near the beginning of their careers, whilc expertise and interest in arboviruses, except at the molecular level, rests much more in senior people nearing the end of their ilclive life. In November 1983, a meeting discussed the possibility of organising a UK- based task farce to investigate outbreaks of acute diseases in the tropics. l Unfortunately. the number of suitably trained people able to eo abroad . . at extremely ihort notice was too few fo make this a realistic pr~positian. The extension of interest of the Trust in postgraduate education in tropicsi medicine is discussed elsewhere in this report (see pages 32-33). Dr. B.M. Ogilvie, who is responsible for the Wellcome Trust Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases activities, war on the Council of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and its meetingr sub-committee in the two ycars covered by this report. Dr. Ogilvie is also a member of the WHO Expert Committee on Filoriasis and acted as an assessor of the WHORDR Malaria Programme during 1983. ANALYSIS OF SUPPORT During 1983-1984, f4,ZOO.OW was distributed for research in tropical med - icine, f865.000 for studies on infcctiour diseases. About half the budget war used to fund research applications, half to support theTrust'r rescareh Units in the tropics and for a variety of special awards 30 SENIOR LECTURESHIPS In addition to the funds made available through theTropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases Programme, six awards were made through the Trust's Senior Lectureships Scheme to individuals undertaking research in those subjects. Two went to basic scientists: Dr. J.J. Shaw, in Belem, and Dr. J.S. McBride, at Edinburgh University; while four awards were made to clinicians trained in infectious diseases: Dr. G.E. Griffin at St. Gmrge'r Hospital Medical School, Dr. M.I.G. Farthing at St. Bartholomew's Hm- pital Medical College, Dr. D.C.A. Candy of Birmingham University, and Dr. G.

TROPICAL LECI'LIRESHIPS This scheme, described in the three previous reports of the TNn, was sa up in 1977 to enable individuals to undertake full -time research in tropical countries. Two awards were made during the period under review and are shown on page 125. ADVANCED TRAINING FELLOWSHIPS Thls Scheme was described in the fourteenth Repon. It is designed m ennble young scientists who have shown promise during their part-doctoral work to extend their training by spending a period of up to two years in any laboratory which offersexceptional appartunitiesfor advanced training in the research field of interest to the applicant. At the end of this period the applicant is supported for a final year back in the UK. Two awards made in 1983 are shown an pages 122-123. There were no applicants for this scheme in 1984. This was surprising and disappointing as outstanding progress in both personal and scientific de - velopment has been shown by recipients of earlier awards. AWARDS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES The first awards in the new scheme for infectious diseases research and training were made in July 1984. A three-year Senior Lectureship was awarded to Dr. I.V.D. Welter, sponsored by ProfessorM.W. Adler in the Department of Genita-Urinary Medicine, Middlesex Hospital Medical School (see page 76) two three-year lectureships were awarded; and two one-year Fellowships to spend a year in an infectious diseases unit in the USA were awarded to Dr. P.T. Rudd, Cambridge University, and Dr. P.C. Davey, Dundee University. There awards are shown on page 77. WELLCOME TROPICAL INSTITUTE During 1983 preparations were made by the Welicome Foundation totrans- fer their head office from The Wellcome Building in Euston Road to a site outside central London. Such a move had two repercussions in the Trust. First, it was decided that more flexibility would be needed in the accam- modation for the Wellcame Institute for the History of Medicine, and so Bentley House, 200 Eurton Road, situated almost directly opposite the Welicome Building. was purchased. Second, it wos decided that the Trust should take over responsibility for the Welieomc Museum of Medical Science from the Weilcome Foundation Ltd. since its activities would clearly have to be sited in central London and the museum was in any case a somewhat anomalous responsibility far a pharmaceutical company. The formal transfer of staff and financial re- sponsibility occurred on 1st September 1984 but during the previous year the Trust had been directing its activities. The transfer of awnership en- abled a number of staff members to take early retirement and so the Museum when taken over had only six remaining staff. Dr. Len Goodwin agreed to act as director until the appointment of Dr. E.H.O. Parry (pres - ently Dean of the Kumasi Schaoi of Medicine in Ghana) in the summer Of 1985. The acquisition of the museum led the Trust to consider its role in con- nection with other Trust activities in the tropical field. Previousiy the Trust had been associated with the two British schools of trooical medicine and the Commonwealth Secretariat in now planning the creation of educational n~omamme. in trnnical medicine for use by Dr. Eusn Henderson of the Open University, the Trust decided to develop a programme of distance learning based on the Welicome Trop~cal Instttute, and steps arc now under way to this end. In addition it has been decided to create a library of the hiitory of tmpical medicine and to initiate a programme in the history of tmpical medicine foruse in conjunctionwith the distance learningactivity. ItwiUalw,pmvide an experiment in the handling of the history of modem mediine. This historical development will he in the charge of Dr. B.I. Wiiliams, who has both medical and historical qualiations. All these new and existing ac- tivities have been incorpnrated under the title of the Wellcome Tmpicsl Institute and are temporarily housed in 2W Enston Road. The majn book stores of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, lwted at Enfield, are also being rehoused in the new building. As and when Le Wellcome Foundation decides to vacate the WeUcome Building plans will have to be made for the future accommodation of the two Institutes bc- tween the Wellcome Building and Bentley House. WELLCOME TRUST TROPICAL UNITS The Units provide special opportunities to undertake detailed studia of tropical problems on a long-term basis and, for this reason, are central to the Trust's tropical research programme. The work of four of the Units - those in Belem, Veilore, Bangkokandlamaica-was rdentiflcauy reviewed in 1984. The nature and location of the Trust's future interests in Kenya are under review as the current programme will terminate in Augurt 1985.

Williams when they visited Nairobi in August 1983, and in Feb- ruary 1984, Dr. Williams and Dr. Ogilvie accompanied by the Chairman of KEMRI, Professor K. Thairu, and Dr. B.E.C. Hopwaad, made a pre- liminaryvisit to the Kenyan coast. On the basisof this, theTrustees agreed to invite Dr. S.J. Oppenheimer to undertake an exploratory study on the coart. Dr. Ogilvie and Dr. K.B. Sinclair went to Kenya in May 1984 with Dr. Oppenheimer to introduce him to the senior Kenyans with whom he will work. Following there successful visits Dr. Oppenheimer was ap- pointed in October 1984, to investigate the feasibility of setting up a Unit an the Kenyan coast. He is based with Professor E.R. Maxan in the Department of Paediatrics, University de Ertudos Especiois da Weiicorne, Beiem, Brarii Since it was created to study the epidemiology nnd ecology of leirhmanlasis in the Amazon basin, the Wellcome Unit has been part of the Department of Parasitology in the lnstituto Evandro Chagas. In August 1983, Dr. the Fundacao Semicos de Saude Puhlica (FSESP) created a Unit of Special Studies to be headed by Professor R. Lainson, FRS, to include all the work funded by the Trust and to be n separate entity within the lnstituto Evandra Chagas. Thir decision, which recognises the contribution made by the staff of the Wellcame Unit to the work of the Inrtituto Evandro Chagas, is greatly appreciated by the slaff of the Unit and by the Trustees. It gives Professor Lalnson and Dr. Shaw the opportunity to diversify their research interests, as well as direct eantrol of their Brazilian staff. The work of the Unit was warmly endorsed by the assessors during the 1984 review. Dr. P.D. Ready completed his period as entomologist to the Unit during 1983. After a year a1 the Department of Entomology, London School of Hygiene andTrapical Medicine, Dr. Ready has obtained support from the Medical Research Council to undertake the genomic character- isation of phiebotomine vectors of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Depart - ment of Pure and Applied Biology, Imperial College, in collaboration with Dr. D.F. Smith, Department of Biochemistry, Imperial College. Dr. L. Ryan. who comes from the Department of Biology. University of Salford (Head. Professor D.H. Molyneux), took over as entomologist to the Unit. The Unit's recent work has principally concerned studies of visceral leirh- maniaris on the island of Maraja where it is transmitted to man by LUI. zomyio Iongipnipis from foxes and dogs. The Unit has had conspicuous success in obtaining parasite isolates from sandflies and work is continuing on establishing the vector and reservoir host($) of L.b. bmziliemir. Dr. 1989.

The Unit has continued 10 study the pathophysidogy of severe malaria in man, rabies and snake bite. Dr. Mary 1. Warrell has undertaken studies designed to minimise the amount of rabies vaccine necessary to induce Immunity. Dr. D.A. Warrell has investigated the treatment and clinical consequences of bites by Malayan pit vipers in Thailand and the large number of cases of Rurrell's viper bite that occur in Burma. Dr. N.J. White has shown that quinine treatment may cause a hyper-insulinaemia which together with the high demand for glucose of parasitised erythrocytes may explain the hypoglycaemia often seen in severe malaria. Dr. K.N. Ward (University of Cambridge medical student) spent two months in the Unit studying the immune response in cerebral malaria at theend of 1982; and Dr. D.J. Ball, from theZwlogicalSociefyof London. visited in March and April 1983 to advise on the care of snakes. Dr. S. Fisher-Hoch (PHLS Centre for Applied Micrnbiol~gy and Research, Por- ton Down) spent four months in 1982 in the Unit to develop an assay for interferon and to work an the diagnosis of rabiesencephalitia. Dr. R.D.G. Theakston (Liverpool Sehwl of Tropical Medicine) spent two months in the Unit in 1982 to help establish anELlSAmethodfor detectingantibodies to venom ant~gens. Dr. R.

Dr. May Ho Fennell was recruited in 1983 to help Dr. Mary 1. Wmll with the laboratory aspens of the work, especially in immunology. The Unit is situated in the Facuity of Tropical Medicine of Mahidol Uni- versity. The original agreement that set up the Unit wassigned by Professor C. Harinasuta as Dean of the Faculty. He has now retired and has been succeeded by Dr. Santariri Sommani. The Trustees made a mnlribution towards the cost of s new building for the Faculty, and agreed to finance an annual Fellowship jointly withMahidol University toallowsenior faculty memben to $pepend a year doing Dr. Vichai Supanara- nond and Dr. Juntra Karbwang began work in the Unit in 1983.

TRAVEL GRANTS On the evidence available, the Trust's Fellowship scheme is a valuable contribution to research and the allocation for 1984185 has been increased In 1955 the Trustees initiated a programme for travel gran5 (marimum to fSW,WO. award \u00a3750 per person) for three main reasons: 40 41 connection with his work; far example, to learn a special techn~que; 2. to cnahle a young scantirt to take n Fclluush,p of one )ex', duration; 3. to enable research scientists to attend small meetings abroad in par- ticular areas relevant to the applicant's field of research. During the period 1982184 approximately \u00a3171,000 has been awarded for travel grants. The total support provided by the Trust in the category of Other Overseas Awards and Travel amounted to ncarly \u00a3656,033. and the gran& awarded are listed, alphabetically by countries. on pages 137-143. During the period 1982 to 1984. the Trustees allocated some a.4 million for the support of research in veterinary and comparative medicine and, for the first time, the annual budget exceeded \u00a31 million. This allocation, which indudes provision far four lecturerhips funded from a separate budget, brings the total support provided by the Trustees for their veter- inary medicine programmes to more than \u00a38.2 million. In accordance with the pattern of recent years, some 93 per cent of the expenditure during the biennium comprised grants and awards to universities in the United Kingdom. Asusual, project grants (55 percent) andFellowshipsand Sehol- srships (24 per cent) accounted for the major part of the expenditure, but analysis of the data shows that, compared with the last hiennium (84 per cent), there was a decline in the proportion received by the veterinary schools (74 per cent). There are several possible explanations for this seemingly new trend but an evident increasedinterest in veterinaryresearch among the staff of universitier withaut a veterinary school is almost cer- tainly one. In previous reports, reference has been made to the relatively small sire of departments in United Kingdom veterinary schools, and the consequent difficulties of maintaining teaching and research activities in the face of cuts in staff and resources. In 1982, cognisant of these difficulties and as part of new a programme, the Trustees decided to allocate funds for the support of four Wellcome Lectureships in Veterinary Science. So far, three appointments have been made and it is hoped that these, together with the University Grants Committee's \"ncw-blood\" lectureships, will help m strengthen the research hare in the veterinary schools. A cornerstone of the Trust's veterinary medicine programme is the re- cruitment and training of younger veterinary researchers, and three schemes of support are offered to further this objective. The recently- introduced Intercalated Course grants enable veterinary undergraduates to punue an approved course of in -depth study in the natural menees, Vacation Scholanhips help students to gain experience of working in a research laboratory, and Research Training Scholarships provide supporl for the recent veterinarv graduate who wishes to undertake a formal train- ine ~n recearch method;aid read for the demee mriod - ~~ -. under rLv,ew, there hrr been a ermfyng interest in a11 these schemes and II 1nrurcalatr.d Courre grants. 20 Vacation Schalanh~ps, and 11 Rcwarch Tra~nnng Scholarships haw hren awarded. a series of imporrant organisational changes which were completed during Dr. Williams' second year of office as Honorary Director. After n careful review, the Trustees invited Sir William Paton to take aver from Dr. Williamr as Honorary Director. for a period of up to three yean, from 1st October 1983. Mr. ETicFreeman continues as Deputy Director and Dr. W.F. Bynum as Head of the Acddcmif Unit. In accordance silh the recommendations of the Working Party of 1981- 82, a number of new appointments to the staff of the Institute have been made with n view to enlarging it5 scholarly expertise. Dr. Riehard Paimer, formerly a Wclicamc Research Fellow, has been appointed (jointly with thc Academic Unit) Curator of Western Manuscripts; Dr. D. Wujastyk was appointed Assistant (Oriental Collections). Mr. S. Emberton war ap- pointed Administrator of the Institute. Recently, Dr. L. Granshaw was selected for a new post as Historian of T~~rentieth-Century $fedline (from 1st October 1984). Dr. L.I. Canrad war appointed Historian of Arabic Medicine. Contrary to what was anticipated at the time of the Fourteenth Report, the Wellcame Foundntion has expressed to the Trustees no wish ta disturb the present position and so for the next fcw years the prospects are that the Institute will remain in in present quarters on three floors of the Wcllcome building. With the cessation of museum activities on the first floor, it has bccome possible to provide a Lecture Room, new carrels, a pleasant Staff Roam, and exhibition space on that floor. AS part 01 d rr.\\irdd polics for the \\\\'cll;cmtc dcvelopmentr arc further described on p. 32. The new premises will also house the reserve stock of the Welicomc Library, which has for a number of years been less conveniently stored at Enfield. The distribution of non-medical and non-scientific material in Sir Henry Wellcome's eaileetions, begun under the Trustees' direction in 1938, has now been completed. Several museums, including the Fitrwilliam Museum nt Cambridge and thc Manchester Museum, have gratefully drawn rtlcn- 1;\". in their rpnnrtr of acouisitions received from ... ...-.. ..r...- - the Trustees. It is interesting too that the residue of the US Patent Office collection of submitted models, acquired by Sir Henry Wellcome at auction in the 1920s but ncver uncratcd, and sold by the Wellcome Foundation In 1938, has now been bought by the Smithsonian Institution, Washingmn. A full aEEOUnt of the dispersal is in preparation and will be published. The medical and scientific collections which remain as the Trustees' property are now all housed in the Institute and the Trust offices or are on loan to the Science Museum. The Library A major event has been the purchase by the Trustees, with the assirranee of six other nstionai charities, of the Library of the Medical Society of London. This collection is the most valuable acquisition (in every sense) made since Sir Henry Wcllcome'r death in 1936. During l9Sl !he Roydl short-term product will be a microfiche ealaloguegiving flexible access by author, title andsubject. The long-term aim is to provide an on-line catalogue accesaed through visual display terminals. The Library's mort important publication far some yen has been that of the long-awaited Amtotared ealalogue of jnedieol Americorra (1983) com - piled by the Deputy Librarian, Mr. Robin Price. Well received by experts in the field of Latin Amerieanrtudiesand assigned theloseToribioMedlna Award for 1984, this scholarly book has already bemme a standard ref- ercnco work. Lesser publications have included illustrated leaflets dewrib- in$ the Oriental Collections, South Indian Bwks and Manuscripts, and the American Collections, ss well as a printed guide to thc Institute's work and facilities. Among the dozen or so exhibitions mounted have been those relating to personalities such as Joseph Priestlcy. Willlam Hunter, Samuel lohnson. Athanariur Kircher and Roberr Fludd, and 10 topics ranging from Hebrew The Library has attracted a steadily inereasing number of readers. Much of this satisfying activity is directly attributable to the greatly enhanced programme arranged by the Academic Unit. A penalty of success is that the Library has almost exhausted the space available for books and readers in its public arenr. The Academic Unit Thd remained active. Twenty third-year pre-clinical medical students have pursued the full-time intercalated BSc course in the history of medicine, and students fram a wide variety of science and arts deparrments have chosen to take individual elective papers offered by members of the Academic staff. Postgraduate instruclion in the history of the life sciences has been carried out in conjunction withthe MScin History of Science through the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at University College. Supervision of fifteen PhD and MD candidates ha5 been provided, and four PhD degrees have been awarded. The Institute's propmme of symposia, research seminars, workshapr and public lectures is now, without doubt, unrivalled elsewhere in the world. Thirteen all-day symposia have been hcld an topics ranging fram New Light on Ancient Medicine to Mcdical Science'in Twenticth-Century Brit- ain. Thc Symposium on Dr. Eighteenth -Century Medicine, held jointly with thc lohnnan Society and the History of Medicine Section of the Royal Society of Medicine, attracted an audience of 125. Other symposia themes have included the British Contribution to the Neurosci- cnecs. Medicine and Demography, and the Historical Language of Mcd- icine. A special grant fram the Trust cnabled the Institute to hold a three- day International Symposium on William Hunter (1718-1783) md his World. This consisted of an exhibition arranged by Mr. William Schupbach, a ul?rk\\l,op 10 London. Edch wncs papers fram the series have been accepted for publication. and a further volumeislikely.TheM*iute has also inaugurated aprogrammeof Visiling Senior Research Fellowships, whereby established scholars are invited to spend a week in landon, meeting staff and students anddelivering a public lecture. Dr. A. McGehee Harvey (Jahns Hopkins University). Professor Robert Darnton (Princeton University). Professor G.L. Geison (Prince- ton) and Professor William Coleman (University of Wisconsin) have been brought to the lnstituce undcr this programme. A joint meeting with the Medical Society of London was arranged for the summer of 19R3, which provided an opportunity to visit the Society's fine cighteenth-century building to hear Sir Douglas Black delivera formal but nevertheless witty lecture. UNITS IN THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE Dr W.F and programme remain unaltered. Universiiy of Oxford Under the direction of Dr. Charles Webster. the Oxford Unit hasmntinued to expnnd its activities an many fronts. The complement of full-time staff has increased to fourteen. As a consequence of this expansion the Unit experienced severe prabiemr of overcrowding, partly alleviated by the grant of additional spacc in 45 Bonbury Road. The University and the Tmst made grants to support extensive moditicslions at 45 and 47 Banbury Road. The restoration of these buildings and their gardens is nearingmm- pletion. The core staff of the Unit is unchanged. Wellcomc Rcscarch Fellowshipr have been awarded to Mrs. J.M. Beinart for a project on the history of nnacsthctics in Oxford, to Dr. Helen lones in connection with her work on occup;ltional health, and to Mr. David Hamilton to suppart his work on the history of surgery. Dr. Webrter has continued his research on the National Heulth Service, publishingvarious contributions on health and health care in the present century as well as From Paracelsus ro Newlion (19R2), derived fcom the Eddington lectures delivered in 1981. Miss Margaret Pelling has published an social and eco- nomic aspects of medic'nl practice, particularly in the early modern period. Dr. Paul Weindling has expanded his research on German biology, med - icine and social policy in the 19th and 20th centuries, and has edited, with Pietro Cord, I!~Jomurion Sosrces in the History of Science and Medicine (1983). Thisvolumemntainsmntributions by several mcmbenafthc Unit. The major change on the teaching front has bccn the great expansion in the number of pre-cliniciil medical students opting to take their dissertation on a history of medicine topic. Thc number of graduate students has also continued to expand. During the biennium four students have submitted DPhil dissenatianr. Undcr the direction of Dr. R.K. French the Unit of History of Medicine at Cambridge continues to provide considerablc undergraduate and post- graduate instruction in History of Medicine. As a subdepartmcnt ofHistory and Philosophy of Science. the Unit enjoys close collaboration with other historians and with the Whipplc Science Museum. Staff changes in the Unit include the appointment of Dr. Adrian Wilson to take over the teaching responsibilities of Dr. John Gabbay, who has faken up a career in community medicine, and the appointment of Dr. A.R. Cunningham as Wellcame Lecturer in the History of Medicine. Mr. P. Williams h.as been awarded s part-time Weiimme Fellowship to enable him to pursue his work on feminism in 19th-century medicine and to un- dertakc undergraduate supervision associated with the taught courses. The MPhii. course in the History of Medicine continues to prove attractive and a growing number of ruccessful candidates are now proceeding to the PhD. Drs. French and Cunningham continue to research and publish in medieval and renaissance medicine, and Dr. Wilson in 19th-century topics. The Unit contributed to the 1983 conference - suooorted bv Wellcome - on renais- sance medicine, and the consequent pukiishcd voiume has been edited by Dr. French and the organisers. Dr. Lonic (Wcllcome Fellow at the Unit (1981-82) and Dr. Wear (Univenity of Aberdeen). Exhibitions of historical material continue to be mounted at the Clinical School by Mn. 0. Brown. GRANTS IN SUPPORT MEDICINE OF THE HISTORY There continues to be considerable pressure from applicants on the funds that the Trustees can make available for historical research, partly by way of deflection from public sources of support. Applicants who might rate themselves as primarily social or economic historians increasingly look to the Trust for finance. An effect of inflation is that the granting of a single Research Fellowship for three years to a scholar of moderate seniority mmmitr a large fraction of the sum available for award at any one time. A new featureof applications is the requestingoftheprovision of apmnal computer for the analysis of data; the Trustees, with regret, have not felt able to meet such requests. As before, the Trustees have tended In wn- centrate awards upon those centres where it has particularly developed studies in medical history: London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Manchester. Major awards were made to 17 post -doctoral schalan and 10 pmtgraduate students; 20 smaller awards were approved, in aid of research or publi- carton. Thz '1'ru.t ducr not. ho*our. ~tself As ,n earlier !e;lrr. the Hluur! Adv~sor) Panel ha met regularly for the canrider.~tion ufnpplit-lam\\ lur granis and to re\\iew Ihc development of the subject. Trustees, Panel memben, scholars and students attended three oneday meetings at which recipients of grants presented acwunts of the research they had undertaken. Grants awarded for research in the History of Medicine during the two- year period of this repart are listed on page 151-156. Thc Sir Henry Wellcomc Medal and Prize, instituted hy Sir Henry Well- come in 1916, is awurdcd annually by thc Council of the Association of Military Surgeuna of the United Stales of America.

The Welleome Trust Award for Research in Biochemistry Related to Med- icine was instituted in 1977 and the first biennial award was made in 1978. This award is intended to recognise distinguished research in the field of biochemistry which leads to new advancesin medicalseience by biochemists under the age of 45 years. Such work must nomaliy have been published in the United Kingdom or Ireland during the seven yean preceding the date of nomination. The award for 1984 was made to Professor R.
