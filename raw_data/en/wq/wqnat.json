It is formulated to make your skin glow and give your immune system a super boost to fight colds, flu, stress and low energy. Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) is a water-soluble nutrient essential for growth and repair of all parts of the body. It is one of the most vital vitamins in our body as it plays roles in red blood cell production, resisting damage from free radicals, production of healthy collagen, wound healing, and immune system function. The body is not capable of making Vitamin C on its own, and it does not store Vitamin C. It is therefore important to include plenty of Vitamin C-containing foods or supplementation in your daily diet. You might have heard that drinking orange juice will give you the Vitamin C that you need, but the truth is that most OJs are loaded with sugar, and do not actually contain enough of the vitamin to help you recover or fight off an oncoming sickness. A quick Vitamin C boost will boost your immunity and cut viral and bacterial load so that you recover faster. Vitamin C is known as a super-antioxidant. Free radical molecules can damage our cells and tissues, leading to health issues such as cancer, heart disease, and arthritis. Antioxidants help prevent the formation, activity, and buildup of free radical molecules. The aging process is largely responsible for the build-up of such free radicals. Multiple studies have shown that large doses of Vitamin C can actually inhibit the growth of cancer cells due to its role in collagen production and the protection and elimination of these free radicals.
