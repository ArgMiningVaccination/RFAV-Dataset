If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn more. Verywell Family / Marcus Millan Women and men can both play roles in a couple's ability to get pregnant, even though it is woman's fertility that is most talked about and treatment is sought out for. In fact, in at least half of the cases of infertility, the cause can be attributed to male infertility. If a couple has been trying to conceive for an extended period of time (which may be determined based on the couple's age), and the female has been evaluated for infertility but found to be healthy, then the male in the partnership may want to get a fertility assessment. A semen analysis is performed and the following factors are assessed: sperm shape (morphology), movement (motility), and the number of sperm produced (concentration). Uncovering a problem in one or a few of these areas does not mean that the male is infertile, but rather it gives clues as to what parameters can be targeted for improvement. After a fertility assessment, the best treatment options can be determined. Research regarding diet and supplements for fertility is evolving, but addressing diet and nutrition concerns may be helpful before considering other medical options for starting their family. \"There are no hard-and-fast rules that dictate whether a man needs a fertility supplement or not. If he has been diagnosed with any condition that may negatively impact his ability to conceive, like a low sperm count or impaired sperm motility, a supplement may offer some benefit.\" says Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN, LDN, CLEC, CPT, author of Fueling Male Fertility. To improve male fertility, start with looking at your diet, lifestyle, choose research-based supplements, and first consult with a healthcare provider such as a reproductive endocrinologist before starting any supplement. Always speak with a healthcare professional before adding a supplement to your routine, to ensure that the supplement is appropriate for your individual needs and which dosage to take.

We love the Natalist Male Prenatal Packets because they contain only the ingredients that are shown by rigorous scientific research to have an impact on male fertility. Our expert dietitian we interviewed, Lauren Manaker, is the co-creator of this product, as well as a board certified urologist and doctor who specializes in male fertility. Each packet contains seven ingredients, divided up into four easy to tolerate capsules. The ingredients include: Coenzyme Q10, DHA, lycopene, selenium, vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin E. We like that these specific nutrients are provided in sufficient, but not unnecessarily high, amounts that are shown to be helpful for fertility. For example, these specific ingredients can help protect sperm from oxidative damage and improve semen quality. You may find it surprising that the Natalist packets do not contain zinc or folic acid, but this is on purpose. After thoroughly combing the research, these two nutrients have not been found to significantly improve birth rates or semen quality. Natalist lists on their website each research study that supports each ingredient for this male fertility supplement. These high quality capsules are manufactured in a GMP facility but are not third-party tested. However, each batch has a certificate of analysis for product integrity and quality. Natalist is transparent about their ingredients and proud to offer a product that is vegan, gluten free, and 100% plastic neutral. Price at time of publication: $55 ($1.83 per serving) Key Specs:Form: capsule | Dose: 4 capsules daily | Third-Party Certified: no | Servings Per Container: 30 Best Budget Nature Made Multi + Omega 3 Gummies for Him Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On Target Pros USP Verified Contains omega-3s Affordable Cons Contains added sugars Having a successful pregnancy can be quite expensive for many couples. If you don't conceive naturally, you may be paying for fertility treatments that can be quite costly. Understandably, you may not want to pay a lot more money for something like supplements. This is why we love the budget-friendly and USP-verified male fertility supplement from Nature Made. A trusted supplement brand, Nature Made delivers on quality, cost, and convenience. The Multi + Omega 3 Gummies for Him provides a full spectrum of vitamins and minerals which is a great boost if your diet if it's not always high in foods like fruits and vegetables. Plus, we like that there is a small addition of the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA in this gummy. Manaker says, \"Most people are not eating the recommended servings of fish every week, and intake of the [omega 3] fats found in fish may support certain fertility parameters.\" Just note a healthcare professional may recommend an additional omega 3 supplement may be recommended to reach the same omega 3 amounts that would be in eating two to three servings of fish per week. As a gummy, they are easy to take and come in delicious strawberry, lemon, and orange flavors. There are four grams of added sugar in the two gummy portions, so if you are closely watching your sugar intake, you may want to consider this. Price at time of publication: $18 ($0.45 per serving) Key Specs:Form: gummy | Dose: 2 gummies daily | Third-Party Certified: yes | Servings Per Container: 40 Best Multivitamin Needed Men's Multivitamin Amazon View On Amazon View On Thisisneeded.com Pros Contains good amounts of vitamins and minerals to help support overall health and fertility Great to take anytime, whether trying to conceive or not Cons Not third-party tested Expensive Diet is an important factor in overall health, and studies show that diet may influence male fertility. However, it can be difficult to always prioritize eating a well balanced diet. This is where a multivitamin may come in handy to support male fertility. Needed has become one of our favorite supplement brands for all things conception and pregnancy related\u2014and for good reason. Their products are formulated based on scientific evidence, and they use extremely high quality ingredients. The Men's Multivitamin is no exception, as they specifically use the most absorbable forms of ingredients. \"It takes approximately 90 days for men to generate new sperm and for it to enter the ejaculate. So, I let male patients know that it may take up to three months to see any possible benefits from lifestyle changes they have made,\" said Dr. Temeka Zore, Director of Fertility Preservation at Spring Fertility in San Francisco This extra timing also applies to supplements, so men may want to start taking this vitamin early into their fertility journey. It's also an excellent supplement to take as a future father with no immediate plans of pregnancy, as this multi provides a full spectrum of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can be beneficial at any adult age. We also appreciate each batch is third-party tested for ingredient purity, pesticides, heavy metals, microbes, allergens, and other contaminants. Note this supplement dose is four capsules and can be more expensive than other over the counter multivitamins, but we feel the quality is worth it. To complete your fertility supplement bundle, we recommend considering pairing this multi with the Men's Omega-3 + and Coenzyme Q10 from Needed (or another brand). Price at time of publication: $50 ($1.67 per serving) Key Specs:Form: capsule | Dose: 4 capsules daily | Third-Party Tested: yes | Servings Per Container: 30 The 12 Best Prenatal Vitamins of 2023 Best Coenzyme Q10 Theralogix NeoQ10 Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart Pros NSF Certified Optimized for enhanced absorption Cons May need other supplements to benefit male fertility More research needed for optimal dose Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) may not be a nutrient you are too familiar with, but it's one that men should pay attention to when it comes to fertility. CoQ10 acts like an antioxidant and is a nutrient that has been shown to benefit male fertility by increasing seminal fluid quality. Manaker says, \"Coenzyme Q10 supplementation is linked to positive outcomes when it comes to sperm health. While more data is needed to confirm this link, anecdotally, many couples claim that this supplement addition helped them on their fertility journey.\" If you're looking for a high quality and potent CoQ10 supplement, we recommend Theralogix NeoQ10. This supplement is NSF verified which means it passes rigorous safety and ingredient testing. It's also formulated using VESIsorb technology which improves the absorption of CoQ10 by mimicking the body's natural process of fat digestion. Theralogix suggests the VESIsorb colloidal delivery system may improve the absorption and bioavailability of supplemental CoQ10 up to 300-600% compared with other standard CoQ10 supplements. This supplement is just CoQ10 and may need to be paired with other supplements to aid in male fertility. It may need to be combined with a multivitamin or other nutrients for your fertility supplement regimen. It's also worth noting more research needs to be done for the best CoQ10 dose to help support male fertility. Price at time of publication: $77 ($0.86 per serving) Key daily | Third-Party Certified: yes | Servings Per Container: 90 Best Vitamin D Source Naturals Vitamin D-3 Liquid Drops Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On Gnc.com Pros Third-party tested Customizable dose Pleasant taste Budget-friendly Cons May need to take multiple drops for higher dose needs Vitamin D is known as the sunshine vitamin, as we can get vitamin D from the sun. Unfortunately, however, most of us don't get adequate sun exposure, and there are limited foods that contain vitamin D. As a result, not getting enough vitamin D can be common. When it comes to fertility, research suggests that if you are deficient in vitamin D, then taking a vitamin D supplement could help boost fertility. Manaker points out that vitamin D may not be helpful for fertility if you're not vitamin D deficient, so getting appropriate testing with your doctor will be helpful before starting this supplement. If you need to supplement vitamin D, we recommend using third-party tested Source Naturals. This is a liquid form of the bioavailable vitamin D3 form. Each nine drop serving provides 50 micrograms\u2014250% Daily Value of vitamin D. Men with significant deficiency may end up needing to take more than the suggested nine drops. Thankfully, this liquid supplement has a pleasant, slightly orange flavor and can easily be mixed into your drink of choice or taken as is. Price at time of publication: $15 ($0.02 per serving) Key Specs:Form: liquid | Dose: 9 drops | Third-Party Certified: yes | Servings Per Container: 695 The 7 Best Fertility Products of 2023 Best Fish Oil Life Extension Super Omega-3 Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On IHerb Pros Third-party tested Provides a high concentration of omega-3s Non-GMO Cons 8 softgels are recommended daily Omega 3 fats provide anti-inflammatory benefits that affect many aspects of health including male fertility. Fish and fish oils are the most common source of omega 3s, but most people are not eating the recommended 2-3 servings of fish per week to reap the health benefits of omega 3s. Therefore, an omega 3 supplement may be recommended. While more definitive research is needed, some studies suggest that omega-3s can improve sperm concentration, total sperm count, and to a lesser extent sperm motility. If eating fatty fish is lacking in your diet, then you may want to consider an omega 3 supplement like the Life Extension Super Omega-3. We like that this supplement is third-party tested, non-GMO, gluten-free, and is IFOS ((international Fish Oil Standards) approved\u2014meaning it has passed testing for quality, safety, and purity of omega-3s. Each four softgel serving provides 500 mg of DHA, 700 mg of EPA, as well as sesame lignans and olive extract to protect the fish oil from oxidation. Due to the highly concentrated dose, the serving size is four softgels, and it's recommended to take each serving twice daily. We recognize the total of eight softgels per day may not seem realistic for some men. However, even if not all eight pills are taken everyday, this supplement is still a good source of quality omega 3s. Also keep in mind men who take blood thinning medications or have a bleeding disorder should talk with a healthcare professional before taking an omega 3 supplement. Price at time of publication: $33 ($1.10 per eight softgel serving) 8 softgels daily | Third-Party Servings Per Container: 30 Best L-Carnitine Jarrow Formulas Acetyl-L-Carnitine Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On IHerb Pros Third-party tested Single capsule Vegan-friendly Cons Recommended dose needs more research Carnitine is a naturally occurring compounds in mammals, and we can get them in the diet through red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy. A specific carnitine\u2014Acetyl-l-carnitine\u2014is a powerful antioxidant, and research has shown that it can specifically protect sperm mitochondria (their \"energy powerhouse\") from oxidative stress and damage. Acetyl-l-carnitine can also impact sperm motility and vitality; in fact, men who have abnormal semen parameters are more likely to be found to have low carnitine levels. If an acetyl-l-carnitine supplement has been recommended for you, we suggest Jarrow Acetyl-L-Carnitine. This is a vegan, third-party tested, non-GMO, allergen-free supplement that comes as an easy to take single capsule that provides 500 mg of acetyl-l-carnitine. More research is needed as to what dosage of acetyl-l-carnitine may be most beneficial for semen and male fertility, and it's possible that you may need to take a higher dose to see the beneficial effects acetyl-l-carnitine can have on male fertility. A healthcare professional can help determine what would be the best dose for your needs. Price at time of publication: $42 ($0.35 per capsule dose) Key Specs:Form: capsule | Dose: 1 to 2 capsules daily | Third-Party Certified: yes | Servings Per Container: 120 The 7 Best Pregnancy-Safe Protein Powders Fertility Supplements for Men We Excluded From Our List Folic acid and zinc are two commonly studied and recommended supplements for male factor infertility; however, more recent studies have not found a strong enough connection between these nutrients and fertility. While these two nutrients do work together in sperm formation, clinical trials that had men supplement with these nutrients actually did not show improvements in sperm health. In fact, studies actually reported greater sperm fragmentation, which is a key marker linked to infertility. Plus, live births did not differ significantly between the supplemented and placebo groups. For these reasons, we did not feel that the evidence was strong enough to recommend taking specific folic acid and zinc supplements. We also did not include any male fertility supplements that had ingredients, like various types of herbs, as these ingredients do not have research to show benefits. Is a Fertility Supplement Beneficial for Men? First, we must remember that a supplement is just that\u2014something to supplement, or add to, a solid foundation of health. Eating a balanced diet, minimizing alcohol intake, not smoking, and being physically active are factors that may improve male fertility parameters and may impact male infertility most. It's important to remember infertility is complex, and certain populations may or may not benefit from a supplement. Furthermore, if a semen analysis has revealed a specific issue, then a targeted supplement may offer more of a benefit. We spoke with Dr. Temeka Zore, Director of Fertility Preservation at Spring Fertility in San Francisco, who says, \"There are different issues that can impact sperm production, function and transportation.\" A male fertility supplement may be beneficial for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: Age. While sperm quality is less impacted by age in relation to female fertility, men over the age of 40 are more likely to report difficulty conceiving. Poor diet. Research has shown that consuming a typical Western diet that is higher in processed red meat, refined grains, sugary beverages, and alcohol can negatively impact semen quality and fecundity rates. Eating a diet that is more Mediterranean style and includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and poultry provides a man with more omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals that can improve semen parameters. Lifestyle factors. Our fast-paced society promotes an always-busy, overly productive mentality which may be detrimental to mental health, ability to cope with stress, and sleep habits. All of these factors may impact a man's health and sperm quality over time. Manaker says that \"managing stress [and] prioritizing getting quality and adequate sleep (7-8 hours every night)\" could help improve fertility. Physiological impairments. There are various conditions that directly impact a man's physiology and hinder their semen quality and fertility. Such impairments could be trauma to the testes, varicoceles, hypothalamus or pituitary gland disorders. Environmental-related factors. Men who work in fields where they are exposed to radiation, environmental toxins (pesticides, lead, mercury, or cadmium), or high temperatures are more at risk for infertility. Medications. Zore says, \"Testosterone [as anabolic steroids] can negatively impact sperm production because it lowers the amount of testosterone your own body will produce. The testicles need to be able to produce high levels of testosterone locally to adequately produce sperm. Additional medications that can impact sperm include certain medications to treat hair loss and some anti-depressants.\" If you are eating a Mediterranean-based diet, do not smoke, drink excessive alcohol, limit your exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, other environmental toxins, and are otherwise healthy and free of chronic medical conditions then you likely do not need to take supplements for fertility. Zore says, \"In general, larger scale, randomized studies on supplements for male fertility or to improve sperm parameters on a semen analysis have been inconclusive and have shown little benefit. However, the majority of the supplements are vitamins and likely have minimal harm to your health.\" How We Select Supplements Our team works hard to be transparent about why we recommend certain supplements; you can read more about our dietary supplement methodology here. We support supplements that are evidence-based and rooted in science. We value certain product attributes that we find to be associated with the highest quality products. We prioritize products that are third-party tested and certified by one of three independent, third-party certifiers: USP, NSF, or ConsumerLab.com. It's important to note that the FDA does not review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they go to market. Our team of experts has created a detailed, science-backed methodology to choose the supplements we recommend. We interviewed the following fertility experts to give further insight into the best supplements for male fertility: Lauren Manaker, MS, RDN, LDN, CLEC, CPT, author of Fueling Male Fertility and co-creator of Natalist Male Prenatal Daily Packets Dr. Temeka Zore, Director of Fertility Preservation at Spring Fertility in San Francisco What to Look For in Fertility Supplements for Men Third-Party Testing Supplements that are third-party tested are sent to a lab where they are tested to ensure they contain what they say they contain and are not contaminated with specific high-risk, common contaminants. However, it's important to note: Third-party testing does not test to see if a product is effective or safe for everyone, and it does not ensure the supplement will not interact with other supplements or medications.Not all third-party testing is created equal. It is not uncommon for supplement companies to pay labs for certificates after conducting minimal to no testing. The third-party certifications we can trust are ConsumerLab.com, NSF, and USP. However, these certifications are difficult to obtain and/or expensive for manufacturers, so many companies choose not to get their products tested by one of these three organizations. Sometimes products tested by these three companies are more expensive to try to offset the cost they pay for certification.Just because a supplement is not tested by one of these three companies, it does not mean it's a bad product. We recommend doing some research on the reputability of the manufacturer and calling up the manufacturer and their testing lab to determine their protocols and decide if you feel comfortable consuming the supplement. Form Fertility supplements, which can be vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other nutrient compounds, can be found in pill, gummy, powder, or liquid form. Supplements that contain multiple ingredients or \"bulky\" nutrients like minerals are less likely to come in easier to tolerate gummy or liquid forms, so this is something to consider if you want these forms of supplements. Ingredients & Potential Interactions It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included, relative to the recommended daily value of that ingredient. Please bring the supplement label to a healthcare provider to review the different ingredients contained in the supplement and any potential interactions between these ingredients and other supplements and medications you are taking. Some fertility supplements may contain nutrients that interact with medications or compete for absorption with other nutrients. So, we recommend to review these products with your healthcare provider before taking any supplement. You may also find other herbs, probiotics, raw food ingredients, and sugars added into fertility supplements, which may be concerning for certain health conditions you may have. Always speak with your healthcare provider to discuss potentially taking any of these products. Dosage Research is ongoing for how dietary supplements impact fertility and the recommended doses of each nutrient. There are few evidence-based recommendations for the dosages of these products. For some vitamins, like vitamin D and folate, fertility specialists will often suggest doses that go above the recommended dietary allowance (RDA), but no official recommendations have been set. If you have a question about the best recommended dose you should take of a fertility supplement, consult a healthcare professional. How Much is Too Much? You may notice when looking at fertility supplements that the amounts for some nutrients are often exceptionally higher than the 100% Daily Value (DV). More research is needed to determine what levels many of these supplements are safe or provide benefit, so always discuss these products with a healthcare provider before taking them. It's also important to consider if you have a true deficiency of a nutrient (this can be verified by obtaining blood work), if you have absorption issues, or other medical conditions. If you have one (or more) of these, that will play a role in determining what is an appropriate or inappropriate amount of a nutrient to take. Frequently Asked Questions How long does it take for male fertility supplements to work? Manaker and Zore agree that it may take two to three months, or longer, to see benefits from fertility supplements and/or diet and lifestyle changes. Ideally a man should start taking fertility supplements, especially a multivitamin, two to three months before wanting to conceive and continue to take any recommended supplements until successful. What should a man avoid when trying to conceive? Men should work to balance their diet, stress, and sleep as much as possible. Manaker also points out that it may be important to \"avoid activities that involve heat to be exposed to the groin area (like sitting in a hot tub or working with a hot laptop on a lap) and to avoid potential endocrine disrupting chemicals, like phthalates.\" These compounds can be found in a lot of personal care items, like deodorants and lotions. How can a man tell if he is fertile? Determining this can be tricky. Zore says, \"Many men may not know they have an issue with fertility until they go down the path of a fertility work-up and treatment.\" Until a semen analysis is performed there may be no indications about a man's sperm quality. What are some natural ways to increase male fertility? Diet and lifestyle should always come first. Following a Mediterranean-based diet, getting regular physical activity, getting adequate sleep, and managing stress are all natural ways to improve male fertility before turning to supplements.
