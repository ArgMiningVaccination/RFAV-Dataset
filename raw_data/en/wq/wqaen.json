T. JACKSON, CEO Gun Violence Strikes a Tulsa Medical Facility Another senseless act of gun violence has devastated a community -this time at a medical facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This shooting comes days after the horrific massacre of children in Uvalde, Texas, and on the 101st anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre of 1921. The legacy of violence that plagues our culture has deep historic roots and festers on. We are tired of being heartbroken; we want change. As the only level -one trauma center in the East Bay, we are on the front lines of gun violence every day. We see firsthand what bullets do to bodies, families and communities. We are tasked with the work of healing physical, emotional, and spiritual wounds from gun violence. It is unconscionable that health care workers just like us would be the targets of violence in a facility intended for healing. Although this latest tragedy occurred in Tulsa, it feels incredibly close to home. I have directed our security team to review and, if necessary, revise our security protocols. Our security officers have received Active Shooter Training and vigilantly observe each of our campuses for suspicious activity. AHS Security and our law enforcement partners are on high alert. According to the CDC, guns are now the leading cause of death among children. The gun violence epidemic in America claims over 40,000 lives annually. Shootings in our streets, schools, movie theaters, concerts, and places of worship have become regular occurrences. There is a shared sentiment being expressed all over the country: Enough is enough. People across the nation want comprehensive cultural and policy reform to address gun violence, mental health service needs, and community safety. As we confront this violence, AHS has an important role. We are educating our communities about firearm violence, supporting local violence prevention efforts, and treating the wounded. Our job is to heal. Our mission is Caring, Healing, Teaching, Serving All. It has never been more important work.The Supreme Court Overrules Roe v. Wade Today, the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established abortion access as a constitutional right. Fifty years of federally protected reproductive freedom have come to an end, and we are deeply disappointed and upset. Because of this heartbreaking decision, fifty -eight percent of U.S. pregnancy -capable people now live in states where abortion care is inaccessible, illegal, or soon to be illegal. History tells us what will come next. People with means will find a way to access safe abortions, and those without means will find a way to have abortions whether they are safe or not or be forced to give birth. Black, brown, and poor people will disproportionately suffer. A recent study by The Guttmacher Institute finds that the number of out -of-state people of childbearing age who now find their nearest legal abortion service in California will increase from 46,000 to 1.4 million. Health care providers, reproductive justice advocacy organizations, nonprofit organizations, and legislative leaders in California are preparing to meet the reproductive health needs of people from all over the country. Additionally, we must address barriers to abortion care access with equitable and affordable reproductive health services for the most vulnerable populations in California and in states without reproductive freedom. As the safety -net provider in California's second -largest metropolitan area, Alameda Health System's role in this effort is significant. We are working with local officials, advocates, and policymakers to protect, strengthen, and expand abortion services. Our Public Affairs and Community Engagement team is expanding our communications and community partnerships to ensure that people who seek out abortions can find our services. And our Department of Obstetrics, Midwifery and Gynecology will continue to offer full spectrum sexual and reproductive health services to our local communities as well as anyone who comes to us from out of state. At AHS, we know that abortion care is health care. We respect the right of all people to make autonomous decisions about their bodies and health. We will meet the reproductive health needs of all our patients. Our clinical teams who provide abortion care have the full support of AHS. We will take all measures to protect them and their ability to deliver reproductive health care to all in need.Workforce CEO Rounding Productive way to connect with staff and identify and eliminate obstacles.
