Naveen tells [Nurse](/answers/registered-nurse-rn) Ken, \"I've been taking my prescribed medications, but I've been using my own remedies too.\" [Nurse](/answers/registered-nurse-rn) Ken responds, \"Naveen, I want to gather some more information to ensure I understand the treatments you're using.\" Naveen goes on to explain that he's been taking his antibiotics as prescribed; however, he's using acupuncture and meditation to address his pain instead of taking his prescribed pain medication. He also mentions that he's now taking a probiotic every day and he's developed a special diet with his nutritionist which limits his intake of gluten and dairy. [Nurse](/answers/registered-nurse-rn) Ken says, \"I'm glad to hear you're taking such a proactive approach to your health. Let's work together to safely incorporate these into your plan of care.\" [Nurse](/answers/registered-nurse-rn) Ken will use what he knows about integrative and alternative therapies to provide support and empower Naveen in making health care decisions. Okay, so allopathic therapy, also called biomedicine, is what we know as conventional Western medicine, such as the use of medications, chemotherapy, and surgical procedures like Naveen's partial colectomy procedure and prescribed antibiotics. Then there's integrative therapy, also known as complementary therapy, which is when an allopathic treatment is combined with a non-conventional treatment, such as massage therapy, chiropractic medicine, or biofeedback. Naveen is using integrative therapy by taking his antibiotics while also using a probiotic supplement to complement his conventional treatment. Next is alternative therapy, which is where non-conventional therapies completely replace a conventional allopathic treatment. For example, Naveen is using acupuncture and meditation instead of his pain medication so this is considered alternative therapy. Now that we know more about integrative and alternative therapies, it's time to see why they're used. Although allopathic medicine is effective in treating diseases, it's not always effective in treating the distressing symptoms that occur as a result of the disease or its treatments. Because of this, clients can seek out integrative and alternative treatments to reduce symptoms and improve their quality of life. Integrative and alternative therapies can be used for the therapeutic benefits of improving sleep and mood, as well as decreasing pain, anxiety, and nausea. For example, Kava is used by clients for its anxiolytic properties, and magnet therapy to help alleviate pain in clients with musculoskeletal disorders.
