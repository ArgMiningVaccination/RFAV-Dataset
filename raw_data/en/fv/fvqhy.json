Confessing our sins should be liberating and joyful - so why do we so often feel only shame and guilt? Spiritual Detox invites you to rethink the way you see confession and discover greater joy through the recovery of this much-neglected spiritual discipline. Blending biblical teaching with practical advice and application, it will show you how making regular, heart-felt confession will revitalise your spiritual life - whether you are unhappy and discouraged, wrestling with guilt and shame or just longing to drink more deeply of God's forgiveness and abundant grace. Using examples from Scripture, and with meditations on 1 John 1:9, Spiritual Detox explores how confessing sin frees us from guilt to strengthen our relationship with God. Packed full of practical wisdom and insight, it will leave you with a clearer vision of God's forgiveness, help you to make confession part of your everyday spiritual formation and set you on a path of liberating joy and discipleship.
