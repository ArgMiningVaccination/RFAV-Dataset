My bet is that the place felt harmonious, balanced and tranquil in one way or another. On the other hand, have you ever entered a space and got a really heavy vibe? Perhaps you can't place your finger on exactly what it was that you felt, but just that something was thick? From an energetic perspective, what you may have felt in the latter can be explained by what Vedic traditions call tamas\u2014 the energy of dullness and inertia. What Is That \"Vibe\"? An abundance of tamas in an environment can be experienced as a palpable sense of darkness, heaviness, lethargy or negativity in a space. The energy may feel thick or stagnant. Now\u2014 tamas isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's simply a natural quality of energy. It's one of three qualities of matter (Triguna) along with rajas, the dynamic energy of activity, and sattva the energy of purity. One explanation as to how tamas can accumulate in a space is from a shift in the organic balance of the five elements of nature\u2014the Pancha Maha Bhutas, of earth, water, fire, air and space\u2014 towards an excess of the earth element. Too much earth element, or tamas, in an environment makes things feel heavy, dull, dark, stagnant, or negative. This tamasic energy is essential in some places\u2014 such as the bedroom as we need this heavy, dull energy to help us sleep at night! However, too much tamas in a space can be felt through the senses and can influence the mind and make us feel lethargic, heavy and quite frankly, down, negative or depressed. 7 Vedic Practices For Clearing & Uplifting Your Space Whether you want to encourage more positive energy into your home or you seek some tools to shift the vibe of a dull or stagnant space, here are some tips to promote peace, balance and sattva in any environment. 1. Clean and clear Start by simply cleaning up the space. Dust and debris are said to be tamasic in nature and attract a dull, lethargic and heavy energy. Wiping down all surfaces, taking down cobwebs and sweeping up any debris is a key step to clear the energy in your space. 2. Open up and let the sunshine in Tamas naturally has a cold, dark and damp quality to it. To dispel this darkness, open up the windows, allow some fresh air to circulate and invite the sunshine in! Make a habit of every morning opening up the curtains and allowing the morning sunlight to enter into your home. Light drives out darkness and has an uplifting effect on both your mind and your space. Have you practiced meditation with Bindi yet? - Self-Love Meditation Bindi Stables 12:35 3. Light up incense Burning incense helps clear out any dense energies in a space and purify the air element (Vayu Bhuta,) which has an uplifting effect on the senses. Natural incense made of sacred plants, resins and herbs emanate a divine fragrance known to attract positive energies, promote a balanced and peaceful atmosphere and cultivate Sattva in the mind. Alternatively, you can diffuse or burn the natural aromas of essential oils from auspicious plants like rose, jasmine, sandalwood or frankincense. Tip: Make sure the incense you are burning is natural and not chemical based!

Light a lamp In Vedic traditions, it is common practice to light an oil lamp known as a deepam or diya, in the home every morning and evening. Lighting a candle or deepam naturally drives out darkness (tamas,) in any space and attracts pure and positive vibrations (sattva.) By lighting a lamp, we purify the fire element in the surrounding environment and invoke auspiciousness, goodness and purity into the space. This light illuminates the mind and brightens the senses. 5. Burn camphor or sacred resins Camphor is like the \"sage\" of the Vedic tradition. It symbolizes a strong connection with the sacred. It offers an ethereal and divine feeling of tranquillity. When burnt or diffused, its fumes are said to possess the power to redefine your surroundings by releasing healing energies, dissolving dense energies and magnifying positive ones. Alternatives: As another option, you can burn Sambrani (gum benzoin,) frankincense or myrrh resin for a similar effect. 6.
