Ear Soother Ear Oiling is the Ayurvedic process of applying herbal oil to the ear canals, called Karna Purana. Your treatment begins with a scalp, face and neck massage. One by one, as you lay on your side, each ear is filled with warmed drops of herbalized oil and massaged to allow the oil to move deeply into the canal.
