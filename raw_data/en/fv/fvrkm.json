Introduction and Background The following document outlines a stakeholder engagement plan for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's National Bio and !gro -Defense Facility (NBAF). NBAF will be a state- of-the-art integrated facility designed to protect the United States' agricult ural economy, food supply, and public health from natural outbreaks or intentional introductions of foreign animal, emerging, and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases. DHS recognizes the need for comprehensive engagement plan to keep stakeholders informed as NBAF moves forward through design, construction, commissioning, and operation stages. DHS and the U.S. Department of !griculture's !gricultural Research Service (!RS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) (as the tenant research entities) are committed to transparency, open communication with stakeholders, and responding to stakeholder inquiries/concerns in a timely manner. As with any high-containment laboratory, the study of high-consequence pathogens is not without risk. DHS is committed to mitigating these risks through comprehensive threat and risk analyses that will inform NBAF design, construction, and operation. Because public perception of these risks will be influenced by communications and outreach strategies, DHS will outline plans for risk communication as a part of the overall risk management strategy for NBAF. The purpose of the risk communication will be to educate and inform the public regarding risks and to inform the public in the highly unlikely event of an incident. To facilitate open communication and transparency, DHS has prepared this stakeholder engagement plan as a dynamic document that will evolve with NBAF to guide efforts to provide consistent, timely and useful information. This plan draws upon stakeholder engagement best practices gathered from the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) and other biocontainment laboratories, and builds on previous stakeholder engagement activities undertaken during the NBAF Site Selection EIS process. The plan also outlines a preliminary risk communication strategy that will be implemented when NBAF becomes fully operational in FY20. This stakeholder engagement plan will be reviewed at least annually and will be updated as needed. 2. Objectives To ensure open communication and transparency with stakeholders, the primary objectives of this plan are to: Identify the appropriate stakeholders and specific activities, avenues, and venues to keep them engaged and informed. Establish public confidence in the NBAF project by facilitating continual dialogue among stakeholders, and DHS, and USDA (ARS and APHIS). NBAF SSRA Report Proactively establish channels of communication (e.g. a Stakeholder Engagement Committee, regular meetings, a website) for this dialogue in order to disseminate information and gather feedback throughout the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. Specifically engage the local Manhattan, KS community to earn public trust. Outline preliminary risk communication strategies for NBAF. 3. Lead Agency and Activity Coordination As the owner of NBAF, DHS is responsible for the planning, construction, and operation. As such, DHS will work with federal partners and other involved organizations to coordinate stakeholder engagement activities. Specifically, the DHS Office of National Laboratories (ONL) within the Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate will take the lead on stakeholder activity coordination. The Director of ONL will work with senior DHS officials to answer questions regarding NBAF. ONL will be responsible for the primary information materials for NBAF, and will update and disseminate new information as it becomes available. 4. NBAF Stakeholders - Definition For the purposes of the NB!F project, the term \"stakeholder\" is defined as any person or organization potentially affected by the planning, construction, and operation of NBAF, interested in the issues of biological and agricultural safety relative to current and emerging foreign animal diseases (FADs), or interested in business or research opportunities at NBAF. Currently, identified stakeholders include: The local community of Manhattan, KS, Kansas State University (K-State) and the Heartland BioAgro Consortium (HBAC) Private sector, non-profit, non-governmental organizations, and academia DHS, USDA and other Federal agencies State and local government Congress General public 5. Specific Stakeholder Engagement Activities and Action Plans The following is a breakdown of the specific engagement activities and action plans that DHS intends to undertake with various NBAF stakeholders. The following activities incorporate many of the best practices of other high containment laboratories. The overall purpose of these activities is to increase NBAF SSRA Report public confidence by establishing a continual and open dialogue between DHS and stakeholders to inform, engage, and answer questions. 5.1 - The Local Community of Manhattan, KS, K-State, and HBAC The members of the local community of Manhattan, KS are important to the success of NBAF. A strong community engagement program is the best method to inform the public, gain feedback, and develop/maintain the facility's reputation for public accountability, safety and trustworthiness . Through events such as open houses, facility tours, and town halls, the public can learn about laboratory operations and the control measures used to protect the staff, the community, and the surrounding environment. These initiatives help establish the relationships that build public confidence and accountability between the laboratory and members of the local community. Kansas State University (K-State) already has a BSL- 3 facility, the Pat Roberts' Biosecurity Research Institute (BRI). Local and regional stakeholders were engaged before and during the construction of the BRI. They are being kept updated on the status of the BRI while research is being launched by K-State faculty and scientists. DHS and USDA will work with these stakeholders to stand up the research at NBAF. To engage the local Manhattan community and other stakeholders, DHS will establish a Stakeholder Engagement Committee (SEC) and a comprehensive community outreach program to engage the public and facilitate a dialogue. To execute these approaches DHS and USDA will: Establish an active community outreach program, prior to beginning construction, which includes the establishment of an NBAF Stakeholder Engagement Committee (SEC). The goal of the SEC is to promote better understanding of laboratory activities (including preparedness in case of an emergency) among the general public, serve as an information exchange between the community and the laboratory, and facilitate community outreach events. Establish a mechanism, either through the SEC or otherwise, where members of the local Manhattan community can interact with the laboratory director and staff to ask questions and understand the facility's ongoing work in science and operations, including preparedness in case of emergency. Continue to participate, give briefings, gather feedback, and answer questions on the status of the program in NBAF-related meetings where members of the Manhattan community are present. Pro-actively seek to engage the community at each milestone of the construction project (i.e., completion of the site-specific risk assessment, award of site-preparation, etc.) through neighborhood or town hall-style meetings. Prepare fact sheets and briefing materials to clearly present and explain the mission, design, research, risks, and mitigation strategies associated with NBAF. Participate in open houses and other public outreach activities on the campus of K-State. NBAF SSRA Report Prior to and continuing through operations, host educational programs, facility tours, community forums, community days, open houses, and town hall meetings to engage and inform the general public and to facilitate communication and dialogue. Regularly update the DHS NBAF website, www.dhs.gov/nbaf, to disseminate timely and accurate information. 5.2 - Private Sector, Non-profit, Non-governmental Organizations, and Academia The private sector, non-profit and non-governmental organizations, and academia are important partners in NBAF and its success. These groups represent the producer groups, agricultural associations, environmental groups, researchers, and academicians. To engage these stakeholders, DHS and USDA will, (in addition to the activities listed above): Establish mechanisms for information exchange between DHS and these organizations, such as research forums, national conferences, and general meetings. Hold monthly meetings with the HBAC to establish a cooperative relationship, inform them regarding NBAF's progress. Strengthen and focus community outreach efforts by keeping an integrated calendar o f events where these groups will be present. 5.3 - DHS, USDA and Other Federal Agencies ONL is the DHS office responsible for NBAF construction and operations/maintenance, and will continue to engage and communicate with DHS senior staff and other Federal agencies to keep them informed on the progress of NBAF. In addition to DHS, USDA ARS and APHIS as the lead partner agencies conducting research at NBAF are vital components in the success of the overall public outreach effort. DHS will continue to work with USDA to inform them of the progress of NBAF and to partner together in public outreach. To engage other Federal agencies, DHS and USDA will, (in addition to the activities listed above): Continue to proactively provide timely information and regular updates to Federal agencies through briefings, materials, website updates, and meetings. Commit to meeting regularly with officials from PIADC and other relevant biolabs for on-going public outreach support and collaboration. 5.4 - State and Local Government Similar to the methods employed to engage federal government partners, DHS will seek to engage state and local government through the timely and accurate dissemination of information through a variety of methods outlined below. To engage these stakeholders, DHS and USDA will utilize all activities listed above. NBAF SSRA Report 5.5 - Congress In keeping with standard practice and operations, the DHS and USDA will regularly inform Congress on the planning, construction, and operations of NBAF, as needed. The purpose of engagement with Congress is to provide timely information, discuss issues, answer questions, ensure transparency and open communication, and mitigate the risks associated with NBAF. Specifically, DHS ONL will work through the Office of the Under Secretary for S&T, the Office of Strategy, Policy and Budget, the Office of Legislative Affairs, and the Office of Public Affairs to conduct briefings, answer questions, and receive feedback from members of congress and their staff. USDA ARS and APHIS will work through their legislative affairs channels to inform members of congress, their staffs, and any appropriate committees. 5.6 - General Public DHS intends to keep the general public informed and engaged regarding the mission, research, risks and mitigation strategies associated with NBAF. DHS considers the general public to be an important stakeholder in NB!F as the mission of NB!F is to protect the nation's animal agriculture and public health. Thus, public outreach will inform the general public as to the benefits of having this facility and inform them of possible risks to animal or public health from FADs, emerging, and zoonotic diseases. To engage these stakeholders, DHS and USDA will utilize all activities listed above. 6. Risk Communication DHS is committed to implementing a comprehensive risk communication plan as part of the risk communication strategy at NBAF. The NBAF risk communication strategies will address qualitative and quantitative risks, clearly explain to the public in lay terms the risks of the facility, and demonstrate how DHS and USDA intend to mitigate those risks. The development of the EIS and the Site-Specific Risk Assessment are the first steps in the risk communication process. Building upon the risk communication plans of PIADC and other relevant biocontainment facilities, NBAF will employ many of the same mechanisms that have proved successful in mitigating risks and informing the public of incidents at these biolabs. For example, NBAF will have an incident reporting system to facilitate communication between the laboratory and the community, including stakeholders. The reporting system establishes a tiered communication system for evaluating the severity of an incident, the appropriate \"Incident Reporting System Response\" and the re quired reporting to the community. The more serious the incident and the potential risk, the broader and the more high-level the incident reporting. This tool ensures that the community is kept fully informed on day- to-day activities, and understands the severity of various incidents that may occur at the laboratory and the associated potential effects on their community. It also provides a consistent method of communication to the community from the laboratory. NBAF SSRA Report 7. List of Acronyms and Abbreviations ARS Agricultural Research Service (USDA) APHIS Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA) BRI Pat Roberts' Biosecurity Research Institute DHS U.S. Department of Homeland Security FAD Foreign Animal Diseases HBAC Heartland BioAgro Consortium K-State Kansas State University NBAF National Bio and Agro -Defense Facility (DHS) ONL Office of National Laboratories (DHS) PIADC Plum Island Animal Disease Center (DHS) SEC Stakeholder Engagement Committee S&T Science and Technology (DHS) USDA U.S. Department of Agriculture Appendix B1 : NAS Comment Matrix National Academy of Sciences Findings Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference Finding 1 The SSRA lacks evidence to support the conclusion that the risk of release that results in infection is very low relative to the risk of infection introduced from an external source. The 2010 SSRA did not attempt to quantify the risk of FMD infection from an external source. A risk-ranking and cumulative risk assessment are included in the Updated SSRA. Section 8.2 SSRA's data indicate that a release of FMDv resulting in infection outside the laboratory has a nearly 70% chance of occurring with an economic impact of at least $9-50 billion. The Updated SSRA presents cumulative probability and risk values across events and over the 50-year operating lifetime of the NBAF, along with quantitative estimates of uncertainty. The updated risk estimates reflect NBAF design updates (65% design) as well as operational and accident response strategies that have been updated since the 2010 SSRA. The calculations resulted in 50-year cumulative probability estimates ranging from 1.54 \u00d7 10-9 to 2.09 \u00d7 10-2 when all events are included, and from 1.54 \u00d7 10-9 to 1.17 \u00d7 10-3 when catastrophic events are excluded. In other words, when all events are considered, the probability of at least one release resulting in an infection over the 50-year NBAF operating lifetime is estimated to range between approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10-7 % and 2.1%. When catastrophic events are excluded, the probability of at least one release resulting in an infection over the 50-year NBAF operating lifetime is estimated to range between 1.5 \u00d7 10-7% and 0.1%. Section 8 The SSRA does not discuss or quantify uncertainties in the risk estimates including risk the passage of time. The Updated SSRA discusses the known uncertainties of its studies and models. In the development of frequencies, failure rates, and source terms, uncertainties in the data presented throughout Section 4 are described, if available. There are still data that are only described as point estimates. For data where the uncertainty is documented, it is characterized by the available confidence levels or standard deviation. In some cases, the distribution of a parameter is best described by presenting and modeling a low, medium and high level. Ranges and uncertainties associated with the epidemiological, and economic models are also used as input for the risk calculations. Sections 4, 6 and 7 all use uncertainties and ranges which are used in Risk Calculations (Section 8) NAS SSRA Findings 1 of 27 National Academy of Sciences Findings Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference Finding 2 The SSRA overlooks some critical issues, both site-specific and non-site\u00ad specific, that could significantly elevate the risk of accidental release and spread of pathogens. The Updated SSRA includes additional livestock data and infrastructure data from the surrounding area that have been collected and used in the assessment. Section 5 and Section 6 Well publicized releases at Pirbright and the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg, Canada call into question the SSRA's estimated frequency of failure of the liquid decontamination system every 2.1 million years. The two incidents described were extensively reviewed during the performance the Updated SSRA. An assessment of design configurations and controls that will prevent similar incidents is presented in the Updated SSRA. Section 3.1 Finding 3 The SSRA has several methodological flaws related to dispersion modeling, tornado assessment, and epidemiological modeling. Thus the committee believes that questions remain about the validity of the overall risk estimates. Additional fidelity has been added to the meteorological modeling and local observations data have been included in the assessment. Sensitivity analyses were performed for the modeled conditions and discussion on the sensitivity is included in the report. Specifically with regard to NAADSM inputs, the epidemiological modeling performed in the Updated SSRA uses inputs and settings developed in conjunction with nationally recognized NAADSM experts and users. All of the input data, assumptions, and settings applied to the epidemiological modeling are incorporated in the Updated SSRA documentation. See Sections 5 and 6 NRC could not determine the input parameters used for the NAADSM and could not independently validate the results. The Updated SSRA provides all NAADSM related parameters with source information (e.g. CEAH, Colorado State University, etc.). Sections 6.1 and A6 (Appendix) SSRA did not predict wind speed over time. The Updated SSRA reports the enhancements made to the NBAF design relative to high wind events. Section 5.1 SSRA made several subjective judgments relative to the Fujita Scale intensity The Updated SSRA uses the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved Pacific Northwest National Laboratory method for estimating wind speeds from tornadoes and high wind events for use in building damage estimation. This model is used to determine strike probabilities based on dimensions of the facility and provides associated wind speed data. Section 4.6 It is not clear that the SSRA conducted tests to check for calculation errors regarding the SCIPUFF model. The Updated SSRA provides the details related to the calculation checks and sensitivity testing of the SCIPUFF model. The performer collaborated with Dr. Ian Sikes. Section 5.1 Daily cleaning of animal pens will probably result in releases that exceed the amounts estimated. The Updated SSRA addresses the animal washdown in terms of urine and fecal excretions. Sections 4.2, 4.4, 9.5, and 9.7 NAS SSRA Findings 2 of 27 National Academy of Sciences Findings Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference Exposure distances are based on an arbitrary cut off of 0.1 virus particle and do not reflect uncertainties in meteorological variables, surface parameters and emission strength. Updated SSRA demonstrates how the 0.1 parameter satisfies the range parameters for distance and variables. The Updated SSRA is based on dose-response information and adjusted to the size of the herd exposed. Several methods are used to estimate this relationship for low doses and sensitivity analysis is performed around these parameters. The Updated SSRA computes the number of index infections based on the material dosage ingested by the animals and no longer uses the arbitrary 0.1 cutoff dosage. Section 6 The largest doses are likely to occur when the boundary layer height is small, the wind speed is low, and the period over which the virus is viable is long, the dry-deposition velocity is low, and the relative humidity and temperature favor FMDv viability. That corresponds to stable, low-wind speed conditions in which meteorological models are notoriously unreliable (Luhar et al., 2009). The Updated SSRA considers the boundary layer height in plume modeling. Sensitivity studies were performed in the Updated SSRA to assess the impact of these conditions. Section 5.1 Furthermore, several inputs cannot be specified objectively, such as the surface parameters (for example, roughness length). That suggests a need to conduct sensitivity studies to examine the effects of uncertainty in meteorological variables and values of model parameters on predicted doses. The Updated SSRA considers the boundary layer height in plume modeling. Additional sensitivity testing has been applied to the meteorological modeling in the Updated SSRA. Section 5.1 However, the SSRA does not provide information on the release and meteorological conditions that constitute a \"reasonable worst case,\" so thus the committee could not judge the validity of that approach for treating model uncertainty. Additional sensitivity testing has been applied to the meteorological modeling in the Updated SSRA. Section 5.1.10 Under these circumstances, it might have been appropriate to assimilate the Manhattan Regional Airport meteorological data into the database constructed by Rife et al. (2010), which has a relatively coarse resolution of 40 km. The Updated SSRA provides an assessment of the similarities between the climatological data and the local point observations from the Manhattan Regional Airport observational data. Section 5.1 However, there are no references to support the SSRA's claim that the dataset was \"specifically developed and subsequently validated to support boundary layer aerosol transport and dispersion modeling applications\" (SSRA Appendix J: Aerosol Fate and Transport (Plume) Modeling). The Updated SSRA provides references that directly related to aerosol boundary layer support and dispersion. Section 5.1.2 NAS SSRA Findings 3 of 27 National Academy of Sciences Findings Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference Finding 4 The committee agrees with the SSRA's conclusion that for FMDv, long-distance plume transport will likely be less important than the near-site exposure of cattle. Near-site exposure is modeled in the Updated SSRA and illustrates the impact of transportation hubs and local premises with susceptible species. Sections 3 and 10.3.3 Finding 5 Substantial gaps in knowledge make predicting the course of an FMD outbreak very difficult, even under ideal circumstances and even when methods exhibit high levels of internal validity, which led to weaknesses in the 2010 SSRA. Additional knowledge and data were collected such that relevant advancements in FMDv research and knowledge have been reflected in the Updated SSRA. The Updated SSRA Team recognizes that there are scientific gaps in knowledge about FMDv (and other pathogens of interest such as Nipah and Hendra). Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 Laboratory release risks were not based on real world estimates. The SSRA release scenarios and initial conditions were developed from data and subject matter expertise. Error rates and accident frequencies were developed from DoE data and from NBAF research plans. The Updated SSRA reports how information gained from the study of FMDv outbreaks in the UK has enhanced the release scenario modeling data. Where possible, the source terms are derived from empirical data. Likewise, failure rates and mitigations efficiencies are derived from published data. Section 4 The SSRA did not adequately consider case histories in arriving at risk estimates of laboratory leaks, and information from the documented cases of FMD releases were not fully taken into account. The Updated SSRA uses relevant case study information regarding known escapes of FMDv from laboratories to highlight the improvements in laboratory design and standard operating procedures. Where possible, the source terms are derived from empirical data. Likewise, failure rates and mitigations efficiencies are derived from published data. Section 4 Finding 6 Although the economic modeling was conducted with appropriate methods, the epidemiological data used as inputs to the SSRA were flawed. Additional infrastructure reviews were performed and subject matter experts were engaged and interviewed to address the NAS SSRA Committee's concerns. More realistic and representative initial culling rates were developed for the Updated SSRA and were incorporated in the modeling. Sections 6 and 7 PIADC and NBAF surrounding populations are different. The suburban - rural human / animal populace causes for different epidemiological spread. The SSRA failed to account for the increased population density in humans and susceptible animals. Enhanced data collection efforts to improve the epidemiological modeling have been undertaken for the Updated SSRA. Section 6 NAS SSRA Findings 4 of 27 National Academy of Sciences Findings Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference Locating the NBAF within the Kansas Animal Health corridor provides greater proximity for cleared, trained personnel to work and train in the NBAF, however the addition of more people \"would in all likelihood increase the risk of accidental spread of infections agents via fomites.\" The Updated SSRA provides evidence-based discussion, largely predicated from worker practices at similar facilities, on how, with proper training and procedures, personnel can enter/exit containment areas and work safely. Section 5 and 10.2.2 The SSRA states that the estimated frequency of failure of the liquid effluent system is once every 2.1 million years, however such failure was the cause of FMDv release from Pirbright and an incident in Winnipeg. The Updated SSRA highlights the advances and differences in design and operating procedures that minimize pathogen release. The Pirbright release was a result of antiquated infrastructure and represents a different effluent decontamination system/layout. The Winnipeg incident occurred during Cx and was the result of errors and failures that are only partially relevant to NBAF. Sections 3 and 4 The SSRA does not discuss or quantify uncertainties in the risk estimates. The Updated SSRA presents the uncertainties in the risk calculations. I n the development of frequencies, failure rates, and source terms, uncertainties in the data presented throughout this section are described, if available. There are still data that are only described as point estimates. For data where the uncertainty is documented, it is characterized by the available confidence levels or standard deviation. In some cases, the distribution of a parameter is best described by presenting and modeling a low, medium and high level. Section 4 The SSRA does not address the variation of risk over time in either a quantitative or qualitative manner. The Updated SSRA provides an analysis of the risk over time. Section 8.3.2 The SSRA failed to provide an appropriate aggregated assessment of cumulative risk over the expected lifespan of the NBAF. The Updated SSRA defines and estimates cumulative risks. Section 8.3 The SSRA does not objectively define its conclusion that risk is \"low.\" The Updated SSRA provides an objective definition of the percentage and risk of release. Section 8.3 The SSRA fell short of considering the cumulative effect of all independent scenarios and estimating the overall (cumulative) risk of release that would result in infection with pathogens that will be handled in the NBAF. The Updated SSRA defines and estimates cumulative risks relative to a pathogen release. Section 8.3 The SSRA shows an accidental FMDv fomite release leading to an infection recurring every 77 years costing a mean of $32 billion. The committee notes that the numbers are probably conservative estimates because the SSRA overlooked other factors that would elevate risk. The figure cited from the SSRA is stated as being conservative--but in the opposite sense. The Updated SSRA provides clarification of the methods and procedures used to determine the risk of release. Section 8 NAS SSRA Findings 5 of 27 National Academy of Sciences Findings Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference The enhanced tornado data analysis failed to include the area-intensity relationship and failed to assess the probability that a point would experience tornado wind intensity. The Updated SSRA clarifies the methods and procedures used to determine the tornado wind intensity. The Updated SSRA uses the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) method for estimating wind speeds from tornadoes and high wind events for use in building damage estimation. The PNNL model has been adopted for use in the Updated SSRA. This model is used to determine strike probabilities based on dimensions of the facility and provides associated wind speed data. Section 4 The SSRA makes a poor assumption that the release would be minimal even if the facility were damaged and containment were lost. The Updated SSRA defines the assumptions regarding the pathogen release. Sections 4 and 5 It is not clear that SSRA SCIPUFF tests have been conducted to check for calculation errors. The Updated SSRA provides the calculations and supporting data for the modeling applied. Section 5.1 The SSRA does not provide information on the release and meteorological conditions that constitute a \"reasonable worst case.\" Thus the NRC cannot judge the validity of treating model uncertainty. The Updated SSRA provides the model uncertainties and supporting data. Section 5 The SSRA is unclear as to how the specific mitigation parameter values were determined, in part due to the inherent complexity of the NAADSM as well as the SSRA's focus on a more general analysis. The Updated SSRA provides the NAADSM parameters used and the supporting data that drove their use. The parameterization of mitigation measures (such as culling, vaccination and surveillance) for the Updated SSRA were based on resources available at the local and federal level as determined by interviews with local and federal stakeholders. Section 6 The SSRA lost realistic constraints on mitigation measures (supply, cost, efficiency) because of particular modeling decisions. Enhanced data collection efforts related to mitigation efforts are included in the Updated SSRA. The Updated SSRA attempts to quantify the cost of achieving enhanced mitigation levels. The SSRA's analysis was limited to parametric analysis. Section 6.3 The SSRA does not consider the logistical demands that culling would place on personnel and equipment. The Updated SSRA documents the basis for the culling rate(s) used. Culling rate calculations include the time needed to deploy and set up for depopulation, time to depopulate, and time to tear down the equipment. Section 6 The SSRA selects only seven states and should focus more on how FMD is being transmitted within and among states and/or Canada and Mexico. The Updated SSRA explains the reasons for limiting the focus of the study area. The Updated SSRA includes TX in the study region. Section 6 NAS SSRA Findings 6 of 27 National Academy of Sciences Findings Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference The SSRA's attempts to enhance the key weakness in the NADDSM inability to consider FMD transmission over longer distances did not reasonably and adequately account for interstate transmission. In collaboration with CEAH, the Updated SSRA team improved the evaluation of interstate transmission. The Updated SSRA used Certificate of Veterinary Inspection data to account for more interstate movement. Section 6 The SSRA does not provide contingency plans for auxiliary diagnostic support by other laboratories in the case of an outbreak that renders the NBAF inoperable. The Updated SSRA considers the need for future operating procedures for auxiliary diagnostic support in the case of an outbreak that renders the NBAF inoperable. Future needs planning related to diagnostic support would be included in emergency response plans. Cost/benefit analysis in the Updated SSRA begins to inform these plans. Sections 3, 9 and 10 The SSRA's economic modeling of the magnitude of livestock culls and the duration of outbreaks are underestimated The Updated SSRA documents the basis for the culling rate. The epidemiological outputs used as inputs for the economic assessment reflect the impacts of the new culling rate assumptions. Sections 6 and 7 Finding 7 The Committee agrees with the SSRA's conclusion that early detection and rapid response can limit the impact of an FMDv release from the NBAF, but is concerned that the SSRA does not describe how the NBAF could rapidly detect such a release. The risk assessment team is in full agreement with the NAS SSRA Committee's observation on the importance of early detection and rapid response. DHS has initiated efforts to develop or leverage technologies that will be beneficial for surveillance and response strategies. The Updated SSRA provides additional information on these concepts. Sections 3, 9 and 10 The SSRA observes that an outbreak's risk can be \"nearly completely mitigated\" by active surveillance, but does not discuss what implementation measure this would require. The Updated SSRA recommends what implementation measures are needed to provide adequate active surveillance. Section 6 The SSRA excluded certain groups and species that could fall outside of the scope of a passive monitoring system (\"backyard operations, feral swine, sheep herds). The rationale for exclusion of groups or species is discussed in the Updated SSRA. The Updated SSRA includes backyard operations and sheep and goat herds. Wild animals cannot be modeled with currently available tools. Section 6 The time to develop clinical signs and the time to detect and report clinical signs once they appear are considered, but location type specific observation rates are not adequately documented. Enhanced data collection efforts were applied to the Updated SSRA. Data supporting detection and reporting are provided. These data are based on interviews with producers and local veterinarians regarding current animal health practices and accounting for differences in the interaction of the livestock with personnel in the facility. Section 6 NAS SSRA Findings 7 of 27 National Academy of Sciences Findings Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference The SSRA assumption that \"self announcing\" leaks from the NBAF would result in rapid detection of cases is unrealistic due to the detection process. Additional evidence-based research is used to support or modify the assumptions regarding rapidity of detection. The SSRA did not assume that an outbreak would be detected, but that animal trade near the NBAF would cease if an obvious and catastrophic breach of containment occurred. The Updated SSRA makes these assumptions more clear. Section 6 The SSRA's assumption that a fomite \"walking out\" of the NBAF would remain in the Manhattan area ignores the reality of human travel and disease movement. Additional evidence-based research and expert advice was used to support or modify the assumptions regarding infection distribution. Data on the behaviors of research personnel in KS was used to determine likely probabilities of travel to various parts of the country. Section 5 Finding 8 The SSRA lacks a comprehensive mitigation strategy developed with stakeholder input for addressing major issues related to a pathogen release. The mitigation strategies that are provided do not realistically demonstrate current or foreseen capacity for how federal, state, and local authorities would effectively respond to and control a pathogen release. The 2010 SSRA and the Updated SSRA were not intended to provide the comprehensive mitigation strategies. DHS (and others) are developing such strategies and have made significant progress since the performance of the 2010 SSRA. Information and data were collected from USDA experts on federal response strategies and these data were used in the Updated SSRA. Section 6.3 Mercy Regional Health Center does not have the appropriate level of clinical isolation facilities, diagnostic laboratory capability, or world class infectious disease clinicians experienced in diagnosing and treating for exposure to BSL-4 pathogens. The Updated SSRA addresses specific means to increase the level of readiness for the regional healthcare providers in Manhattan, Kansas. Sections 3, 9 and 10 The SSRA states that the Manhattan, Kansas area does not have adequate resources or capabilities to undertake all the prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery activities necessary to develop and implement the emergency and contingency plans needed for the NBAF The Updated SSRA addresses specific deficits in risk planning and communication and provides an analysis of regional health and medical outlets that can respond to potential emergency situations. Section 3 There is no active national surveillance system for FMD. Currently there is not funding allocated to an active national surveillance plan for FMD. In the current passive observational surveillance system, the U.S. veterinary practitioners and producers notify State or Federal animal health officials of animals with disease signs that could be a suspect FAD. Section 3, 6 and 10 It would be essential to provide funding and validated tests to the National Animal Health Laboratory Network to conduct routine active surveillance for agents studied at NBAF. The Updated SSRA considers the analytical requirements for a surveillance system. Sections 3, 9 and 10 NAS SSRA Findings 8 of 27 National Academy of Sciences Findings Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference As the Manhattan, Kansas region serves as a hub of animal movement, a potential FMDv release would increase the likelihood of a widespread outbreak. Consequently, USDA may wish to implement an emergency vaccination policy. Emergency vaccination policy was discussed with USDA during the preparation of the Updated SSRA. The Updated SSRA considers vaccination as part of the mitigation measures modeled. Sections 6 and 7 Finding 9 The committee agrees with the SSRA's conclusion that human error will be the most likely cause of an accidental pathogen release, and fomite carriage is the most likely way that a pathogen would escape the facility's outer biocontainment and biosecurity envelope. Human error is a significant contribution to the potential for an accidental pathogen release. The Updated SSRA demonstrates that mitigation of fomites is an important consideration in the facility design and operational plans. Sections 3 and 10 SSRA timelines do not provide the level of and extent of training needed to reduce the possibility of an inadvertent release . The Updated SSRA informs an iterative risk management process that demonstrates how operating procedures, design and training mitigate the chances of a human error release. Section 3 The SSRA should be thorough and address the risk of transmission to cattle in the Manhattan, Kansas area due to the contamination of respiratory tracts of workers. The Updated SSRA provides a more thorough assessment of the human carrier risk. Several Events are considered that include the contamination of the respiratory tracts of humans and the effectiveness of personal respiratory protection on the amount of virus retained. Contact and behavior data are used in to model the interaction of respiratory-contaminated personnel in the Manhattan, Kansas area. Sections 4 and 5 The SSRA does not mention site-specific risks associated with staffing. The Updated SSRA provides a more thorough assessment of likely staff composition and training. Section 3 Finding 10 The committee agrees with the SSRA's conclusion that investment in biosafety and biosecurity engineering and the training of personnel and responders can reduce the risks, but is concerned about current design plans that potentially compromise safety measures. The 65% Design is fully compliant with the recommendations and guidelines in the most recent version (Fifth Edition) of Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) [USDHHS/CDCP, 2007]. Comprehensive design reviews have been conducted by an experienced team, including partners from international laboratories. Section 3 NBAF should comply with national guidelines developed to reduce the risk of escape of severe foreign animal pathogens. The Updated SSRA highlights the updates to design that reduce the escape of severe foreign animal pathogens. Section 10 The SSRA doesn't recognize that BSL-3Ag areas will generate much greater concentrations of pathogens than typical laboratory scale work due to the rate infected animals shed pathogens. The Updated SSRA more clearly reports its concerns with the greater concentrations of pathogens in the BSL-3Ag areas. An assessment of contribution sources and summary of empirical data from animal room aerosol measurements is made as the basis for the modeled source terms. Section 4.3 NAS SSRA Findings 9 of 27 National Academy of Sciences Findings Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference The committee is seriously concerned that the current NBAF design omits a parallel redundant bank of HEPA filters for BSL-3Ag and BLS-4 rooms. A more detailed discussion of the HEPA filtration design recommendations is provided in the Updated SSRA. Redundant series HEPA filtration has been incorporated. The redundancy scheme is described and modeled and reference to its compliance with BMBL is made. Sections 2 and 4 Finding 11 The SSRA's qualitative risk assessment of work with BSL-4 pathogens in large animals was inadequate. An updated assessment of risks associated with working in a BSL-4 environment with livestock was performed for the Updated SSRA. The conclusions and recommendations derived from this study are presented in the body of this report. Section 9 The committee does not concur with the SSRA's finding that its quantitative risk assessment regarding FMDv and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) sufficiently represents the range of risk regarding the other pathogens that will be studied at the NBAF, that is, the pathogens that are included in the qualitative risk assessment. The committee does not agree that the BSL-3 quantitative risk assessment adequately frames the risks associated with operating a BSL-4 large animal facility, because it is insufficient to use BSL - 3 pathogens to predict risks associated with BSL-4 pathogens that are zo onotic and for which no treatment is available. In collaboration with the NAS committee invited experts, the Performer defined the goals and objectives for the Large Animal BSL-4 Assessment contained in the Updated SSRA . Section 9 The RVF model is described in detail, however implementation remains opaque. Quantitative modeling of RVF is not required in the Updated SSRA due to a lack of validated models. NA NAS SSRA Findings 10 of 27 National Academy of Sciences Findings Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference The RVF model was created for this report and has not undergone peer review and independent validation. The Updated SSRA includes a Large Animal BSL-4 (ABSL-4) Assessment which relied on a panel of international containment subject matter experts (SMEs), members of the NBAF Design Partnership (NDP), and risk assessment professionals to develop and analyze a set of events that represent the state-of-the\u00adpractice risks associated with handling (infected) large animals within BSL-4 containment. This effort represents a significant change from the SSRA, which performed a purely qualitative assessment of the eight primary research pathogens to be studied at the NBAF. In the Updated SSRA, a comprehensive event-driven evaluation of ABSL-4 (NiV and HeV) risk was completed. This effort was informed and supported by the enhanced fidelity of BSL-4 design data from the 65% Design; additional detail on proposed NBAF BSL-4 containment practices; BSL-4 systems performance, including failure nodes and probabilities across all four release pathway associated systems; published data regarding the amount of NiV and HeV typically observed during ABSL-4 activities; prevalence and proximity of susceptible species/reservoir hosts surrounding the NBAF; and a historical review of NiV and HeV case studies to inform impact metrics integral to the estimation of the associated ABSL-4 risk. Section 9 NAS SSRA Findings 11 of 27 Scenario and Pathway Development and Review NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 1 Proper training, education, and monitoring of skills would reduce the risk of human error causing a release from the NBAF. Yet increasing the number of scientists, students, and postdoctoral scholars who have access to high- containment facilities would in all likelihood increase the risk of accidental spread of infectious agents via fomites, the primary identified risk in the SSRA. Pg 22 This comment is a valid observation. An increase in the number of individuals that are potentially involved in FMDv research may increase the likelihood of an accidental release. The mitigation measures that will be used at NBAF include advanced engineered systems and application of best practices gathered from years of FMDv containment experience around the world. The Updated SSRA models the anticipated number of researchers and mitigation techniques. It should also be considered that more research and researchers may provide solutions to eliminate or provide more effective control measures that will greatly reduce the impact of an FMDv containment loss. It is not productive to consider the increase in the number of researchers to represent only an enhanced risk--it may also result in an overall cumulative risk reduction. Sections 4.4 and 4.5 describe the modeled number of researchers per room type Section 4.2 describes the mitigation procedures for reducing the likelihood of a release Section 8 describes and presents the modeled risk calculations 2 The NBAF will venture into a new and unprecedented area of BSL laboratory operations with respect to its mainland location, scale of operations, and scope of agents. It would therefore be prudent not only to abide by the strongly recommended guidelines set forth in the most recent Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), but to also glean best practices and guidance from existing BSL-4 laboratories. Pg 66 DHS has fully embraced the BMBL and the current NBAF design is compliant with guidelines and requirements established by the BMBL and cognizant regulatory agencies. DHS has established cooperative relationships with numerous domestic and international laboratories to facilitate the exchange of best practices. DHS has also embraced the one-health concept--integrating best practices from animal research and human research. Section 3 3 The estimated spill rate is low for several reasons: (1) In some instances, a person responsible for the spill either would not report it or would be unaware of it. (2) The spill rate does not include the likelihood of spills from sample shipments or damage occurring during shipment. (3) The omission of anticipated virus spillage that would occur routinely as part of regular cleaning of large animal rooms. Pg 27 Non-reporting of spills and a lack of spill awareness are incorporated into the accident frequency estimates in the Updated SSRA. The Updated SSRA also includes an originating accident location that models events, such as shipment accidents, outside of containment. The regular animal room washdown contributions to the quantities of potentially released pathogen are modeled in the Updated SSRA as discussed below. Section 4.4 (source term development) and 4.5 (event frequency development) 4 The wash-down process would aerosolize virus deposited in the room from animal secretions and excretions, and would result in removal of massive amounts of virus through the air filtration system. Even with the use of disinfectants,1 the committee feels that those sources offer more frequent (daily) opportunities and possibly higher viral loading than the laboratory-scale spills that were evaluated in the SSRA. Pg 28 Twice-daily animal washdowns are modeled in the effluent contributions to the modeled virus loading to the aerosol pathway and the liquid effluent pathway. Sections 4.4 and Section 4.5 5 If only one room were used for FMD experiments, it would be the equivalent of experiencing 365 necessary and anticipated spills per year. Such a spill rate would raise the risk estimates by a factor of more than 140 from what is given in the SSRA (365/2.6 = 140). Pg 28 See above response. The suggested increase in risk estimates is modeled in the Updated SSRA. The factor of 140 is not usable input because it incorporates an assumption that FMDv research in the animal holding rooms is continuous. Sections 4.4 and Section 4.5 NAS Scenarios Review 12 of 27 Scenario and Pathway Development and Review NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 6 An important factor that was neglected in the SSRA is the distinction between real and simulated conditions for viral disinfection and natural viral decay. The hosing of waste materials (such as secretions and excretions) would create a protective bioburden matrix for virus particles, and their aerosolization would lead to a severe underestimation of the amount and duration of potentially infectious material generated. Pg 28 The potential of virus concentration enhancement by animal room washdown techniques is specifically addressed in the Updated SSRA. Data sources cited in the received comments are in reference to the concentration enhancement of virus in the surface of bubbles liberated by gas streams injected into a deep liquid matrix and do not seem to be applicable to the animal room washdowns. Section 4.4 7 The SSRA also did not address the effects of large amounts of aerosolized material (such as dust, dander, and other particles [such as fur, feed, vomit, cud, mucus, and hoof detritus]) on high-efficiency particle air (HEPA) filters in animal rooms and how it would affect filter performance over time. Pg 28 Empirical data indicate that the rough pre-filter mitigates detrimental affects on filter performance. Thirteen years of data from the Australian Animal Health Laboratory indicated that intake air HEPA filters are replaced more frequently than exhaust room filters and animal holding room filters with pre filters do not have a statistically significant difference in failure than other room exhaust filters. Sections 4.2 and 4.5 8 The SSRA did not adequately consider case histories in arriving at risk estimates of laboratory leaks, and information from the documented cases of FMD releases were not fully taken into account. Documented cases do not provide empirical data on all of the Events. There are a very limited number of relevant case histories with well-documented accident sequences. Case histories are reviewed in Section 3. Section 3 9 When DHS was asked about this at the public session of the committee's meeting, a somewhat confusing answer was provided: that the escape from Plum Island (Margasak, 2008) was irrelevant because livestock were being housed on the island, and this will not be the case for the NBAF, which will be in Manhattan, Kansas. Pg 28 Site-specific data on premises with susceptible species are included in the Updated SSRA. Sections 5.1 - 5.3 and 6.1 10 The committee believes that an assessment based on a plethora of information on case histories of escape of agents from laboratories would likely have provided a more realistic assessment of the case scenarios, likely frequencies, and confidence intervals of laboratory escapes projected for the NBAF. Pg 29 The modeled Updated SSRA events and initial conditions are developed from published data and elicitation of date from experienced professionals and subject matter experts. While there is much information available on FMDv accident causes, the limited number of incidents make it impractical to use only this information for a quantitative risk assessment. Moreover, the information available on such releases is antiquated and speculative. For example, the precise mode of initial index infection from the Pirbright incident is still not known., While it is known (with some certainty) that the virus was released from a wastewater connection, the fate and transport of the virus via a contaminated construction vehicle and the premises of the index location is speculative. Furthermore, the mechanism between the road (near the index premises) and the infected animal is not understood. It is not realistic or practical to attempt to perform a quantitative assessment on such incomplete data that is not necessarily applicable to the modern NBAF design and new operating protocols. Sections 4 and 9 NAS Scenarios Review 13 of 27 Scenario and Pathway Development and Review NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 11 The SSRA does not discuss or quantify uncertainties in the risk estimates. Pg 29 Uncertainties are incorporated, where available, in the Updated SSRA. Section 4.4 provides source term uncertainty development information. Sections 5, 6, and 7 address uncertainties in fate & transport, epidemiological modeling, and economic consequence assessments. Section 8 incorporates discussion and calculations on the propagation of uncertainties throughout the Updated SSRA. 12 While sensitivity analyses of several case model components were undertaken, the SSRA does not provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding the case event risk estimates (for example, in the form of confidence intervals) nor is there a qualitative discussion of the sources and magnitude of the uncertainties associated with these scenario risk estimates. Pg 29 Uncertainties are incorporated, where available, in the Updated SSRA. Section 4.4 provides source term uncertainty development information. Sections 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 address uncertainties in fate & transport, epidemiological modeling, and economic consequence assessments. Section 8.0 incorporates discussion and calculations on the propagation of uncertainties throughout the Updated SSRA. 13 The Tornado analysis failed to include the area-intensity relationship and failed to assess the probability that a point would experience tornado wind intensity. Pg 33 The Updated SSRA applies the PNNL tornado model that accounts for the footprint of the modeled area. (The SSRA included a detailed analysis on the probability and frequency of a point experiencing a tornado strike and a discussion on the rationale behind not incorporating the straight-line high winds of tornado magnitudes.) Section 4.5 14 The tornado scenario in the SSRA assesses the risk of a direct hit of the facility by a tornado of F3 or greater intensity, and it makes a poor assumption that the release would be minimal even if the facility were damaged and containment were lost. Pg 33 Such assumption is not made in the Updated SSRA. The amount of material released is dependent on the wind speed of the tornado, with complete release of the available material at a wind speed of 280 mph, and no material released at the designed wind speed which the NBAF can withstand at 228 mph. Section 4.6 15 The use of a tornado hazard model would provide a more accurate assessment that correlates tornadic wind speed with the annual probability of occurrence (or the mean return period) for Manhattan, Kansas. Pg 33 The PNNL tornado model is incorporated in the Updated SSRA. Sections 4.6 and 5.1 16 The results of the planned tornado hazard model to be pursued by DHS were not available for the committee's review, thus it is not possible to comment on its efficacy. Pg 33 The SSRA appendices included the custom tornado frequency model details. A5 (Appendix) NAS Scenarios Review 14 of 27 Scenario and Pathway Development and Review NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 17 For a highly contagious disease, such as FMD, the risk of infection corresponds to the collective dose to all the animals exposed to the puff of virus particles. Thus, the dose calculation requires summing the doses to all the animals exposed to the puff of virus particles. If enough animals are exposed, infection may be likely even if the doses are very small. Pg 34 These are now included in the Updated SSRA Section 6.1 18 Need to conduct sensitivity studies to examine the effects of uncertainty in meteorological variables and values of model parameters on predicted doses. Pg 35 Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the aerosol fate and transport. Section 5.1.10 19 SSRA does not provide information on the release and meteorological conditions that constitute a \"reasonable worst case\". Pg 36 Meteorological conditions are discussed and described in the Updated SSRA. Sections 5.1.1 - 5.1.8 20 It might have been appropriate to assimilate the Manhattan Regional Airport meteorological data into the database constructed by Rife et al. (2010), which has a relatively coarse resolution of 40 km. The appendix to the SSRA states that the Rife et al. database was constructed to \"recreate the observed characteristics of the Great Plains Nocturnal Low Level Jet\"; however, there are no references to support the SSRA's claim that the dataset was \"specifically developed and subsequently validated to support boundary layer aerosol transport and dispersion modeling applications\" (SSRA Appendix J: Aerosol Fate and Transport (Plume) Modeling). Pg 36 Meteorological conditions are discussed and described in the Updated SSRA. Section 5.1 21 The committee remains unsure about the following sanitation-driven air-quality engineering issues: How relatively large indoor bioaerosol loads\u2014in terms of mass, particle size distribution, and agent longevity\u2014would differ markedly from those in biosafety level 3-4 (BSL-3/BSL-4) facilities that do not house cohorts of large animals. How such bioaerosol loads are likely to affect the design and operations of the associated indoor air quality systems. Pg 52 Data from 13 years of animal holding experience with HEPA filtration systems and pre-filters at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory indicates that animal holding room exhaust air systems are less likely to fail than intake air HEPA filtration systems. Sections 4.2 and 4.5 22 The projected sanitary redundancies are in accordance with those of facilities that have similar charters, but need to be appropriately scaled for the projected NBAF loadings. Pg 52 The NPD Basis of Design incorporates scaling for NBAF loadings. This data is summarized in Section 2.0 and available to the Committee to review in the BOD and its supporting documentation. Section 2 23 The recent announcement of a wastewater treatment plant on the NBAF campus will need to be clearly justified and explained with respect to its service intents and mission over the design life of the NBAF. Pg 52 The need for the on-site pretreatment system is described, in detail, in the NBAF BOD and is summarized in Sections 2.0 and 4.2 of the Updated SSRA. Sections 2, 4.2, and 9.5 NAS Scenarios Review 15 of 27 Scenario and Pathway Development and Review NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 24 As the NBAF progresses through the design phase, it is important that a commitment be made to not \"value engineer\"1 out critical secondary containment systems in BSL-3Ag and BSL- 4 spaces that will house large animals. Pg 52 DHS has fully embraced the BMBL and the current design is compliant with guidelines and requirements established by the BMBL and cognizant regulatory agencies. It is believed this reference is related to the lack of complete redundancy (like all other containment facilities) that was originally incorporated in the NBAF design (15%). The current design meets or exceeds all recommendations and requirements for animal containment spaces. Sections 2, 4.2, and 9.5 25 At a minimum, NBAF should comply with national guidelines that were developed to reduce the risk of escape of severe foreign animal pathogens, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDv), that can result in catastrophic economic loss, and of potentially lethal zoonotic pathogens, such as Nipah and Hendra viruses, that have medium to high lethality and for which no vaccines or treatments are available. Pg 52 See above response. See above response 26 For BSL-3Ag spaces, the guidelines strongly recommend two HEPA filters installed in series and a parallel redundant bank of HEPA filters so that one or both of the HEPA filters in the primary bank can be replaced while the room is still operational (\"hot\") (CDC, 2009). Pg 53 See above response. The 65% design incorporates this design feature. See above response 27 The SSRA falls short of recognizing that BSL-3Ag areas will generate much greater concentrations of pathogens than typical laboratory-scale work because of the large animal component in BSL-3Ag areas: infected animals shed significant amounts of pathogens. Pg 53 Empirical data and contributions from animal respiration, excrement, and other sources (skin, hair, mucous, vomit, blood, etc.) are incorporated in the Updated SSRA source term calculations. Section 4.4 28 The SSRA does not discuss or describe the effects of additional residues\u2014such as animal hair and food residues\u2014that may also become aerosolized by the animals themselves or by cleaning processes, each of which may shorten the life span of the HEPA filters because of loading beyond normal operational limits. Pg 53 See above and response to comment 21. See above and response to comment 21 29 The committee is seriously concerned that the current NBAF design strategy omits a parallel redundant bank of HEPA filters for BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 animal rooms (see Figures 3-21 through 3-28 of the SSRA). Pg 53 See multiple responses related to this same comment. See above responses 30 The SSRA indicates that the most probable cause of accidental release will be human error. Human error can be reduced by rigorous hands-on training in laboratories that will have comparable biocontainment and biosecurity practices. However, SSRA timelines do not provide for that level and extent of training and could increase the probability of an inadvertent release or human exposure. Pg 54 Best practices will inform the NBAF SOPs. Section 3 NAS Scenarios Review 16 of 27 Scenario and Pathway Development and Review NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 31 As noted in the committee's preliminary letter report: \"it would be useful to consider the risks associated with the lack of respiratory protection for workers that come into contact with FMDv. It is a common recommendation that workers exposed to FMDv-infected animals not contact other susceptible animals for 5 days\u2014as a result of studies demonstrating recovery of virus from nasal passages (Sellers et al., 1970, 1971)\u2014to reduce the risk of respiratory transmission. While the committee is not aware of literature showing this as an important route of transmission, the SSRA should be thorough and also address the risk of transmission to cattle in the Manhattan, Kansas area due to the contamination of respiratory tracts of workers.\" The SSRA did not address those issues. Pg 55 DHS has determined that respiratory protection will be required when laboratory workers will be exposed to respiratory aerosols from infected animals. A discussion of the efficacy of respiratory protection (N95) is provided in Section 4.2 and the failure of (failure to use) respiratory protection is modeled in the Updated SSRA. Sections 4.2 and 5.4 32 Whereas the SSRA estimates roughly 300 staff members in the NBAF, it does not mention site-specific risks associated with staffing. Pg 55 Original data collection on the contact behaviors of potential NBAF workers is presented in Section 5.4. Section 5.4 33 Because the SSRA did not account for important uncertainties and risk factors as discussed below, the SSRA could well have underestimated the risk of pathogen release and transmission and its consequences. In many scenarios considered, the numbers probably represent conservative estimates of risk. Pg 59 See above responses. See above responses 34 The SSRA failed to account for other site-specific factors, including: The movement of personnel between KSU facilities, the Biosecurity Research Institute, and the NBAF, which increases risks related to fomites and respiratory transfers. Pg 59 See response to Comment 32. See response to Comment 32. 35 The SSRA neglected to consider is the maintenance and cleaning of BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 large animal pens. Pg 59 See above responses. See above responses 36 Large animal pens are normally washed daily, and this would likely result in substantial aerosol formation of BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 pathogens in addition to fomites. Pg 59 See above responses. See above responses 37 The daily cleaning of animal pens as a potential pathway of pathogen release would result in aerosol emissions much greater than were assumed in the aerosol scenario in the SSRA and would place greater strain on the HEPA filters and air handling system than noted in the SSRA. Pg 59 See above responses. See above responses 38 The cleaning scenario is likely to lead to significantly increased risks of infection through fomites and airborne pathways. Pg 59 See above responses. See above responses NAS Scenarios Review 17 of 27 Scenario and Pathway Development and Review NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 39 The execution of the SCIPUFF model to estimate risk of infection associated with exposure to airborne virus was not based on approaches described in the literature (see Cannon and Garner, 1999; Schley et al., 2009), but instead was based on an arbitrary threshold dose of 0.1 plaque forming unit for infection, which leads to uncertainties in the estimation of risk. Pg 60 A range of thresholds are presented in the Updated SSRA. Section 6.1 40 The omission of the animal pen cleaning leads to a major underestimation of the magnitude of aerosol release. Pg 60 See above responses. See above responses 41 The SSRA used a tornado risk assessment that is sensitive to user bias. The use of a tornado hazard model would have eliminated the need for user judgment, and would more appropriately provide information about the design basis wind speed and building envelope design. Pg 60 The Updated SSRA incorporates the use of the PNNL tornado model. Section 4.6 and Section 5.1 NAS Scenarios Review 18 of 27 Epidemiological Modeling NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 1 One overlooked characteristic that would contribute to risk is the NBAF's proximity to KSU's College of Veterinary Medicine. If an agent were released from the NBAF, those animals could readily become infected and serve as a conduit for amplification and transport. Pg 22 All locations near the NBAF with susceptible species were included in the model for the Updated SSRA. A6.2.4 (Appendix) 2 The SSRA states that the Manhattan, Kansas, area does not have adequate resources or capabilities to undertake all the prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery activities necessary to develop and implement the emergency and contingency plans needed for the NBAF. Pg 23 Resources to implement mitigation measures were explicitly considered in the Updated SSRA Section 6.3 3 Although many high-containment laboratories are located in highly-populated areas, the SSRA failed to adequately account for such populations and the large animal aspects of the NBAF's work in its risk analysis. Pg 21 All locations nearby the NBAF with susceptible species were included in the FMD model. The proximity of susceptible species near the NBAF as well as the unique risks associated with handling large animals within containment was also considered in the Updated SSRA ABSL-4 assessment. Sections 6.1.3, 6.1.4 and Section 9 (throughout) 4 There is no active national surveillance system for FMD detection. Pg 24 We agree, insinuation removed n/a 5 To fulfill the SSRA's recommendation of enhancing local diagnostic capability to support regional surveillance and traceback capability, it will be essential to provide funding and validated tests to enable the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) at a minimum to conduct routine active surveillance for the agents under investigation in the NBAF. Pg 24 The Updated SSRA can make recommendations as to which additional pathogens should undergo routine surveillance; however, the risk assessment can not assure funding to do so. Surveillance and diagnostic plans would be part of overall emergency response planning by DHS and USDA. Section 9.10 6 For an active FMD surveillance system to become fully operational, the NAHLN will need to expand its repertoire of testing and will need diagnostic surge capacity for those agents in the event of an outbreak. Pg 24 We do not mention active FMD surveillance in the Updated SSRA. n/a 7 If USDA implements vaccination policy as a result of an outbreak adequate supplies and distribution policy will need to be in effect and agreed to nationally. Pg. 24 Vaccination is only modeled notionally because of shortcomings of NAADSM and issues like limited supply of vaccine are not considered in this iteration of the risk assessment. A6.2.18 (Appendix0, A6.2.21 (Appendix), Sections 7 and 10.2 8 The SSRA is unclear as to how the specific mitigation parameter values were determined. Pg 37 These are now included in the Updated SSRA Section 6.1.4 9 The quantitative epidemiological study in the SSRA does not connect the general mitigation rates to the logistics of specific mitigation practices in a site-specific manner. Pg 37 These are now included in the Updated SSRA Section 6.1.4 10 The report observes that an outbreak's risk can be \"nearly completely mitigated\" by active surveillance (page 225), but it does not discuss what implementation measures this would require. Pg 37 Active surveillance is not discussed in the Updated SSRA. Interviews suggest it is impractical. n/a NAS Epidemiological Review 19 of 27 Epidemiological Modeling NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 11 When an index case initiates an epidemic, modest transmission between locations is usually sufficient for final epidemic sizes to be independent of index- case location, particularly with respect to FMD. That suggests that the cumulative distribution in Figure 4-20 of the SSRA may be an artifact of specific model assumptions placed on contact patterns and mitigation. pg 38 The outbreak starting location determines the extent to which the outbreak spreads to other premises before detection or, indeed, if the outbreak starts at all. Section 6.2 12 The committee is concerned about the exclusion of specific species or management-type groups, such as \"backyard\" operations, sheep herds, and feral swine (the committee recommended inclusion of the latter in its preliminary letter report, see Appendix B). pg 38 These are now included in the Updated SSRA. Section 6.1.4 13 Feral swine would be important to consider in that they would probably become infected and be outside the passive surveillance system. Pg 38 Wildlife species are not explicitly modeled in the Updated SSRA but are discussed. Section 6.1.6 14 Failure of the model to include the other 41 of the 48 states as well as incursions in and out of Canada and Mexico would clearly be manifested as unrealistically low estimates of the overall impact of FMD in the United States. Pg 39 The full US cannot currently be modeled. A future iteration could include the development of a higher-level, full North American model. Section 6.1.2 15 While adding sales barns to the NAADSM is an improvement because it takes some interstate animal movement into account, sales barns are not the sole source of long-distance animal movement rates (USDA-ERS, 2003), and therefore the SSRA underestimates the long-distance transport of animals and equipment and in doing so also underestimates the rate and extent of FMD spread. Pg 39 The method to estimate long-distance movement has been substantially revised in the Updated SSRA. Section 6.1.5 16 Both the time to develop clinical signs (lesions) and the time to detect (and report) clinical signs once they appear were considered in the model (pages 179 and 219 of the SSRA), but location-type-specific observation rates were not adequately documented. Pg 40 All parameters are documented in the main text. Section 6.1.4 17 The SSRA does not provide contingency plans for auxiliary diagnostic support by other laboratories (such as state laboratories and the Winnipeg and Pirbright laboratories); such diagnostic contingency plans are critical for NBAF operations and should have been included in the SSRA. Pg 41 Diagnostic capacity was discussed with USDA representatives. Key concepts and considerations from these conversations are incorporated into the Updated SSRA. Surveillance and diagnostic plans would be part of overall emergency response planning by DHS and USDA. Sections 3, 6, 9 and 10 18 The NAADSM uses a sensitivity value of 1.0 (1.0 being perfect accuracy) in identifying FMD-affected premises and assumes that the clinical diagnostic processes involved in contact tracing would be reliable and accurate. However, the 2001 UK epidemic demonstrated that sensitivity is not perfect and that it may be around 0.947 (McLaws et al., 2007). On the basis of that estimate, clinical monitoring and declaration could miss about 5.3% of infected herds. Pg 41 The Updated SSRA now considers disease control to be highly imperfect (direct movement is only reduced to 20% of pre-event values) which reflects this and other real world shortcomings. Section 6.1.4 NAS Epidemiological Review 20 of 27 Epidemiological Modeling NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 19 Because a percentage of infected herds would be missed in a real outbreak, the model has underestimated the number of cases and the duration of the epidemic. Pg 42 See above. Section 6.1.4 20 The assumption that the first case of FMD resulting from fomite escape from the NBAF would appear only in the Manhattan area (pages 168-169) ignores the reality of human travel and disease movement. Pg 42 Agreed. Transference is modeled to possibly start an infection in any part of KS. Section 6.1.3 21 The SSRA failed to account for other site-specific factors, including: The location of the KSU College of Veterinary Medicine clinics adjacent to the NBAF, where large numbers of sick and susceptible animals are treated and where there are large numbers of transient animal patients. Pg 59 The Updated SSRA included all these locations. However, the health status of the animals was not modeled due to lack of data. It is possible that animals already sick may be more or less susceptible to FMD . A6.2.4 (Appendix) 22 The SSRA failed to account for other site-specific factors, including: The location of the Kansas State University (KSU) football stadium in close proximity to the NBAF, which presents a large human population that potentially could be periodically exposed to a released zoonotic pathogen and that potentially could transport a released pathogen outside of the area. Pg 59 Zoonotic diseases, Nipah, Hendra and emerging pathogens were considered within the Updated SSRA ABSL-4 Assessment, and that analysis accounts for factors such as proximity of susceptible species - animals and humans-around the NBAF. The previous SSRA did clearly document and consider proximity of dense human populations around the NBAF - including the K-State campus in it's analysis of RVFv. Given the relative infrequent occupancy of the K-State stadium compared to the daily occupancy of the K-State campus at large - the impact of a periodic increase at a single location (stadium) was considered within uncertainty of the modeling. Section 9.9 NAS Epidemiological Review 21 of 27 Epidemiological Modeling NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 23 Many uncertainties of the epidemiological modeling of FMD transmission were inadequately considered so the sensitivity analyses were insufficient and many scenarios were probably overoptimistic. Some parameter values and assumptions used in the North American Animal Disease Spread Model (NAADSM) were inconsistent with what is known about epidemiological and veterinary aspects of and experience with FMD. Pg 60 1. The scope of spread was limited to seven states by the exclusive use of sales barns as the sources of animal movement. The scope was also limited only to cattle and swine and did not include infection of feral swine, deer, and small ruminants. 2. The extent of spread did not address the critical elements of animal movement within and among states. The transportation modeling methods considered animal movement only in an indirect and superficial manner and excluded movement within and among states (as well as incursions in and out of Canada and Mexico) by individual producers and neighbors, therefore underestimating the spread. 3. The response did not provide realistic assumptions regarding mitigation values of input parameters, and the values inflated prospects of surveillance, diagnosis, available manpower, depopulation rate, and movement bans (direct and indirect). Mitigation strategies did not mention how and where FMDv diagnostics, research activities, and matching of vaccine to outbreak strain might be conducted if the NBAF had to shut down or curtail some activities because of a pathogen escape or physical damage to the facility. Interstate movement is modeled completely differently in the Updated SSRA than the SSRA. Resources for culling are explicitly described and are the basis of the baseline and enhanced measures. (1) Section 6.1.2, (2) Section 6.1.5, and (3) Section 6.1.4 24 Restricting epidemiological modeling to its effect on seven states that have large livestock populations would mean that inferences about the other 41 contiguous states (with Alaska and Hawaii excluded) cannot be drawn, so external validity would be lacking. Pg 61 See response to comment 14 above. Section 6.1.2 25 On the basis of the information provided, the committee could not determine the input parameters used for the NAADSM and could not independently validate the results. As a result of the assumptions and methodological flaws, the committee concludes that the epidemiological results of the SSRA deflate the duration and magnitude estimates of a possible FMD epidemic. Pg 61 The Updated SSRA includes an explanation of all parameters used in the main body of the report and in Appendix 6. Sections 6.1.4 and A6.4 (Appendix) NAS Epidemiological Review 22 of 27 Epidemiological Modeling NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 26 Without data relative to the potential role of wildlife in the spread of FMD, there is not way to fill in the gaps and improve precision beyond the scope of opinion. Pg 61 Wildlife cannot be included a quantitative FMD model currently. They are considered qualitatively. Incorporation of wildlife into a model of FMD could be a future risk assessment activity. Supporting information is included in the appendix. Sections 6.1.4 and 6.1.6 27 Although there is a lack of data regarding the role of wildlife in the role of FMD spread as it regards to the use of the NAADMS, viral outbreaks in other countries (Taiwan, UK, etc) can provide valuable lessons in understanding realistic expectations for mitigation measures and disaster preparation plans. Pg 62 Wildlife is discussed qualitatively. Using data from outbreaks in other countries with MUCH smaller and more contained wildlife populations is problematic. Sections 6.1.4 and 6.1.6 28 The epidemiological modeling assumptions that were used in the economic assessment, such as depopulation rates and outbreak duration, were overoptimistic in their estimates. The committee does not think that infected herds could be detected and culled at the rate of 120-720 herds per day. Pg 62 Culling rate now includes mobilization and demobilization times and is based off a herd size of larger than median. Also, estimates for the number of culling teams that a state could field was obtained (instead of head-per-day estimates). Section 6.1.4 29 To implement appropriate FMD surveillance and response, it would be necessary for a number of things to occur that were not described in the SSRA, including: 1. Development and testing of adequate real-time diagnostic capabilities for FMDv. 2. Development of real-time global full-length genomic surveillance for FMDv. 3. Development of a real-time active surveillance system1 for FMDv in the United States. 4. Development and testing (through modeling) methods and scenarios for surveillance, control, eradication, vaccination, and mitigation of FMD in the United States. Pg 62 Agree. A full FMD prevention plan and response plan needs many of these components. However, a risk assessment is not an appropriate place to address these issues. None 30 Make sure to point out that networks are not captured with NAADSM as a NAADSM weakness Agree Section 6.1.5 31 When discussing results, discuss if our model shows controllable vs. out of control outbreaks one panel member mostly cares about that All results are shown for duration (chance that the outbreak lasts more than 100 days or more than a year) and chance that they spread to other states. Also, giving more than the median percentile outcome from NAADSM also gives an idea of that. To do more than this, one would have to define what \"out of control\" means. Section 6.2 32 As the Manhattan, Kansas region serves as a hub of animal movement, a potential FMDv release would increase the likelihood of a widespread outbreak. Consequently, USDA may wish to implement an emergency vaccination policy. Animal movement to other states is explicitly modeled and uses data for the counties around the NBAF and KS as a whole. Vaccination policy is an on-going discussion with USDA with or without NBAF. Section 6.1.4 33 Did you consider changing the time to vaccine protection to partially account for the fact that larger premises require more time to vaccinate. Yes. Discussion is included. Section 6.1.4 NAS Epidemiological Review 23 of 27 Epidemiological Modeling NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 34 The SSRA lost realistic constraints on mitigation measures (supply, cost, efficiency) because of particular modeling decisions. The SSRA was a parametric analysis to determine break-points in the benefit. The Updated SSRA continues the parametric analysis but underpins it with the resources necessary to achieve particular mitigation strategies. Section 6.1.4 35 The SSRA does not consider the logistical demands that culling would place on personnel and equipment. The Updated SSRA does this explicitly both for the baseline estimate and the enhancements. Section 6.1.4 1 econ The SSRA is unclear as to how the specific mitigation parameter values were determined, in part because of the inherent complexity of the NAADSM (Schoenbaum and Disney, 2003; Harvey et al., 2007) but also in part because of the SSRA's focus on a more general analysis. Pg 45 These are now included in the Updated SSRA Section 6.1 NAS Epidemiological Review 24 of 27 Economic Assessment NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 1 The SSRA is unclear as to how the specific mitigation parameter values were determined, in part because of the inherent complexity of the NAADSM (Schoenbaum and Disney, 2003; Harvey et al., 2007) but also in part because of the SSRA's focus on a more general analysis. Pg 45 The mitigation parameter values for the Updated SSRA have been supplemented by an extensive and unprecedented data collection effort to bring clarity and regionally relevant specificity to the NAADSM modeling applied to the Updated SSRA. Section 6.1 and A6 (Appendix) 2 The SSRA description of how the regional analysis is conducted is shock introduced into the regional input-output is not reported. The total dollar regional impact of each scenario is reported, but results for individual economic activities that would help to confirm the quality of the analysis are not reported. Pg. 46 Agree. A more detailed output would assist in the review of the data generated. Please refer to the updated data presentation throughout Section 7 which includes additional economic detail (p5, p50, p95 for all outputs modeled) as compared to data presentation in the SSRA. Please see tables, figures and exhibits throughout Section 7 3 The SSRA recognizes the problems inherent in WTP estimates and describes steps undertaken to mitigate them. Comparisons with similar values from research on diseases other than RVF are used to validate the results. Because the values are unknown, it is difficult to determine the success of the efforts beyond noting that the proper methods were applied. Pg 46 RVF modeling was not included in the Updated SSRA analyses. These discussions have been removed from Section 7. Not applicable to the Updated SSRA NAS Economic Review 25 of 27 SQRA Review NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 1 Mercy Regional Health Center does not have the appropriate level of clinical isolation facilities, diagnostic laboratory capability, or world-class infectious disease clinicians experienced in diagnosing and treating for exposure to BSL-4 pathogens. Pg 23 Section 3 (Best Practices) of the Updated SSRA discusses the capabilities of the Mercy Regional Health Center. One recommendation from the Updated SSRA ABSL-4 Assessment includes the elements of medical response that should be established near the NBAF (and likely at Mercy Regional Health Center or the equivalent on-site medical facility) prior to ABSL-4 activities at the NBAF. Sections 3 and 9.10 2 Passive surveillance methods in which veterinarians report suspected \"vesicular diseases would not be applicable to zoonotic pathogens that would be in the NBAF Pg 24 Agreed, alternative methods would be needed to identify/survey for Nipah and Hendra infections, and some may not even be effective given that animals can experience viremia with subtle to no observable symptoms. Training of healthcare personnel and veterinarians for disease detection is discussed in the Updated SSRA. Section 9.10 3 The Rift Valley Fever study was not validated and the section was greatly maligned. The updated SSRA will need to provide guidance how zoonotic threats are studied in the new assessment. The Updated SSRA includes an assessment of the specific ABSL-4 pathogens to be researched at the NBAF, Nipah and Hendra virus, including documentation of the specific methods and assumptions used in the assessment. The Rift Valley Fever model was not used in this assessment with the minor exception that one input parameter (value of a human life) that was informed by a survey performed during the SSRA was referenced in the Updated SSRA ABSL-4 Assessment. Section 9 4 Finding 11: The SSRA's qualitative risk assessment of work with BSL-4 pathogens in large animals was inadequate. The Updated SSRA includes an in-depth assessment of the risks involved in handling Nipah and Hendra within ABSL-4 containment. While the previous SSRA qualitatively discussed the risks involved with all of the 8 pathogens to be studied at the NBAF, this Updated SSRA focused specifically on the risks inherent with handling Nipah or Hendra infected large animals in ABSL-4 containment . Where-ever available, published data and containment facility SMEs were used to quantify the event assessment. Section 9; specifically discussed in 9.1. 5 The qualitative risk assessment was inadequate because it failed to fully consider the characteristics of the pathogens and the risks of working with BSL-4 pathogens in large animal facilities. Pg 66 The Updated SSRA includes an in-depth assessment of the risks involved in handling Nipah and Hendra within ABSL-4 containment. While the previous SSRA qualitatively discussed the risks involved with all of the 8 pathogens to be studied at the NBAF, this Updated SSRA focused specifically on the risks inherent with handling Nipah or Hendra infected large animals in ABSL-4 containment . Where-ever available, published data and containment facility SMEs were used to present the pathogen characteristics and quantify the risks for Nipah and Hendra. Section 9 throughout; with pathogen data in 9.5, outbreak considerations in 9.9, and risks in 9.10. 6 The committee does not concur with the SSRA's finding that its quantitative risk assessment regarding FMDv and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) sufficiently represents the range of risk regarding the other pathogens that will be studied at the NBAF. Pg 66 A specific evaluation of the risks involved in handling Nipah and Hendra virus within ABSL-4 containment was performed to address this finding. Section 9 NAS SQRA Review 26 of 27 SQRA Review NAS Letter Report Criticisms by Updated SSRA Section Updated SSRA Response /Actions Relevant Updated SSRA Section Reference 7 There is a need to develop strong working relationships with the CDC, USAMRIID, USDA, and National Institutes of Health to understand how the NBAF can work safely with dangerous zoonotic pathogens in large animals. Pg 66 In preparation of the Updated SSRA ABSL-4 Assessment, DHS has began the close and interactive partnership of international containment facility experts who have informed and will continue to inform the operations at the NBAF regarding handling large animal in ABSL-4 containment. The experts and their associated affiliations are presented in the Updated SSRA. Section 9.2 NAS SQRA Review 27 of 27 Appendix A3: Draft Plan for Preparing the NBAF Emergency Response Plan (ERP) 1. Scope of the Effort The Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate (through the Office of National Laboratories) has the primary responsibility to develop the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) emergency response plan (ERP) covering preparedness, response and recovery. The NBAF ERP will follow components in the National Incident Management System (NIMS; http://www.fema.gov/emergency/nims/). The NBAF ERP will provide guidance and direction to assure an integrated and coordinated response to emergency situations (e.g., an accidental or intentional release of foot-and-mouth disease virus or other hazardous pathogen from the facility, hazardous chemical spill, weather-related event, etc.). It will support/define the response efforts both horizontally across the Federal Government and vertically among Federal, State, and local entities. In addition the ERP will address NB!F's response to emergencies and other incidents occurring at nearby facilities (e.g., Kansas State University, Biosecurity Research Institute) or within the local community that could impact the operations and/or security at NBAF. The ERP will build upon the documents prepared, or to be prepared, in support of the NBAF si te selection and the pre-construction/construction of the actual facility. The ERP will be developed and implemented prior to beginning operations of the NBAF. 2. Organizations who will be Engaged in the ERP Development The NBAF ERP will be the responsibility of the ONL Operations and Oversight Group working with appropriate NBAF staff (e.g., Laboratory Director, Operations Director, and Responsible Official [RO] for biological select agent and toxins [BSTA]). ONL will reach out for support/expertise in developing the ERP to other organizations such as: S&T ChemBio Division and S&T Laboratories (PIADC and NBACC) Other DHS Components (e.g., Office of Security, Office of Health Affairs, and Federal Emergency Management Agency) U.S. Army Garrison, USAMRIID, and other National Interagency Biodefense Campus (NIBC) partners at Ft. Detrick U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service- Veterinary Services (APHIS -VS) and Agricultural Research Service (ARS) at HQ and field operations/laboratories State of Kansas (e.g., KS Emergency Management Director, State of KS Division of Emergency Management, KS State Veterinarian, KS Public Health Director, KS Homeland Security, KS Homeland Security Advisor, KS USDA, and KS Secretary of Agriculture) Bios ecurity Research Institute (BRI) personnel Kansas State University (e.g., Director, Environmental Health and Safety; Public Safety; Emergency Management Coordinator, and KSU Police Chief) A3-1 City of Manhattan, KS Riley County, Pottawatomie County Ft. Riley (Police Department, EMS, etc.) FBI ( Manhattan, KS office), KS Bureau of Investigation (Intelligence Fusion Center), KS Threat Integration Center KS Highway Patrol Mercy Regional Health Center, University of Kansas Hospital Medical Center 3. NBAF ERP 3.1 ERP Table of Contents (Appendix A shows more detail for topics to be included in the ERP) Overview (scope and purpose) Preparation and Mitigation (e.g., annual update of plans, staff education, new employee orientation and refresher classes, systems and resources to minimize a potential release of infectious agents or hazardous materials, emergency exercises and drills, evacuation instructions for evacuation, fitness for duty, how employees will be vaccinated or prophylaxed before or during an event, emergency supplies [clothing, footwear, respiratory protection], employee identification badges, mutual aid agreements, emergency communication system, regional hospital disaster planning, emergency weather preparations, risk vulnerability assessment with mitigation strategies, establishment of a site Emergency Operations Center, etc. ) Response (e.g., response to internal or external emergency; Incident Management System to manage emergency conditions in cooperation with external public service agencies; evacuation plans; reporting an emergency incident; communication via media including discontinuation of emergency operations and return to normal operations; implement mitigation strategies [including establishing effective area quarantine, animal movement controls, surveillance and response zones if necessary], etc.) Recovery (e.g., damage assessment of building spaces, equipment and personnel impacts and repairs; documenting emergency outcomes; debriefing the incident; NBAF business continuity; etc.) Acronyms and Glossary of Technical Terms Appendices 3.2 Events to be Covered in the ERP The emergency response plan for NBAF will incorporate the breath of activities that may be encountered at such a facility including animal health, human (public) health, security, and environmental issues. The emergency response plans will include, but not be limited to, clearly indentifying and articulating the procedures for the following: Emergency notification Medical emergency Evacuation of buildings and/or site (including those with disability) Fire Tornado, earthquake, or flood Criminal or violent behavior including demonstration/civil disturbance, bomb threat, etc. Hazardous materials release (e.g., biological select agents and toxins, pathogens other than BSAT, flammable/ combustible gases in labs and storage areas, radioactive material, oil spill or leak) including shipments to the NBAF Utility failure Building system failure (e.g., response actions to discharge scenarios such as ventilation A3-2 problem resulting in loss of negative pressure in containment spaces, effluent waste discharge problem, natural gas leak, breaches of primary biocontainment) The ERP will address an emergency at facilities in proximity to the NBAF (e.g., K-State TRIGA Mark II research reactor used to train nuclear reactor operators) that might affect NBAF operations. 3.3 NBAF Operational Plans The ERP will be integrated with the appropriate NBAF operational plans including, but not limited to: Incident Response Plan (IRP) for biological select agents and toxins (BSAT) per 73.14, 7 CFR 331.14 and 9 CFR 121.14 (including plans for theft, loss or release of BSAT in compliance with Federal statutes; accidental releases or occupational exposures will b e immediately reported to APHIS Agricultural Select Agent Program via Form 3; BSAT-exposed animals will be handled in the same manner as the agent or toxin itself for the purpose of reporting a BSAT theft, loss or release to appropriate Federal, state and local agencies). The IRP will address pathogens other BSAT. Biological Safety Plan Biosecurity Incident Response Plan for Non-Biological Incident Occupant Emergency Plan for the laboratory/animal room sections and for administrative sections of the NBAF Security Plan (facility, physical, policies for personnel, data and cyber) Emergency Preparedness (drills, training and documentation, securing building contents, building evacuation diagram and plan) Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan 3.4 Supporting Agreements for the Plan Effective implementation of the NB!F ERP will require MOU's or formal agreements with local, state, and Federal authorities (and others as necessary) for mutual aid and sharing/ utilization of resources (personnel, equipment, and facilities). In order to assure effective emergency management operations, there exists the need to coordinate activities of government agencies or other entities which provide mutual aid and have their own incident response plans. Per the NIMS model, protocols must be in place to designate the overarching authority to manage and coordinate structure and concurrent implementation processes consistent with their responsibilities. These may include: Kansas State University (KSU) KSU's Biosecurity Research Institute (BRI) City of Manhattan, KS Riley County Ft. Riley (Chemical unit, Bomb Unit, Irwin Army Community Hospital, possibly setting up special immunization program [SIP] with new hospital being built, etc.) Hospital/Facility emergency plan at local and regional hospitals (e.g., Mercy Regional Health Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital at Ft. Riley, and University of Kansas Medical School) State of Kansas o Kansas Secretary of Agriculture o Kansas Director of Emergency Management and Homeland Security o Kansas State Veterinarian - Kansas Animal Health Department A3-3 o Kansas State Fire Marshall 3.5 Implementation of the Plan (Training, Drills, and Reviews) Effective implementation of the NBAF ERP will also include on-going training, coordination, and drills for preparing for actual events. Potential FMDV scenario-based workshops, meetings exercises and/or drills for assessment and finalization of the Plan (may also include other BSAT) including: Emergency FMD vaccination strategy exercise (scenario-based discussion) FMD standstill exercise (scenario-based discussion) Functional FMD exercise (rapid response team from local and state level simulation of a hypothetical FMD outbreak) to include mitigation strategies (e.g., may include establishing an area quarantine, animal movement controls, and response zones; may involve diagnostics, surveillance, depopulation/ disposal, cleaning/disinfection; spraying for infected insect release) FMD communications strategy (information management) workshop Resourcing workshop Sectional coordination workshop (KS local and regional counties) Incident Command training and workshops Veterinary investigations, restricted area movement and security, infected premises operations workshop Directors, operations managers, etc. meetings 4.

During this same period, within approximately 120 nautical miles of Manhattan, Kansas, there were about 42 tornados per year, and as recently as June 11th, 2008 a tornado hit the Kansas State University campus in Manhattan. For the original NBAF SSRA [DHS, 2010], a tornado frequency analysis (Table 1) was performed to estimate the mean return periods for tornados of a given intensity (Table 2) or higher, based on the original Fujita Scale (F-Scale), for a 9\u00b0 by 7\u00b0 region encompassing the NBAF site (Figure 1). Tornado tracks for all of the confirmed tornados from 1950-2010 are shown: F/EF0-F/EF1 (Black), F/EF2-F/EF3 (Blue), and F/EF4-F/EF5 (Red). The proposed NBAF location is denoted by the red dot in north-eastern Kansas on this figure. The SSRA analysis used tornado records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Prediction Center (SPC) available online at www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/ covering the period from 1 January 1950 to 31 December 20 09. These data were adjusted using the spatial bias correction technique of Ray, Bieringer, et al. [2003]. A5-1 Figure 1 : 9\u00b0 by 7\u00b0 Region From Which the Tornado Climatological Statistics Were Determined for the 2010 SSRA For the NBAF Updated SSRA, the analysis results have been updated and refined by leveraging methods developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and described by Ramsdell and Rishel [2007] to a) include recent tornado events recorded since the original SSRA, b) account for the conversion from the Fujita (F-Scale) to the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale) classification system (Table 3), c) account for the size of the NBAF facility when determining the probability of a tornado strike, d ) account for the documented variation of wind speeds across the tornado damage area when determining the probability of exceeding a specified wind speed at the NBAF, and e) use these A5-2 - - Tab le 3: Enh anced F ujita Damage Cla ssifica tion Scale (EF Scale 3-Second Gust Description EF0 65-85 mph damage EF1 86-110 mph 111-135 136-165 166-200 mph Severe damage EF5 >200 mph Devastating damag e probabilities to develop probabilities of exceedance curves for a continuous range of wind speeds. D etails of this methodology and associated results are summarized below. 2.0 Methodology Choice of Tornado Hazard Analysis Methodology In April of 2011, the American Nuclear Society published a revision to ANSI/ANS 2.3- 1983, \"Standard for Estimating Tornado and Extreme Wind Characteristics at Nuclear Power Sites\", expanding its scope to include hurricanes, replacing the original Fujita Tornado Damage Scale (F-Scale) with the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-scale), and expanding its applicability to all nuclear facility sites [American Nuclear Society, 2011]. Within this revised standard, \"Estimating Tornado, Hurricane, and Extreme Straight Line Wind Characteristics at Nucle ar Facility Sites\", two methodologies for estimating tornado strike probabilities and developing tornado wind hazard curves are recommended: one developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the other developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The LLNL methodology, detailed by Boissonnade, Hossain et al. [2000], uses a variety of information to develop a final set of probabilistic wind hazard curves for a specific size facility and location, including tornado heading, touchdown locations within a specified area surrounding the location of interest, area of the tornado footprint, variation of wind speeds within the tornado damage footprint, and tornado intensity based on the Fujita scale (F-scale). This methodology also accounts for the uncertainties associated with the observed parameters. The PNNL methodology incorporates many of the same sources of information to calculate probabilistic hazard curves, but also incorporates the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF-Scale) in the analysis. Since the NAS SSRA Committee recommended suing the EF-Scale for future tornado hazard analyses, the PNNL methodology was selected for use in the Updated SSRA. PNNL Methodology At the heart of the PNNL methodology, as documented in NUREG/CR-4461, Rev.2, \"Tornado Contiguous Unites States\" [Ramsdell and Rishel, 2007], is the calculation of the probability of exceeding a specified wind speed threshold at a specific site. This probability is defined as the product of A5-3 the probability of a tornado of any intensity striking the site and the probability of exceeding a wind speed threshold, given that a strike has occurred (Equation 1 ). Equation 1 where P(u uo), is the total probability of the wind speed, u, exceeding the wind speed threshold, uo, P(s) is the probability of the site being struck by a tornado, and P(u uo | s) is the conditional probability of exceeding uo, given a strike has occurred. In revision 1 of NUREG/CR-4461, the total probability of exceedance (e.g. tornado event exceeding a given wind speed) was solely based on a point structure calculation, which neglected the dimensions of the structure. Accordingly, the probability of a tornado striking any point, Pp(s), within a user defined region of interest, Ar, is represented as: Equation 2 where At represents the total area impacted by tornadoes within the region of interest and N is the total number of years of record. The total area impacted by tornadoes, A t is simply the sum of expected areas, E[A(F i)] for each F-scale, Fi (i=0,1,2,3,4,5) , multiplied by the number of tornado events, associated with that F-scale, within the analysis region, Nt[Fi]: Equation 3 Equation 4 Calculation of the conditional probability of exceeding a wind speed threshold, given a tornado strike , for a point structure, is subsequently defined as: Equation 5 where, A(uuo), is the total area receiving wind speeds greater than or equal to the wind speed threshold, uo. By assigning the minimum wind speed associated with each damage classification A5-4 category (0 thru 5) to uo, six values are obtained for the conditional probability (Equation 5 ). To calculate conditional probabilities over a continuous range of wind speed thresholds, a continuous distribution functional form is assumed and then numerically fit to the six values calculated using Equation 5. Ramsdell and Rishel Rishel 2007) recommend the use of a Weibull distribution to represent the continuous conditional probability of exceedance: Equation 6 where ap and bp are parameters of the Weibull distribution which need to be estimated using a numerical optimization method, which minimizes the difference between the observed probabilities and the estimated probability distribution. Revision 2 of NUREG/CR-4461 further extended this methodology to include probabilities of exceedance associated with a finite size structure, Pl(u uo). This is combined with the probability of exceedance, Pp(u uo), for a point structure to determine the total probability that a given wind speed is exceeded as a result of a tornado: Equation 7 As with the point structure, the finite structure probability of exceedance is also the product of the probability of a strike, Pl(s), and the probability of exceedance given a strike, Pl(u uo | s): Equation 8 A5-5 where the probability of a tornado strike is similarly calculated: Equation 9 but instead utilizes a characteristic building dimension, ws, multiplied by the total length impacted by tornadoes, Lt to characterize the total impacted area. The total length impacted by tornadoes is simply the sum of expected lengths, E[L(Fi)] for each F-scale, Fi (i=0,1,2,3,4,5) , multiplied by the number of tornado events, associated with that F-scale, within the analysis region, Nt[Fi]: Equation 10 Equation 11 Calculation of the conditional probability of exceeding a wind speed threshold, given a tornado strike, for a point structure, then becomes: Equation 12 where, L(uuo), is the total length receiving wind speeds greater than or equal to the wind speed threshold, uo. As for the point structure methodology, the Weibull distribution is similarly used to represent the continuous conditional probability of exceedance: Equatio n 13 After combining the probabilities for a point and finite size structure, the equation for the final probability of exceedance becomes: Equation 14 A5-6 Using Equation 14, probabilities are calculated for a continuous range of wind speeds, uo, and used to develop the final tornado wind hazard curves, as illustrated in Figure 2:. Figure 2: Tornado Hazard Curves from Ramsdell and Rishel [2007] Representing Total Probabilities of Exceedance Calculated for the Continguous, Western, Central, and Eastern United States Implicit in Equation 3 and Equation 10 is the need to estimate the values for tornado areas and lengths, for tornadoes of record within the defined region of interest. In place of calculating a simple arithmetic average, Ramsdell and Rishel [2007] recommend using the expected value, assuming tornado dimension statistics follow a lognormal distribution. The expected value and associated 5% and 9 5% confidence intervals can be computed using Equations 15 - 17, below: Equation 15 Equation 16 Equation 17 A5-7 where \u00b5 and represent the mean and standard deviation of the natural logarithm of the tornado length, width, and areas in the climatological record. In addition to incorporating the probabilities associated with a finite structure size, revision 2 of NUREG/CR-4461 also made modifications to the revision 1 methodology to account for variation of win d speeds within the tornado impact area for the conversion from F-scale to EF-scale wind speeds (not detailed here). Using the revised methodology, PNNL subsequently calculated probabilities of exceeding specified wind speeds for the contiguous, western, central, and eastern United States for a characteristic building dimension of 200 ft using tornado records covering the period from 1 January 1950 to 31 August 2003. The results of their analysis included recommended design wind speeds of 230, 200, and 160 mph for the central U.S., east coast/western great plains, and western U.S., respectively, using a best estimate probability of 10-7 per year. NBAF Updated SSRA Methodology For the Updated SSRA tornado hazard analysis, the PNNL methodology was used with a few modifications. First, tornado records from 1 January 1950 to 31 December 2010 were used to estimate the tornado dimension statistics. Second, a characteristic building dimension of 380 ft was used to estimate the probabilities associated with a finite size structure. This dimension was based on the latest NBAF design (65%) which calls for a \"first floor tornado wall plan\" with a rectangular area of dimensions 320' (in the east/west direction) by 380' (in the north/south direction) . The tornado record used in the Updated SSR! was the \"event -based\" climatological record maintained by the NO!! SPC, versus the \"segment -based\" record maintained by the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) that was used by PNNL. Lastly, to provide a more representative statistical record, the tornado records used in the Updated SSRA were extracted from a smaller analysis region surrounding the NBAF location versus the significantly larger \"Central US\" domain used by PNNL. These adjustments are discussed in more detail in the sections, below. NOAA SPC Tornado Dataset The Updated SSRA tornado hazard analysis used the latest \"event -base\" archive of tornado events for the continental Unites States from the NOAA SPC [available online at: http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/ ], which covered the period from 1 January 1950 to 31 December 2010. The archive includes a variety of information related to documented tornado touchdown events, including intensity (F-Scale: 1950-2007, EF-Scale: 2007-Present), starting/ending locations, length/width of damage paths, date/time of event, injuries, fatalities, and other related data. An important distinction regarding this archive and the one used by PNNL is that the NOAA SPC archive currently lists the tornadoes in terms of a single event in contrast to the \"segment -based\" archive currently maintained by the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) which lists a single tornado as a series of segments that correspond to the specifics of the tornado as they pertain to a given county of a state. In the \"segment -based\" record , a single tornado can A5-8 - - Tab le 4: U.S. Total Confirmed Tornados (1950 2010) F Scale Tornado Count Percentage of Total Unknown 1,864 3.36 % F0 23,966 43.23 652 1.18 % F5 78 0.14 % - - Tab le 5: Confirmed Tor nado s Within 10 nm i of NBAF (19 50 2010) F Scale F0 Tornado Count Percentage of Total 8 53.33 % 5 33.33 % 1 6.67 % 0 0.00 % 1 6.67 % 0 0.00 % F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 be archived more than once and the length of a tornado that crosses county and state lines will be reported as the length within the county and state and not the total length of the tornado path. As will be discussed, the use of the \"segment -based\" record has implications on the accuracy of the 5th and 95th percentile total strike probability calculations. Choice of Statistical Analysis Region and Associated Statistics The relatively small sample size and well documented data quality issues associated with the U .S. tornado climate record poses a significant challenge in using it to draw robust conclusions for facility design and risk assessment analyses [Doswell, 2007] . One of th e challenges of calculating tornado statistics as a function of F-Scale is that the more intense tornados (F4- F5) are extremely rare events. For example, during the entire period of record (60 years), over the entire continental U.S., there were only 730 F4 and F5 tornado events (Table 4). The relative rarity of these strong tornado events is also illustrated in Figure 1. Here the tracks of all of the confirmed tornados between 1950 and 2010 are depicted over the US central plains region. Because of the rarity of intense tornados, it is difficult to produce a statistically relevant sample size for the immediate vicinity of Manhattan, Kansas. This point is illustrated in Table 5 which contains a summary of the confirmed tornadoes that occurred within approximately 10 nautical miles (nmi) of Manhattan and in Figure 3 which depicts the paths of these tornados. Over the 60-year record, there have been only 15 confirmed tornadoes of any intensity documented in this area. A5-9 Figure 3: Touchdown Location and/or Tracks for all of the Confirmed Tornados from 1950\u00ad 2010 Within 10 nmi of the NBAF. The red circle denotes the NBAF location. Since the climatological record is not long enough to capture a statistically relevant number of tornadoes at all of the intensity levels in the immediate vicinity of the NBAF, it is necessary to identify an area (as large as possible) where the overall tornado occurrence statistics are relatively uniform and representative of tornado statistics for Manhattan, Kansas. To accomplish this, tornado occurrence statistics were examined in 1 longitude bands from west to east and 1 latitude bands from north to south to identify regions of uniform tornado occurrence and/or trends in the NOAA SPC database (Figure 4: and Figure 5 ). The results illustrate that a region of higher tornado occurrence is present over southern Nebraska, most of Kansas and Oklahoma, and northern Texas between longitudes of 102 to 95 W and latitudes of 32 to 41 N. This area constitutes a portion of what is often referred to as \"Tornado !lley .\" The local maximums in tornado frequency at 98 west and at 32 , 35, and 39 north roughly correspond with localized regions of higher population associated with the cities of Dallas/F ort Worth, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, and smaller towns along the transportation corridors of U .S. interstate highways 20, 40, and 70. Outside of the 32 to 41 N latitude and 102 to 95 W longitude band, the number of tornados markedly decreases. Based on these findings, the area illustrated by the dashed red box in Figure 1 was selected to provide tornado climatology statistics used in this assessment. Using an area of this size significantly increases the total number of tornadoes in each of the F-Scale categories and provides tornado occurrence data that are both statistically relevant and A5-10 representative of the conditions that can be expected at the NBAF facility. Table 6: lists the tornado occurrences by F-Scale for the area outlined by the red dashed-line box in Figure 1.

First, the strike probability is computed for the entire NOAA SPC tornado database and is used as a comparison to the PNNL results [Ramsdell and Rishel, 2007]. Second, the tornado strike probability i s computed for the 9o by 7o NBAF analysis region for the reasons discussed above. Third, the analysis of tornado strike probability is computed for the 9o by 7o NBAF analysis region where a correction for the unreported tornado events based on the findings of Ray, Bieringer et al. [2003] is applied. A5-12 Table 7. Tornado Path Statistics (Entire Tornado Climate Record) Statistic F/EF -0 Reported 8575 2397 628 72 Median (ft) 75 150 300 600 1200 1500 Mean (ft) 122.096 266.590 101.026 The statistics for tornado path length, width, and area for the entire NOAA SPC database are listed in Tabl e 7. This table provides the mean and median tornado path characteristics computed using standard methods, along with the expected value, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile values when the tornado path characteristics are represented by a lognormal distribution. The statistics based on the lognormal distribution assumption are the values then used to compute the strike probabilities for the NBAF (assuming a 380 ft horizontal length of the structure) over a continuous range of wind speeds (Figure 6: ). The results depicted in Figure 6: represent the strike probabilities based on the entire NOAA SPC to rnado record and are comparable to those computed by PNNL shown in Figure 2:. Both analyses indicate that strike probabilities are on the order of 10-7 or lower for wind speeds in excess of 200 mph. The primary difference in the magnitude of the strike probabilities between Figure 2: and Figure 6: is due to the size of the structure used in the analyses. The PNNL study used a 200 ft structure while the NBAF analysis assumed a structure with a length of 380 ft. The other significant difference between this analysis and the one done by PNNL are the spread of the 5 th and 95th percentile strike probabilities (red and blue dashed lines, respectively) from the expected value (black line). The NBAF analysis shows a significantly broader spread of the 5th and 95th percentile values than those identified in the PNNL analysis (not shown). The estimates of 5th and 95th percentile strike probability shown in Figure 6: and Figure 7 for the NBAF are more accurate than those reported in the PNNL study. The improved accuracy of this analysis is a direct result of the use of the NOAA NCDC \"segment -based\" tornado database NOAA SPC \"event -based\" record used here . When the \"segment -based\" tornado database is used, the tornado lengths are artificially shortened as a result of the way they are reported. A5-13 This is sue does not impact the accuracy of expected value results reported by PNNL which are comparable to those reported for the NBAF. It does, however, result in the lognormal distribution of tornado path length be ing narrow er than it should be in the PNNL analysis. This then impacts the 5th and 95th percentile values, which are incorrectly closer to the expected value. The values used for NBAF in this assessment are correct. Figure 6: Tornado Strike Probability vs. Maximum Wind Speed Based on the Full Tornado Climatological Record Over the Contiguous United states. A5-14 Figure 7: Tornado Strike Probability vs. Maximum Wind Speed Based on the Tornado Climatological Record in the NBAF Analysis Region Located in the US Central Plains. (Note that the Maximum Wind Speed is 280 mph for this Plot.) Table 8 lists the comparable set of statistics for tornado path length, width, and area that are used in the computation of the strike probability for the 9o by 7o NBAF analysis area. Many of the tornado intensity characteristics are comparable between the analysis that used the entire data-base and the analysis that used the NBAF analysis area. Notable differences are the statistics fr om the NBAF analysis that indicate longer tornado path lengths and corresponding larger areas. This result is expected, and due to the fact that the US central plains, area in which the NBAF analysis area is located, is known to have the more frequent, larger, and more intense tornadoes than the average tornado path characteristic when computed over the entire US. The larger, more intense tornadoes, which occur more frequently in the US central plains, result in a higher total strike probability than when the entire tornado climate record is used. The 95th percentile is also higher; however, the 5th percentile estimate over the NBAF region has an artificially shallow slope. This result is due to an insufficient sample size of large tornadoes in the NBAF analysis region. Consequently, the 5th percentile results should be used with caution. A5-15 Table 8: Tornado Path Statistics (NBAF Analysis Area) 18 Events with Reported Length 5408 3048 1672 502 64.270 The tornado strike probability methodology used in the previous 2010 SSRA used the spatial bias correction technique of Ray, Bieringer et al. [2003] which corrected for un-reported tornadoes. In this study it was found that in the Manhattan, Kansas region, the tornado climatological record under- reports the total number of tornadoes by approximately 60%. Since the larger more intense tornadoes often leave identifiable damage even in remote locations, the most likely type of tornadoes to be under-reported are the weaker, F0 events. Further evidence of this can be seen in a plot of the number of tornado events over the year as a function of F/EF scale intensity (Figure 8). The number of F0 events has increased markedly since the beginning of \"official\" record keeping in 1950 in the NBAF analysis area, while there has not been a marked increase in the number of F1- F5 events. A similar finding was reported by Ramsdell and Rishel [2007] for the entire tornado climatological record. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that if a correction is to be made to the tornado climate record to account for the under-reporting of tornadoes documented by Ray, Bieringer et al. [2003], it should be applied only to the F0 events. Based on this assumption, the number of F/EF0 tornado events in the NOAA SPC database was increased by 60% to account for the unreported events and then the tornado strike probability was recomputed. The increase in the number of F/EF 0 tornado events results in an increase in the tornado path area expected values relative to the unadjusted analysis for the NBAF region (Tables 9 and 10). This in turn results in a corresponding change in the relative percentages of tornado path area of the weaker storms between the adjusted and unadjusted analyses. This change associated with the adjustment due to under-reporting of weak tornadoes results in only a small change in the cumulative probability of exceeding a wind threshold. Since this in-turn results in only a small change to the 6 data points that are A5-16 the basis for the Weibull function fit, there is little change to the corresponding Weibull function coefficients used to determine the continuous strike probability estimate. Consequently it is acceptable to use the tornado strike probabilities illustrated in Figure 7 to determine the design-basis wind speed for the facility and the tornado return frequencies for the final risk calculations.

Appendix A6: Epidemiological Model Start Locations A6.1.1 Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (CVIs) An important aspect of disease modeling is accounting for the movement of infected animals. Movement of animals within each state is modeled using direct contact parameters in the Updated SSRA. Livestock is also shipped between states. To account for this, data from animal certificates of veterinary inspection (CVIs) were used to develop multiple parameters for epidemiological modeling. CVIs are the most comprehensive data source available for interstate livestock movement. CVIs are required for animals sold directly by the producer and for animals sold through markets; however, animals moved from Kansas to a sales barn in another state are not issued a CVI, so this approach somewhat underestimates the movement of animals between states. Subject matter experts (SMEs) believe that a small fraction of animals are sold through markets in states other than the state where they were produced. Additionally, there will be some illegal movement of animals that will not be captured using this approach. According to SMEs, the larger livestock species modeled for the SSRA and Updated SSRA (as opposed to poultry) are not typically part of illegal activities or an underground market system or culture (e.g., cockfighting), nor are they traded at unregulated swap meets, a common event in the small scale poultry industry. This greatly limits the opportunity for \"off-the-grid movement.\" Two sets of CVI data were collected. The first dataset contains limited information from all CVIs issued in 2010 to states in the modeled region. The second dataset includes detailed information collected from all CVIs issued in the nine counties nearest the NBAF during the first half of 2011. Resources and data availability limited the CVI data collection effort. Additionally, a 2003 interstate livestock movement report from the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) was used when sufficient data were not available from CVIs . A6.1.1.1 2010 CVIs for Modeled Region One CVI dataset included the species, animal number, and reason for export for every CVI issued in Kansas in 2010 to a shipment of animals destined for the six other states modeled for the Updated SSRA.

This relationship is called a dose- g to that particular dose. In the model used here, a positive response was a successful infection, and the marker of a successful infection was viremia. For example, if the response at a given dose was 50%, then 50% of animals exposed to that dose would have been infected, as indicated by the presence of viremia. This 50% infection rate is also known as an infectious dose 50 (ID 50). The calculation of this dose-response relationship from published experimental data was accomplished using probit analysis, which is a standard method used to characterize the effects of dose within a population. The following section reports the results of probit analysis, including the ID 50, for the aerosol and intranasal inoculation of cattle, swine, and sheep with Foot-and- Mouth Disease virus (FMDv). A6-6 A6.1.2.1 Method Choosing a Method for Characterizing the Dose-Response Relationship Multiple methods could have been used to characterize the relationship between dose and response after exposure of cattle, swine, and small ruminants to FMDv. These methods include probit analysis, an exponential model, and a beta poisson model. Probit analysis involves transforming the response within a population so that the relationship between dose and response is characterized by a linear function as opposed to a sigmoid curve [Finney, 1952]. This analysis is data-driven and does not require the estimation of any parameters. The exponential model calculates the probability of at least one organism causing an infection, assuming that the organisms within the inoculum follow a poisson distribution. This model assumes all organisms have the same probability of causing an infection, defined by the parameter r [French et al., 2002 ; Teunis and Havelaar, 2000]. The beta poisson model has an additional dimension of analysis by us of an organism causing an infection [French et al., 2002 ; Teunis and Havelaar, 2000]. Probit analysis was initially used to characterize the dose response, as it relies solely on experimental data rather than parameter estimations, and the resulting dose-response curves fit the data well, as demonstrated in Figure 1. The exponential and beta poisson model were also considered; however, the potential of these models to characterize the dose-response relationship of FMDv in cattle and sheep was previously studied by French et al. and was found to be unsatisfactory, particularly at low doses [French et al., 2002]. The exponential model that included viremia as a measure of response to FMDv exposure did not fit the data well and underestimated the probability of infection at low doses. Additionally, French et al. were unable to establish reasonable parameter estimates for the beta poisson model and concluded that this model was not suitable for characterizing the FMDv dose-response relationship [French et al., 2002]. The results of French et al., combined with the relative success of probit analysis to fit the data well, indicated that probit analysis was the best method by which t o characterize the dose-response relationship for the Updated SSRA. Characterizing the Dose-Response Relationship The available literature was searched for any experimental data on the infectiousness of FMDv in cattle, swine, and sheep inoculated via aerosol (natural and artificial) or intranasally. Although goats are also included in this model, the majority of data available on the exposure of small ruminants to FMDv came from experiments in sheep rather than goats and so the probit slope and ID 50 calculated for sheep were applied to all small ruminants. Data for each species and route of inoculation combination were analyzed separately because the susceptibility of animals to infection may vary considerably depending on the route of exposure. For this same reason, experimental data obtained from inoculation via any method other than the one being analyzed were excluded from analysis. For example, data from intradermolingual (tongue) inoculation, although numerous in the literature, were not used at all. Similarly, data from an aerosol exposure were not used for probit analysis of an intranasal exposure. Additionally, data could also only be included for analysis if the studies they were from reported both the amount of virus in each inoculum and the response within the population after exposure to a A6-7 specified dose, because these two parameters (dose and response) are necessary for probit analysis. The dose had to be expressed in either plaque forming units (PFU) or a unit that could be converted to PFU. For example, doses expressed as a tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50) could be converted to PFU by multiplying by 0.7, because 1 TCID 50 is equivalent to 0.7 PFU [Burrows, 1966]. Other data were excluded from probit analysis, including data from animals examined before the first animal in the group developed markers of infection. This is because it was possible that those animals would have developed markers of infection, but were examined too early. Data from animals tha t developed markers of infection at the same time or after control animals were similarly excluded, as it is possible they developed a secondary infection rather than in response to the primary exposure. Additionally, data from aerosol exposures lasting more than 24 hours were excluded from analysis because it is unlikely that reasonable estimates of dose can be determined over such an extended period of time. Before analyzing the data, the endpoint that would be the measure of infection was determined. The three most commonly reported endpoints after exposure to FMDv were seroconversion (the development of antibodies), viremia (the presence of virus in blood) and clinical symptoms (e.g. lesions). While clinical symptoms are a good indicator of successful infection, it has been demonstrated that some animals infected with FMDv may not develop lesions [Sutmoller et al., 1968]. Additionally, sheep are less likely than cattle to have lesions after infection with FMDv [Donaldson et al., 1970]. Basing the infectious dose on the presence of clinical symptoms would thus fail to capture these asymptomatic animals. However, because the model predicts the spread of FMDv throughout the population, all animals that can transmit the virus need to be accounted for, not just those displaying clinical symptoms, and so the presence of clinical symptoms was not used as the measure of infection. The measure of infection also needed to provide evidence that FMDv was actively replicating within the host (indicating the host is infectious) because this dose-response data feeds into the model of disease spread, and the disease spreads via infectious animals or contact with infectious animals. Thus seroconversion was eliminated as the marker of infection because animals may seroconvert without displaying evidence of virus replication and multiplication, such as viremia or isolation from oesophageal-pharyngeal fluid [Donaldson et al., 1987]. Additionally, antibodies may fail to be detected in animals which have viremia, indicating that animals which are potentially infectious may be not be accounted for if seroconversion is used as the measure of infection [Aggarwal et al., 2002; Donaldson et al., 1987]. Therefore, the remaining endpoint, viremia, was determined to be the best marker of successful infection, as it demonstrated active replication within the host and likely captured those For each species and route of exposure combination, the responses of the individual animals were paired with their respective doses and then sorted and grouped by dose. The groupings by dose were necessary because individual animals were either infected (100%) or not (0%), but probit analysis can only use responses between 0% and 100%, which requires multiple exposed animals. For example, if two out of four animals are infected by a dose of 100 PFU, as a population the response is 50%, whereas A6-8 as individuals the response rate is 0% for two and 100% for the other two. In probit analysis, population responses which equal 0% or 100% are excluded because the theoretical sigmoid response curve never reaches 0% or 100%, but extends infinitely [Finney, 1952]. Dose groups were defined by one log intervals (e.g. 0-0.99 log 10 PFU, 1-1.99 log 10 PFU, etc.), and for each group the mean dose was determined. The number of viremic animals out of all exposed within each dose group was used to determine the percent response to that mean dose. Using the method described by Finney, the linear transformation of the dose response (probit) was plotted as a function of dose, so that the relationship between dose and dose response was linear as opposed to a sigmoid curve [Finney, 1952]. A linear best- fit line was then calculated, which gave the probit slope. The equation followed the formula y = mx + b 10 F \u00ad intercept. The ID 50 was determined by solving the best-fit equation for the dose at which the probit was 5, because a probit of 5 is equivalent to a 50% response [Finney, 1952] . Method Exception: Intranasal Exposure in Swine Only one study was identified with appropriate data on the intranasal infection of swine with FMDv; however, there were some difficulties with using this data that had to be addressed [Li et al., 2010]. The central issue was that each of the swine received the same dose of virus; however, probit analysis requires at least two different exposure doses because a linear best-fit line cannot be calculated from a single dose. The second issue was that the amount of virus in each inoculum was reported in ID 50, without detailing how the virus was titrated (e.g. in tissue culture, suckling mice, etc.) and so it was not clear how many PFU were in each ID50. Finally, Li et al. reported the presence of fever or lesions, but not viremia, which was problematic because viremia was the marker of infection for probit analysis. Therefore, the probit analysis and ID 50 determination for the intranasal infection of swine were performed using a method different than that used for the other exposures. First, it was assumed that one ID 50 was equivalent to one TCID 50 so that the dose in PFU could be calculated. This assumption was made because many of the studies performed with FMDv use TCID 50 as the dosage unit. Once the exposure dose was calculated, a new marker of infection had to be substituted for viremia. Because clinical symptoms alone are not a good marker for infection, the marker of infection for this study was the presence of clinical symptoms, fever or both. This method captured those animals that did not develop clinical symptoms, but still became ill, as characterized by fever. Once the dose and marker of infection were identified, the issue remained that there was only one dose, and so a probit equation could not be calculated. Therefore, it was assumed that the swine intranasal probit slope was equal to the swine aerosol probit slope, which was determined using the method described previously. This was supported by the fact that in cattle, for which the data and sources were most numerous, the aerosol probit slope (0.33) was similar to the intranasal (055) F [Finney, A6-9 Tab le 6: Probit Slope and ID 50 for Catt le, Swine, and Sheep Ex posed t o FMDv via Aero sol Anim al Cattle Swine 0.33 15 0.89 30,000 0.72 3 1952]. All that was then missing from the probit equation was the y-intercept, and because the probit (y), dose (x), and slope (m) were known, the y-intercept could be calculated. Once the y-intercept was calculated, the probit equation was complete. The ID 50 was then calculated by solving for the probit equation when y = 5, identical to the ID 50 calculation method for the other exposures. A6.1.2.2 Results Aerosol Exposure Table 6 below lists for each species the calculated probit slope and ID 50. The probit graphs and complete equations specific to each species are reported in the following subsections. Cattle D ata from 57 animals and 5 studies were compiled for probit analysis [Aggarwal et al., 2002 ; Burrows et al., 1981 ; Donaldson et al., 1987 ; Donaldson and Kitching, 1989 ; Sutmoller and McVicar, 1976]. The dose-response curve is shown in Figure 1, while the transformed probit and best-fit equation are displayed below in Figure 2. The probit slope is equal to 0.33 and the calculated ID 50 is 15 PFU. This ID 50 is supported by a report assessing the risk of an airborne outbreak of FMDv in Australia, which reported a calculated ID 50 of 20 PFU, very similar to the results shown here [Garner and Cannon, 1995]. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Probability of Infection Dose FMDv (pfu) Probit Fit Real Data Figure 1 : Dose-Response Curve Depicting Aerosol Infection of Cattle A6-10 y = 0.3331x + 4.6096 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 Probit Dose FMDv (log10 pfu) Cattle Aerosol Figure 2: Probit Graph for Aerosol Infection of Cattle Swine Data from 51 animals and 3 studies were compiled for probit analysis [Aggarwal et al., 2002; Alexandersen et al., 2002 ; Alexandersen and Donaldson, 2002]. Despite the large number of animals exposed, only two animals were actually infected. This resulted in only two data points for probit analysis, both of which were less than a 15% response. Because responses towards the termini of the response range are statistically less reliable than responses in the middle (i.e., a response of 5% is less reliable than a response of 50%), there is more uncertainty surrounding the calculated probit slope and ID50 for an aerosol exposure in swine than that of cattle or sheep. However, all available data were used if possible, and Alexandersen and Donaldson established that swine are at least 60 times more resistant to FMDv infection via aerosol than cattle or sheep, and they admit that even that amount is likely an [Alexandersen and Donaldson, 2002] . The transformed probit and best-fit equation are displayed below in Figure 3. The probit slope is equal to 0.89 and the calculated ID50 is 30,000 PFU.

The transformed probit and best-fit equation are displayed below in Figure 4. The probit slope is equal to 0.72 and the calculated ID50 is 3 PFU . This ID 50 is similar to that calculated in an Australian report, which estimated an ID 50 of 11 PFU [Garner and Cannon, 1995].

Although minimum infectious dose data were collected from experiments, reviews, and models, ultimately only original experimental data were used to determine minimum infectious dose. While this may potentially overestimate the minimum infectious doses, as there may be lower doses that could cause infection if a large number of animals were exposed, it was more scientifically sound to report the minimum infectious doses based upon experimental data than conjecture. In addition, all minimum infectious doses reported in Table 7 are already low so it may be unlikely that the true minimum infectious doses are significantly lower than experimental evidence suggests. To determine these minimum infectious doses, all experimental data were compiled for each species, and the lowest dos e resulting in infection, as measured by the presence of viremia, was determined to be the minimum infectious dose. Minimum infectious doses reported in TCID 50 were converted to PFU. Each of the minimum infectious doses was lower than the calculated ID 50 for each species, with the exception of sheep. The sheep ID 50 was calculated using probit analysis and equaled 3 PFU, while the lowest reported infectious dose in sheep is 7 PFU. This is an artifact of the probit analysis, as there were only two sheep exposed to doses less than 7 PFU, and neither became infected; however, six of eight (75%) of sheep exposed to doses between 7 and 10 PFU became infected [Gibson and Donaldson, 1986] . Therefore, while the lowest reported infectious dose is 7 PFU, the expected ID 50 is actually less than 7 PFU, which accounts for the ID 50 being greater than the minimum infectious dose. Intranasal Exposure Table 8 below lists for each species the calculated probit slope and ID 50. The probit graphs and complete equations specific to each species are reported in the following subsections. Cattle D ata from 65 animals and 7 studies were compiled for probit analysis [Bouma et al., 2004 ; McVicar and Sutmoller, 1976 ; Orsel et al., 2007 ; Orsel et al., 2005 ; Sutmoller and McVicar, 1972 ; Sutmoller and A6-13 McVicar, 1976 Sutmoller et al., 1968]. The transformed probit and best-fit equation are displayed below in Figure 5.

As explained in the methods section, Li et al. only investigated the response at one dose of FMDv, so a probit equation could not be calculated. It was therefore assumed that the swine intranasal probit slope is equal to the swine aerosol probit slope of 0.89. The calculated ID50 is 4,100 PFU. Sheep Data from 32 animals and 3 studies were compiled for probit analysis [Hughes et al., 2002a ; Hughes et al., 2002b ; McVicar and Sutmoller, 1972]. The transformed probit and best-fit equation are displayed below in Figure 6. The probit slope is equal to 1.8 and the calculated ID50 is 9,200 PFU.

Determining the infectious dose was further complicated because most of the available studies were undertaken before or during the 1970s, so uncertainties or discrepancies within the studies could not be readily clarified . For example, in many of these studies it was unclear what dose of FMDv the animals were exposed to because the inocula were reported in ID 50 units. Reporting dose as a function of ID 50 is problematic because the PFU count in a single ID 50 may change depending on how the ID 50 was titrated. For example, Orsel et al. [2007] reported that one cattle ID50 is equivalent to 25 PFU, as determined by cattle tongue titration; however, in a similar study it was determined one cattle ID50 is equivalent to 6.5 PFU when titrated on lamb kidney cells or 4.5 PFU when titrated on pig kidney cells [Bouma et al., 2004]. Therefore, for inocula reported in ID50, two distinct PFU doses were calculated by different methods. The first method assumes that an ID 50 is equivalent to 25 PFU, as determined by titration on bovine tongue [Orsel et al., 2007]. The second methods assumes that an ID 50 is a tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50), which is equivalent to 0.7 PFU. By calculating the PFU of the inocula by these two methods, a range of uncertainty was defined around the individual doses in an effort to capture the true PFU dose somewhere within this range. These results are summarized in Table 9, and more detailed methods and results are in the following sections. Overall, for all animals that a range of oral infectious doses could be estimated, the lower estimate of the oral infectious dose was greater than the ID 50 for an intranasal exposure (Table 8). Therefore, of the two modes of infection, intranasal inoculation will be the more likely fomite scenario, as it requires less virus to cause infection. Intranasal inoculation will thus be modeled instead of oral inoculation.

A6.1.3.1 Cattle The only published study describing the infectious oral dose for cattle was that of Henderson and Brooksby [Henderson and Brooksby, 1948]. However, they did not report the dose used to infect the infect cattle by feeding virus in glass [Henderson and Brooksby, 1948]. Both Sellers and Donaldson later cited this paper in their own reviews and reported that the cattle in Henderson and \u0011 10 6.5 ID50 and none became infected [Donaldson, 1986 ; Sellers, 1971]; however, it is unclear how they determined both the dose and number of animals infected from the original study, and so this information was excluded from the present assessment. Within those same reviews, Sellers and Donaldson reported that results from an experiment by Burrows demonstrated that some cattle (<50%) were infected by oral doses of 10 5.8-106.8 ID50 of FMDv [Donaldson, 1986 ; Sellers, 1971]. Although the Burrows results were cited as unpublished, and therefore could not be verified, it was the only experimental oral infectious dose reported for cattle identified in the literature, other than the Henderson and Brooksby study, and so it was used to estimate an oral infectious dose for cattle. As mentioned previously, the use of ID 50 to quantify the inocula is problematic. Therefore, to best estimate the range of possible oral infective doses for cattle, the infectious dose was calculated in two ways. Assuming an ID 50 is equivalent to 25 PFU results in a low-end cattle oral infectious dose of 107.2 PFU and a high-end dose of 108.2 PFU. Alternatively, assuming an ID 50 is equivalent to 0.7 PFU equates to a low-end cattle oral infectious dose of 105.6 PFU and a high-end dose of 106.6 PFU. Together, the overall range of a cattle infectious dose is 105.6-108.2, or 440,000-160,000,000, PFU. A6.1.3.2 Swine Although the data on oral infectious doses for swine are limited overall, there are more studies published for swine than for cattle. Data were collected from both experimental data [de Leeuw et al., 1978 ; Terpstra, 1972] and reviews [Donaldson, 1986 ; Sellers, 1971]. The lowest reported dose to cause infection was 10 3.9 ID50 [Donaldson, 1986 ; Sellers, 1971]; however, there is some ambiguity surrounding the dose PFU content because the dose was expressed in terms of ID 50. Assuming an ID 50 is equivalent to 0.7 PFU, the lowest infectious dose was 103.7 PFU, while assuming it is equal to 25 PFU results in an infectious dose of 105.3 PFU. The greatest dose to result in infection was 107.9 mouse ID 50 (Terpstra, 1972). Assuming that one mouse ID 50 is equivalent to approximately one PFU (Richmond, 1971), the greatest tested oral dose resulting in infection is 107.9 PFU. Together, the overall range for an oral infectious dose in swine is 103.7-107.9, or 5,600-79,000,000, PFU. A6-16 A6.1.3.3 Sheep There were no studies or experiments identified reporting an oral infectious dose in sheep. A6.2 NAADSM Parameter Development and Data Collection Supplementary Material The data in this Appendix Section are organized in the order in which they are first referenced in the main report. Subsections may describe data collection, details of parameter development or analysis of parameters or datasets produced for the Updated SSRA. This Appendix is not meant to stand alone, and makes the most sense when used as a reference for the main epidemiological modeling chapter.

Wildlife SMEs Shane Hesting and Lloyd Fox, Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks Dr. Dale Garner, Iowa Department of Natural Resources G \u0012 Division A6.2.1.1 General NAADSM Setup Number of Iterations In NAADSM, hundreds of user-defined parameters, many defined as ranges or distributions, dictate the course of a disease outbreak for a scenario. Parameters, such as the distance an animal travels between farms when it is sold, cannot be defined as a single point value because a single point does not represent the true range of values. The model samples from each distribution to select different parameter values for each iteration. Given this variability in inputs, the model must be run repeatedly to capture the range of possible outbreak courses. The number of iterations of each NAADSM scenario necessary to adequately capture the uncertainty was determined experimentally. A suite of five premises was chosen near the NBAF that represented the major production types used in the model. These premises included large feedlots, small swine operations, cow-calf operations, and dairies, representing the range of sizes and producer behaviors of facilities near the NBAF. Moreover, more than 80% of outbreak starting locations due to modeled release events occurred in facilities of these types used in this analysis. An outbreak was modeled starting at each location and the model was run with 100, 500, and 1,000 5 95 75 50 iterations affected the smallest and greatest outputs relative to the median (Figure 7). This analysis seeks to understand the relationship between the median and the extreme cases considered in the analysis to determine if this relationship changes significantly as a function of the number of iterations performed. The results were remarkably similar across runs with varying iterations. That being said, runs with 100 iterations predict a greater difference between the smallest (p5) and the median output cases. For large cases, runs with 100 iterations predict a slightly smaller difference between the most extreme cases (p95) and the median but predict a larger difference between the p75 and median output. For this reason, 100 iterations were considered adequate to represent the uncertainty inherent in the NAADSM model for the dataset used in this study; moreover, the information presented above suggests that outputs would be similar if more than 100 iterations were performed. The relatively small size of the p95 outputs compared to the median reflects a difference in the median outputs across model runs with varying iterations. Directly comparing the median output of runs with 100, 500, and 1,000 iterations showed a larger percentage difference in the median output than in the A6-19 p95, which were usually within 1%. For this reason, runs with 100 iterations would not underestimate the largest plausible epidemiological outputs. Even though 100 iterations were considered adequate, in the Updated SSRA, 200 iterations were used for almost all model runs because the computational power was available. Moreover, most release events involved many model runs (up to 400) of 200 iterations each that represent the various possible starting locations. In this way, many release pathways are described by several thousand NAADSM iterations. Figure 7 : Average Ratio of Median Output to p5, p75, and p9 5 Results for Head Culled across Modeling Runs with F ive Different Starting Locations Runs with 100 iterations (red), 500 iterations (blue), and 1,000 iterations (green) are shown. Random Number Generator Seed A random number generator was used to generate the seed for Updated SSRA modeling, as directed by !!D \"In the box labeled Random number generator seed, make sure that the option Generate seed automatically is selected.\" [Hill and Reeves, 2006] A6.2.1.2 Kansas Wildlife Data Collection Although wildlife parameters were not developed, several species of wildlife were identified that could impact a FMD outbreak in Kansas. A6-20 Elk Elk were not considered a substantial concern in Kansas because of their small number. Free-ranging elk herds were introduced into the wild at only two sites in Kansas, with total numbers estimated at less than 200 [Conrad et al., 2006].There are approximately 100 elk in the Fort Riley, Kansas, area [Fox, 2011]. Additional elk sightings are reported around the state; however, most are limited to the occasional sighting of a single or pair of animals [Conrad et al., 2006]. Pronghorn Pronghorn are also likely to have a minor impact on a FMD outbreak in Kansas. There are estimated to be 50-60 pronghorn in central Kansas, primarily around the Emporia area, about 70 miles south of Manhattan, Kansas. An additional 1,000 pronghorn are estimated to inhabit western Kansas (Manhattan is in the eastern portion of Kansas) [Fox, 2011]. Feral Swine There are currently less than 500 feral swine in the state of Kansas [Johnson, 2011a ; Johnson, 201 1b]. Feral swine transportation, release, and sport hunting are prohibited in Kansas. The Wildlife Services Feral Swine Control Program monitors and controls emerging populations and twelve known populations across the state (Figure 8). Several of these populations are replenished by movement of feral swine across state borders from Missouri and Oklahoma and are unlikely to be eradicated. Another persistent population is the result of illegal introduction of feral swine by a group of private landowners and is also unlikely to be eradicated. Most feral swine populations are more than 100 miles away from the NBAF. The closest population is east of Topeka, Kansas, around 75 miles away [Johnson, 2011a ; Johnson, 2011b]. A6-21 Figure 8 : Locations of Feral Swine Populations in Kansas (g reen) and Approximate Location of Manhattan, Kansas, NBAF Site (red star) Deer Deer are the most abundant FMD-susceptible wildlife population in Kansas. Kansas is divided into 19 deer management units that are monitored for deer density. Deer density data are expressed as deer per square mile per deer management unit [Fox, 2005]. Two surveys reported deer population in Kansas. The first survey was conducted by the Docking Institute of Public Affairs; their estimates of deer densities were derived from the average number of deer reported on private properties through telephone surveys (rather than an established method of deer sighting ) [Zollinger, 2004 ; Zollinger, 2010 ; Zollinger and Wheeler, 2007]. The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks also collects data on deer densities. Both surveys present data as deer density per deer management unit [Parks, 2010]. Deer management units are vast and do not coincide with county borders, making the mapping of these units difficult. Additionally , the deer densities within these units do not discriminate between rural and urban areas or agricultural land and forests. High densities of deer may occur in specific small areas, while other areas may be devoid of deer [Parks, 2010]. Data were also available from a limited number of deer check stations, and deer-related vehicle accident data [Parks, 2010]. Based on these data, the density of deer in the two deer management units near the NBAF is 5 to 14 deer per square mile [Fox, 2011]. While these data may be sufficient to develop crude parameters to incorporate deer into an FMD model, no one has developed a method that enables NAADSM to model wildlife yet. A6.2.2 Backyard and Small Scale (BY-SS) Producer Interviews and D ata A6.2.2.1 Interview In 2011, BY-SS production types were developed from interviews conducted with 29 producers at state fairs in Kansas and interviews with county extension agents and SMEs. Exhibitors and fair attendees A6-22 were interviewed so that the dataset would not be biased toward small producers raising animals for show; nevertheless, interviews with SMEs indicated that a large proportion of Kansas backyard producers would be raising animals for show or 4H projects. A standard interview was given to producers, which included the following questions: How many animals of the following production types do you have on your farm? o Beef Cattle o Dairy Cattle o Swine o Small Ruminants (Sheep and Goats) Species contact on a multispecies farm (Answered the following series of questions for each species on their farm) o What percentage of animals has free direct contact with an animal(s) of another species on site? o For those animals that do not directly contact other species freely, how often would direct contact occur? o Do you use the same equipment to handle/interact with multiple species? Do you wash your equipment betweenuse with different species? How often do you use this equipment with multiple species? o How often do you visit one species of animal and then a second species of animal without taking a break or taking decontamination steps? Animal purchase (for each species) o How many different farms/vendors to you purchase animals from each year? Describe the farm/vendor (i.e., cow-calf, sales barn) If purchased through sales barn, do you know what type of farm was selling? How many animals do you purchase at a time? How close is the point of purchase from your farm? o Were animals mixed with other animals during transportation from point- of-purchase to farmstead? Animal sale (for each species) o Do you keep any animals on your farm that will not be sold to any other facility (i.e., pet, brush control, direct to slaughter)? o Do you sell animals to be raised elsewhere? A6-23 o Do you show animals? o D -products (i.e., wool, milk)? How many times per year, if any, would you move your cattle from your farm to another site and then bring the animal back to your farm? o Which destinations are the animals transported to? Do your animals come into contact with any persons other than yourself during the year? o How often do they come into contact with each person? How often do you inspect your animals each week? o Which of your animals do you inspect? o Would you recognize the symptoms of FMD in your animals? What would your response be to symptoms of FMD? Results and Discussion Interviews were conducted with 29 producers at 5 Kansas county fairs; 24 of these producers qualified as small-scale producers (they had 10 or fewer animals of each species on site). The remaining 5 interviewees had between 11-50 animals on site. Survey responses from these farmers were indistinguishable from the small-scale producer responses. Sixty-nine percent of backyard and small-scale producers owned cattle, with an average herd size of 8.9 head. 38% owned small ruminants, with an average herd size of 5.4 head. 38% owned swine, with a n average herd size of 6.45 head. 52% (15 of 29) of the production sites had more than one species on site. Direct Contact All producers interviewed answered questions relating to direct contact rates. Interviews showed that production types on single- species backyard or small-scale farms never came into contact with other species on the farm. Most production types in multi-species farms (17 of 19; 89%) had daily contact with other species on the farm, as shown in Table 10 . Most producers (78.9%) purchased livestock from breeders or single-species operations. Other livestock were raised by the producers or purchased from other sources, such as dairy farms and private individuals. Purchase locations are presented in Table 11. Producers also provided estimated distances the purchase locations. The median travel distance for any production type was 42.5 miles (Swine median travel distance: 50 mi; Cattle median travel distance: 25 mi; Small Ruminant median travel distance: 41 mi). Most swine producers (80%) and small ruminant producers (67%) did not sell these production types. The swine and small ruminants were used as pets, show animals for county fairs and/or direct slaughter. A6-24 The destinations of sold animals included other backyard or small-scale farms, small ruminant production sites and feedlots, as detailed in Table 13. Producers sold to feedlots through sales barns. Movement with return to the farm, such as the movement to the county fairs, is discussed below. Producers also provided estimated distances of facilities that bought their livestock. The median travel distance for any production type was 40 miles (Swine median travel distance: 42.5 mi; Cattle median travel distance: 25 mi; Small Ruminant median travel distance: 62.5 mi). Backyard and small-scale farm livestock could make direct contact with other livestock when being transported for a short time to another site and returning to the farm. Producers were asked about the frequency of visits to fairs and shows, veterinarians, rodeos, insemination and other farms for brush suppression. Two producers transported cattle or small ruminants for insemination; two transported cattle for hoof trimming; no producers reported rodeo transportation. Table 15 presents livestock movement to and from fairs or shows and veterinarians.

Also, the number of producers answering these interview questions fluctuated (from 28 to 12). Indirect contact questions included contact with people other than the producer, the producer, and equipment. Most producers reported no livestock contact with people other than themselves, but most reported daily handling of more than one species.

Producer Reporting (Contacting Veterinarians for I ll A nimals) Twenty-seven (of 29; 93%) producers described whether they contact a veterinarian regarding livestock health. 100% of these producers reported that they always contact a veterinarian after observing that an animal is sick. One producer was a veterinarian and therefore treats his own animals. A6.2.3 Producer Interviews for All Private Facilities within 6.2 Miles of the NBAF Precise data were collected on all animal populations within a 6.2-mile radius of the NBAF site, including the location (lat and lon), herd size, and production type of every herd in the region. Herds identified for the Updated SSRA were confirmed and additional herds were identified through interviews and by driving around the entire area and looking for animals. A6.2.3.1 Interview Producers and Kansas State University (K-State) officials were interviewed to collect the following information for each herd identified: Current herd location (GIS coordinates collected by interviewer) Herd size Seasonality of herd (how many animals are typically on site in each of the four seasons) Production type (feedlot, c ow-calf, dairy, etc.) Are there plans to relocate/downsize the herd when the NBAF opens? If so, if possible, obtain the new location and new size. Where animals are typically sold? (Are they sold through a market? To a single producer through a direct arrangement? If so, where is that producer located?) What biosecurity procedures are currently in place at this location? How often are animals observed? In what level of detail? Can observers identify critical conditions and do they know how to report them? A6-29 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - What does a producer do when an animal becomes sick? A6.2.3.2 Results Eleven producers were identified in Pottawatomie County and 34 producers were identified in Riley County within a 6.2-mile radius of the NBAF, some producers house multiple production types or had multiple herds at different sites (Table 20). An additional four pastures were identified that could potentially be used for livestock grazing, but the owners of these properties could not be contacted and their use could not be determined. Twenty-eight producers agreed to interviews (62%).. Only one active swine operation was identified in the area and only one dairy with two cows was identified. The majority of livestock operations were cow-calf beef operations, with a few backgrounder operations. There are no true feedlots in this area. This survey probably accounted for between 75% and 90% of privately held livestock in this area. No producers were planning to change production practices or relocate as a result \u0011!F Table 20: Summary of Specie s and Number of Head on Private Farms Production Type Head of Animals Cow Calf 11 Cow Calf 24 Cow Calf 180 Feedlot(L) 2 Cow Calf 72 Cow Calf 71 Cow Calf 17 Cow Calf 50 Cow Calf 130 Cow Calf 175 Swine(S) 100 Swine(S) 100 Feedlot(S) 11 Swine(BY SS) 9 Sheep 8 Goats 15 Cow Calf 21 Cow Calf 79 Cow Calf 75 Cow Calf 45 Cow Calf 280 Cow Calf 136 Cow Calf 40 Cow Calf 30 Cow Calf 36 Cow Calf 104 A6-30 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Table 20: Summary of Specie s and Number of Head on Private Farms Production Type Head of Animals Cow Calf 20 Cow Calf 30 Cow Calf 110 Cow Calf 8 Goats 40 Goats 3 Goats 3 Cow Calf 7 Cow Calf 9 Cow Calf 11 Dairy 2 Beef(BY SS) 5 Cow Calf 30 Cow Calf 448 Cow Calf 449 Cow Calf 250 Cow Calf 45 Cow Calf 725 Feedlot(S) 350 Cow Calf 1 Cow Calf 230 Beef(BY SS) 10 Cow Calf 4 Cow Calf 1000 Cow Calf 265 Cow Calf 500 Direct Contact The degree of specificity provided when describing the source and destination of livestock varied by producer. About half of the producers interviewed (19 of 31; 61%) identified the source of their livestock, usually by city name(s) or specifying that they raised calves to replace cattle. Most of the producers (26 of 31; 84%) identified the destination of the livestock and did so with more specificity than identification of source. The destinations were described by city, county or state names, locker plant, sale barn, or retained by the producer. The producers rarely could provide information about where the livestock travelled after being sold at a sale barn. Table 21, therefore, gives the location of livestock immediately before or after . Columns do not sum to 100% because producers may obtain or sell livestock to multiple other facilities.

Eleven producers (of 31; 35%), mostly c ow-calf facility operators, reported that the frequency of observation increases to daily during calving season or winter. The data recorded in Table 22 reflects the lowest frequencies for each producer. Producers also reported symptoms they routinely looked for. The most common included livestoc k neglecting feed, lameness, standing alone, drooping ears, and pink eye. According to FADD interviews, cattle with FMD would display some of these symptoms. Producers looked for the same symptoms in cattle and small ruminants. The single swine producer checked for coughing or wheezing. Producer Reporting (Contacting Veterinarians for I ll A nimals) All producers interviewed described when they contact a veterinarian regarding livestock health, shown in Table 23. Most producers vaccinated their livestock and treated minor illnesses, calling a veterinarian for more serious or unrecognized illnesses. Some used veterinarians for all animal care while others only resorted to veterinarians after widespread illness or livestock death.

Biosecurity measures varied very little and tended to be security measures. Producers reported no biosecurity, visual, or hearsay observation of people entering the production site or more formal biosecurity measures such as gates or registering hunters, fishermen, or visitors. A6.2.4 Kansas State University Data Collection Kansas State University (K-State) faculty and staff were interviewed to collect data on all university animal populations (Tabl e 25). Location data were collected for all thirteen campus affiliated facilities housing livestock. K-State does not plan to relocate any of their operations when the NBAF opens [Odde, 2011].

This dataset is FOUO and cannot be provided in this report. The data were used to estimate the number of animals of each species to be placed at the veterinary hospital in the NAADSM model. In the 2010 SSRA, the K-State Veterinary Hospital was included in the animal population dataset, but this was not specifically stated in the write-up. The Updated SSRA improves on the treatment of this facility by including an evidence based population, but the dataset is smaller than would be desired. Furthermore, mixed species production types were not developed for the Updated SSRA. So, when multiple species of animals were reported at the same facility, these were incorporated into the model as individual production type populations sharing a geographic location (see Table 26). This approach significantly underestimates the spread of FMD between species because the production type parameterization does not typically allow for contact between different species. For example, cows and sheep at the veterinary hospital would not be able to contact each other and spread disease because they are parameterized as Beef (BY-SS) and Small Ruminant (BY-SS), which have no contact with each other. A6-34 K-State Dairy Unit Based on 2009 data, the dairy unit numbers vary from 484 to 515. The unit keeps a consistent number of animals on site for most of the year. The facility is open for public tours and is used for teaching. It is likely that a sick animal would be quickly identified[Hollis, 2011]. K-State Stocker Unit Based on 2009 data, the stocker unit numbers vary from 0 (January to March) to 720 (July). The unit includes 1,120 acres. Animals are purchased at various area markets by Pratt Feedyard, who provide the animals to K-State for their use but ownership remains with Pratt Feedyard. The animals are returned to Pratt Feedyard for finishing. The facility is used for teaching, and animal disease would be identified and reported quickly [Hollis, 2011]. K-State Feedlot Unit Based on 2009 data, the feedlot unit numbers varies from 300 (November to February) to 1400 (May to August). Animals are purchased at various area markets by Ward Feedlot and brought to K-State for finishing. They are owned by Ward Feedlot and managed by the K-State staff. They are shipped to the Tyson plant in Garden City, Kansas. The facility is used for teaching, and animal disease would be identified and reported quickly [Hollis, 2011]. K-State Purebred Unit Two locations make up the Purebred unit. One unit is located next to the NBAF, and this facility typically houses about 100 head and is used to finish bulls and for the annual purebred sale in March. In 2011, 127 head were sold at the sale [Hollis, 2011]. The second facility, referred to as Cedar Creek, houses the remaining animals: 700-750 cows, calves, bulls, steers, and gomers. Between January and April cows calve, and then spend May to November on grass. Between September and December calves are weaned and 200-300 calves are shipped to K-State campus. 300 animals stay at the farm all of the time, but heifers are moving to and from campus on a regular basis. Animals at this location are owned by K-State, are bred at the facility and are sold at an annual sale to producers in multiple states (2 011). K-State Cow-Calf Unit Based on 2009 data, the Manhattan cow-calf unit numbers varies from 219 to 613. The K-State herd numbers are fairly consistent with the variation in numbers occurring because K-State utilizes ground in Geary and Ellis counties. The Geary county property is used from June through November and the Ellis county property is used in November and December. Numbers increase during calving season. Animals are owned by K-State and are bred at the facility. Animals are sold at by private sale and through markets to various states. The facility is used for teaching, and animal disease would be identified and reported quickly [Hollis, 2011]. A6-35 K-State Sheep and Goat Unit In May 2011, the sheep and goat unit housed 329 sheep and 40 goats; seasonal information was not obtained but the monthly inventory numbers would likely increase during lambing and kidding season. A new facility for the goat and sheep unit is currently under construction in roughly the same location and the flock is likely to increase in size once this building is complete. Animals are owned by K-State and are bred at the facility. The facility is used for teaching, and animal disease would be identified and reported quickly [Hollis, 2011]. K-State Swine Unit Based on 2009 data, the K-State Swine unit numbers vary from 1,383 to 1,808, with an average of 1507 per month. The facility is used year round and hog numbers remain fairly consistent month to month. This is a farrow to finish unit. It includes indoor and outdoor animal production facilities. Animals are shipped to slaughter once they reach market weight. The facility is used for teaching, and animal disease would be identified and reported quickly [Hollis, 2011]. K-State Early Weaning Unit This unit is run separately from the K-State Swine unit. No human or animal movement occurs between the two sites. Four hundred piglets are housed at the site. Piglets remain there for 9 weeks. Once a batch is moved out, a new batch of 400 arrives. Animals are owned and provided by a commercial hog operation in Kansas, and they are returned to the commercial operations for finishing. The facility is used for teaching, and animal disease would be identified and reported quickly [Hollis, 2011]. Reynolds Ranch Reynolds Ranch is split by highway 177; the herd on the east side runs around 900 head of cattle and the herd on the west side runs around 35 head of cattle. As part of grazing studies, half of the east herd grazes from May till October and the other half from May till July. The animals on the west side of the highway graze from May 1 to October 1. Animals are supplied by two private producers, one in Geary County and the other from northeast Kansas. Animals are owned by the producer that provides them, but they are managed by K-State while at Reynolds Ranch . Animals are shipped to private feedlots, with many destined for one feedlot in Beloit, Kansas. Staff observes animals daily to collect data on grazing patterns. While they do check animals health, this is not always their first priority [Owensby, 2011]. Kansas Artificial Breeding Service Unit (KABSU) KABSU animal numbers are highly variable throughout the year, ranging from 6-25 bulls per month. Bulls come to the facility for semen collection, some stay a few weeks and other stay several months. Almost all bulls at the facility come from Kansas (~95%), although occasionally bulls come to the facility from Montana and Oklahoma. Animals are regularly observed by veterinarians who would recognize and report a FAD immediately. There is some movement of animals between KABSU and the Veterinary School [Taul, 2011].

Large Animal Research Facility (LARF) The L ARF is a research facility that does not maintain a herd of animals. The number of animals at the LARF varies depending on research needs. The average head of cattle on site is around 20-25, but could range from 0-60. Cattle will stay for weeks or months. There are months when no cattle will be on site. The monthly average for head of pigs is between 25-30, with a range from 0-200. Goats are seldom kept on site, but five goats could be on site [Marlow, 2011]. A6.2.5 Concentrated Animal Feeding Permit (CAFO) D ata Collection and Standardization CAFO datasets were obtained from Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Texas, and Colorado through communication with responsible state agencies (Table 26). A6.2.5.1 Formatting CAFO datasets were uniformly provided as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets; however, each CAFO dataset came uniquely formatted. Therefore, all CAFO datasets were standardized into a format useful for the NAADSM model. The standardized datasets included fields for herd size, latitude, longitude, and a herd ID number (Table 27). CAFO data were occasionally incomplete, and when possible the missing data were extrapolated. A6-37 Some CAFO datasets listed multiple entries for the same permit-holder. In some cases duplicate entries were obviously artifacts from older datasets, and these entries were removed. In other cases, dataset providers indicated that duplicate entries represented single facilities with multiple clusters of buildings or multiple waste storage areas. For these facilities, all livestock were merged onto the location/listing with the greatest headcount. A6.2.5.2 Herd Size Another consideration was that CAFO permit actual number of livestock present at the time of permitting. According to KDHE, dairies typically operate at 97% of maximum permitted capacity, swine facilities at 97.5%, and feedlots at about 85% maximum capacity. The herd size at each of these facilities was reduced accordingly. A6.2.5.3 Location Most facilities listed in CAFO datasets were accompanied by geo coordinates in latitude and longitude format. In instances where datasets did not contain latitude and longitude coordinates, but did contain addresses, an online geocoding tool was used ( http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocoder/ ) to convert addresses to coordinates. One CAFO dataset listed coordinates in UTM Northing and UTM Easting format. These coordinates were converted to longitude and latitude using the tool available at http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/usefuldata/utmformulas.htm . A6.2.5.4 City-Based Facility Removal It became apparent that in some cases business address es were used for CAFO permits and Dunn & Bradstreet (D&B) listings. In an attempt to remove some of these addresses from each dataset, all facilities that fell within the city limits of the ten largest cities for each state (by population, based on U.S. Census data) were removed from the dataset. Each city was mapped using Google Earth Pro overlay image feature, which is an overlay that provides zip code boundaries of U.S. cities [USNaviguide, 2009]. Because the Naviguide website uses Google Maps to outline cities, the overlay image matched the Google Earth Pro map well. Figure 9 is an example of a city boundary map generated for Manhattan, Kansas. The city boundary is outlined in dark grey and is based on zip codes. The image was copied from the website using the Snipping Tool and imported into Google Earth Pro as an overlay image. Once the image was adjusted and aligned to the Google Earth Pro map, the polygon tool was used to trace the outline of the city boundary. The overlay image was easily matched to the Google Earth Pro region. This procedure was used to create accurate, complete outlines of the ten most populated cities in each state. A6-38 Figure 9: Manhattan, Kansas, outlined by U.S. Naviguide LLC Program The maptools package in R was used to identify and remove facilities falling within the city limits of the ten most populated cities in each state. The maptools package allowed for a simpl e assessment of geographic coordinates on the basis of an 'in/out' algorithm. A6.2.5.5 Production Type CAFO permit listings specified both the number and type of livestock produced by each permit holder. Facilities without relevant livestock types or location information were removed from all CAFO datasets, and facilities housing multiple livestock types were classified based on the most prevalent livestock type. CAFO facilities were classified as dairies, feedlots, cow-calf facilities, swine producers, or goat and sheep producers. Although most states only require large facilities to obtain permits, some CAFO listings also included small and medium sized CAFOs. Farms with fewer than 250 swine or fewer than 3000 cattle were classified as small swine facilities and small feedlots. Similarly, facilities with fewer than ten animals were classified as backyard swine, backyard beef, or as backyard small ruminant facilities, which produce goats and sheep. However these facilities were extremely rare in CAFO datasets, since they do not produce significant amounts of wastewater runoff. A6.2.6 Dunn & Bradstreet data collection and standardization A6.2.6.1 Herd Size D&B herd sizes were assigned during the merge of the D&B dataset with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL) dataset, and as described in Appendix Section A6.2.9.3. A6-39 Table 28: SIC Codes by Livestock Type SIC Code SIC Description Updated SSRA classification 211 Beef Cattle Feedlots Feedlot 241 Dairy farms Dairy 212 Cattle, except feedlots, which were assigned as Cow -Calf Cow -Calf facilities 213 Hogs Swine 214 Sheep/goats Sheep/Goat 291 Animal production, NEC General livestock, NEC Mixed Livestock Mixed Livestock 219 A6.2.6.2 Location Each D&B business listing is accompanied by a set of geo coordinates. As with CAFO permits, it was obvious that some locations were business addresses. As a result, facilities were removed from the dataset if they fell within the borders of the ten largest cities in Kansas, as described in the CAFO data standardization section (Appendix Section A6.2.12.2 ). A6.2.6.3 Production Type In order to assign animal production types to D&B facilities, all listings were first sorted by their SIC codes. Facilities with SIC codes for specific animal types were assumed to derive all revenue from these livestock and were assigned production types accordingly (Table 28). Similarly, facilities with SIC codes denoting general livestock production were assumed to produce some number of cattle, hogs, sheep, and goats. Since D&B datasets do not specify how many of each livestock type a general livestock facility holds, these fa cilities were assigned production types based on the overall composition of livestock farms at the state level. In 2007, LLNL produced datasets for each state, which attempted to account for all livestock and livestock facilities by county and by production type. The LLNL datasets, which were based ! (!) 2007 the proportion of all farms holding cattle, swine, sheep, and goats for each primary region state. These proportions were then applied to the list of D&B general livestock facilities such that the breakdown of facility types in this group mirrored the composition of farms in the statewide LLNL dataset. As an example, in the Missouri D&B dataset, there were 513 facilities producing multiple livestock types, or whose primary products were not livestock, for which livestock production types needed to be assigned. To do this, all of the farms listed in the Missouri LLNL dataset were broken down by livestock type to determine the proportions of facilities in Missouri that hold cattle, swine, goats, and sheep. The 513 mixed livestock facilities were then multiplied by these state-wide proportions to determine how many facilities should be assigned each production type (Table 29). A6-40 Table 29: Assigning Livestock Types to D&B mixed facilities Livestock Production # of Facilities Prop of Total Mixed D&B Assignments Type Facilities - Cow Calf 43,393 0.82 =513*0.82 419 Dairy 9 Total 53,079 1 513 While it is assumed that SIC codes specify the primary activity of a given facility, D&B datasets provide add itional information about secondary products and business activities as short business descriptions. Many facilities that are primarily crop farms according to their SIC codes also list specific or general livestock types in their business description fields. Once facilities with livestock-oriented SIC codes were removed from the master list, the business description fields of the remaining listings were searched by keyword for specific livestock types. Keyword searches were performed for dair , sheep, swine, except feedlot operations , and cattle operations . Because livestock were not their primary products, facilities identified in this manner were classified as backyard operations. The only exceptions were dairies. Finally, keyword searches were performed on the business description fields of remaining entries for terms indicating general livestock production. General livestock facilities identified in this way were assigned production types based on the overall composition of livestock farms in Kansas. A6.2.7 LLNL Dataset Assessment A6.2.7.1 Selecting Sample Counties for Data Analysis Four states in the modeled region (Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Colorado) were analyzed to determine how accurately the LLNL simulated farm location file matched the NASS data on which it was based. For each state, analysis was performed on the counties with the greatest and least number of cattle, swine, sheep, and goats, as well as counties with the greatest and least number of each facility type . These counties were selected to test how well the LLNL dataset accounted for areas with both high and low animal and facility densities. Additionally, analysis was performed to determine how the LLNL dataset ! ! \u0012 s in accounting for facilities of different sizes. A6.2.7.2 County Level Analysis For each livestock facility, LLNL lists location information as geo coordinates. In order to compare the ! -level data, it was necessary to place these geo coordinates in the appropriate counties. This was done by drawing polygons around each county of interest in Google Earth Pro, and then using an R script sourcing the maptools package to list all LLNL facilities with A6-41 Tab le 30: Compar NL and by Animal tion (Head o f Animal ) Livestock Cattle Swin e Goats Sheep State County LLNL/NASS LLNL/NASS LLNL/NASS LLNL/NASS Kansas Least 91.93 100 100 100 86.42 Median 97.82 117.86 100 131.09 Nebraska 98.79 95.94 95.56 100 85.24 Median 108.00 99.97 100 100 Colorado Least 95.24 100 100 100 Most 99.31 100 100 100.01 Median 100 coordinates falling inside these polygons. An Excel spreadsheet was then created for each county listing all livestock facilities in that county. A6.2.7.3 Comparison County-level data from LLNL and NASS were compared on the basis of both livestock type and herd size. For cattle, swine, goats, and sheep, LLNL and NASS datasets were compared to determine the percentage of NASS livestock population was accounted for by the LLNL dataset. The same was done to determine the percentage of NASS livestock facilities that were accounted for by LLNL. The LLNL and NASS proportions for each county analyzed were calculated and multiplied by 100 to achieve a percentage. The data is presented in Table 30 below, where 100% represents the LLNL and NASS data being equal, percentages greater than 100 represent LLNL accounting for more head of livestock than NASS, and percentages less than 100 represent LLNL accounting for fewer head of livestock than NASS. The datasets were also analyzed to determine how closely the LLNL and NASS data agreed on the n umber of facilities. The percentage of NASS facilities accounted for by the LLNL data is presented in Table 31. As with the livestock data, the facility data showing the greatest disagreement between the two datasets is from the counties with very few facilities. In the Colorado county with the least cattle facilities, the LLNL data account for 300% of the NASS data, yet reflect a difference of only 2 facilities.

A6.2.8.2 Location No conversation was needed for LLNL location . A6.2.8.3 Production Type The LLNL dataset was created with production types that were similar to the production types used for the Updated SSRA, but some translation was necessary (Table 32).

In order to maintain this accuracy and take advantage of the increased accuracy of facility locations provided by the other datasets collected, a multistep merge process was performed . For each facility that was added from the CAFO, D&B, K-State, and local survey datasets, one facility was removed from the LLNL dataset. The methods used aimed to choose a facility for removal that matched the herd size, location, and production type for the facility that would replace it as closely as possible. The exception to this approach was the procedure followed for the facilities identified within a 6.2-mile radius of the NBAF site. That survey should have identified every location in that region, so all LLNL, CAFO, and D &B farms were removed from that area and replaced with the locations identified near the NBAF. A6.2.9.1 Creating Local Area Population F iles Each dataset was broken down into a local area population file, which accounted for about 1/12 of the area of each state. This helped to maintain the regional accuracy of the LLNL population file as it was merged with the datasets used in this assessment. Shape files were generated in Google Earth Pro, which roughly divided each state into 12 regions using a 3X4 grid (Figure 10). These shape files were imported as KML files into the R environment, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics [Team, 2011]. The point.in.polygon function from the R maptools package was applied to each population file to established which geographical locations fell within the boundaries of the generated polygon. A6-44 Figure 10: Google Earth Pro 3x4 Generated Grid A6.2.9.2 Dunn & Bradstreet and CAFO duplicate check R was used to remove D&B facilities that duplicated CAFO facilities based on geo-coordinates. Each state was divided into 12 F \u0012!F D&\u0011 was approximated; if two farm areas overlapped, one of the farms was removed (the D&B farm), as it was likely a duplicate. To determine farm area, the plotrix package in R was used to draw circular areas around each. The radii of these areas were calculated using herd sizes and animal densities specific for each production type (Table 33). Densities were calculated using NASS 2007 Census State Data reporting average farm size (acres) and median herd size for each production type for the state of Kansas . An example of this process can be seen in Figure 11, which shows the generation of simulated farm areas in the R environment. Table 33: Head to Area Ratio # Cow -Calf / acre # Beef cattle/ acre # Dairy / acre # Swine / acre # Small Ruminants / acre 0.2169893 0.13001 0.252163 Farm A6-45 A6.2.9.3 The Dunn & Bradstreet and LLNL Merge For each production type in each local area population file (generated as described above), the D&B and LLNL facilities were sorted by revenue and herd size, respectively, and the corresponding percentiles were calculated. For example, the largest LLNL facility is the 100th percentile and the smallest facility is the 0th percentile. Likewise, the D&B facility with the highest revenue is the 100th percentile and the facility with the lowest revenue is the 0th percentile. For each D&B facility, an LLNL facility of the same production type, percentile, and grid was identified, and the D&B coordinates were assigned to that LLNL facility. On rare occasions there were more D&B facilities for a specific production type than LLNL facilities. D&B facilities that could not be matched with LLNL facilities of the appropriate size and production type were removed from the dataset. A6.2.9.4 Division of CAFO into Large and Small Subsets CAFO operations were divided into two subsets: small CAFOs and large CAFOs. Small CAFOs were permitted facilities that fell below the legal cutoff for that operation type, whereas all large CAFOs were at or above the permitted population (Table 34). Dairies with less than 700 head were classified as small CAFOs and dairies with more than 701 head were classified as large CAFOs. In terms of cattle facilities, including feedlots and cow-calf, facilities 1000 head were designated as small CAFOs; facilities > 1001 head were designated as large CAFOs. O ften CAFO datasets characterized goats and sheep in a single category defined as small ruminants or the equivalent. The final Updated SSRA distinguishes between goats and sheep given the practices affecting contact rate and other parameters associated with these production types. As a means of establishing distinct production types for these facilities, statewide percentiles were established based on the LLNL dataset following production type translation. For example, in Kansas, goats and sheep were often combined into a single production type. By definition, CAFO facilities were large enough to cause waste runoff, making a designation of BY-SS production type inappropriate. Based on LLNL state specific percentiles, 70% of facilities combining the small ruminant population in Kansas were sheep and 30% of the small ruminant population were attributed to goats. Table 34: CAFO Operation Division for Population File Creation Small CAFO subset Large CAFO subset Dairy < 700 Dairy > 700 Cattle < 1000 Cattle > 1000 Swine< 10000 Swine > 10000 Rum < 10000 Rum > 10000 CAFO cutoffs were established using data generated through SES interviews. Sorting datasets into small and large CAFOs utilized the Microsoft Excel sort function. Generated small CAFO and large CAFO datasets subsequently underwent alternative merge methods. The small CAFO and large CAFO interim datasets were subjected to individual merge processes described in detail below. A6-46 A6.2.9.5 Small CAFO Addition Each state was broken into 12 regions by drawing a 3x4 grid, as described above. For each CAFO facilit y in a grid sector, an LLNL facility with the same production type and herd size from that grid was removed. If there were no exact matches, the size requirement for facilities larger than 85 animals was relaxed from an exact match to a \u00b1 1% range, \u00b1 5% range, \u00b1 10% range, and finally a \u00b1 20% range if needed. The size requirement for facilities smaller than 85 animals was relaxed from an exact match to a \u00b11 range, \u00b15 range, \u00b110 range, and finally a \u00b120 range. The size ranges of specific production types were ignored so that, for example, a KDHE Feedlot(S) facility with a herd size close to the Feedlot(L) cutoff could be matched with either a Feedlot(S) or Feedlot(L) LLNL facility. Any KDHE facilities not able to be matched even at a \u00b120 or \u00b120% size rang e remained in the final dataset. While this resulted in a greater number of animals and facilities in the final Updated SSRA population file, this was determined to be an acceptable discrepancy given the evidence basis supporting the addition of these locations. A6.2.9.6 Large CAFO Addition Following the percentile based merge all facilities in the subset LLNL and D&B dataset over the established large CAFO cutoff were removed and replaced with the subset large CAFO dataset. This step was justified given that at a specific size facilities are legally required to have a state permit. Legal requirements for state livestock permits provide an evidence basis for the exclusion of LLNL and D&B facilities over the established cutoff in favor of large CAFO facilities. A6.2.9.7 Backyard Addition As described above, the LLNL and D&B population files were broken into 12 regions, for BY- SS production types in each dataset, coordinates corresponding to D&B facilities falling within the same geographically distinct areas were used to randomly replace LLNL coordinates. A6.2.9.8 Adjustment of Overlapping CAFO and LLNL Farms Using the same approach described above to identify duplicate D&B locations, LLNL locations that D&\u0011 \u0012!F ns were identified. The maptools package was used to identify any LLNL facilities falling within approximated areas of the CAFO facilities . The longitude and latitude of LLNL facilities falling within the area of were adjusted by the diameter of the CAFO f For example, facilities in the northeast quadrant of the state were moved in a southwest direction; facilities in the northwest quadrant of the state were moved in a southeast direction; facilities in the southeast quadrant of the state were moved in a northwest direction; and finally, facilities in the southwest quadrant of the state were moved in a northeast direction. A.6.2.9.9 Replacement of 6.2-Mile Survey Region In order to provide the most accurate information regarding the potential risk posed by the release of FMDv, all facilities within 6.2 miles of the proposed NBAF site were removed and replaced with the facilities identified by surveys and K-State interviews (described earlier in this section). The maptools package in R was used to identify and remove facilities falling within 6.2-miles of the NBAF. This code was nearly identical city based facility removal (discussed above) . A 6.2-mile radius w as generated using the NBAF coordinates as the centroid with the \"circle-draw\" tool of Google Earth Pro. Sixty facilities were removed and replaced with 54 facilities, represented by 66 herds. A6-47 Tab le 35: Model ing File Analysis Total Animals Total Facilities vs. NASS and LLNL Files The final Updated SSRA population file for Kansas was compared to the NASS census results and the LLNL dataset, to show that the Updated SSRA file maintains the animal populations and total facilities described in these datasets (Table 35, Figure 12, and Figure 13). In terms of total number of facilities, the Updated SSRA matches both LLNL and NASS quite closely. For both cattle and swine, the Updated SSRA includes a greater number of animals in the population dataset than predicted by LLNL or NASS. This is almost entirely due to concentrated animal feed operation dataset, which is the most accurate dataset available on large animal populations. It was impossible to incorporate the CAFO dataset in the Kansas population without exceeding the NASS population estimate. While the NASS census has impressive producer participation, it is voluntary (where as CAFO permits are legally required), so the NASS dataset may be underestimating larger producers. The Updated SSRA file was also compared against the 2010 SSRA file to show the improvement of the population modeled for the Updated SSRA. The Updated SSRA population file is a more accurate representation of animal populations than the 2010 SSRA population file because it incorporates data from additional sources that help capture small producers. The Updated SSRA also incorporates new production types, goats and sheep.

The latter encompasses both of what NAADSM refers to as the subclinical and clinical periods. Assuming that the duration of the infectious period is equal to the duration of the subclinical and clinical periods, the A6-49 difference between the two distributions gives the length of the clinical period. The clinical period was estimated for each species. Using a stochastic simulation, values from the subclinical period distribution and from the infectious period distribution were drawn. For each set of drawn values, the subclinical period was subtracted from the infectious period to give a value for the duration of the clinical period. If this value was negative, then it was invalid, and was discarded. This was repeated until 10,000 valid values were produced, and those values were fitted to a distributio n using @Risk. This distribution represents the duration of the clinical period. This approach assumes that the length of the subclinical period is independent of the length of the clinical period, an assumption that is probably not true. However, sufficient information on this relationship was not available, and so it could not be incorporated into this approach. A6.2.12 Within-Herd Model Generated Parameters A6.2.12.1 Within-Herd Model In order to develop unit-level disease spread characteristics appropriate for the production types and populations specific to the datasets used in this assessment , the within-herd model (version 0.9.6) was used. This model captures animal-level variation and within-herd dynamics and was developed by Colorado State Universi ! H The model was used to develop state- specific disease and detection parameters for each production type. The within-herd model is a stochastic, state transition model that simulates disease spread through a single herd, taking into account variation in disease phases for individual animals. Like NAADSM, the model operation on daily time steps for a user specified number of iterations. Probability distributions for species specific disease phase durations [Mardones, 2010] state specific production type populations distributions, and within-herd animal- to-animal contact rates (CEAH 2011) are entered into the modeling tool. For every iteration, each infected individual within the herd progresses through the latent, subclinical, and clinical states, and these data are used to determine herd level disease phase durations. Depending on the number of initially infected animals in the latent state, the duration of the latent phase extends from the day of first infection in the herd to the first time any of the latent animals transitions to the subclinical phase. The subclinical phase extends from the day of the first subclinical infection to the first time any of the subclinical animals transitions to the clinical state. The clinical state lasts from the day of first clinical infection to the day that the last animal completes its clinical phase. Then the immune phase for the herd begins. The phase duration values resulting from each iteration are a model output that is then processed in Excel to obtain unit-level latent, subclinical, and clinical phase duration distributions. The within-herd modeling tool also calculates the number of infected individuals per disease phase for each day the herd is considered infected. These outputs were used to calculate the unit-level probability of infection curves and the observation curves. Setting Up and Running the Model A within-herd model was developed for each production type population in each state modeled, including: disease phase spread, within-herd prevalence spread, and detection functions. Within-herd A6-50 model simulations were run for 1,000 iterations for each production type, unless this process took longer than 24 hours to complete, because for this assessment simulations that took longer than this F ( ) the Reeves-Talbert approximation was applied (a model setting) or the number of iterations were shortened to 500. The within-unit prevalence output option was set to display data describing infected (latent, subclinical, and clinical) individuals. The within-herd input parameters for Kansas are described in this section; for input parameters for all other states, see A ppendix Section A6.2.12.2. Parameters Entered into Within-Herd Model: Origin and Development Within-herd model input parameters included: state specific population distributions, initial disease state of each animal (latent, subclinical, clinical), adequate exposures per time step, and animal-level disease phase functions. Population distribution functions were produced for each state, for each production type, using the population file described in Appendix Section A6.2.12. 2..

Initially latent animals were represented by a uniform function with a range of 1 to 5, which allowed a random selection of one to five latent animals to start the disease outbreak. The selection of a uniform (1,5) function to represent initially latent animals was based on USDA 2011 parameters, based on the assumption that infected shipments of animals may have more than one latent individual. Subclinical and clinical animals were represented with fixed zero-point functions, which established an initial condition of zero subclinical and clinical animals within the herd population. These initial state parameters were the same for every production type and across all states. The adequate exposures per time step parameters were used universally for each state model. These parameters are specific for each production type and were based on the within- herd contact rate distributions developed in USDA 2011, based on conversations with commodity experts from the National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS). The exposure functions describing each production type used in the Kansas model are shown in Table 36. Table 36: Adequate Exposures Per Time Step Production Type Adequate Exposures Per Time Step Cow Calf SS) Beta(5,2,1,99) The animal-level disease phase functions (subclinical, clinical, and immune) were species-specific and taken cumulatively from two expert documents, USDA 2011 and the Mardones paper on the parameterization of FMD [Mardones, 2010]. The animal-level disease phase distributions that were used to develop the Kansas herd-level distributions are shown in Table 37.

Hypergeometric calculations were performed in Excel on within-herd model data to develop within-herd prevalence and detection functions. The program, @Risk, was used to create probability distribution functions (PDFs) for latent, subclinical, and clinical disease phases. The state-specific parameters were used as input values for the herd-level modeling in NAADSM. Disease State Parameters For each production type, disease phase PDFs were fit to the herd-level state duration data produced by the within-herd model. For each iteration, the model provided the duration in days of each disease phase (latent, subclinical, clinical) for a population sampled from the state-specific animal population distributions. A frequency analysis, in Microsoft Excel 2010, determined how often a particular duration occurred within the modeling set for each disease phase. Data were binned according to duration period A6-56 - - - - - Tab le 38: Kan sas Herd Level Diseas e State Paramet ers Production Types Latent Subclinical Clinical 1) G(=930 =90) (days). most production types, the latent and subclinical period bins stretched from 0-20 days with sin gle day increments, and the clinical bins ranged from 0-40 days with single day increments. For each disease phase, the @Risk distribution function fitting tool was used to fit PDFs to binned herd-level disease phase duration data, based on minimizing root-mean squared error. The fitted distributions were un-normalized density functions with a lower fixed limit of zero and no bounding on the upper limit. The immune phase functions were taken from USDA 2011, as described in the Section 6.1.4.3 (NAADSM modeling parameter development and data collection). The disease progression parameters developed for Kansas are shown in Table 38. Within-Unit Prevalence Curves P roduction-type specific within-unit prevalence curves were developed from the within-herd prevalence data produced by the within-herd model. The within-herd prevalence data provided the proportion of infected individuals (latent, subclinical, clinical) at each time step (day). For each day of the outbreak period, an average prevalence of infection (proportion of animals in the herd infected) was calculated across all iterations. An estimated number of infected individuals were calculated for each day by multiplying the mean prevalence of infection by the state-specific median herd size. In order to inform direct contact spread more accurately, the impact that shipments and their size would have on the chance of contact with an infected animal was incorporated into the calculations. The probability of A6-57 exactly zero clinical animals being shipped on each day was then determined by applying the hypergeometric function in Equation 1 to the estimated number of animals infected. Equation 1 . The hypergeometric calculation provides the probability of at least one clinical animal being shipped each day , n is median shipment size, P t is probability of shipping at least one infected animal given prevalence within the herd, N is median herd size, and t is a given day. # ## ! \"!!% #\" $\"\" !&!\" # !! # The probability of at least one clinical animal being shipped outside the herd was obtained, for each day, by subtracting the probability of zero clinical animals being shipped from 1. The probabilities, presented as percentages, were plotted against time in days and entered as within-herd prevalence curves in NAADSM (Table 39). It should be noted that there is an inherent weakness in this approach that may have an effect in the model. The within-unit prevalence curves entered into NAADSM are used to inform spread that is a result of direct contact and airborne. The approach above incorporates the impact of shipments on infection transfer in direct contact. However airborne spread is not limited by shipment size, therefore application of the same curve may be slightly inaccurate for airborne spread. If the hypergeometric function was not applied to account for shipment sizes, the application to direct contact would be less accurate and the application to airborne would be more accurate. The Updated SSRA team assumed that direct contact would have more impact in the model and subsequently decided that it would require the more accurate application of the within-unit prevalence curve.

The problem with this approach is that both observation and reporting behavior change after an outbreak is announced. The approach used by the Updated SSRA team the relatively complex producer behavior in both observation and reporting in the model prior to the declaration of an outbreak. T point forward. The obs and rep fx takes into account: the prevalence of symptomatic disease in the herd the frequency with which producers observe their animals the number of animals a producer observes at a time the probability that a producer would call a veterinarian after observing symptoms The detection functions are applied to every herd that becomes clinical. The obs and rep fx will always start on the day the herd moves to the clinical state. To reflect change in producer behavior once an !!D is used as a modifier. The modifier function always begins on the day of first detection for all herds and applies a multiplicative value that occurs the number of days the day of observation occurs after the outbreak becomes public knowledge. obs and rep fx To determine the prevalence of symptomatic disease, the within-herd model was used to estimate the within-unit prevalence of clinically infectious animals for each state and production type. Similar to within-unit prevalence curve parameter development, for each day of the outbreak period, an average prevalence of clinically infectious animals (proportion of animals in the herd infected) was calculated across all iterations. For each day, the number of clinical animals was calculated by multiplying the average prevalence of clinically infectious animals by the median herd size. Given the prevalence of clinical animals within the herd, the probability that a producer would actually observe a clinical animal on a given day depends on the frequency with which a producer observes his/her animals and the number of animals a producer observes at a time. Production type specific producer observation behavior (frequency and sample size) was based on SME opinion and a small producer survey dataset shown in Table 40 (see also Appendix Sections A6.2.2, A6.2.13, and A6.2.14).

Equation 2: Equation estimating the probability that day t is an inspection day for a production type with a given inspection period T ! \" ! \" # &! \" ! \" ! !! ! \" \" For example, the inspection period for a Kansas cow-calf was determined to be weekly (every 7 days). Application of the formula to this weekly rate of inspection is provided in Table 41. If the first day of an outbreak is the inspection day, then the probability of inspection is 1/7. If the producer inspects a clinical herd on the second day, the probability increases to 1/6 and further until day seven when the probability is 1, as the producer is known to definitely inspect the herd at least once a week. Assuming the producer inspects the herd on a regular schedule, the producer will inspect the animals on the same day the next week with a probability of one. With some production types, different parts of the herd A6-63 Table 41: Probability Of Inspection Day The probability that a given day after a herd first shows clinical signs is an inspection day for a production type that inspects once a week : Start in the upper table and see what the probability is for that day being an inspection day .

In these situations, the daily average was taken from the portions in spected and the probability of that portion being inspected on that day. The second part of this calculation determines the probability that a producer would see a sick animal if the herd was inspected, taking into account the prevalence of clinical animals in a herd, herd size, and the size of the inspected sample. The herd size was estimated by the median value for each production type, for each state. The probability of exactly zero clinical animals being observed on each observation day was determined by applying the hypergeometric function (Equation 3) to the prevalence of clinical animals. The probability of at least one clinical animal being observed was then obtained by subtracting the probability of zero clinical animals being observed from 1. Equation 3 : The probability of observing a clinical animal, where C t is the prevalence of clinical signs, N is median herd size, and n is sample size # \" !&!! \"! ! % #\" $\"\" !&!\" !! # It was assumed that if a producer observed a clinical animal, they would clearly recognize it as a sick animal based on SME input. Therefore the probability that a producer will observe a sick animal on a given day is the product of the probability that a given day is the inspection day (Equation 2) and the probability a producer will see and recognize a sick animal given that day is the inspection day (Equation 3). This product is represented in Equation 4, where t is the given day.

Data that characterized producer delays in notifying a veterinarian once sickness was observed were obtained through a survey administered to large animal and mixed practice veterinarians across Kansas (see Appendix Section A6.2.12.2). Based on these data, producer population was divided into three distinct groups: quick reporting, slow reporting, or non-reporting. Quick reporting was defined as contacting a veterinarian immediately after observing clinical signs, and slow reporting was defined as waiting four days after observation to contact a veterinarian. To account for delays in the veterinarian visiting, and potentially in the veterinarian recognizing the disease as FMD, a two day delay was added to all groups. The probability that a producer will observe a clinical animal on a given day (Equation 4) was weighted according to these reporting behaviors (Equation 5). Table 43 provides an example of how all of these steps were applied to the average cow-calf clinical prevalence data to arrive at an obs and rep fx. Equation 5: obs and rep fx: This function represented the probability of observing and reporting a sick animal prior to FMD becoming public knowledge, on any day t with a given proportion of producers S that report slowly and a proportion of producers F that report fast : If (t-6) or ( t-4) was less than 1, then ! ! ! or !! ! was set to 0.01 : This constraint was made so that the probability of observing and reporting was never equal to zero. # \" ! \"! # \" ! ! # # \" !! # A6-65 - Table 43: Example Of Calculations For Detection In A Cow Calf Herd Days Average Prev. p(0) p(at P(day is P(obs) 20% would 80% prob official within least 1) inspection call at first would outbreak Herd day) sign (2 delay 6 starts days) days 1 0.0002 0 1 0 0.14 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.02 2 0.0025 0 1 0 0.17 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.02 3 0.0093 1 0 1 0.20 0.20 0.01 0.01 0.02 4 0.0234 2 0 1 0.25 0.25 0.01 0.01 0.02 5 0.0554 4 0 1 0.33 0.33 0.04 0.01 0.05 6 0.1064 9 0 1 0.50 0.50 0.05 0.01 0.06 7 0.1714 14 0 1 1.00 1.00 0.07 0.01 0.08 8 0.2396 19 0 1 1.00 1.00 0.10 0.01 0.11 9 0.2964 24 0 1 1.00 1.00 0.20 0.16 0.36 10 0.3338 27 0 1 1.00 1.00 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.80 1.00 Modifier Function As a state d earlier, the obs and rep fx provides the probability that a producer will observe and report FMD once his herd shows symptoms. Day one of this function is new for each herd, since it begins when the herd becomes clinical. However, if knowledge of the outbreak is public, the probability of a producer observing and reporting once the herd shows symptoms is assumed to increase. The modifier function represents this increase as a multiplicative factor. The value of the factor changes as time progresses from the day the outbreak is common knowledge. In NAADSM, the day the outbreak occurs is equivalent to the day the first herd has been observed and reported; it is the day the first infected herd is detected and when the multiplicative factor is 1. All subsequent herds that are observed and reported A6-66 will be impacted by the multiplicative factor that occurs later in the modifier function, after the day the first herd was detected. To create the modifier function, the Updated SSRA team estimated a few functions describing observation and reporting given that an FMD outbreak has been detected and publicized. Based on SME input, it was assumed that knowledge of an outbreak would cause producers to report sick animals immediately to public health officials or a veterinarian and that producers would observe their herds daily. The probability that an infected herd is observed and reported after the outbreak is declared wa s considered to be equal to the probability of observing a clinical animal given inspection because immediate reporting post outbreak notification was assumed (Equation 4). The maximum effect of a public outbreak announcement on producer behavior was assumed to be the value whose product with Equation 5 approximately equals Equation 4. A two day delay was added to the modifier function to account for the time required to publicize the outbreak. Thus, the modifying function was 100% for the first two days following an outbreak announcement, to account for the delay in reporting. Following that, it was equal to the multiplier for all remaining days. The value of the multiplier represents the maximum effect of a public outbreak announcement on producer behavior. This modifying function was entered as the state-specific reporting function in NAADSM. The resultant overall detection probability is thus equal to the probability of detection prior to first detection for the index case and for the first two days after first detection. Beyond the first two days after first detection, the overall detection function includes the maximum effect of public outbreak announcement on producer behavior. Both Kansas observation and reporting functions in raw data form are shown below for each production type.

For each production type, large animal veterinarians were asked estimate the probability that producers would exhibit the following behaviors animal infected with foot-and mouth disease in their herd: Producer would call a veterinarian at the first signs of sickness Producer would try to treat observed symptoms before calling a veterinarian Producer would wait to see if the symptoms went away on their own Producer would call a veterinarian when the producer-treatment or waiting did not appear to work Producer would euthanize a sick animal before calling a veterinarian The survey also asked how many days it would take, once initial symptoms appear ed, for the average producer to call a veterinarian . A.6.2.13.2 Results and Discussion Eighteen veterinarians responded to the survey, but all respondents did not respond to all questions. Most producers would try to treat an animal before calling a veterinarian (Table 46). SME interviews with specialists in goat and sheep production suggested that this survey might estimate a higher rate of producer contacting a veterinarian for those production types than would actually occur. In general, the higher value the animal, the faster a veterinarian is predicted to be consulted (Table 47).

Three FADDs were interviewed for their opinion on how long it would take for animals to exhibit symptoms that a producer could observe to tell that the animal was ill. A.6.2.14.2 Results and Discussion These results are based primarily on the range of incubation times of FMD. The maximum value reported by FADD1 for beef is based on how long it might take for a producer to observe his animals, not on how long it would take for an animal to exhibit symptoms. Observable symptoms would appear between 10-14 days. All the FADDs interviewed said that sheep and goats are so inconsistent in their presentation of symptoms , that it is likely that a producer would never observe the symptoms. One of the FADDs reported that sheep and goats would need to be carefully examined to detect the disease. All the FADDs interviewed indicated that symptoms of fever from FMD would be general depression, and A6-70 Table 48: Responses from FADD 1 Species Min. (Days) Ave. (Days) Max.

All FADDS felt that a producer would be able to identify that his animals were ill, but he identify the disease as FMD. A6.2.15 Direct Contact Reduction for Out Of State Movement Original direct contact rates were gathered from USDA 2009 and personal communication . However, these contact rates included livestock shipped out of Kansas (outshipments). Because the Updated SSRA model treated livestock moving within and out of Kansas in separate modules, the contact rates needed to be reduced to account for only those livestock remaining within Kansas, with the exception of backyard facility contact rates, which were calculated using a different method and so did not need to be reduced. Using certificate of veterinary inspection (CVI) data, the number of outshipments moving from any production type facility in Kansas to any production type facility in other states was estimated . These outshipments were then subtracted from the total number of annual shipments, as estimated from the original contact rates, to calculate total number of animal shipments moving within Kansas. The total number of intrastate shipments was then used to calculate a new reduced direct contact rate for each facility type- to-facility type combination (e.g. cow-calf to dairy) that excluded the movement of livestock out of Kansas. A summary of these calculations is depicted in Figure 25, while detailed descriptions are in the following sections. A6-71 Figure 25: Flow Chart Displaying the Calculations Leading to Reduction of the Production Type Facility-Specific Contact Rates to Exclude Animals Shipped Out of Kansas (outshipments) Facility type A refers to the type of facility sending animal shipments, while facility type B refers to the receiving facility. For example, if a shipment moves from a dairy facility to a feedlot, the dairy is facility A and the feedlot is facility B. Boxes outlined in red and bolded indicate the main flow of calculations. A6-72 A6.2.15.1 Data Sources The majority of the original contact rates came from the CEAH 2009 document. Exceptions were cow- calf to dairy, cow-calf to small and large feedlots, dairy to cow-calf, small feedlot to large feedlot and dairy to large feedlot, which were provided through personal communication from USDA. Data on the numbers of types of livestock outshipped from Kansas were collected from Kansas CVI data, which listed every livestock shipment out of Kansas for the year of 2010 to any one of the primary states (Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Texas). These CVI data also included the number of animals in each shipment and the production type of each shipment. Generally, these CVI data exclude animals outshipped for immediate slaughter (see Appendix Section A6.2.15). Verification of the Livestock Movement Report Although the Livestock Movement Report is dated 2001, the validity of its data were supported by the 2010 CVI data. The total numbers of cattle moving from Kansas to each primary state from the 2010 CVI data were compared to the total number of cattle moving to each state according to the Interstate Livestock Movement Report. The difference between the datasets was expressed as the percent change from the Interstate Livestock Movement Report. The total range in differences was from -60% up to 149%. Colorado and Missouri had decreases in cattle outshipments from Kansas between 2001 and 2010, while Iowa experienced an increase in cattle outshipments. Texas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma outshipments during 2001 and 2010 were essentially unchanged, with percent changes of less than 20%. Overall, five of the six modeled states had a difference of less than one-fold, while all six states were within two-fold. Therefore, the total number of animals outshipped from Kansas reported by the Livestock Movement Report, and used in these calculations, is a reasonable estimate of the number of animals currently outshipped each year. A6.2.15.2 Method The method to reduce the contact rates to exclude livestock movement outside of Kansas required multiple inputs and the calculations were performed in a particular order. The flow of calculations and the necessary inputs are outlined in Figure 25, and this section will follow this outline. To distinguish ! \u0011 receiving facility type. For example, if a shipment moves from a dairy to a feedlot, the dairy is facility A and the feedlot is facility B. Total Number of Outshipments The first type of information needed to calculate the reduced direct contact rates was the total number of annual outshipments for each species (cattle, swine, sheep, and goats). This information was calculated by dividing the total number of animals outshipped per year for each species by the median shipment size of each species. The median number of animals per outshipment was identified from the CVI data. The only shipments excluded for the determination of median shipment size were animals moved for show or slaughter. The total numbers of animals outshipped from Kansas annually for cattle, swine and sheep were obtained from the Livestock Movement Report [Shields and Mathews Jr., 2003] . A6-73 Outshipments of goats were not included within this report, so the number of goats outshipped was estimated by multiplying the total number of sheep outshipped (from the Livestock Movement Report ) by the ratio of goat outshipments to sheep outshipments, as determined from the 2010 CVI data. Total Outshipments Moved to Each Receiving Facility Type The two inputs needed to calculate the total number of outshipments to each facility type B were the total number of annual outshipments and the proportion of outshipments to each facility type B. The total numbers of outshipments were calculated as described in the previous section. The proportions of outshipments to each facility type B from each facility type A were calculated from the 2010 CVI data using the following subsections. Both the total number of annual outshipments and proportion of outshipments to each facility type B were multiplied together to calculate the total number of outshipments to each facility type B. Proportion of Cattle Outshipments For cattle, the proportion of cattle that were moved for either breeding (i.e., cow-calf), feeding, dairy, show/trail, or sale/others/blanks were calculated by dividing the number of shipments for each specific facility type by the total number of cattle shipments. The proportion of cattle shipments moving to dairy facilities was then increased because some shipments that are marked as moving to breeding move to likely move to dairies instead of cow-calf facilities. Therefore, it was assumed that the percent of cattle shipments that move to dairy facilities are the same for out- of-state movement as they are for overall movement. The percent of cattle shipments that move to dairies overall was calculated by dividing the total number of annual Kansas cattle shipments to dairies (using USDA 2009 contact rates) by the total number of cattle shipments. These extra dairy cattle were then subtracted from the breeding category. The category for sale/others/blanks was distributed among the other four facility types (breeding, feeding, dairy, and show/trail) because it was unclear which of the four facility types any of the animals within this category would have moved to. The proportions of outshipments to each facility type B were then finalized, with the exception of cattle moving to feeding. This proportion was split into a large feedlot and a small feedlot. To do so, the number of overall shipments to large feedlots and small feedlots was calculated from the USDA contact rates. The proportion of cattle moving to feeding, as determined from the 2010 CVI data, was then multiplied by the percentage of feeding shipments that go to large and small feedlots, to get the proportion of cattle that move to large and small feedlots, respectively. Proportion of Swine Outshipments The number of swine outshipments, excluding show outshipments, was divided by the total number of swine outshipments to get the proportion of outshipments. Similar to cattle, the proportion of swine outshipments was split into large and small swine facilities, according to the proportion of shipments that move to large facilities versus small facilitie s. A6-74 Proportion of Sheep and Goat Outshipments The number of sheep and goat outshipments, excluding show outshipments, was divided by the total number of either sheep or goat outshipments to get the proportion of outshipments. Total Outshipments Moved in Each Facility Type- To-Facility Type Combination In order to calculate the total number of outshipments moving from one facility type to another, two types of information were needed. One of these was the total number of outshipments moved to each facility type B, as determined in the previous section. The other type of information needed was the proportion of outshipments moving to each facility type B from the possible facilities type A. For example, of all shipments moving to a dairy facility, what proportion of those shipments originated from a feedlot, dairy, etc. The total number of outshipments moving to a facility B, multiplied by the proportion of outshipments moving to facility B from facility type A, yields the total number of outshipments moving from any single facility type A to any facility type B. To calculate the proportion of outshipments moving to any facility type B from any facility type A, it was necessary to first calculate the actual number of shipments that move from each possible facility type A to facility type B. Therefore, the USDA 2009 facility-specific contact rates were multiplied by 365 to get annual contact rates. These contact rates were then multiplied by the number of facilities of each production type in Kansas sending out shipments to yield the total number of shipments moving from any facility type A in Kansas to any facility type B. This number was then divided by sum of all shipments moving to the receiving facility (type B), which gave the proportion of shipments that moved to a specific facility type B from the possible facilities type A. Reduced Facility-Specific Contact Rate The total number of shipments moved within Kansas was calculated by subtracting the number of outshipments moving from one facility type to another from the total number of shipments moving from one facility type to another. Essentially this removed the number of shipments moving out of Kansas from the total number of shipments, yielding the number of shipments moving within Kansas. For each facility type combination, the total number of shipments moving within Kansas was divided by the total number of facilities in Kansas according to the originating facility. This equaled the annual contact rate for each facility type combination. The daily rate was calculated by dividing the annual rate by 365. These results are listed in Table 51 and Table 52. A6.2.15.3 Results Each of the facility-specific contact rates (or production type specific contact rates) are listed below in Table 51 through Table 53. There is no direct contact between different species of livestock, nor between large and small swine facilities. A6.2.16 Direct Contact Parameters The USDA 2009 parameters served as the basis for the Updated SSRA direct contact parameters, however some parameters went through a series of modifications to increase their accuracy and to A6-75 account for differences in modeling approach between the Updated SSRA and USDA 2009. Additionally, contact parameters were developed to describe BY-SS producer contact. This Appendix Section provides the USDA 2009 evidence basis first, followed by tables listing individual production type combination contact rates. Any modifications to the original USDA 2009 parameters are noted. A6.2.16.1 Cattle Direct Contact Parameters USDA 2009 Evidence Basis The following was provided as the justifications and assumptions for all cattle (cow-calf, dairy, feedlot) direct contact parameters in USDA 2009, which served as the basis for the direct contact parameters listed in the following sections. For more information please see full USDA 2009 report: According to NAHMS Beef 2008 1, cow-calf producers received an average of 1.1 shipments from another beef operation and 1.2 shipments from auction markets over the previous 12 months. The ultimate source of auction market cattle that a cow-calf operation would buy is another cow-calf operation. Movement of cattle from feedlots, backgrounders, and dairies to cow-calf operations are rare events. Occasionally feedlots will feed cattle not meant for U.S. slaughter. According to Feedlot '99, Part I, 1.1% of feedlot placements are not for slaughter. Backgrounder/stocker operations receive virtually all of their cattle from cow-calf operations. It is estimated that backgrounder/stocker operations receive approximate ly 20 shipments per year from cow-calf operations. There is no movement of cattle from finish feedlots to backgrounder operations. Movement of cattle from finish feedlots and backgrounder operations to dairy operations are rare events. The median size of a finish feedlot is an estimated 15,000 head. On average, feedlots turn over twice per year. Assuming 200 head pens, there is an estimated 150 shipments from a cow-calf operation to a finish feedlot operation per year. An estimated 85 shipments per year are from an auction market of which 60% (51 shipments) are from a cow-calf operation while 40% (34 shipments) are from backgrounder/stocker operations. An estimated 28 shipments per year are directly from a backgrounder/stocker operation. An estimated 28 shipments per year are directly from a cow-calf operation. An estimated nine shipments per year are directly from a dairy operation. A6-76 There is no movement of cattle from finish feedlots to finish feedlots. According to NAHMS Dairy 2007, Part III dairy operations averaged 2.6 and 0.12 shipments of females and bulls, respectively, from one dairy operation to another each year. According to NAHMS Dairy 2007, 1.5% of dairy operations receive beef bulls, 2% receive steers, and 0.9% receive beef heifers from cow- calf operations. According to Feedlot '99, Part I 1.1% of feedlot placements are not for slaughter (0.2% are beef breeding animals, 0.1% are dairy breeding animals, and the other 0.8% are \"other\" cattle). It was estimated that an average of one shipment is received by a dairy each year. The probability of infection transfer was determined by the within-unit prevalence. Expert opinion was gathered from the following individuals: Drs. Mike Apley, Mike Brouk, Robert Larson, Dan Thomson, Brad White, and Jason Lombard.\" Cow-Calf The following description of cow-calf contact parameter development was provided in Chapter 6. Since it is important for understanding the development of other contact parameters between USDA 2009 production types and BY-SS production types, the description is reproduced here. Direct contact parameters for cow-calf facilities were developed for USDA 2009 through subject matter expert interviews and literature review (see previous section). Parameters describing direct contact between cow-calf and BY-SS facilities were developed from BY- SS producer interviews (described in Appendix Section A6.2.2). Producers were asked how often they purchased new animals and from where they obtained those animals. Animals were often directly purchased from another facility, but in the event animals (typically calves) were purchased at market, they were assumed to originate from a cow-calf facility. Almost all animals originated from within the state. The mean number of purchases per year per producer was calculated and then multiplied by the total number of each type of backyard facility and divided by the total number of cow-calf facilities. For example, there were 14 shipments sold from cow-calf operations to the 18 beef backyard producers interviewed, which averaged to 0.78 shipments to each of those 18 beef backyard facilities. This value was then adjusted for the total number of backyard beef (3,724) and cow-calf (22,929) producers in Kansas and converted, by dividing by 365, from a yearly value to a daily value of 0.00035 shipments per day (Table 54).

For more information, please see the full USDA 2009 report: Many small ruminants that are removed from various small fenced/farmed small ruminant operations are moved directly to slaughter. The number of major movements of small ruminants from larger small ruminant operations to backgrounder and/or feedlot operations is one to two per year which is limited by the natural reproductive cycle. The second or third and final move will be directly to slaughter. A6-81 The probability of infection transfer was determined by the within-unit prevalence. Expert op in ion was gathered from the following individual: Dr. Brian Faris. Goats Direct contact parameters for goat facilities were developed for USDA 2009 through SME interviews and literature review (see above). Parameters describing direct contact between goat and BY-SS facilities were developed from producer interviews as described in the direct contact cow-calf section (interviews are described in Appendix Section A6.2.2).

Parameters describing direct contact between sheep and backyard facilities were developed from producer interviews as described in the direct contact cow-calf section (interviews are described in Appendix Section A6.2.2).

A6.2.16.4 Backyard-Small Scale Production Type Direct Contact Parameters Beef (Backyard-Small Scale) The Beef (BY-SS) description was provided in Chapter 6. Since it is important for understanding the development of other BY-SS Production types, the description is reproduced here. Parameters describing direct contact originating from BY- SS were developed from producer interviews (interviews are described in Appendix Section A6.2.2). For BY-SS producers, each animal sold or purchased was considered a single shipment. When answers were provided in number ranges, the median value of the range was used. For example, if a producer purchased 2-4 animals per year, he was considered to have purchased three shipments of animals. Producers were asked how often they sold animals and to whom did they sell their animals. Animals were sometimes sent to slaughter and sometimes sold through markets. Animals sold straight to slaughter were excluded. Most producers were able to indicate whether animals sold through market went to slaughter or finishing. The destination was assumed to be feedlots for most cattle sold through markets. If the producer specified other destinations through markets, such as 4-H operations or other small farms, Beef (BY-SS) facilities were selected as the receiving production type. Shipments that went to unspecified feedlots were divided between small and large feedlots according to the ratio of small to large feedlots in Kansas . The same method was used when the destination of backyard swine or small ruminants was not specified between the various small and large swine or goat- and sheep-type locations. All producers surveyed were from Kansas and shipments from these farms were assumed to stay within the state. The mean number of sales per year per producer was calculated. This mean was then multiplied by the total number of Beef (BY-SS) facilities and divided by the total number of each production type. For example, there were 25.25 shipments sold from the 18 Beef (BY-SS) producers interviewed to small A6-83 - - - - - - - - feedlots, which averaged to 1.4 shipments sold by each of the 18 Beef (BY-SS) facilities. This value was then adjusted for the total number of Beef (BY-SS) facilities (3,724) and small feedlot facilities (2,485) in Kansas and converted, by dividing by 365, from a yearly value to a daily value of 0.00576 shipments per day. These contact values were not adjusted for backyard facilities in other states, nor were they adjusted for the complications of market sales because shipment sizes were likely to be so small that they would only be sold as single lots. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Table 57: Direct Contact Originating from Beef (BY SS) Operations Production Types Kansas mean baseline direct contact rate (shipments/day) Shipments per year Parameter source Beef (BY SS) to Cow Calf 0 0 Updated SSRA team Beef (BY SS) to Dairy 0 0 Updated SSRA team Beef (BY SS) to Feedlot(L) 0.0058 2.1 Updated SSRA team Beef (BY SS) to Feedlot(S) 0.0058 2.1 Updated SSRA team Beef (BY SS) to Goats 0 0 Updated SSRA team Beef (BY SS) to Sheep 0 0 Updated SSRA team Beef (BY SS) to Small ruminant (BY SS) 0 0 Updated SSRA team Beef (BY SS) to Swine (S) 0 0 Updated SSRA team Beef (BY SS) to Swine (L) 0 0 Updated SSRA team Beef (BY SS) to Beef (BY SS) 0.0018 0.64 Updated SSRA team Beef (BY SS) to Swine (BY SS) 0 0 Updated SSRA team Swine (Backyard-Small Scale) Parameters describing direct contact between swine (BY-SS) facilities and other production types were developed from producer interviews as described in the direct contact Beef (BY-SS) section (interviews are described i n Appendix Section A6.2.2).

For example, if BY-SS producer A raises cows and purchases 2 cows a year (one at a time) from Cow-Calf B, his contact was included in the calculation of the Cow-Calf to Beef (BY-SS) direct contact rate. The typical distance traveled by animals when shipped to or from another producer A6-85 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - was collected as part of the BY-SS Interviews (see Appendix Section A6.2.2.1). These distances were organized by contact pairing and used to estimate distance distribution functions. To estimate overall distance distribution functions, first individual distance distribution functions were estimated for each contributing producer. If a producer gave a range for shipment distance, a uniform distribution was created for that range. If a single point estimate was provided, a normal distribution was used. A triangular distribution was used when a range and most likely value were provided. Using an R program, each function was randomly sampled using a weighted scheme to determine the number of samples taken for each individual distribution. The number of samples taken from a distribution was 1000 multiplied by the number of shipments the producer sent/received. The results from sampling from all distributions were pooled and fit with new distribution using @Risk (Table 60) to come up with the overall distance distribution for each pairing.

Interviews identified two producers that send animals from their notional (BY\u00ad SS) farm to cow-calf operations every year. Farm A sends 1 shipment of animals about 50 km away each year, so a normal distance distribution was created to describe this producer behavior. Next, 1,000 samples are drawn from this distribution to contribute to the pool that will be used to generate the overall distance distribution for this pairing. Farm B sends two shipments to different farms every year, these farms are typically between 3 and 100 km away. For Farm B a uniform distribution is generated, for which 2,000 samples are drawn because two shipments are sent each year. The 3,000 distances generated are pooled into a single table and a distance distribution is fit using the @Risk distribution fitting tool. - Table 61: Simplified Example of Method Used to Develop BY SS Distance Distributions Annual Shipments Shipment distance Individual distance Number of sent to Cow -calf distribution samples taken Farm A 1 50 km Normal (50,1) 1000 Farm B 2 3-100 km Uniform (3,100) 2000 A6.2.18 Indirect Contact Rate Parameters Indirect contact parameter development is described in Section 6.1.4.3. USDA evidence basis is provided below along with tables listing parameters. A6.2.18.1 Cattle and Swine USDA 2009 Evidence Basis Indirect contacts considered include veterinarians, feed and feed truck deliveries, milk truck pick-ups (dairy), salesmen, nutritionists, AI technicians (dairy or cow-calf), hoof trimmers, rendering trucks, external contract processors, employee contact, and neighbors. Indirect contacts through contract livestock haulers are included between swine and cattle.

Contact between sheep and professional service providers is also limited. The high cost of veterinary services along with narrow profit margins dictate the restriction of veterinarian visits for serious disease problems only. Many commonly administered vaccines and biological products are purchased and administered by producers from livestock supply companies. In exception to this trend, rams undergo breeding soundness evaluation exams one to two times per year. Producers typically receive Information from health-professional sources at offsite meetings. Professionals are not likely to visit the farm premises. Shearer crews may shear sheep at multiple sites/locations that belong to a single producer. Visits by shearer crews are mostly applicable to large open-range flocks. Finally, only 10% of U.S. sheep producers used livestock haulers during 2001.\" A6-90 The evidence basis for these parameters was based on NAHMS reports, and USDA 2009 team interp retat ions of an interview with a single subject matter expert, Dr. Brian Faris. This limited evidence basis is a weakness. Development of indirect contact rates for BY-SS producers are described in Section 6.1.4.3.

For both direct and indirect movement, the representatives were asked to estimate the ability over time of the state to control movement. In particular, the representatives movement over time relative to the declaration of an FMD outbreak. Movement control here refers to the restriction of travel within and out of a 10-km zone around an infected premise. A6-98 A6.2.20.2 Results and Discussion All four representatives provided quantitative data for the first day through two weeks after the declaration of an FMD outbreak. For both movement types, all state representatives predict that movement will sharply decline immediately after the outbreak declaration and then rise back up over time (Table 68 and Table 69). These data indirectly informed the movement control parameter implemented for the Updated SSRA, because zoned movement control was not used, as explained in Section 6.1.4.3. Individual state responses are not provided because this information is considered sensitive because it reveals strong and weak points in the emergency.

The purpose of the conversation was A6-99 to obtain expertise regarding triggering and deploying a vaccination response that might reflect current U.S. policy. Specifically, the following questions were posed: How many confirmed detections of FMD would trigger a vaccination response? What deployment processes would take place between triggering a response and physically vaccinating an animal? What influences or affects the amount of animals or herds that can be vaccinated in a day? A follow-up data validation email was sent requesting additional comments on the values of other parameters not discussed during the call. Specifically, a timeline and datasheet listing the parameter values was sent. Additional questions were added for clarification and comment: Factors that will affect the number of animals vaccinated in an hour/day: Vaccine Resources o The quantity of vaccines distributed to a producer? Human Resources o How many people are needed to vaccinate and tag one animal? o How many animals can be tagged in an hour? Equipment Resources o Which facilities have chutes (How many to what size of facility)? o How many animals can be vaccinated per chute in an hour? o How many animals can be vaccinate without a chute in an hour? Factors that will affect the number of herds vaccinated in an hour/day: o What is the quantity of vaccines in the stockpile? o What is the quantity of vaccines that can be manufactured and supplied a regular rate? A6.2.21.2 Results and Discussion Discussion during the conference call focused on current and future policy regarding the three questions listed above. These discussions provided data that contributed primarily to the development of the triggering herd value and the vaccination capacity. Details regarding what affected vaccination rates were further elaborated on in follow-up correspondence. USDA noted that the FMD vaccine bank and the type of FMD vaccine available for use may be different than what is currently available based on vaccine technology and policy changes. However, under A6-100 current plans, Commissioners of the North American FMD Vaccine Bank (NAFMDVB) have instituted a policy that activates the NAFMDVB when the FMD virus serotype and subtype have been confirmed and vaccine matching determines which specific vaccine should be used. (The NAFMDVB is managed by the U.S. for the three member countries, Canada, Mexico and the U.S.). The length of time to determine what vaccine to use depends on the serotype. If it is a serotype with limited antigenic differences, the determination will be made rapidly, however, some serotypes have multiple strains requiring additional laboratory work that may take several days. Vaccine bank activation would take place prior to an official decision being made by any of the member countries to actually use vaccine. This activation would provide for the current vaccine antigen concentrates of the selected vaccine to be shipped to the manufacturer for production of finished vaccine. It is expected that this activation would take place regardless if the FMD detection was related to a release from NBAF or some other type of introduction. It was generally agreed that the first confirmed case of FMD and therefore the first detected herd would trigger a vaccination response. The NAFMDVB uses a decision matrix that takes into account both outbreak (contact rate, host or species affected/at risk, status of outbreak and environmental) and mitigation (physical resources, human resources, socio-political) factors to make a decision on use of vaccine. Therefore, the vaccination strategy employed relies heavily on the actual situation and the vaccine available. A preliminary delivery of vaccination supplies and vaccine would occur with supplementary vaccine production orders placed concurrently. Once the vaccine was obtained and on location, the vaccination process would begin. Specific elements of deployment were discussed such as the quantity and availability of stockpiled vaccine, human resources and equipment. While serotype matching and vaccine selection was estimated to take 48 hours, deployment of the vaccine supply would take several days unless finished vaccine that matches the outbreak strain is available through commercial contracts. To minimize the time to conduct vaccination of designated animals and make maximal use of governmental resources, USDA officials indicated that a vaccination strategy would include plans in conjunction with the Incident Command in the area to allow producers with appropriate oversight to administer vaccines to their own herds. The number of people required to administer vaccine was suggested that 2-4 people would be needed at cow-calf operations, 4-5 at a feedlot, and 2-3 at a dairy. The rate of vaccination and tagging would depend on the availability of equipment and personnel. A6.2.21.3 Assumptions Though the discussion provided elaboration on vaccination processes and deployment capabilities, the availability of vaccine is a key part of response. For security purposes, the stockpile quantity or current capability to procure vaccines was not provided. Therefore, it was decided that vaccine availability would not be considered a limiting factor in vaccination capacity. A6-101 A6.3 Estimating Probability of Spread to States Other than Kansas A6.3.1 Wildlife Data Collection (states other than Kansas) While most states maintain harvest data on wildlife species in their state, estimates of total population or population density were not always available. All states modeled had significant deer populations. Elk and pronghorn were only present in some states; these populations tend to be small compared to deer populations. Nebraska also has two bighorn sheep populations with between 100-200 animals total [Taylor, 2011] . Feral swine could play a significant role in an FMD outbreak in several states modeled. Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri all have significant, uncontrolled feral swine populations (Figure 26). Colorado, Iowa, and Nebraska have small feral swine populations. Feral swine would likely play a minor role in an FMD outbreak in these states. All three states have task forces to eradicate introduced swine [Garner, 2011; Pelzer, 2011]. Iowa has trapped and killed a total of 181 feral swine since 2006 [Garner, 2011]. Figure 26: National Feral Swine Mapping System Swine Populations in the Modeled Region [College of Veterinary Medicine, 2007] A6.3.2 State Within-Herd Model Data and Herd-Level Parameter Development A6.3.2.1 Setting Up and Running the Model A within-herd model was developed for each production type population in each state modeled, as described in Appendix Section A6.2.12.1. Parameters Entered into Within-Herd Model: Origin and Development Within-herd model input parameters included: state specific population distributions, initial disease state of each animal (latent, subclinical, clinical), adequate exposures per time step, and animal-level disease phase functions. A6-102 Population distribution functions were produced for each state, for each production type, using the population file described in Appendix Section A6.2.1.2. The statistical program, R, was used to generate population distributions as histogram graphs for each production type in the state. The population distributions for Oklahoma (Figure 27 through Figure 37), Iowa (Figure 38 through Figure 48), Texas (Figure 49 through Figure 59), Nebraska (Figur e 60 through Figure 70), Missouri (Figure 71 through Figure 81), and Colorado (Figure 82 through Figure 92) are shown below.

Initially latent animals were represented by a uniform function with a range of 1-5. The adequate exposures per time step parameter was specific for each production type but used universally for each state model, as described in Appendix Section A6. 2.12.2 (Table 70).

Due to time constraints, a full set of direct contact parameters could not be created . Instead, several SMEs from each state were interviewed to determine how the contact A6-221 parameters for their state would vary from the contact rates developed for Kansas, shown in Appendix Section A6.3.3.2. Direct contact rates and distances for Texas were developed for the USDA 2011 study, the evidence basis for these parameters can be found in Appendix Section A63.3.1 and the parameters themselves in Appendix Section A6.3.3.2. A6.3.3.1 Texas Direct Contact Parameter Evidence Basis, Entire Section Quoted from USDA 2011 distance distributions of direct contacts were obtained from two studies: a survey of 77 livestock producers in 8 counties located in the Texas panhandle [Dominguez et al., 2007a], and another survey 156 livestock producers in 9 counties of southwest Texas [Dominguez et al., 2007b ]. A matrix was created with marginal row and column values equal to the estimates of overall direct contacts on to and off of premises reported by the two surveys. The contact rates of individual cells in the matrix were distributed so that the sums of the rows and columns were as close to the marginal values as possible. Relative differences in direct contact rates between pairs of production type combinations were guided by estimates from NAHMS beef, swine, and dairy reports on the percentages of shipments to various destinations, and information provided by the southwest Texas study on the destinations of shipments from sale yards. The sum of all production type contact rates off of premises was 0.07/day less than the sum of contact rates onto premises. Therefore it was not possible to perfectly reconcile the marginal totals. These discrepancies were distributed among the feedlot production types. Distances travelled by contacts were reported as minimum, most likely and maximum values in the two Texas studies. These reported values were used to assign BetaPERT distance distributions for direct contacts. All Feedlots It was assumed that all cattle leaving company feedlots, stockholder feedlots, and custom feedlots were consigned to slaughter and had no direct contacts shipped to other production types. All cattle leaving yearling-pasture feedlots were assumed to go to one of the other three feedlot types. The Texas panhandle study found that the average daily rate of direct contact shipments onto all feedlots was 0.27/day (sd = 0.83). To reflect the variability in feedlot direct contacts observed in that study, it was assumed that contact rates increased with increasing feedlot capacity. Using the numbers of each feedlot category that participated in the Texas panhandle study, weighted average daily contact rates were calculated so that the combined total for all categories equaled 0.27. According to the Texas panhandle study, yearling-pasture feedlots and stocker operations shipped animals to other feedlots at the same rate. Therefore direct contacts off of yearling pasture feedlots were assumed to be the same as those reported for stocker operations (0.21/day, see below). Cow-calf and stocker operations According to the southwest Texas survey, there was an average of 0.32 direct contacts/day originating from large cow-calf operations, 0.20 direct contacts/day originating from small cow-calf operations, and 0.21 direct contacts/day originating from stocker operations. The average direct contacts/day onto large cow-calf, small cow-calf, and stocker operations were 0.05, 0.02, and 0.17, respectively. It was assumed that all contacts from large and small cow-calf operations A6-222 were to other beef operations, feedlots, or small ruminants (see small ruminant section below), and all contacts from stocker operations were to feedlots only. Dairy The Texas panhandle study surveyed 21 dairy operations (4 small and 17 large). The rate of direct contacts onto dairy premises was estimated to be 0.01/day and the rate off of diary premises was 0.07/day. It was assumed that the destinations of all animal shipments from dairies were to other dairies or to feedlots. According to NAHMS dairy [2007], approximately three times as many dairies shipped animals directly to feedlots than shipped directly to other dairies. Therefore the assigned contact rates between dairies and feedlots were higher than the contact rates between dairies. All dairy production types were assumed to have direct contacts with each other at equal rates. Swine The Texas panhandle study surveyed 16 swine producers (7 small and 9 large) and estimated the average daily rate of direct contacts off of all swine premises to be 0.01/day (sd = 0.02). The average reported direct contact rate onto swine premises was rounded to 0 (sd = 0.01). According to NAHMS swine (2007), 8% of large swine operations in the south region (including Texas) had a combination of all phases of swine production present, indicating that most large swine premises specialized in one or more production phases. According to NAHMS small enterprise - swine (2007), 67% of small swine operations shipped 1 or more pigs off of premises in the prior 12 months and 22% of these shipments were to other premises. Based on this information, it was assumed that large swine premises had more frequent shipments of pigs off of premises to other specialty operations than small swine operations. It was also assumed that small and large swine operations had direct contact only within their respective production types. Small Ruminants According to the southwest Texas survey, 79% of sheep operations also owned cattle and 67% of goat operations owned cattle. Therefore small ruminant production types were permitted to have direct contact with other non-dairy, cattle production types. The southwest Texas study reported direct contact rates for mixed small ruminant/cattle operations as 0.20/day off of premises and 0.04/day onto [USDA 2011] A6.3.3.2 Direct Contact Rate and Distance Distribution Parameters State specific direct contact rates and distance distributions are shown in the tables below.

A6-230 A6.3.4.1 Texas Indirect Contact Parameter Evidence Basis, Entire Section Quoted from USDA 2011 Both the Texas panhandle survey and the southwest Texas survey reported indirect contact as high risk and low risk contacts (Dominguez et al., 2007a; Dominguez et al., 2007b). High risk contacts are those that involved contact with animals and low risk contacts were vehicles and people who came onto premises but did not have contact with animals. All premises in the two studies reported high risk contacts during the previous year but only a proportion of each production type reported low risk contacts. NAADSM does not differentiate between high risk and low risk contacts so these two types of indirect contacts were combined into averages that were weighted by the proportion of premises in each production type that reported those contacts. The indirect contact rates reported by the Texas panhandle study were for broad production type classes, feedlots, dairies, and swine. The southwest Texas study reported one combined indirect contact rate for all premises. These rates were applied to the specific production types in our study by using the 50% and 75% confidence limits of the production type classes. For example, for the four feedlot production types, it was assumed that indirect contacts increase with increasing feedlot capacity. The indirect contact rate for company feedlots was assumed to be the upper 75% confidence limit for all feedlots reported in the Texas panhandle study. The indirect contact rate was the upper 50% confidence limit for stockholder feedlots, the lower 50% confidence limit for custom feedlots, and the lower 75% confidence limit for yearling-pasture feedlots. For the four production types represented in the southwest Texas study, it was assumed that the indirect contact rates were highest for large cow-calf operations followed by small cow- calf, small ruminant, and stocker operations. Upper and lower 50% and 75% confidence limits were applied to these four production types in the same way as for the feedlots. To estimate the contact rates between particular pairs of production types, sources of indirect contact were classified into eight groups (veterinarians/extension, feed trucks, drug sales, nutritionists, external processors, milk trucks, neighbors, and contract haulers). The proportions of visits collectively made by each of these eight sources to each production type were estimated from NAHMS reports and expert opinion [Mike Sanderson, personal communication]. From these estimates, normalized proportions of overall contact visits for each production type were calculated. The contact rate from one production type to another was the product of the contact rate for the source production type and the normalized proportion of visits by all contact sources to the recipient production type. Laboratory transmission data were obtained from published studies involving experimental infection with FMD. In cases where no empirical disease transmission data were published, the probability of disease transmission was assumed to be 1.0 (100%). The data collected from the literature were used to calculate the probability of infection given exposure for each production type combination. To account for a variety of biosecurity measures implemented by various livestock sectors, an average reduction factor was calculated using published National Animal Health Monitoring Systems (NAHMS) data. This reduction factor was then multiplied to the probability of indirect disease transmission for each livestock sector (cattle, swine, & small ruminants ) [USDA 2011] A6.3.4.2 Indirect Contact Rate Parameters State specific indirect contact is shown in the table below.
