Notify Students and employees should email [wellness@alma.edu](mailto:wellness@alma.edu) or call the Wilcox Health Center (989-463-7181) and employees should also notify their supervisor. They will help you determine your timeline for returning to campus and connect you with resources to aid in your recovery. Isolate Stay home from class and work. Students and employees should isolate for at least five full days (returning on the morning of the sixth day). You may end isolation after five days when your symptoms improve, test negative, and are fever-free for 24 hours (without fever-reducing medication). Students should have an isolation plan in the event that they need to separate from roommates and most often choose to return home. Mask Wear your mask for days 6-10 of the isolation period or if you have access to antigen tests, you should consider using them. With two sequential negative tests after five days, 48 hours apart, you may remove your mask sooner than day 10. Note: If your antigen test results are positive, you may still be infectious. You should continue wearing a mask and wait at least 48 hours before taking another test. Continue taking antigen tests at least 48 hours apart until you have two sequential negative results. What should I do if I am experiencing symptoms? Stay home If you are experiencing any symptoms, stay home from classes and work and let your professors and/or supervisor know that you will not be in until you are feeling better. Test If symptoms persist for more than 24 hours or you suspect you might have COVID, consider taking an at home test or making an appointment at Wilcox Health Center (989-463-7181) Testing before 24 hours after symptom onset might be too early to detect COVID.

Mask (N95 or high-quality mask) when you are at home around other or in indoor public space on campus for 10 days after your last close contact. Watch for symptoms, especially in the first 10 days after your exposure. If you develop symptoms in this period, see \"symptoms\" above. Self-quarantine: You are not required to quarantine, but if you live in the same household as the person who tested positive, you should isolate from that person as much as possible. Wear a quality mask if you need to share a common space and try to use separate bathrooms, if possible. Test: For five full days after your exposure, even if you do not have symptoms. What should I do if I need a COVID- 19 test? Free home tests are available at the Wilcox Health Center and Alma Public Library while supplies last.
