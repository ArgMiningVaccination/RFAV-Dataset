This re port details the work and achievements of the Department of Justice in carry ing out its Environmental Justi ce Strategy and Executive Order 12898. All communities across this nation - regardless of their race, ethnicity, or income status - deserve to live in a healthy environment and to know that law enforcement will respond as fully as possible to deal with the human health and envi ronmental issues they face. The Department is deeply committed to ensuring that every community receives full protection under the nation's laws, including environmental and civil rights la ws. We recognize that low-income, minority, and tribal Americans are often disproportiona tely burdened with po llution, resulting in disproportionate health problems, greater obstacl es to economic growth, and a lower quality of life. This report illustrates some of the ways we have continued to ach ieve meaningful results for these, and all, communities. The Departme nt is building upon the gr oundwork we previously laid to ensure environmental justice principles inform the way we perform our work and lead to even greater outcomes for communities in the future. To showcase a few of the Department's accomplishments: Interagency collaboration is a fundament al aspect of successfully addressing environmental justice issues. To further this collaboration, the Department continues to play an active role in the Federal Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice (IWG) created by Executive Order 12898. The IWG facili tates coordination among the federal agencies to guide, s upport and enhance federal environmental justice and community-based activities. The Department has also taken significant steps to meet its obligations under the interagency Memora ndum of Understanding on Environmental Justice (MOU), which was si gned by seventeen federal agencies. The MOU, which the Department helped develop in 2011, enhances interagency collaboration and increases public access to information about agency work on environmental justice. Community engagement is one of the cornerstones of environmental justice. The Department continued its unprecedented efforts to ensure communities have the opportunity to participate m eaningfully in environmenta l decision-making that may affect them. Representatives from the Environment and Natural Resources Division, the Civil Rights Division, and U.S. Attorney s' Offices met with communities affected 1 by pollution around the Nation, as well as envi ronmental justice advocates and other stakeholders. The Department's Community Relations Service continued to use its mediation and conciliation expertise to f acilitate meaningful participation in environmental decisions by community lead ers. The Department also conducted outreach in the context of cases to give communities a meaningful opportunity for input in the consideration of appropriate remedies to resolve violations. The Department continues to achieve meaningful results for communities in its cases. For example, in fiscal year 2012 the E nvironment and Natura l Resources Division brought additional cases throughout the nation to improve aging municipal wastewater and stormwater collection and treatment facilities. Settlements in these cases addressed the impacts of violations on disproportionately burdened communities, and, when fully implemented, will significantly improve public health and the environment for the entire aff ected community. This report provides numerous other examples of how the Department has achieved discernible positive outcomes in disproportionately burdened communities through its litigation and negotiation work. While we have made significant progress integr ating environmental justice principles into the daily work of the Department, there is still more to be done to meet the challenge of achieving environmental justice. The Department is committed to consistently make progress towards achieving this goal. To that end, we c ontinue to build a str ong foundation within the Department and to engage key stakeholders - communities, other federal agencies, business and industry, and state, local, and tr ibal governments - in this impo rtant work. Your input on the Department's environmental justice activities, strategy, and guidance is always welcome. Tony West Acting Associate Attorney General 2 Introduction The Department of Justice joined 16 other federal agencies in signing a Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Ju stice (MOU) in August 2011. The Department played an important leadership role in the conception and development of the MOU and continues to play an important role in its implementation. The MOU builds upon the foundation laid by Executive Order 12898 - the federal government's first statem ent of an environmental justice policy - and embodies the government's renewed commitment to environmental justice. The MOU promotes interagency collaboration and public access to in formation about agency work on environmental justice, and specifically requires each agency to publish an environmental justice strategy, to ensure that there exists an opportunity for public input on those strategies , and to produce annual implementation progress reports. This report - the Department's second annual implementation progress report - highlights the work and achievements of the De partment in implementing its Environmental Justice Strategy and Executive Order 12898 during fi scal year 2012. The Department is deeply committed to the principles of environmental justice and ensuring that those principles are considered in all aspects of our work. The Department continues to achieve meaningful environmental justice results and to work on ma ny fronts to ensure that environmental justice goals and principles are fully integrated into the mission of the Department. All Americans - regardless of income or race - should breathe cl ean air, drink clean wa ter, and be free from exposure to hazardous waste and t oxic substances. Environmental justice does not mean special treatment, but equal treatment and full pr otection under the nati on's laws, including environmental, civil rights, and health laws. The burden of pollution often falls disproportionately on low-income and minority communities. Sources of pollution are frequently located in or near these areas, and such communities have often expressed a concern that they do not have sufficient sa y in the decisions that affect their health and livelihood. The same is true for tribal communities. The principles of environmental justice can help tribes tackle the unique challenges that pollution poses for tribal culture, land use, and subsistence rights. This report is divided into three sections. Fi rst, we describe the Department's continued interagency collaboration on environmental just ice issues. Working primarily through the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice (IWG), the Departme nt is acting with other agencies to promote a coordinated federal response on environmen tal justice issues. Second, we summarize selected accomplishments of the Department to further environmental justice through its own work and litigation docket. The Department continued to focus its efforts on increased community outreach regarding our litigation work and tangible results for communities. Third, we discuss two public co mments received regarding the Department's Environmental Justice Strategy and Envi ronmental Justice Guidance. 3 Part One: Interagency Collaboration Actively Participating in th e Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice (IWG) Working primarily through the IWG, the Department has played a leadership role in ensuring that there is a coordina ted federal response to environmental justice issues. The IWG, which was originally established in 1994 under Executive Order 12898 and reinvigorated under this Administration, is charged with providing guidance to federal agencies on environmental justice issues; coordinating the development of agency environmental justice strategies; coordinating research, data collection, and anal ysis; holding public me etings; and developing interagency model projects on environmental jus tice. The creation of the IWG underscores the importance of federal agencies working collaboratively to address environmental justice issues. Representatives from the Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) and Civil Rights Division (CRT) regularly attend IWG senior staff-level meetings and identify how the Department can support and furt her the IWG's work. As discussed below, the Department has been actively involved in the work of the IWG this year. Implementing the Interagency Memo randum on Environmental Justice The Department continues to make significan t progress in fulfilling its own obligations under the MOU and furthering the efforts of the IWG: The MOU identified four focus areas for the IWG as agencies implement their environmental justice strategies: (1) im plementation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); (2) implementation of T itle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (Title VI); (3) addressing impacts from climate change; and (4) addressing impacts from commercial transportation a nd supporting infrastructure (called \"goods movement\"). The IWG formed committees for NEPA, Title VI, and, more recently, goods movement. The Environment and Natural Resources Division acti vely participates in the NEPA committee and the Civil Rights Division chairs the Title VI committee. In February 2012, the Department releas ed the Department of Justice 2011 Implementation Progress Report on Environmenta l Justice, its first annual report on the work and achievements of the Department in this area. In April 2012, ENRD Assistant Attorney Ge neral Ignacia Moreno and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bruce Gelber attended the IWG Deputies' Meeting chaired by White House Council on Environmental Quality Deput y Director Gary Guzy and EPA Deputy Administrator Robert Perciasepe. Among othe r topics, each agency shared its views on proposed initiatives. During fiscal year 2012, ENRD took further st eps to institutionaliz e its commitment to the principles of environmental justice and w eave them into the permanent fabric of the Division's work. ENRD selected a career Depu ty Assistant Attorney General to lead the Division's EJ portfolio; created a new Seni or Level EJ Coordinator position for the 4 Division responsible for coordinating envi ronmental justice issues throughout the Division and representing the Division on the IWG; and appointed a Division Community Liaison for the IWG. Each of EN RD's nine Sections has designated an EJ Coordinator and has developed a Section-specific plan for integrating EJ considerations into their day-to-day work. The Section Pl ans have been finalized and distributed to ENRD staff. Increasing Communication and Awareness Across Federal Agencies The Department also continued to collaborate directly with other federal agencies to increase the dialogue on and awareness of environmental justice issues. In fiscal year 2011, ENRD, along with EPA's Office of General Counse l, organized a group of career attorneys from agencies across the federal government to discus s legal issues that ar ise with respect to environmental justice. In fiscal year 2012, the group continued to serve as an important forum for open dialogue, continuing education, and informal counseling among the federal agencies. The discussions fostered by this effort improve each agency's ability to understand not only how to implement environmental justi ce initiatives, but also how to respond to environmental justice concerns within the parame ters of existing law. ENRD attorneys and staff assist in training staff of other federa l agencies regarding environmental justice issues. This past year , ENRD participated in training sessions for personnel from the Department of Energy, for example. CRT conducted several presentations during federal agencies' training programs and environmental justice activities. In part icular, CRT attended programs organized by the Department of Transportation and the Envir onmental Protection Agency as well as the Department of Energy. The discussions addresse d the role of civil ri ghts enforcement and compliance efforts in achieving environmental justice goals. Participating in Community and Other Outreach The IWG continued to conduct listening se ssions in communities around the United States. These sessions provide community me mbers; state, tribal, and local government representatives; busin ess leaders; academics; and other inte rested persons the opportunity to hear about federal initiatives and speak directly to federal agency representatives a bout environmental issues that affect them. These meetings are of ten held in conjunction wi th other environmental and public health-related meeti ngs to maximize the opportunities for reaching a broad spectrum of stakeholders. These regional IWG sessions allow us to hear first-hand from communities so that we can continuously improve how we address environmenta l justice concerns in the work that we do. For example, this fiscal year, ENRD representa tives participated in tours and listening sessions in Corpus Christi, Texas and Richmond, Californi a. We gain valuable feedback from these sessions, and look forward to continuing our participation in more of them. 5 Part Two: Environmental Justice Accomplishments The Department's internal Environmental Justice Workgroup, chaired by the Associate Attorney General's Office, continues to play an important role in Department-wide efforts to consider environmental justice in our work. Af fected components of the Department continue their efforts to increase awareness of envir onmental justice and environmental enforcement issues among their staff. The Department's environmental justice public website ( www.justice.gov/ej ), launched in September 2011, provides information abou t DOJ policies, case resolution, and contact information for the public. The site also provide s the public access to view and comment on the Department's Environmental Justice Strategy an d Environmental Justice Guidance. The public comments received during the last fiscal year are addressed in Part Three of this report. The remainder of this section of the report focuses on four areas of the Department's work as it relates to environmental justice: (1 ) civil rights issues; (2) environmental issues; (3) access to justice issues; and (4) mediation and co nciliation assistance. While the Department's accomplishments in these areas continue to be substantial, there remains much more to be done. The Department will continue to seek out ways to promote environmental justice in all that we do. The Department's ongoing commitment and th ese achievements establish a firm foundation to ensure environmental justice work across th e Department continues in the future. 6 Civil Rights Issues The Department remains committed to upholding civil and constitutional rights. The majority of the Department's work in this ar ea is conducted by the Civi l Rights Division (CRT), which enforces federal statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, disability, religion, familial status, and national or igin. CRT is led by Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, and its work is carried out by twelve sections based in Washington, D.C. CRT's key tool in environmental justice enforc ement continues to be Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discriminatio n on the ground of race, color, or national origin by recipients of federal financial as sistance. Executive Orde r 12250, \"Leadership and Coordination of Nondiscrimination Laws,\" gives the Department au thority to ensure consistent and effective enforcement of Title VI across all federal agencies. The Attorney General has delegated that authority to the Civil Rights Division, and it is the key function of the Federal Coordination and Compliance Section (FCS). FCS ensures that all federal agencies consis tently and effectively enforce civil rights statutes and Executive Orders that prohibit disc rimination in federally conducted and assisted programs and activities. Each federal funding agency has the ultimate responsibility for resolving its Title VI administrative complaints. To the extent any agency funds programs and activities that impact the envir onment or human health, there is the potential for a Title VI complaint to raise environmental justice issues . The Civil Rights Divi sion has aggressively executed its coordination author ity to address adverse environmental impacts on low-income communities and communities of color through a number of ongoing activities, a few of which are listed below: CRT leads the Title VI Committee of the Environmental Justice Interagency Working Group. During FY 2012, the committee identified th e need to improve the distribution of information on the intersection of Title VI a nd environmental justice issues across federal agencies and to the public. The committee has gathered resources from various agencies and will post these resources on the EJ IWG's website. In the upcoming year, the committee will work with the IWG's Public Participation Committee to ensure outreach activities address communiti es' Title VI concerns. CRT provided significant assistance to the Fe deral Transit Administration (FTA) as it revised its Title VI Circular. This guidance doc ument is a critical resource for recipients of funding from FTA. Many recipients of FTA funding operate programs that impact the environment of minority communities. CRT's assistance to FTA ensures its guidance is robust and effective in achieving Title VI compliance by its recipients. In coordination with staff from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Servi ces, the Civil Rights Division met with stakeholders on civil rights concerns in emer gency preparedness, response, and recovery. The two meetings included discussions on cha llenges to civil rights compliance, the role of federal agencies in addressing civil righ ts in emergency manage ment, and strategies 7 employed by nongovernmental organizations working with local governments and communities to protect the righ ts of vulnerable populations. CRT has provided significant input on emer gency management frameworks developed pursuant to Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness. CRT successfully incorporated civil righ ts protections in critical docume nts including provisions to ensure individuals with limited English proficiency have access to information and that local emergency management agencies are aware of the obligations to comply with Title VI and other civil rights laws in emergency situations. CRT continues to work closely with the E nvironmental Protection Agency to strengthen its Title VI program and its Office of Ci vil Rights. The ongoing assistance to EPA provides vital support and resources that will lead to the effective appl ication of Title VI to environmental justice matters i nvolving recipients of EPA funds. Coordination among and within the relevant DOJ components is a fundamental aspect of successfully implementing the Executive Order. The Civil Rights Division has conducted several presentations to attorneys in the Environment and Natural Resources Division. This collaboration is critical to helping attorneys understand the potential for the overlap of EPA's Title VI enforcement activities with environmental enforcement efforts and the Civil Rights Division's Title VI coordina tion authority. In October 2011, CRT launched the new Fe deral Interagency Working Group on Title VI. This working group further supports coordination among agencies whose programs impact the environment and human health. CRT has also met with advocates from e nvironmental justice and transit equity organizations concerned about agencies' Title VI enforcement and environmental justice activities. In fiscal year 2013, the Civil Rights Division will pursue new interagency initiatives to address adverse environmental and health impa cts in violation of civil rights statutes. Additionally, CRT will continue its outreach efforts through participation in environmental justice programs and listening sessions with stakeholders. 8 Environmental Issues The Department remains committed to the strong enforcement of our nation's environmental and natural resources laws. This work is principally handled by ENRD. The Division was founded in 1909, and is led by Assistan t Attorney General Ignacia S. Moreno. The Division is organized into nine Sections and an Executive Office. It is principally located in Washington, D.C., with field offices located in Denver, Colorado; Sacramento, California; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Boston, Ma ssachusetts; and Anchorage, Alaska. ENRD's core mission includes: Strong enforcement of civil and criminal enviro nmental laws to ensure clean air, water, land and other resources for the protection of human health and th e environment for all Americans; Vigorous defense of environmental, wildlif e and natural resource s laws and agency actions; Effective representation of the United States in matters concerning the stewardship of our public lands and natural resources; Vigilant protection of tribal sovereignty, tr ibal lands and resources , and tribal treaty rights; and Protection of the public fisc. Therefore, ensuring that environmental justice is c onsidered in all aspects of our work is a core mission of ENRD. ENRD stri ves to ensure that all communities are protected from environmental harms, including low-income and minority communities that too often are disproportionately burdened with pollution. ENRD works closely with U.S. Attorneys' Offices and in concert with other federal agencies to ensu re that affected communities have a meaningful opportunity for involvement in environmental d ecision-making that affects them, including the consideration of appropriate remedies for viol ations of the law. In fiscal year 2012, the Department took further steps to make environmen tal justice a routine and fully integrated part of its work and that of its client agencies. Conducting Outreach on Environmental Justice Issues ENRD and U.S. Attorneys' Offices have c ontinued to undertake an unprecedented level of community outreach over the la st year to ensure that the Department understands and is responding to community concerns. This has ta ken many forms, including community visits by ENRD and U.S. Attorneys' Offi ces, participation in IWG listening sessions (described above), participation in environmental justice conferences, and outreac h in conjunction with specific cases in litigation. ENRD and U. S. Attorneys' Offices worked di rectly with other components in the Department, federal agency partners, state a nd local officials, and community representatives to organize direct outreach on environmen tal justice issues. For instance: 9 In June 2012, ENRD Assistan t Attorney General Moreno met with U.S. Attorney Thomas G. Walker (E.D. N.C.) and U.S. Attorney Anne Tompkins (W.D. N.C.) to discuss environmental and natural resource issu es within the state of North Carolina. In August 2012, EPA Region 6 hosted a Strategi c Planning Meeting in Dallas, Texas co- led by EPA, ENRD Assistant At torney General Moreno and U.S. Attorney Sara Saldana (N.D. Tex.), and attended by U.S. Attorney s Malcolm Bales (E.D. Tex.), Ken Magidson (S.D. Tex.) and Robert Pittman (W.D. Tex.) to discuss the challenges to enforcement of environmental laws, as well as ensuring that communities will not be burdened disproportionately by environmental and/or health hazards. In August 2012, Assistant Atto rney General Ignacia Moreno , U.S. Attorney Kenneth Gonzales (D. N.M.) and U.S. Attorney Mich ael Cotter (D. Mont.) held a listening session on environmental and natural resources i ssues affecting New Mexico tribes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In September 2012, U.S. Attorney Tim Purdon (D. N.D.) hosted 20 plus U.S. Attorneys and senior staff from ENRD in Bismarck, North Dakota to meet with the North Dakota tribes for listening sessions . Department attorneys from ENRD and the United States Attorneys' Offices continue to follow up on co mments and concerns received from tribes at this session, as well as other sessions convened in other regions of the country during 2012. In November 2012, Assistant Attorney Ge neral Moreno and U.S. Attorney James Santelle (E.D. Wis.) held listening sessions wi th the tribes in the Eastern District of Wisconsin to discuss the challenges to enforcement of environmental laws, as well as ensuring that communities, including those on tribal lands, will not be burdened disproportionately by environmen tal / health hazards. Assistant Attorney General Ignacia Moreno and other ENRD senior staff also spoke about environmental justice on a number of occasions. Examples include: December 7, 2011 New York City Bar Association event April 12, 2012 National Environmental Justice Conference and Training Program in Washington, D.C. April 25, 2012 Hispanic Bar Association of the District of Columbia event April 26, 2012 ALI-ABA Conference on Criminal Enforcement of Environmental Laws May 15, 2012 D.C. Bar event, \"Environmenta l Justice and Fede ral Environmental Policy\u2014A Conversation\" 10 July 5, 2012 World Bank \"Colloquium on Enviro nmental Justice: Access to Information and Public Participation\" July 24, 2012 National Environmental Justice Advisory Council meeting in Crystal City, Virginia ENRD, partnering with EPA, also has foster ed a dialogue with the corporate community regarding environmental justi ce. In July 2012, with Cynt hia Giles, EPA's Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance A ssurance, Assistant Atto rney General Ignacia Moreno convened the first in a series of sessi ons with representatives from the corporate community to discuss environmental justice in enforcement matters. The listening session provided a forum for a fruitful discussion that w ould, among other things, raise awareness within the corporate community of the importance of environmental justice and encourage consideration of environmental justice as a basic component of enforcement and compliance matters. The corporate community has an esse ntial role to play in the conversation on environmental justice and ENRD will continue to look for appropriate ways to engage the corporate community in a productive dialogue on these important matters. Training and Increasing Awareness ENRD has continued to increase awareness and understanding of environmental justice issues among its attorneys and staff. For example, in 2012, ENRD's Environmental Enforcement Section conducted highly successful e nvironmental justice training for attorneys at its Advanced Civil Environmental Enforcement Seminar at the Nationa l Advocacy Center in Columbia, South Carolina. Several U.S. Attorn eys' Offices also attended the training, which focused on incorporating the principles of e nvironmental justice into civil environmental enforcement work and, more specifically, on how to identify and address environmental justice issues that arise. The Section collaborated with the Department's Civil Rights Division and Community Relations Service, the U.S. Attorney's Office for Montana, and EPA to conduct the training. Because community engagement is one of the cornerstones of environmental justice, a veteran environmental justice policy analyst who works on behalf of communities and an expert from academia also were included among the se minar faculty. These participants brought an invaluable perspective to th e environmental justice convers ation, helping to enhance the attending attorneys' understandi ng of community concerns. Th e training was repeated in Washington, D.C. and attended by staff from EES, other ENRD sections, and EPA who were unable to attend the South Carolina seminar. Other sections within ENRD have also work ed to raise the Division's awareness and understanding of environmental justice issues. The Natural Resources Section has worked with other Sections to hold discussions on a wide rang e of issues such as a tool developed by the Indian Resources Section to more effectively characte rize demographics in Indian Country. ENRD and U.S. Attorneys' Offices have coll aborated to increase their awareness of regional environmental justice i ssues. For example, in January 2012, ENRD Assistant Attorney General Moreno, U.S. Attorney Ja mes Santelle (E.D. Wis.), and U.S. Attorney Michael Cotter 11 (D. Mont.) held meetings with federal officials and state officials to discuss environmental and natural resource issues within the Ea stern District of Wisconsin. To facilitate environmental enforcement in Indian Country, in October 2012, Assistant Attorney General Moreno and ENRD staff hosted a week long training session in Columbia, South Carolina focused on \"Tribal and Federal Training on Wildlife and Pollution Enforcement Issues Affecting Tribal Lands.\" ENRD worked with other parts of the Department, EPA, and the U.S. Department of the Interior to develop th is training in response to tribal requests for additional training for both federa l and tribal officials who are involved in enforcing the wildlife and pollution laws that protect tribal lands a nd resources. The training included subject matter experts from ENRD, the U.S. Department of Interior, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U. S. Attorneys Offices and Tribal Environmental Program Directors. More than 60 different tribes signed up to participate as students and faculty. The course was designed to promote federal-tribal partnerships in this area and to help tribes develop the capacity to assume a greater role in enforcement of laws affecting tribal lands, consistent with the Department's focus on strengthening tribal self-governance. Integrating Environmental Justice Princi ples into ENRD Litigation and Outcomes Through enforcement of the nation's environm ental and natural resources laws, ENRD seeks to ensure that all communities enjoy the benefit of a fair and even-handed application of the law, and have a meaningful opportunity for input in the consideration of appropriate remedies for violations of the law. We continue to see the Division's commitmen t to environmental justice demonstrated in litigation results. For example, the following ca ses concluded by ENRD in fiscal year 2012 have furthered the principles or goals of environmental justice: United States v. Metropolit an St. Louis Sewer Dist. (\"MSD\") (E.D. Mo.) is one of the largest environmental enforcement settlements in the na tion's history. Under the terms of a consent decree resolving claims of viol ations of the Clean Water Act (CWA), MSD agreed to make extensive improvements to its sewer systems and treatment plants, at an estimated cost of $4.7 billion over 23 years, to eliminate overf lows of untreated ra w sewage, including basement backups, and to reduce pollution levels in urban rivers and streams. The injunctive relief, historic in its scope and importance to the people of St. Louis, also will significantly advance the use of large-scale gr een infrastructure projects to control wet weather overflows by requiring MSD to invest at least $100 m illion in an innovative green infrastructure program, focused in environmental justice communities in St. Louis. Residents in Memphis, Tennessee, will see si gnificant public health and environmental benefits as a result of the comprehensive CWA settlement reached in United States and State of Tennessee v. City of Memphis (W.D. Tenn.) to address overflows of untreated sewage. The City of Memphis will spend an estimat ed $250 million to make improvements to its sewer systems as well as maintenance-and -repair programs. The parties conducted community outreach and incorporated environmen tal justice consideratio ns into the remedy. For example, the settlement requ ires Memphis to consider \"co mmunity input\" as a factor in 12 prioritizing preventative maintenance and the long-term assessment of its sewer system. Memphis is required to assess 70% of its sewe r system, 10% of which must be done in the first year of the settlement. Of the 10% of th e system assessed, nearly all of the assessment will be in neighborhoods with envi ronmental justice concerns. The city also will prioritize rehabilitation of approximately six percent of its system and nearly all of this rehabilitation work will be done in neighborhoods with environmental justice concerns. The United States filed a complaint in United States, et al. v. Town of Fort Gay (S.D. W. Va.) alleging an \"imminent and substantial en dangerment\" to public health presented by the discharge of untreated sewage into a tributar y upstream of the intake for drinking water supplied by the Town of Fort Gay. Fort Gay is a very small, low-income municipality in West Virginia. In a consent orde r, the town agreed to halt th e discharge of untreated sewage and make urgently needed repairs to its sewage pumping stations. When Fort Gay subsequently violated the order, ENRD nego tiated a consent decree entered in January 2012 to resolve CWA and Safe Drinking Water Act violations at the town's waste water and drinking water treatment plants. The decree pr ovides for $1.8 million in injunctive relief in the form of extensive capital improvements and other meas ures to ensure proper operation, maintenance, and reporting relative to the pl ants. The decree also appoints the Wayne County Commission as receiver over both faci lities until the capital improvements are completed to ensure that the settlement brings lasting health and environmental benefits to Fort Gay residents. In the United States v. Ster ling Suffolk Racecourse, LLC (D. Mass.) CWA settlement, Sterling Suffolk will spend more than $3 million to prevent polluted water from entering nearby waterways from its Suffolk Downs racetrack facility, a concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO), in Revere and East Boston, Mass. Sterling Suffolk is completing construction of a wastewater collection system, is making improvements to its stormwater collection system and has applied for a Nati onal Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. The company will also pay a civi l penalty of $1.25 milli on and perform three Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) worth approximately $742,000. (A SEP is an environmentally beneficial proj ect that a defendant agrees to undertake in se ttlement of a civil penalty action that has a su fficient nexus to the alleged vi olation, but that the defendant is not otherwise legally required to perform.) The SEPs, developed through outreach to the affected communities with environmental ju stice concerns, will provide water quality monitoring and habitat protection efforts for more than 123 square miles of watershed. Suffolk will work with the Mystic River Watershed Association (MyRWA) to conduct monthly baseline and targeted water quality sampli ng throughout the Mystic River watershed and will work with the Saugus River Watershe d Council (SRWC) to conduct a Saugus River watershed sampling program. Both the Mystic River watershed and Saugus River watershed data will be available to the public for free on the MyRWA and SRWC websites. Suffolk will also construct a habitat protection boardwalk in the Belle Isle Marsh, which is immediately downstream of the Suffolk Downs f acility and represents one of the largest remaining areas of salt marsh in Boston Harbor. Under the settlement in United States v. BP Products North America, Inc. (N.D. Ind.), BP will invest more than $400 m illion to install stat e-of-the-art pollution controls and cut 13 emissions from its petroleum refinery in Whiting, Indiana. The United States was joined in this settlement by the state of Indiana as well as by several environmental organizations and citizens who had asserted claims against BP. As a result of the direct participation of the environmental groups and citizens in the settl ement negotiations and input provided by the local community, BP agreed to perform a SEP. The SEP requires BP to install, maintain, and operate a $2 million fence-line emission monitori ng system at the refinery and to make the data available to the public weekly on a public website. This information will allow the local community to monitor future emissions from the facility. The environmental groups and citizens also sought reductions in facility greenhouse gas emissions and, as a result, BP is required to spend an additional $9.5 million at the refinery on projects to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Suiza Dairy Corporation agreed to make significant upgrades to two dairy facilities in Puerto Rico, and conduct community emergency drills, as part of a Clean Air Act (CAA) settlement lodged in United States v. Suiza Dairy Corporation (D. P.R.). The case stems from violations involving Suiza's us e of anhydrous ammonia, an extremely hazardous substance, at both facilities. The proposed consent de cree is the product of extensive community outreach and will have significant health and sa fety benefits to the communities surrounding Suiza's facilities. DOJ and EPA conducted co mmunity meetings near both facilities in August 2011, which led to an agreement by Suiza to conduct emergency drills and train residents and responders in the adjacent commun ities. Suiza has also agreed to implement over 40 compliance measures at each facility, and will also spend approximately $3.75 million on projects to reduce the amount of a nhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration process, improve alarm and ammonia release notification procedures , and provide medical training and equipment. Additionally, Suiza has agreed to pay a $275,000 civil penalty. In United States v. Donald Fillers, et al. (E.D. Tenn.) salvaging company Watkins Street Project, L.L.C., and three individuals were convicted by a jury of conspiracy, CAA violations, obstruction of justice, and fals e-statement offenses related to the illegal demolition of a Chattanooga, Tennessee, factory which contained large amounts of asbestos. During the demolition of the factory, visible as bestos dust emissions engulfed surrounding businesses, residences, and a daycare center. As bestos removed from the factory was left in open piles on the property. Defendants attemp ted to conceal their illegal activities by falsifying documents, lying to federal authoriti es, and using low-paid day laborers to remove the material. Donald Fillers, an owner of Watkins Street Proj ect, L.L.C., was sentenced to 48 months of incarceration, followed by a three-year term of supervised release, and ordered to pay a fine of $20,000. David Wood, a supervisor for Watkins Street Project, L.L.C., was sentenced to serve 20 months of incarceration, followed by a three-year term of supervised release. James Mathis, an owner of Mathis Construction, Inc., was sentenced to serve 18 months of incarceration, followed by a three-year term of supervised release. The company was ordered to pay a fine of $30,000. In additi on, defendants were held jointly and severally liable for $27,899 in restitution for the costs a ssociated with the emergency response and cleanup of the former plant. 14 In fiscal year 2012, ENRD also handled environmental enforcement matters that benefitted Indian tribes. For example: Under the consent decree entered in United States v. Questar Gas Mgmt. Co. (D. Utah), Questar paid a $3.6 million penalty under the CAA to resolve violations at five natural gas compressor stations on the Uintah and Ouray Reservation in Utah. Questar also paid $350,000 into a Tribal Clean Air Trust Fund to be established by tribal member intervenors. The consent decree requires Questar to reduce its emissions by removing certain equipment, installing additional pollution controls, and replacing its natural gas powered instrument control systems with compressed air control syst ems. The actions required in the settlement will eliminate approximately 210 tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 219 tons of carbon monoxide, 17 tons of hazardous air pollutants, and more than 166 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) per year. It also will cons erve 3.5 million cubic feet of gas each year, which could heat approximately 50 U.S. househol ds. The reduction in methane emissions (a greenhouse gas that is a component of natural ga s) is equivalent to planting more than 300 acres of trees. More than half of ENRD's work consists of defending the environmental or natural resources actions of federal agencies. The Division is incorporating the principles of environmental justice into our handling of these case s as well. Several exampl es of this aspect of ENRD's environmental justice effort in fiscal year 2012 are described below: Recent amendments to federal tr ansportation law underscore the n eed to ensure that transit systems serve lower-income communities. A major goal of federal transportati on planning and funding decisions made by the Department of Transportation is to further such \"transportation equity.\" In Honolulu Traffic.com v. Federal Transit Admin. (D. Haw.), the Division vigorously defended the Federal Trans it Administration's deci sion to approve the city of Honolulu's rapid rail project, which will serve lowe r-income communities in western Oahu and reduce traffic congestion in and out of Honolulu. In Crenshaw Subway Coal. v. Federal Transit Admin. (C.D. Cal.), the Division supported the President's number-two infrastructure priority project to bring light rail from Los Angeles International Airport through the minority and low-income Crenshaw neighborhood to intersect with another rail line in Los Angeles. The project will provide the broad benefits of public transportation, and we are working clos ely with the federal and local agencies involved to ensure that they have fully considered and addressed community impacts from building an above-ground light ra il instead of a subway. In Latin Americans for Social and Economic Dev. v. Federal Highway Admin. (E.D. Mich.), we defended a challenge to the Detroit River International Crossing project. Community-, ethnic-, and business-based orga nizations challenged the prop osed construction of a new crossing in the Delray area of Detroit connect ing Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario. Plaintiffs claimed that the Department of Tr ansportation illegally targeted the primarily Hispanic and poor community in siting the proj ect in Delray. We cl osely scrutinized the claims and determined that the agencies ha d developed comprehensive mitigation measures and done extensive work to consider the impact s on the Delray area and the potential impacts 15 to other environmental justice communities from different siting options. We also concluded that much of the impacted community welc omes the expected employment and economic opportunities from the project. The district court found that the agency considered community issues, noting that throughout the NEPA study pr ocess, the Federal Highway Administration took a careful look at impacts to low-income and minority communities. Moreover, the district court held that there was no evidence in the administrative record that the agency downgraded the mitigation measures or that it otherwise misled the community. Climate Change ENRD expects to continue to play a central role in the implementation of the MOU on Environmental Justice, which includes workin g with federal agencies in the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice to address impacts from climate change, one of the four focus areas identified in the MOU. In carrying out its core mi ssion, ENRD has furthered federal agency efforts to gene rally address impacts from climate change by successfully defending EPA administrative action. Over th e past several years, EPA has developed a regulatory program under the CAA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change. In one of the most signi ficant environmental regulatory decisions of the past decade, a unanimous panel of the D.C. Circuit in Coalition for Respon sible Regulation v. EPA upheld EPA's four principal greenhouse gas-rela ted regulatory actions. Through a series of regulations, EPA had (1) found that emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles may reasonably be expected to endanger public heal th and welfare (known as the \"endangerment finding\"); (2) set standards for greenhouse gas emi ssions from motor vehicles; (3) specified how, and to what extent, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from motor ve hicles would trigger stationary source CAA permit requirements; and (4 ) established the measures that states and EPA must take to effectuate such stationary source requirements. 16 Access to Justice Issues The Department is also working to ensure th at those who are exposed to toxic substances have equal access to the justice system tools available to addre ss impacts to human health and the environment. As Hurricane Katrina a nd other disasters have demonstrated, the environmental and health impacts of such disa sters can fall disproporti onately on vulnerable and disadvantaged segments of the population. The Department's Access to Justice Initiative (ATJ), established in 2010, works to help the criminal and civil justice system efficiently deliver outcomes that are fair and accessible to all, irrespective of wealth and status. The Initiative's staff works within the Department, across federal agencies, and with state, local, and tribal justice system stakeholde rs to increase access to counsel and legal assistance and to improve the justice delivery systems that serve people who are unable to afford lawyers. ATJ is guided by three principles: Promoting Accessibility \u2014 eliminating barri ers that prevent people from understanding and exercising their rights. Ensuring Fairness \u2014 delivering fa ir and just outcomes for all parties, including those facing financial and other disadvantages. Increasing Efficiency \u2014 delivering fair and ju st outcomes effectively, without waste or duplication. During fiscal year 2012, ATJ has continued its efforts to, among other things, improve access to legal services for low and moderate income people in high-stak es civil proceedings. For example: Gulf Coast Claims Facility : ATJ worked with the Associate Attorney General's office to be sure that those affected by the BP oil spill rece ived clear explanations of the legal right to compensation and that the Gulf Coast Clai ms Facility (GCCF) provided for free legal assistance to individuals and businesses subm itting claims to the GCCF. Ultimately, the GCCF recommended that practice be adopted by claims facilities addressing losses from future catastrophic events. 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund : ATJ worked with other components within the Department, the New York City Bar, law schools throughout the New York region, the private bar, and advocacy organizations to help make sure th at potential claimants for the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, including first responders a nd those who participated in the cleanup, could easily understand their rights and secure needed assistance. The website for filing claims was translated into Spanish, Mandarin Ch inese, and Polish. Legal clinics were set up at law schools in the New York area to offe r free assistance to individuals in filing their claims. 17 Mediation and Conciliation Assistance The Community Relations Service (CRS) is the Department's \"peacemaker\" for community conflicts and tensions arising from di fferences of race, color, and national origin. Created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, CRS is a specialized Federal mediation and conciliation service available to community leaders and organi zations and state and local officials to help resolve and prevent community tension associated with allegations of discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin. CRS also works with communities to employ strategies to prevent and respond to alleged violent hate crimes committed on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, gender, gender ident ity, sexual orientation, re ligion or disability. Through mediation, conciliation, tec hnical assistance, and training, CRS offers services that can enable community members to participate meani ngfully in environmental decision-making that may affect them. The following ar e examples of these services provided during the last fiscal year: In December 2011, CRS worked in collabora tion with ENRD attorneys to provide technical assistance to minority communities impacted by an environmental issue in Detroit, MI. CRS helped bring conflicting parties together along with local community members, school officials, advocacy offici als, church leaders, and other local organization leaders. It was reported that over 35 community members attended the event. CRS provided conciliation services and facilitated a co mmunity dialogue to encourage and engage community partners. As mentioned in Part One of this report, CRS conducted training sessions for attorneys in ENRD as part of the 2012 Advanced Civil Environmental Enforcement Seminar. The training was conducted pursua nt to a CRS and ENRD Me morandum of Understanding aimed at assisting DOJ's handling of envi ronmental issues by providing training and supporting ENRD attorneys in conducting community outreach. During the training CRS programs, trainings, and services were discussed as well as CRS' role related to environmental issues. CRS helped resolve a conflic t regarding a water project by facilitating discussions between the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Southern Tribes of Utah, which included the Confederated Tribes of Goshute, Skull valley Goshute, and the Paiute Tribe. It was reported that the State of Nevada was allowing water to be diverted from the Colora do River causing concern to Utah tribes. In particular, the tribes were c oncerned that the 300 mile pipe line would disrupt the sacred burial site of Swamp Cedar and have drasti c impacts to ancestral roaming lands. In addition, tribal members believed that the wa ter project would have a threatening impact to tribal water supply and deplete the aquifer. Tensions were furt her exacerbated after tribal members learned that BLM did not pa rticipate in the Southern Nevada Water Authority Project. It was repor ted that a total of 15 Utah and Nevada tribes objected to the water project. CRS contacted the Southern Tribes of Utah a nd the BLM to address the perceived lack of communication between the par ties. After conducting an a ssessment, CRS learned that 18 tribal leaders were particularly concerned that ethnogra phy information provided to the BLM contained inaccurate information regarding the impact to sacred sites and roaming lands. In addition, tribal leaders were concerned that they were given insufficient time to review and comment on the Final Environmenta l Impact Statement. CRS assisted the parties in creating a formal consultation process to develop guiding principles during the Record of Decision. In addition, tribal communities were granted an additional 30 days to review the statement. CRS facilitated discussions be tween an Indian Tribe in Wyoming and the Department of Energy Legacy Program to resolve community concerns and allegations of disparate treatment regarding the scope of groundwater testing being performed. CRS learned that the EPA, the State of Wyoming, the U.S. Geological Survey began groundwater testing in the non-reservation comm unity of Pavillion, Wyomi ng intended to address the possibility of pollutants as a result of fracking. The Northern Arapahoe Office of Tribal Health indicated that in contrast, the Wind River Indian Reservation communities of St. Stephens and Arapaho, approximately twenty-e ight (28) miles south of Pavillion, which were also experiencing community fears and concerns over mill tailing and water contamination, were not included in the testing. Tribal leadership in dicated to CRS that community perception was that Wind Rive r Reservation communities with greater representation of American I ndians were not given equal access to EPA assistance and were reportedly neglected. The Northern Arapaho Office of Tribal Health and the Wind River Office of Environmental Quality reiterated this concern and perception of disparate treatment. It was reported that the Pavi llion community had a high percentage of non- Indian Community members in comparison to the St. Stephens and Arapho communities which were predominantly Am erican Indian populations. CRS contacted the EPA Conflict Preventi on and Resolution Center and the EPA Environmental Justice Program who indicated th at they did not have an active case or National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) pro cess for St. Stephens and Arapahoe. The EPA assistance to these communities had stopped due to an expired technical assistance grant. However, CRS learned that the trib al community was eligible for an additional grant and technical assistance. CRS forwarde d the grant eligibility information to the Wind River Indian Reservation Department of Environmental Quality (WRIR DEQ). CRS determined that the St. Stephens and Arapaho environment clean up and monitoring was under the jurisdiction of the Department of Energy Legacy Program. CRS helped share this information and assisted in comm unications between the Department of Energy Legacy Program and WRIR DEQ. From this partnership, the parties are institutionalizing a formal contract and a water sampling pr ogram involving the trib e. The WRIR DEQ along with Tribal leadership indicate that tr ibal community member s are satisfied with the progress in resolving water sampling fr equency via tribal personnel drawn water samples. 19 Part Three: Response to Public Comments As part of its effort to increase comm unity outreach, the Department shared its Environmental Justice Strategy and its Envir onmental Justice Guidance with the public on September 30, 2011. These documents were initially prepared to implement the Department's commitments following the issuance of Executive Order 12898 on February 11, 1994. Prior to sharing the Strategy and Guidance in 2011, the De partment's internal Environmental Justice Workgroup, chaired by the Associate Attorney Gene ral's Office, carefully re-evaluated these documents in light of the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding on Enviro nmental Justice and Executive Order 12898. The Department determined that the Strategy and Guidance continued to fully reflect the goals and commitments of the Department of Justice. The Department has continued to solicit comments on the Strategy and Guidance through the DOJ Environmental Justice website (www.justice.gov/ej ), as well as through the EPA IWG website and IWG conference calls with environmental justic e advocates and community leaders. To date, the Department has received two sets of public comments regarding its Strategy and Guidance. The Department appreciates the time and resources the commenters committed to reviewing and providing recomm endations on the Department's Guidance and Strategy. One commenter submitted comments prior to the Department's publication of its 2011 Implementation Progress Report. Many of the issues raised in the comments were addressed in the 2011 report; nevertheless, the Department in cludes responses to those comments below. Summary of Comments Submitted The following is a brief summary of the two sets of comments submitted on the Department's Strategy and Guidance. The full text of the comments will be posted on the Department's Environmental Justice website. Comments Submitted by the California Environmental Justice Alliance (CEJA) : CEJA asked the Department to revise its EJ Strategy and Guidance to \"reflect persistent environmental racism\" and \"exhibit a commitment to carrying through the mandate captured in Executive Order 12898.\" CEJA believes the Strategy for Environmental Justic e \"fails to capture significant changes in scientific literature and similarly does not address the changing environmental harms facing environmental justi ce communities.\" CEJA also asked that the Department \"work proactively with other federal agencies to ensure that enforcement efforts further the mandate of Executive Order 12898.\" \"Because DOJ may only bring environmental justice enforcement actions through referrals from other agencies, the Department should work with other agencies to ensure clear lines of communication and adequa te training in how to identify and refer environmental justice cases to DOJ.\" Finally, CEJA as ked that the Department \"take a stronger leadership role in ensuring the timely adjudication of Titl e VI complaints related to environmental justice. \" More specifically, CEJA believes the Department should \"ensure that agency staff receive rigorous training and are held accountable for ensuring that Title VI cases are properly investigated.\" 20 Comments Submitted by Dylan Kesti: While the commenter noted that the Depart ment's Environmental Justice Strategy and Guidance \"are both strong and well thought out do cuments that have brought some successes to communities regarding EJ issues,\" he believed there was still room for improvement to fully promote Environmental Justice for every comm unity. He asked the Department to \"hold regional listening sessions that are accessible to the disabled and Limited English Proficient (LEP) populations in all 93 state Attorney offices in the US an d in all tribal territories by December 2013 . . . to inform DOJ and the community of EJ priorities and the appropriate avenues of action by both parties to mitigate, mediat e, and address EJ issues in communities.\" It was suggested that a member of the Department 's Environment and Natural Resources Division attend each of the listening sessions as a point pe rson and liaison to document the EJ information communicated from and to the community and to work with the Civil Rights Division \"to pursue litigation or mediation using all appropriate environmental, civil rights, criminal, and civil laws to achieve fair environmental protection to be initiated by January 2014.\" The commenter asked that the ENRD liaisons collect the informati on learned through the 93 listening sessions to establish a \"baseline on environmen tal justice issues in the US.\" The commenter then suggested that the Department work to improve those is sues by 25 percent each year, starting in 2014, so that all issues are addressed by 2018. Fina lly, noting the Supreme Court decision in Alexander v. Sandoval (2001), the commenter stated that, becaus e \"plaintiffs no longer have access to the implied private right of action to enforce the di sparate impact regulations of Title VI,\" the Department should \"give CRT effective tools to quantitatively and qualitatively improve the situation of communities impacted by environmental injustice in the United States.\" 21 Response to Comments Submitted The Department's 2011 and 2012 Implementa tion Progress Reports on Environmental Justice speak to many of the issues raised in the public comments received. The following responds to the predominant themes identified in those comments: Revisiting the 1995 Guidance Concerning Environmental Justice and Environmental Justice Strategy One set of comments, received before the Department issued its 2011 Implementation Progress Report, stated that the Department's Environmental Justice Strategy and Guidance are out of date and thereby do not demonstrate a commitment to environmental justice. We disagree with the commenter's assessment. As noted in our 2011 Progress Report, the Department's internal Environmental Justice Workgroup carefully re-evaluated the Strategy and Guidance in 2011 in light of the 2011 Memorandum of U nderstanding on Environmental Justice and Executive Order 12898. The Department determined that the Strategy and Guidance continue to fully reflect the goals and commitments of the Depa rtment of Justice. In light of the public comments received, the Department reviewed th e Strategy and Guidance again and concluded that they continue to evince the Department's co mmitment to make environm ental justice part of its mission by using the tools at its disposal to ensure all communities benefit from a fair and even handed application of the law. One commenter suggested that the Department update its Strategy to \"capture significant changes in scientific literatu re\" and \"changing environmental ha rms facing environmental justice communities.\" While the Department's Strategy and Guidance include a range of factors to consider and examples of potential environmenta l justice matters, they do not attempt to provide an exhaustive list. The Strategy and Guidan ce in no way limit the Department's ability to address emerging legal or scientific issues. Moreover, the Department intends, as appropriate, to incorporate any such issues into its training and other efforts to increase its staff's awareness of environmental justice issues. Thus, the Departme nt did not see a need fo r a wholesale redrafting of the Strategy and Guidance. Instead, we fo cused our efforts on implementing the lasting changes necessary to achieve discernible results through our work, such as the meaningful outreach and outcomes described in this report and the 2011 report. Prioritizing Environmental Justice th rough Title VI Coordination Activities One commenter did not feel that the Department had made environmental justice a priority in its civil rights work. As highlighted in this report, as we ll as the 2011 Implementation Progress Report, the Department has prioritized environmental justice issues in its work. For example, the Civil Rights Division continues to address environmental ju stice matters through its Title VI enforcement and coordination activities wh ich include its extensive assistance to federal agencies, the formation of the Title VI Inte ragency Working Group, and its leadership on the Environmental Justice IWG's Title VI Committee. One commenter also suggested that the lack of federal agency referrals of Title VI administrative complaints to the Civil Rights Division demonstrates a lack of concern for environmental justice. Pursuant to most agenci es' Title VI implementing regulations, matters are 22 referred to the Division only when a voluntary resolution between the investigating federal agency and the federal funding recipient cannot be achieved. The Division has committed a significant amount of resources to assist agenci es whose Title VI programs have the greatest impact on environmental justice communities, as hi ghlighted in Part One and Part Two of this report. That assistance has provided much needed guidance to several agencies that have been able to resolve complaints involving environmen tal justice issues and develop practices to facilitate compliance by recipients and efficient resolution of future complaints. Both commenters recommended that Title VI training be provided to federal agencies. The Department has continued to provide training to federal agen cies' civil rights staff, and has worked closely with agencies to develop their own training programs. Additionally, the Title VI IWG includes a Training Committ ee which has been committed to supporting agency training efforts as well as developing innovative tools to assist agencies in their enforcement and compliance activities. Finally, both commenters recommended amending Title VI to provide a private cause of action to enforce agencies' Title VI impleme nting regulations. The Civil Rights Division recognizes the need for robust enforcement of agencies' implementing regulations, which prohibit both intentional discrimination as well as practices that have an unjustified disparate impact. Private attorneys genera l could serve a critical role in enhancing federal agencies' own enforcement efforts. Until there is legislative action amending Title VI to allow for private enforcement of agency implementing regulations, the Division will continue to provide guidance and technical assistance to federal agencies to ensure federal funds are not used in a manner that either intentionally discriminates, or has the effect of discriminating, agai nst individuals based on their race, color, or national origin. Prioritizing Environmental Justice throug h Collaborative Environmental Enforcement As highlighted in this report, the Department 's commitment to environmental justice is also evident from the numerous ways in which the Environment and Natural Resources Division has integrated the principles of environmental ju stice into its work. One commenter asked that the Department \"work proactively with other federa l agencies to ensure that enforcement efforts further the mandate of Executive Order 12898.\" We agree that fe deral agency collaboration is an important element in achieving environmental justice. The Department has engaged other federal agencies in a variety of ways. As one commenter noted, ENRD only handles civil environmental enforcement cases that have been referred to the Di vision by client agencies.1 Those cases may raise environmental justice concerns. ENRD worked collaboratively with EPA when the agency revised its Model Litigation Report Guidance for civil referrals , to incorporate environmental justice considerations in the developmen t of potential enforcement actions. ENRD also works closely with client agencies to evaluate referred cases to determine if environmental justice concerns are 1 Although the commenter made reference to \"environmenta l justice cases,\" this is a misnomer because there is currently no federal environmental justice statute. Federal agencies refer cases to ENRD that involve violations of environmental statutes, and those cases ma y raise environmental justice concerns. 23 raised, what community outreach might be appropriate, and how environmental justice issues might be addressed through the outcomes sought in those cases. ENRD works with many of the 93 U.S. Attorn eys' Offices and other federal, state, and tribal law enforcement partners to establish prio rities and address the most egregious violations of the law, including those affecting low-inco me, minority and Native American communities. As part of the Environmental Ju stice IWG, ENRD meets regularly with other federal agencies to set strategic goals and share be st practices. In 2011, ENRD established a Resource Agency Liaison Committee to facilitate coordination with other federal agencies. Working in partnership with EPA's Office of General Counsel, the co mmittee works to provide a forum for dialogue, continuing education, and ge neral counseling about envi ronmental justice. Prioritizing Environmental Justice throug h Community Outreach and Engagement One commenter suggested that the Departme nt hold regional listening sessions in the 93 U.S. Attorneys' Office2 locations and tribal territories. The Department agrees that community outreach is important. Successful community out reach provides valuable feedback which can enhance the effectiveness of the Department's work.3 As discussed in this report and the 2011 report, the Department has conducted an unprecede nted level of community outreach in various forms, including participating in stakeholder meetings as part of the Environmental Justice IWG, community visits by ENRD and U.S. Attorneys' Offices, and specific ou treach and training for tribal communities. In addition, in both our affirmative and defensive environmental litigation we seek appropriate opportunities for communities to have meaningful input in decision-making that may affect them. The Department believes that engaging in this type of case specific, outcome oriented outreach is a more efficient us e of our resources. The Department believes it would be neither efficient nor prudent to duplicat e the regional listeni ng session efforts of EPA and the Environmental Justice IWG. Nonetheless, ENRD and CRT will con tinue to work closely with EPA and other agencies and take a leadership role in facilitating th e environmental justice community engagement efforts being spearheaded by the Environmental Justice IWG. The commenters also suggested that the Depa rtment adopt best practices for engaging communities. As described in the Mediation an d Conciliation Assistance section of this report, the Community Relations Service has utilized its long history of community outreach to assist in matters raising environmental justice issues. CRS has also provided training to ENRD attorneys regarding community outreach practi ces and will continue to use its considerable expertise to help facilitate successful community engagement. The Department continues to welcome comments on its Strategy and Guidance and environmental justice activities. The public can email comments to ejstrategy@usdoj.gov . 2 Although the commenter referenced \"93 state Attorney General offices in the US,\" we believe he was referring to the 93 U.S. Attorn eys' Offices. 3 Pursuant to Executive Order 13166, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and other authorities, the Department has and will continue to ensure its activities, including environmental justice outreach, are meaningfully available to limited English proficient individuals and individuals with disabilities. 24 "}
