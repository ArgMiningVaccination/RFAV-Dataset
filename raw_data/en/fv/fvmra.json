In fact, my guest today, Dr. Debra Gambrell, agrees to the current statistics. According to the report, children diagnosed with autism are increasing at an alarming rate. Dr. Gambrell is a board certified pediatric anesthesiologist who went to Osteopathic school in Kansas City. She likewise underwent a traditional internship at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. She also completed a pediatric anesthesia fellowship at the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles in 2009. Autism is something close to Gambrell's heart because her son, Lucas, was diagnosed as autistic shortly after he was born. Her child's condition eventually led her to embark on extensive research on autism for the past ten years. Opening The Second Practice Apparently, there is more to autism than just medication and behavioral treatments. Gambrell shared that she had great success in healing her son three years ago. Consequently, her son Lucas is now doing well in public school. Because of her success in treating her son, Gambrell decided to open a second practice. The practice focuses on helping children diagnosed with autism, sensory disorders, asthma, seizures, ADHD, obesity and other chronic diseases. Living In A Toxic Environment According to Gambrell, the toxicity in our environment is rapidly increasing. Hence, this level of toxicity changed the common diseases to the diseases of neurologic origin. Dr. Gambrell also believes that there is more to digest in our environment. In addition to the physical things to digest, we also have to deal with increased fear, EMF and bad air quality. Apparently, the state of the environment that we live in is a contributing factor to a child diagnosed with autism. And because the bodies of autistic children are more physically dense, it's a long process for them to digest. Consequently, their immune system loses its inherent intelligence. \"Anything that we don't digest is called residual undigested proteins,\" Gambrell explained. \"And anything undigested in the body can trigger the disease. That's the current state of children today.\" Anthroposophical Medicine Rudolf Steiner developed this branch of medicine. It aims to heal the body, soul, and spirit through health and wellness. \"Anthroposophy is a way to know your environment. It also has to do with your thought processes and your feelings,\" said Gambrell. \"It's a study that allows the person to be able to find a grounded center in reality.\" Under anthroposophical medicine, rhythmic massage, therapeutic eurythmy, and therapeutic arts are used for healing. Among the three, rhythm plays a big part and is sub-divided into Nerve-Sense, Metabolic/Limb, and the Rhythmic force. Sensory Disorder There are 12 physical senses. Among the 12, we have five senses that we typically talk about -- hear, taste, touch, smell, see. Often, we fail to realize that we also have to have a sense of balance, movement, word. \"We know autistic children are not able to point,\" shares Gambrell. \"They're not able to look at something because that requires them knowing who they are and what's outside of them. That line gets blurred.\" In the case of children diagnosed with autism, some people confuse autism with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD). Despite that, studies conducted by the Star Institute for Sensory Processing Disorder show that at least three-quarters of autistic children have symptoms of SPD. However, the Star Institute also clarifies that most children who have SPD are not always diagnosed as autistic. Consequently, regardless of what the diagnosis is, both autism and SPD require medical intervention.
