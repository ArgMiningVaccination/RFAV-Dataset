He is a licensed and board certified Naturopathic Doctor in the state of California and Arizona. He started his medical career pursuit at the University of California, San Diego where he earned his Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience and Physiology. While attending UCSD Dr. Melikyan began questioning our current philosophical and scientific approaches to medicine. According to Dr. Melikyan, the practice of allopathic (Conventional) medicine has turned into the fast food health care model wherein about 15 minutes a physician treats and diagnosis individuals with the prime emphasis on symptom reduction without a proper understanding of the root cause of illness. Therefore, instead of opting for a career in allopathic medicine, Dr. Melikyan chose to pursue his naturopathic medical degree because his personal philosophy about health aligned with the core principles of naturopathy. Dr. Melikyan attended a four-year postgraduate Naturopathic Medical School called Bastyr University in San Diego, California. Dr. Melikyan's ultimate goal is to help achieve optimal wellness for his patients and to advance Naturopathic Medicine around the world.
