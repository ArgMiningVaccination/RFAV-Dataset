Update including Novavax Vaccine What's in a vaccine? With the emergence of COVID-19, the crucial role that vaccines play in protecting our health has come into sharp focus. During this pandemic hope comes in the form of a vaccine and immunologists around the world are working to develop a vaccine that will protect us against infection by this new coronavirus. It's important to understand and address vaccine concerns that are prominent in public discussion and may lead to hesitancy to vaccination. Here we discuss questions about the ingredients found in a vaccine. (Source: www.immunology.org) Why you can't compare Covid-19 vaccines Novavax COVID-19 vaccine (Nuvaxovid) ingredients ( [source EMA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/nuvaxovid-epar-product-information_en.pdf)) One dose (0.5 mL) contains 5 micrograms of the of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein* and is adjuvanted Matrix-M. mL hydrogen heptahydrate Sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate - Sodium chloride - Polysorbate 80 Sodium hydroxide (for adjustment of pH) - Hydrochloric acid (for adjustment of pH) - Water for injections Adjuvant (Matrix-M) - Cholesterol - Phosphatidylcholine (including all-rac--Tocopherol) - Potassium dihydrogen phosphate - Potassium chloride - Disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate - Sodium chloride - Water for injections Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine ingredients ( [Source cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/downloads/Janssen-Prep-and-Admin-Summary.pdf)) One dose (o.5 ml) contains: Recombinant, replication- incompetent Ad26 vector, encoding a stabilized variant of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein - Polysorbate-80 - 2-hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin - monohydrate - Trisodium - Sodium chloride - Sodium hydroxide - Hydrochloric acid - Ethanol - Water for injection [Vaccine Preparation and Administration Summary](https://www.pharmaexcipients.com/news/ingredients-and-excipients-in-the-covid-19-vaccines/attachment/janssen-covid-19-vaccine/) AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine ingredients ( [Source Gov.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca)) One dose ml) contains: COVID-19 Vaccine recombinant) 5 \u00d7 10^10 viral particles (vp) *Recombinant, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector encoding the SARS CoV 2 Spike (S) glycoprotein. Produced in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Excipients Sodium chloride - Disodium edetate dihydrate - Water for injections mRNA vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccination has been a big topic and we were curious on the role of excipients in such formulations. Not surprisingly both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna (source FDA) have quite similar compositions: Active Ingredient, [Lipids](https://www.pharmaexcipients.com/news/drug-development-synthetic-lipids/) and a saline solution. Lipid (oil) \"bubbles\" are tiny bubbles of lipid (oil) surround and protect the mRNA so cells in your body can pick it up both vaccines have Cholesterol as part of the composition. The Saline (salt) solutions are also different. Pfizer-BioNTech uses a common type of saline called phosphate buffer solution, or PBS. Moderna uses a tris buffer which aims to make the pH level of the vaccine close to that of our bodies.
