Foods that are rich in Vitamin C should be part of your diet. Unfortunately, only a small amount of consumed Vitamin C can be absorbed by the body. Taking high or frequent doses of oral Vitamin C may cause gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort. An optimal way to maximise the benefits of Vitamin C is through a Vitamin SEA IV therapy. How long will an IV Vitamin therapy last? After a Vitamin SEA infusion, you can expect the Vitamin C levels to stay elevated for two or three weeks. The kidneys oversee controlling this nutrient with a process known as renal reabsorption (when water and other nutrients are removed from pre-urine and put back into the bloodstream). Nephrons within the kidneys maintain a balance of minerals, salts, and vitamins integral to healthy tissue and organ function, so regardless of how much you eat, the nephrons are continually at work to eliminate and reabsorb different substances. If you are lacking Vitamin C, the nutrient will remain in the body much longer after treatment. If you have normal levels, you may experience a temporary increase and then the urine will expel whatever isn't needed. However, even if levels are only temporarily elevated, the benefit of this treatment is helpful to your body: ** Supporting adrenal glands, especially during stress ** Brakes down fats to increase energy and relieve fatigue ** Reduction and removal of free radicals to decrease inflammation including seasonal allergies ** Boost immune system to fight infections- acute and chronic, sepsis, respiratory, viral. ** Reduced effects of chemotherapy and radiation, such as fatigue and nausea (see specifics of Vitamin C & cancer therapy at the end of this additional information) ** Supports collagen production - aids in healing bruises, wounds, strengthen bones and tendons (recommended post orthopaedic surgery) and appearance and texture of skin. Optimising your levels of Vitamin C may assist to sustain the body, and potentially reduce recurring bouts of infections, inflammation, joint pain and increase energy and vitality. IV Vit C is frequently given to patients as a treatment for infections, including sepsis, fatigue, post snake bite, and alongside most cancer therapies Advantages of IV Vitamin C verses Oral Vitamin C The small intestine maintains a deliberately low pH environment to keep stomach acid out and allow small intestine enzymes to work, however this environment dilutes the absorption and delivery of Vitamin C. By the time the Vit C reaches the blood, it can be reduced to about 18%. IVT delivering of Vit C provides 100% bioavailable, meaning the nutrient is at full capacity for the body to use as required immediately, and once administered, it can stay in the body for a more sustained period. IVT of standard and high dose Vit C is recognised to cause very few side-effects Why IV Vitamin Therapy Dr John Myers is credited with the earliest of IV Vitamin infusions. In the 60's, he began administering via an IV, formulas of vitamins and minerals intended to treat different conditions. Dr Myers showed that IV transfusions can be administered when lacking crucial nutrients to restore energy, vitality, and well-being. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that fights free radicals and improves overall health, playing a crucial role in body function and giving an instant rejuvenation. This is why IV Vitamin SEA is so popular. HIGH DOSE VITAMIN C and CANCER THERAPIES What Is High-Dose Vitamin C? When taken by intravenous (IV) infusion, Ascorbic acid - Vitamin C can reach much higher levels. Amounts prescribed have been 15G, 30G, 45G, 60G and 75G of High Dose Vitamin C in a IVT administration - diluted in 500ml - 1000mls Normal saline and infused over 30 minutes and up to 3 hours. HIGH DOSE VIT C can be given in the above dosages weekly and twice weekly, using intravenous access, medical advice required. ** Patients with PICC or PORT access - IV by the SEA has equipment and experience with these modalities of administration. **See IV [hydration information](/waves-of-hydration) for further specification details of IV Therapies What Are the Side Effects and Risks of High-Dose Vitamin C? Intravenous high-dose Vit C has caused very few side effects in clinical trials, however, high-dose Vit C may be harmful in patients with certain risk factors: kidney disorders/failure, risk of developing kidney stones; patients with an inherited disorder called G-6-PD deficiency; and patients with haemochromatosis - Vit C is not recommended as Vitamin C may make the body take up and store more iron than it needs. G-6-PD should be checked via a BLOOD TEST before administration of Vit C, especially for high dose and long term frequent Vit C therapies Your treating doctor, including your specialist physician (i.e. oncologist) should be consulted to ensure high dose Vit C IVT plan is in place and is appropriate for your medical condition. During a Vit C infusion you may feel cold, and extremely thirsty. Sometimes high dose Vitamin C can decrease your blood sugar level causing nausea/ queasy/ sickness. Please bring a snack and your water bottle with you. A blanket, heat pack, herbal teas and filtered water are available during your treatment session. How Does High-Dose Vitamin C Help Treat Cancer? Many studies, including those from fifty years ago, suggested that cancer was a disease of changes in the connective tissue, caused by a lack of vitamin C. In the 1970's, it was proposed that high-dose ascorbic acid (Vit C) could help build resistance to disease or infection and possibly treat cancer. Many studies have been done to find out how high-dose vitamin C may cause the death of cancer cells. The anticancer effect of vitamin C in different types of cancer cells involves a chemical reaction that makes hydrogen peroxide, which may kill cancer cells, (is one theory). **Discussion with an oncologist and treatment team is always advised. Further information and ongoing studies using High Dose Vitamin C alone and combining High Dose IV Vitamin C with other drugs are available. High Dose Vitamin C therapies are used widely around Australia and overseas, however not all physicians in Australia promote these therapies. Please be aware and understand that all vitamin and nutrient infusions and injections given at IV by the SEA, are not considered to be the usual standard of care and can be considered investigational or experimental, despite significant research, studies, and data available.
