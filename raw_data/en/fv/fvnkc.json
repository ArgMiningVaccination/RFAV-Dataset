Interim results of the safety and immunogenicity of the bivalent omicron-containing mRNA-1273.214 booster candidate are presented. Methods In this ongoing, phase 2/3 trial, the 50-g bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.214 (25-g each ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 and omicron B.1.1.529 spike SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs) was compared to the authorized 50-g mRNA-1273 booster in adults who previously received 2-dose primary series of 100-g mRNA-1273 and a first booster dose of 50-g mRNA-1273 at least 3 months prior. Primary objectives were safety and reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 50-g mRNA-1273.214 compared with 50-g mRNA-1273. Immunogenicity data 28 days after the booster dose are presented. Results Four hundred thirty-seven and 377 participants received 50-g of mRNA-1273.214, or mRNA-1273, respectively. Median time between first and second booster doses of mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273 were similar (136 and 134 days, respectively). In participants with no prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, observed omicron neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs [95% confidence interval]) after the mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273 booster doses, were 2372.4 (2070.62718.2) and 1473.5 (1270.81708.4) respectively and the model-based GMT ratio (97.5% confidence interval) was 1.75 (1.492.04). All pre-specified non-inferiority (ancestral SARS-CoV-2 with D614G mutation [D614G] GMT ratio; ancestral SARS-CoV-2 [D614G] and omicron seroresponse rates difference) and superiority primary objectives (omicron GMT ratio) for mRNA-1273.214 compared to mRNA-1273 were met. Additionally, mRNA-1273.214 50-g induced a potent neutralizing antibody response against omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5 and higher binding antibody responses against alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron variants. Safety and reactogenicity profiles were similar and well-tolerated for both vaccines groups. Conclusion The bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.214 50-g was well-tolerated and elicited a superior neutralizing antibody response against omicron, compared to mRNA-1273 50-g, and a non-inferior neutralizing antibody response against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G), 28 days after immunization, creating a new tool as we respond to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. ### Competing Interest Statement SRW has conducted clinical trials funded by NIAID/NIH, Moderna, Inc., Janssen Vaccines, and Sanofi Pasteur; BE, AB and KV have nothing to disclose; DCM reports funding from Moderna, Inc. for pseudovirus neutralization assays performed in the study; LRB is a co-primary principal investigator of the COVE trial funded by NIAID and conducted in conjunction with Moderna, Inc.
