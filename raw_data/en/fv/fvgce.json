Below I've rounded up the best natural energy drinks that are currently on the market. Sometimes in order to get through the day, a mid-afternoon boost is just what you need. So, ditch the monster energy drinks and the red bull and try one of the below alternatives instead. As someone who used to be a bit addicted to energy drinks in college (5 hour energy may have been a frequent purchase of mine), trust me when I say natural alternatives are SO much better! Not only do you avoid the crash and adverse side effects, but they aren't filled with synthetic caffeine, artificial sweeteners or chemicals. BUT FIRST, WHAT IS AN ENERGY DRINK? Energy drinks are drinks that are used to increase alertness and energy. In plant based energy drinks this is usually done through either caffeine or adaptogens. WHAT MAKES AN ENERGY DRINK PLANT BASED? What determines a plant based energy drink might be different from person to person. For this list I specifically looked for vegan energy drinks (so no animal products) that avoided artificial sugars / ingredients (such as sucralose). The drinks below focus on natural ingredients such as adaptogens, as well as natural sources of caffeine (i.e. those coming from yerba mate, coffee, green tea, etc). With that being said, make sure to look at the ingredients in an energy drink before purchasing to make sure it fits your personal preferences. And now let's get into the best natural energy drink brands! 15 BEST PLANT BASED ENERGY DRINKS 1. [Mantra Labs Go Natural Energy Drink Mix ](https://amzn.to/3j77NPj) We're starting this list off with one of my personal favorite plant based energy drinks!
