Parents particularly are looking for alternatives to conventional drugs, as in the last few years some over-the-counter medications have become off-limits for children. Homeopathy is a holistic system of medicine which is used to support our natural constitutional health, and having a strong constitution makes us less susceptible to infectious illness. If you do become ill, research has shown that homeopathic remedies can be effective in the treatment of people with respiratory tract infections (1, 2), otitis media infection and inflammation of the middle ear - commonly referred to as ear infections (3) and sinusitis (4). Homeopathic remedies are non-toxic and safe for use in babies and children (5). Homeopathic remedies all have their own specific 'symptom picture' and this means that a remedy can be chosen not just for 'the cold that's going round the office', but for the particular individual way in which you are experiencing that cold, and also for the reason(s) why you were susceptible to it in the first place. This is one of the major strengths of Homeopathy - it treats you as a unique individual, not a set of common symptoms. So if you come down with a bug this winter, don't forget the option of homeopathic treatment. Your local homeopath can help you to get better, and their treatments can benefit you in other ways as well. References: 1. Riley D, Fischer M, Singh B, Haidvogl M, Heger M M.
