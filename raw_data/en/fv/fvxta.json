When I was in college free speech was the sine qua non of the academy. It is what tenure was designed to protect! The answer may be found in the recent eruptions of student protests at numerous American colleges and universities, including [Amherst](http://theatln.tc/1HY8lNG), Brandeis, Brown, Claremont McKenna, Oberlin, [Occidental](http://lat.ms/1lVKlRD), Princeton, Rutgers, University of California, University of Missouri, Williams, Yale, and others. Most of these paroxysms were under the guise of protecting students from allegedly offensive speech and disagreeable ideas\u2014defined differently by different interest groups\u2014with demands for everything from trigger warnings and safe spaces to microaggressions and speaker disinvitations.

Carroll \u2014 The Serengeti Rules: The Quest to Discover How Life Works and Why It Matters How does life work? How does nature produce the right numbers of zebras and lions on the African savanna, or fish in the ocean? How do our bodies produce the right numbers of cells in our organs and bloodstream? In [The Serengeti Rules](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691167427/?tag=skepticcom20-20), award-winning biologist and author Sean Carroll tells the stories of the pioneering scientists who sought the answers to such simple yet profoundly important questions, and shows how their discoveries matter for our health and the health of the planet we depend upon. One of the most important revelations about the natural world is that everything is regulated\u2014there are rules that regulate the amount of every molecule in our bodies and rules that govern the numbers of every animal and plant in the wild. And the most surprising revelation about the rules that regulate life at such different scales is that they are remarkably similar\u2014there is a common underlying logic of life. Carroll recounts how our deep knowledge of the rules and logic of the human body has spurred the advent of revolutionary life-saving medicines, and makes the compelling case that it is now time to use the Serengeti Rules to heal our ailing planet.

Myth, Mystery, and Margery: When Scientific American Put Psychics to the Test by Michelle E. Ainsworth According to the s\u00e9ance record, the table pushed [a sitter] out of the den, through the dark corridor, and into the ... bedroom... Were four respected physicians and their wives collectively hallucinating? (123) Can the dead talk to the living? With worldwide press coverage and challenges for the future of psychical research? In 1924, Scientific American magazine, which often exposed charlatans, offered a contest for testable s\u00e9ance phenomena. Several candidates were dismissed before the magazine's judges found a Boston medium they nicknamed Margery. In her s\u00e9ances, the table moved mysteriously, the Victrola started and stopped without explanation, the medium's dead brother apparently the cause. Scoffers became converts. Historical context (from the Old Golds brand cigarettes nervously smoked by one of the investigators, to the pop-hit song lyric \"we have no bananas today\"), dramatic tests, and ensuing controversy are engagingly told by David Jaher in [The Witch of Lime Street: S\u00e9ance, Seduction, and Houdini in the Spirit World](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307451062/?tag=skepticcom20-20). The prose brings the past to life, while being weak on precise dates. The book seemed at first reading to be highly credulous, despite including details which, taken together, indicate consistent fraud by Margery. Jaher divides his book into nine major sections and innumerable unnumbered subsections. The first quarter of the book sets the post WWI stage, discussing the US tours by two British spiritualist advocates, scientist Sir Oliver Lodge and writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and background material on magician Harry Houdini. They clash, as Doyle sees religion where Houdini sees fraud. Scientific American magazine regularly ran articles on spiritualism, and a 1920 prize for the best short essay explaining Einstein's theory of relativity had boosted the magazine's circulation. These strands met in a November 1922 editorial meeting to discuss a s\u00e9ance contest suggested, ironically, by Doyle (72), who arranged sittings in England, at different times, for Houdini, the Scientific American editor, and Mina Crandon. (Doyle also corresponded with the editor and with Mina's husband throughout the subsequent investigation). Jaher reproduces the contest announcement in facsimile (82), but does not tell precisely when or where it appeared. [...] SCIENCE SALON APRIL 10 Gravitational Waves, Black Holes and the Nature of the Cosmos On Thursday, February 11, 2016, the National Science Foundation made [a thrilling announcement](https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=137628): gravitational waves\u2014first predicted by Einstein as part of his general theory of relativity in 1916\u2014had been detected for the first time. This incredible development made front page news and was reported by outlets across the country. How was such a remarkable discovery, a long hundred years after Einstein's prediction, made possible? In this Science Salon based on her new book, [Black Hole Blues and Other Songs from Outer Space](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307958191/?tag=skepticcom20-20), astrophysicist and award-winning writer Dr. Janna Levin tells the epic story of the scientific campaign to record these waves\u2014the holy grail of modern cosmology. A handful of physicists, led by Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech and Rainer Weiss at MIT, have been working nearly their entire careers to conceive of, design, and build an instrument sensitive enough to detect gravitational waves. Levin delves into the lives and fates of the scientists, painting compelling portraits of these very human visionaries. She journeys from Los Angeles to Boston, to the LIGO interferometers in Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana, to the labs, offices, and observatories where the work in this great quest has painstakingly unfolded over the past five decades. Her account of the personalities, surprises, setbacks, and successes is a compelling and intimate portrait of the people and processes of modern science.

This cosmological journey accompanies Alexander's own tale of struggling to reconcile his passion for music and physics, from taking music lessons as a boy in the Bronx to studying theoretical physics at Imperial College. Playing the saxophone and improvising with equations, Alexander uncovered the connection between the fundamental waves that make up sound and the fundamental waves that make up everything else. As he reveals, the ancient poetic idea of the \"music of the spheres,\" taken seriously, clarifies confounding issues in physics. Dr. Alexander is the Royce Family Professor at Brown University's Physics Department. In 2013, he won the prestigious American Physical Society Bouchet Award for \"his contributions to theoretical cosmology.\" He is also a jazz musician, and recently finished recording his first electronic jazz album with Erin Rioux.

Subscribe to MonsterTalk this week's eSkeptic: NOW AVAILABLE IN PAPERBACK Request an Autographed Copy from Shop Skeptic In this book, Dr. Michael Shermer claims that we are living in the most moral period of our species' history. It is a book about moral progress that demonstrates through extensive data and heroic stories that the arc of the moral universe bends toward truth, justice, and freedom. Of the many factors that have come together over the centuries to bend the arc in a more moral direction, science and reason are foremost. The Scientific Revolution led by Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton was so world-changing that thinkers in other fields consciously aimed at revolutionizing the social, political, and economic worlds using the same methods of science. This led to the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment, which in turn created the modern secular world of liberal democracies, civil rights and civil liberties, equal justice under the law, open political and economic borders, and the expansion of the moral sphere to include more people\u2014and now even animals\u2014as worthy of moral consideration. Epic in scope, The Moral Arc is the Cosmos of human history.

SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN \"SKEPTIC\" COLUMN FOR MARCH 2016 Left Behind: Political Bias in the Academy In the past couple of years imbroglios erupted on college campuses across the U.S. over trigger warnings (for example, alerting students to scenes of abuse and violence in [The Great Gatsby](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0743273567/?tag=skepticcom20-20) before assigning it), microaggressions (saying \"I believe the most qualified person should get the job\"), cultural appropriation (a white woman wearing her hair in cornrows), speaker disinvitations (Brandeis University canceling plans to award Ayaan Hirsi Ali an honorary degree because of her criticism of Islam's treatment of women), safe spaces (such as rooms where students can go after a talk that upset them), and social justice advocates competing to signal their moral outrage over such issues as Halloween costumes (for example, at Yale University). Why such unrest in the most liberal institutions in the country? Although there are many proximate causes, there is but one ultimate cause\u2014lack of political diversity to provide checks on protests going too far. A 2014 study conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles, Higher Education Research Institute found that 59.8 percent of all undergraduate faculty nationwide identify as far left or liberal, compared with only 12.8 percent as far right or conservative. The asymmetry is much worse in the social sciences. A 2015 study by psychologist Jos\u00e9 Duarte, then at Arizona State University, and his colleagues in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, entitled \"Political Diversity Will Improve Social Psychological Science,\" found that 58 to 66 percent of social scientists are liberal and only 5 to 8 percent conservative and that there are eight Democrats for every Republican. And the problem is most relavent to the study of areas \"related to the political concerns of the Left\u2014 areas such as race, gender, stereotyping, environmentalism, power, and inequality.\" The very things these students are protesting.

About this week's feature In this week's eSkeptic, scientist and historian, Michael Shermer, responds to evolutionary biologist and anthropologist, David Sloan Wilson, about ancient warfare and the notion the blank slate.

Most of the skeletons showed signs of a violent death: blunt-force trauma to the head, broken hands (some of which were bound), shattered knees, cracked ribs and, most revealing, arrowhead projectile points in the skull and thorax and arrow lesions in the neck. The research team, headed by Dr. Marta Mirazon Lahr from Cambridge University, concluded that one band of people was most likely attacked by another band, explaining: The deaths at Nataruk are testimony to the antiquity of inter-group violence and war.

In his book [One Simple Idea: How Positive Thinking Reshaped Modern Life](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307986497/?tag=skepticcom20-20), Mitch Horowitz reports with pride how he responded to a task assigned to him by the teacher of a spiritual group. For a winter camping trip, he had to find heart-shaped pink buckets for the female campers who didn't want to venture into the icy woods at night to urinate. Round wouldn't do; red wouldn't do. He searched for days, annoying his wife, who wondered why he didn't expend the same energy on household tasks. And then, incredibly, he found exactly the right buckets at a neighborhood grocery store.

When something bad happens to you, it certainly seems logical that it is healthier to assume that you will come through it okay than to gloomily mutter, \"I knew it.

All Sacred Cows by Donald Prothero Those of us who have read extensively in the field of comparative religion are pretty familiar with many of the bizarre beliefs and practices of religions and cultures all over the world. But most Americans are alarmingly insular and unaware of other cultures and religions, especially if they've been raised in a small rural town and taught to think only one way by their church. Even in the relatively liberal Presbyterian church where I was raised, serious discussions of other religions were taboo. It was not until high school church groups that I heard about other \"cult\" religions such as Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, Christian Scientists, and Scientologists, and that exposure was simply to mock and condemn their belief systems, without any close examination of the absurdities we were expected to believe.

NEW SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN COLUMN ON MICHAELSHERMER.COM Afterlife for Atheists: Can a Brain's Connectome be Preserved Forever? The soul is the pattern of information that represents you\u2014your thoughts, memories and personality\u2014your self. There is no scientific evidence that something like soul stuff exists beyond the brain's own hardwiring, so I was curious to visit the laboratories of 21st Century Medicine in Fontana, Calif., to see for myself an attempt to preserve a brain's connectome\u2014the comprehensive diagram of all neural synaptic connections. This medical research company specializes in the cryopreservation of human organs and tissues using cryoprotectants (antifreeze). In 2009, for example, the facility's chief research scientist Gregory M. Fahy published a paper in the peer-reviewed journal Organogenesis, documenting how his team successfully transplanted a rewarmed rabbit kidney after it had been cryoprotected and frozen to -135 degrees Celsius through the process of vitrification, \"in which the liquids in a living system are converted into the glassy state at low temperatures.\" Can brains be so preserved? Fahy and his colleague Robert L. McIntyre are now developing techniques that they hope will win the Brain Preservation Technology Prize, the brainchild of neuroscientist Kenneth Hayworth (I'm on their advisory board as the advocatus diaboli). As I write this, the prize is currently valued at more than $106,000; the first 25 percent of the award will be for the complete preservation of the synaptic structure of a whole mouse brain, and the other 75 percent will go to the first team \"to successfully preserve a whole large animal brain in a manner that could also be adopted for humans in a hospital or hospice setting immediately upon clinical death.\" [...] FOLLOW MICHAEL SHERMER ON [Insight](https://www.skeptic.com/author/michael-shermer/) [The Moral About this week's feature In this week's eSkeptic, Harriet Hall, M.D. (a.k.a. The SkepDoc) takes a close look at Samir Chachoua, a man who claims to have discovered a cure for HIV/AIDS, cancer, and a host of other illnesses. Be sure to check out Harriet Hall's free, ten part, video lecture series, entitled Science Based Medicine. [More details below](#freeCourse). Charlie Sheen's HIV Goat Milk Doctor by Harriet Hall, M.D. On January 29, 2016, HBO Real Time host [Bill Maher featured Samir Chachoua](https://youtu.be/dYiq0-M1MDU), a man who claims to have discovered a cure for HIV/AIDS, cancer, and a host of other illnesses. He is not licensed to practice medicine in the US; he operates out of Mexico where he charges rich visitors many thousands of dollars for treatment with his untested vaccines. Most of what he says on the program is unverifiable, demonstrably false, or frankly impossible. Charlie Sheen: Failure, not a Success The problem from the start is that Chachoua claims to have cured Charlie Sheen of HIV, and yet he admits that Charlie still has HIV. What gives? He says Charlie was dying from severe encephalitis, was incontinent, couldn't tolerate daylight, and had severe liver failure. He claims to have \"fixed\" the liver, eliminated all the symptoms, and returned Charlie to vibrant health within a few hours of the first treatment. He claims that \"within minutes\" of starting his therapy, Charlie's liver tests went to normal levels. That is simply not a believable claim, and no proof is on the offing. Damaged tissue takes time to heal. Recovery from chronic illness takes more than a matter of hours. Charlie Sheen was also featured on a recent episode of Dr. Oz. There he described how Chachoua injected himself with Charlie's blood. Bizarrely, he drew blood from some kind of lump on Charlie's elbow rather than from a vein. Dr. Oz was appalled, as anyone would be. Not only was there a risk of HIV transmission, but there was a risk of transfusion reaction from mismatched blood that had not been typed and cross-matched. If the incident really occurred, it was nothing but a theatrical stunt demonstrating Chachoua's overconfidence and poor judgment. Sheen had been on antiretroviral medications that had reduced his viral load to undetectable levels. As with all such patients, this does not mean the virus had been eradicated from the entire body. When Sheen stopped taking the meds, the HIV titers (concentrations) remained undetectable for a while, but then started going back up, exactly as would be expected. Chachoua started treating him during the undetectable period and proclaimed Charlie cured. But then Charlie's titers started rising again. He realized he was not cured and went right back on his antiretroviral medications on the plane home from Mexico.

About this week's feature It's possible that life exists outside of our solar system and that we may, one day, find it. The Internet has been abuzz with speculation that an alien megastructure orbiting the star KIC 8462852 is responsible for the star's erratic flicker. Since scientists have yet to advance a convincing natural explanation, attention has turned to more tantalizing possibilities. In this week's eSkeptic, Dr. George Michael discusses a number of theories that have been advanced to explain the anomalous activity of the star. The Great ET Paradox: Why We are Likely to Find Them Before They Find Us by George Michael Despite over 50 years of effort, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) enterprise has yet to detect any telltale signs of sentient life beyond Earth. But exciting news of an anomalous star 1,400 light-years from Earth has raised new hopes that we are not alone in the galaxy after all. Using data collected by the Kepler space telescope, astronomers discovered that the distant star\u2014KIC 8462852\u2014flickers in an unusual way, as if some unknown celestial bodies were intermittently obscuring it. Of the roughly 150,000 stars within view of the Kepler telescope, KIC 8462852 is the only one that glimmers in this odd fashion. [1](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-great-et-paradox/#note01) Since it has been observed over the past few years, KIC 8462852 has dimmed dramatically, at times dropping in brightness as much as 22 percent. [2](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-great-et-paradox/#note02) Moreover, the recorded dips have not been regular, but uneven and unpredictable. Tabetha Boyajian announced these amazing findings that she and members of Planet Hunters\u2014a citizen science program launched at Yale University\u2014in a paper recently published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. [3](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-great-et-paradox/#note03) A number of theories have been advanced to explain the anomalous activity of the star. Conceivably, the dips in light could be occasioned by an orbiting a planet, but even a Jupiter-sized planet would only dim this type of star by only 1 percent as it transited across. Furthermore, the irregular flickering associated with the star would not be consistent with a planet making a regular orbit, which would produce predictable dimming. Perhaps fragments from a planetary collision could be responsible for the dimming light, but such events are so rare that we would not expect Kepler to pick up such activity based on probabilities. [4](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-great-et-paradox/#note04) Finally, the star could be surrounded by an accretion disk of dust and rubble that has not yet agglomerated into planets or been gobbled up by the star itself. Such an explanation would be convincing if the star was young, but KIC 8462852 appears to be mature. As Jason Wright, a professor of astronomy at Penn State University, noted, the star is moving too fast to have formed recently, as it fails to show any infrared signs of a big disk that would normally be associated with the material that could cause such dips in brightness. [5](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-great-et-paradox/#note05) Because scientists have yet to advance a convincing natural explanation, attention has turned to more tantalizing possibilities. By far the most exciting is that an alien megastructure is responsible for blocking the light emitted by the star. [6](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-great-et-paradox/#note06) After news of the star's unusual features was released, SETI scientists quickly began using the Allen Telescope Array in California to examine radio emissions from the area of star for any signs of Paradox: Why We are Likely to Find Them Before They Find Us](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-great-et-paradox/) [George Michael](https://www.skeptic.com/author/skeptic/)| [Comments (6)](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-great-et-paradox/#comments) Despite over 50 years of effort, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) enterprise has yet to detect any telltale signs of sentient life beyond Earth.

Perhaps fragments from a planetary collision could be responsible for the dimming light, but such events are so rare that we would not expect Kepler to pick up such activity based on probabilities. [4](#note04) Finally, the star could be surrounded by an accretion disk of dust and rubble that has not yet agglomerated into planets or been gobbled up by the star itself. Such an explanation would be convincing if the star was young, but KIC 8462852 appears to be mature. As Jason Wright, a professor of astronomy at Penn State University, noted, the star is moving too fast to have [CONTINUE READING THIS POST...](https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-great-et-paradox/#more-32259) [alien megastructure](https://www.skeptic.com/tag/alien-megastructure/), [aliens](https://www.skeptic.com/tag/aliens/), Benjamin \u2014 The Magic of Math: Solving for x and Figuring Out Why](https://www.skeptic.com/michael-shermer-show/the-magic-of-math-solving-for-x-and-figuring-out-why/) [Skeptic](https://www.skeptic.com/author/skeptic/)| Comments Off on Dr. Arthur Benjamin \u2014 The Magic of Math: Solving for x and Figuring Out Why [The Magic of Math](https://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b169HB) is the math book you wish you had in school.

How does nature produce the right numbers of zebras and lions on the African savanna, or fish in the ocean? How do our bodies produce the right numbers of cells in our organs and bloodstream? In [The Serengeti Rules](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691167427/?tag=skepticcom20-20), award-winning biologist and author Sean Carroll tells the stories of the pioneering scientists who sought the answers to such simple yet profoundly important questions, and shows how their discoveries matter for our health and the health of the planet we depend upon. One of the most important revelations about the natural world is that everything is regulated\u2014there are rules that regulate the amount of every molecule in our bodies and rules that govern the numbers of every animal and plant in the wild. And the most surprising revelation about the rules that regulate life at such different scales is that they are remarkably similar\u2014there is a common underlying logic of life. Carroll recounts how our deep knowledge of the rules and logic of the human body has spurred the advent of revolutionary life-saving medicines, and makes the compelling case that it is now time to use the Serengeti Rules to heal our ailing planet.

Introduction: Skeptic Viewing the World with a Rational Eye by Michael Shermer Ever since the early 1980s when I discovered the elegant and entertaining essays by the late Harvard evolutionary biologist and paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould\u2014initially through his early essay collections in books (Ever Since Darwin and The Panda's Thumb) and subsequently in monthly form as they rolled off the presses for Natural History magazine\u2014I have maintained a deep passion to write science for general audiences. Not \"popular science\" writing per se, but more along the lines of what Gould strove for in his essays: deeper truths within scientific discoveries. As he wrote in the Preface to a later collection of essays, The Lying Stones of Marrakech: I have tried, as these essays developed over the years, to expand my humanistic 'take' upon science from a simple practical device...into a genuine emulsifier that might fuse the literary essay and the popular scientific article into something distinctive, something that might transcend our parochial disciplinary divisions for the benefit of both domains (science, because honorable personal expression by competent writers can't ever hurt; and composition, because the thrill of nature's factuality should not be excluded from the realm of our literary efforts). Transdisciplinary doesn't begin to describe the breadth and depth of Gould's oeuvre, and it has been a mark at which I have aimed in my own writing. In a 2002 paper published in the journal Social Studies of Science entitled \"This View of Science,\" I presented the results of a content analysis I conducted of all 300 essays Gould penned in his 25-year monthly streak, revealing five deeper themes that appeared in them: Data-Theory, Time's Arrow-Time's Cycle, Adaptationism-Nonadaptationism, Punctuationism-Gradualism, and Contingency-Necessity. The first theme on how data and theory interact interested me the most, inspired as I was by a quote Gould occasionally employed from his hero Charles Darwin: \"How odd it is that anyone should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service!\" The context for that quote, as I explicate in the first essay in this volume (in what I call \"Darwin's Dictim\"), was that Darwin was challenged by his critics to just put his data forward and not to bother theorizing too much. But as the founder of evolutionary theory knew, the facts never just speak for themselves; they are always viewed through the lenses of theory. The two\u2014observations and views, data and theory\u2014are the conjoined twins of science. That theme\u2014the interplay of data and theory\u2014is the central and unifying schemata in all of the essays in this volume. Gould completed his streak of 300 consecutive monthly essays in January of 2001. My first essay in Scientific American was in April of that year, but with a three month publication lead-time I actually penned the first one that January, close enough for an intellectual transition (if only in my mind). The 75 essays in this volume are from the first six and a quarter years of my own streak that\u2014good health and fortune willing\u2014will reach 300 in April of 2026, with several more essay volumes to come. I have grouped them into ten sections by topic within the larger data-theory schemata. I. Science. In this section I set the tone of the entire series with Darwin's Dictim in the first essay, giving examples of why data and theory are necessarily bound together, then move through essays whose themes related to general scientific principles and debates, such as what scientists should say when they're wrong (\"I was wrong\" is a good start) and what it means to be wronger than wrong, scientism and why people look up to scientific superstars like Stephen Hawking, how to tell the difference between the ideas of a cutting edge scientist versus a cutting edge amateur, how to communicate science in both words and pictures, and the nature of scientific replication. II. Skepticism. These essays range from classic skeptical debunkings (from the \"faked\" moon landing to 9/11 conspiracy theories) to the delicate balance between orthodoxy and heresy in science and when we should be skeptical of a heretical idea, and the fine art of baloney detection. III. Pseudoscience and Quackery. There is also a difference between heresy and crazy, and the essays in this section explore why smart people fall for the latter, why being too open-minded is not always a good idea, why scams and cons work, and why bad ideas are dangerous to the point where they can kill. IV. The Paranormal and the Supernatural. The essays in this section are about nothing. That is to say, there is no such thing as the paranormal and the supernatural; there is just the normal, the natural, and mysteries we have yet to explain. Talking to the dead, ESP and PSI, Bible codes, random electronic signals that sound like voices, and illusory patterns in Beatles' albums, and what happens when a skeptic goes to the New Age capital of the world. V. Aliens and UFOs. This is one of my favorite of all subjects in the skeptical pantheon of things to investigate, because there are really two different questions: Are aliens out there? and Have aliens come here? The answers to these two questions are \"probably\" and \"probably not.\" These essays consider what it means to search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, and how we would know when we made contact, a good reason why we have not yet heard from ET, what time travel means for the search, and what it feels like to be abducted by aliens. VI. Borderlands Science and Alternative Medicine. For my money the most interesting ideas are not those that are obviously right or wrong, but those that, if they are true, would be revolutionary. Nanotechnology and what it means for immortality, cryonics, cloning, and cures for the common cold, and other remedies that promise us the world but rarely deliver. VII. Psychology and the Brain. I am by training a psychologist so I am always interested in how our brains work, especially how we can so easily be fooled and mistaken in believing things that are not true. The essays in this section explore the many facets of human psychology as it relates to our beliefs about the world, especially how and when our intuitions serve us well or lead us astray. VIII. Human Nature. Fundamental to who we are and why we think and act as we do is our evolved biological nature, and the essays here consider a number of highly controversial scientific theories in this regard. For example, are we noble or ignoble savages? Are we biologically predisposed toward making love and war? Can we unweave the heart to understand love and attachment? And what is happiness, anyway, and can science measure it? IX. Evolution and Creationism. Ever since I was in college this topic has periodically erupted on the political and cultural landscape as scientists hope creationism goes away while creationists continue to evolve new strategies to wedge their ideas into the minds of the public, including and especially students. These essays dip into that controversy from a number of different points ranging from science to politics. X. Science, Religion, Miracles and God. Outside of the specific case of creationism, which focuses on evolution as a perceived threat to a narrow sect of religious belief, there is arguably no more contentious topic in all of science today than how it relates to religion, miracles, and God (most notably the latter's existence\u2014or not). It seems to be a perennial topic for scientists and philosophers of all stripes to ring in on, with new books landing on my desk almost weekly since I began this column a decade and a half ago. That's a lot of ink spilled to solve a problem that may be insoluble. Is it? The essays in this final section consider that question, and others, in what is essentially a guide to how to think about science and religion, even while offering my own often strongly worded opinions. Writing monthly essays for Scientific American has been one of the most consistent joys in my life. I look forward each month to exploring a new theme or topic, chosen based on a number of criteria partially shaped by the editorial policies of the magazine, which has been in print for over a century and a half (so they know what they're doing). These include new and newsworthy findings, discoveries, experiments, surveys, articles, and books in science that people care about and\u2014fitting with my data-theory schemata\u2014in each essay I try to connect them to some deeper theoretical idea with some relevance for society and culture. My pathway in this series has been navigated around many rocky shoals by the remarkable editors at Scientific American, including most notably John Rennie, Mariette DiChristina, and Fred Guterl, all of whom have struck the perfect balance of editorial hand, improving my prose without rewriting to the point of unrecognizability. And I would especially like to thank the fact checkers at Scientific American, most notably Aaron Shattuck, who has caught some potentially embarrassing whoppers before they went to press. In cycling we have a saying: there are only two types of cyclists\u2014those who have crashed and those who are going to crash. Well, in literature there are only two types of writers\u2014those who need editing and those who are going to need editing. The \"Skeptic\" column\u2014and by extension this book\u2014would not be possible without such supreme editing. I thank them, and the readers of Scientific American who have consistently supported my column, for this great honor. A final note on length and content To the original essays of this collected series I have, where appropriate, added updates that include corrections and addendums of new information that has come to light since the original publication dates. As well, I have included the slightly longer versions of the essays as I originally penned them for Scientific American; that is, my original published essay length was one page with an illustration, which delimits the word count to around 700. But I usually wrote around 800-1000 words and then started cutting, a painful process that I endured by promising myself that one day the full-length versions would come to light (the \"director's cut\" as it were). It's not that there was anything wrong with the original 700-word pieces, only that they breathe a little freer when I'm allowed to flesh out a thought or explain an idea with a few additional sentences as I attempt to view the world with a rational eye, the reading line for SKE?TIC.
