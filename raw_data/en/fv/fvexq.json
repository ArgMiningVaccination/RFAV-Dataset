Unfortunately, there is no magic remedy regarding diet and loss of belly fat. When you lose weight on most diets, typically belly fat is lost first. A sensible weight management program which combines exercise and a balanced diet is key. Does this mean cutting calories? Usually, yes. A 250-500 calorie deficit over maintenance calorie needs is a sensible starting point for most people. This should result in a weight loss of about \u00bd to 1 pound per week, without really adversely affecting you. What is the risk of belly fat? Studies point to the fact that a big belly can be trouble for your heart. The incidence of heart disease rises in women with a waist circumference of more than 35 inches and men with a waist circumference of more than 40 inches. Big bellies can affect the organs involved in regulating blood sugar. Insulin stimulates the liver to store sugar in the blood for later use. Belly fat keeps the liver from doing this efficiently, so more blood sugar accumulates in the bloodstream, increasing the risk for diabetes. So what foods should you avoid and why? Too many calories in general should be avoided, but watch out for the following: Eat only moderate portions of lean meats and consume fish 2-3 times/week; consume low fat dairy and avoid added fats, like bacon, butter and creamy salad dressings. What foods should we be eating long-term to reduce belly fat? A calorie-appropriate diet, focused on a wide variety of vegetables and fruit, whole grains, healthy fats and lean protein is the answer. Consider the Mediterranean eating style. What about carbs? Vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans (legumes) as well as lowfat dairy contain the type of healthy carbs your body needs. A balanced diet should typically contain about 45-50% calories from good carb sources. What about indigestible carbohydrates? Indigestible carbs (soluble fiber) may play a role in prevention. According to recent studies, a diet rich in soluble fiber can help with satiety/weight management and may have a slight advantage on the management of visceral fat. We need both soluble and insoluble fiber to be healthy, and most Americans get around 16 grams of dietary fiber/day, well short of the 25-38 grams/fiber/day requirement. How can soluble fiber be incorporated into a diet? To boost your soluble fiber, aim to get about 10 grams per day. This is achieved by eating two small apples per day; one cup of green peas; or \u00bd cup of pinto beans. What other foods contain soluble fiber? Other sources include oats, nuts, barley, psyllium seeds, Brussels sprouts, avocado, sweet potato, figs, nectarines, carrots and many other fruits and vegetables.
