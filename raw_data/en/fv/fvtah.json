But before you freak out, know that it's also quite common\u2014and in the vast majority of cases, not a cause for alarm. \"When the top layer of your skin flakes or peels off, that's often a result of some type of inflammation underneath the skin or something that the skin has come into contact with,\" [Isha Tiernan, MD](https://www.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/physiciandirectory/isha-tiernan), board-certified dermatologist at SELF. More specifically, that means you've likely reacted to a topical irritant or allergen such as a detergent in a dishwashing soap. But there are other common culprits, too, including dry skin due to a cold climate or frequent handwashing, as well as more chronic conditions like eczema (atopic dermatitis) or psoriasis. The good news is that, in most instances, with a little sleuthing (and plenty of [hydrating moisturizer](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-moisturizer-for-dry-skin)), you can probably make the skin peeling on your fingers soft and smooth again. Read on as we answer your top questions and share what you need to know in order to figure out the cause of your peeling and flaky skin\u2014plus how to treat and stop it. [What are common causes of skin peeling on fingers?](#commoncauses) | [Can an immune-system disorder cause skin peeling?](#immunesystem) | [What about stress?](#stress) | [What about vitamin deficiencies or infections?](#vitamins) | [Any more rare causes?](#rare) What are some common causes of skin peeling on fingers? Spring has technically arrived, but for many of us, the winter has been long and cold, leaving our hands out to, ahem, dry. \"Typically, in the winter months, skin becomes more dehydrated and sensitive because, in cold weather, there's less humidity in the air, plus we're usually hanging out in dry, heated environments,\" [Shari Hicks-Graham, MD](https://columbusdowntownderm.com/our-practice/meet-our-staff/columbus-dermatologist-shari-hicks-graham-md/), board-certified dermatologist in Columbus, Ohio, and of the [American Academy of Dermatology](https://www.aad.org/public), tells SELF. \"Together, that strips the natural levels of moisture in the skin: The water we have in our skin escapes into the environment and doesn't get replenished, so we end up with dryness and peeling.\" This can become an especially uncomfortable and irksome problem if you already have sensitive skin to begin with, she adds. Treating dry skin boils down to repairing the skin's barrier and replenishing its moisture. The best way to do that is to use a thick cream-based moisturizer and to use it daily (these are some of our favorite [hand creams for dry skin](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-hand-creams)). \"I tell my patients, whichever one you choose, buy five and then make them accessible: Put one at your kitchen sink, one at your bathroom sink, one at your desk, one in your car, and one by your bed,\" [Robin L Travers, MD](https://www.skincarephysicians.net/about-us/physicians/dr-robin-travers-dermatologist/), board-certified dermatologist in Boston, \"That way you won't forget to use it.\" Consider also [using a humidifier](https://www.self.com/story/best-humidifiers) in your home and doing something as simple as wearing gloves, which can protect your skin against drying environmental elements during the colder months, adds Dr. Tiernan. After the initial stages of a sunburn\u2014in which the skin is inflamed, tender, and sometimes hot to the touch\u2014peeling often occurs because the skin is trying to repair its topmost layer, [Erin Boh, MD, PhD](https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/dermatology/faculty/erin-e-boh-md-phd-faad), board-certified dermatologist SELF. \"Those sunburnt [skin] cells are basically going to die, then that causes the barrier to get disrupted,\" she explains. \"The cells normally would be 'glued' together, but these dead or dying cells start losing their 'glue,' so to speak.\" And it's when these damaged skin cells come \"unglued\" that you'll start to notice some peeling. For milder cases, cool compresses, gentle and soothing skin protectants like aloe vera, and pain relievers can help reduce the discomfort of a sunburn, Dr. Tiernan says. But if your sunburn is more severe, meaning it's a deeper shade of red and much more painful, it's likely that the lower levels of your skin are also affected and inflamed. In these cases your skin will probably blister before it sloughs off, Dr. Boh says, adding that your first step toward [treating a severe sunburn](https://www.self.com/story/how-to-treat-painful-sunburn) should be taking an anti-inflammatory pain reliever, like ibuprofen, within 24 hours of getting burned. Your dermatologist can also prescribe a topical steroid to help mitigate the inflammation in the first few days. The past couple of years have reminded us that [washing your hands frequently](https://www.self.com/story/how-to-actually-wash-your-hands-the-right-way) is key to staying healthy. Unfortunately, the more you wash, the more you're likely exposing yourself to detergents that can strip moisture from, and possibly irritate, the skin on your hands. When an irritant is involved\u2014such as chemicals in hand or dishwashing soap\u2014even those of us who have less sensitive skin may end up finding that theirs becomes dry and inflamed, Dr. Travers says. To help repair your skin and prevent your hands from becoming too dry again, make sure to wash your hands with lukewarm water instead of piping-hot, which can also contribute to the stripping of your skin's protective oils that naturally keep moisture locked in, Dr. Tiernan says. And, again, use hand cream daily to restore your skin barrier\u2014you can make the moisturizer even more effective by using it directly after showering or washing your hands to seal in the water already on your skin. Otherwise, you'll likely just end up back where you started, with irritation, little breaks in the skin, and inflammation, Dr. Tiernan explains. \"When someone comes into my office with skin peeling on their fingers and hands, about 80% of the time it's due to irritant contact dermatitis,\" Dr. Travers says. As the name implies, this condition occurs when an irritant of some sort comes into contact with the skin and creates inflammation. That irritant may be from common items you have around your house like soaps, cleansers, hand sanitizers, alcohols, chemicals in nail polishes, solvents, and even mechanical irritation, like rubbing and chafing, Dr. Travers says. (Dry, peeling skin on your hands or fingers resulting from repeated hand washing is often a form of irritant contact dermatitis since it includes exposure to a detergent as well as the mechanic rubbing of paper or towels to dry the hands.) \"For some people with sensitive skin, they can develop this kind of dermatitis after a single encounter. But the fact is, with any irritant, there's always going to be a breaking point, even for people who have thicker, more resilient skin,\" Dr. Travers says. Step one in treating contact dermatitis on your hands is figuring out what the irritant may be and removing it from your daily routine, Dr. Travers says. That may take some trial and error\u2014start by eliminating the most obvious, like a new soap or lotion, and then go from there\u2014so you might want to talk to a dermatologist, if you're able, to see what help they can provide. \"Step two is to try to restore the skin's normal barrier with the simple act of moisturizing,\" Dr. Travers says. Your skin should start to go back to its usual state after that, but if that doesn't make it better and it remains inflamed, then the third step is to potentially treat the inflammation with medicines such as topical steroids, which your doctor can prescribe, she says. Though the symptoms of this condition are similar to irritant contact dermatitis\u2014you'll see irritated, inflamed, dry, or scaly skin\u2014the difference is that with allergic contact dermatitis your body is actually having an allergic reaction to a substance that it doesn't like, so the symptoms are the result of that immune response. With irritant contact dermatitis, the offending irritant damages your skin's protective barrier to the point where it causes a [rash](https://www.self.com/story/decode-rash-questions), irritation, or scaly skin after a single or repeated exposure. Allergic reactions are less common and it takes multiple exposures to the same chemical to develop an allergy, Dr. Travers says. \"The classic example is of hairstylists who, after years of exposure to hair dyes, shampoos, or other chemicals, suddenly become allergic and develop painful inflammation and dryness on their hands,\" Dr. Hicks-Graham says. Other common allergens include jewelry metals (like nickel), cosmetic products, fragrances, and preservatives, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/contact-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352742). The best way to prevent allergic dermatitis, Dr. Hicks-Graham says, is to identify and avoid your trigger or set of triggers which, as with irritant dermatitis, will likely take some trial and error. If you're in the middle of a flare, your dermatologist can prescribe a topical steroid to help mitigate the inflammation. In the meantime, keep your skin hydrated with rich emollient creams or even good ol' Vaseline (petroleum jelly)\u2014per the [American Academy of Dermatology](https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/skin-care-secrets/routine/petroleum-jelly), it's an affordable, effective moisturizer that doesn't contain fragrance or other common irritants or allergens. \"There are some medications, such as antibiotics like doxycycline, that can make you more sensitive to sunlight and specifically cause irritation on the tops of your hands and fingers,\" Dr. Travers says. This can look like a sunburn that eventually will start peeling like one, she says. Other drugs, such as isotretinoin (used to treat acne), can actually dry out your skin all over your body including your forearm, fingers and hands, she says. While you may not want to stop taking the prescribed medication because of these side effects, you might want to ask your doctor if there are any alternative drugs available that might not cause the same reaction. Otherwise, wearing [sunscreen](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-sunscreen-for-face) and keeping your hands moisturized will help prevent your fingers from getting dry and painful, Dr. Travers says. Can an immune system disorder cause skin peeling on fingers and hands? Yes! Topping the list: [Hand eczema](https://www.self.com/story/hand-eczema-treatment) is a common condition that affects about 1 in 10 people living in the U.S. Eczema can easily be mistaken [for regular old dry skin](https://www.self.com/story/dry-skin-eczema) because it gives the skin a similar appearance and tends to occur [more frequently in winter](https://www.self.com/story/eczema-winter-tips). But eczema usually has specific triggers, like allergens and irritating substances, and will likely require further treatment. Also, research suggests that [genetics may play a part](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/atopic-dermatitis/#inheritance), so if eczema as well as asthma or hay fever run in your immediate family, your risk of developing this condition increases. Symptoms include redness, itching, pain, cracks, as well as dryness to the point of peeling and flaking. It often affects people who work in cleaning, catering, hairdressing, health care, and mechanical jobs where they may come into contact with chemicals and other irritants, according to the [National Eczema Association](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/types-of-eczema/hand-eczema/). It can be tricky to differentiate between contact dermatitis and [eczema](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/eczema), as they both cause similar symptoms and those with eczema are prone to developing contact dermatitis. \"Anytime the skin is dry and prone to inflammation, you're more likely to develop contact dermatitis,\" Dr. Tiernan says. That said, there's actually another form of hand eczema called dyshidrotic eczema that doesn't follow that rule. \"While atopic eczema (the most common type of eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis), happens more often in the dry winter months, this eczema tends to get triggered and worsened by sweat, so we see it occur more often in the summertime,\" Dr. Travers says. Jobs that require frequently getting your hands wet can also trigger an outbreak. It usually appears first as a rash of painful, blister-like bumps, and as the blisters heal, the skin dries and often reddens and peels, leaving the hands tender. Regardless of the kind of eczema you have, moisturizing is still a very important preventive step, Dr. Tiernan says. But she adds that eczema patients should also make extra sure to keep their skin clean, avoid irritants that may have triggered an outbreak (like harsh cleansers and fragrances), and steer clear of any known allergens. (Your doctor can do a [\"patch test\"](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/types-of-eczema/hand-eczema/) to see which allergens or irritants may be the problem and help you find ways to modify contact or avoid them.) Get in touch with a dermatologist as soon as you notice a flare. \"Once the eczema happens, it's really important to try to see a provider right away, because we can prescribe steroid creams or ointments that can help calm down the inflammation,\" Dr. Tiernan says. If you're in the middle of one, your dermatologist can prescribe a topical steroid to help mitigate the inflammation that comes with contact dermatitis, she adds. In the meantime, Dr. Tiernan says it's important to keep your skin hydrated and use hypoallergenic products as often as possible. And remember: Per the [American Academy of Dermatology](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/atopic-dermatitis), it's a myth that to reduce flare-ups, you should skip washing your hands and getting your skin wet (yes, even for those with dyshidrotic eczema\u2014just make sure to remove rings beforehand, so moisture doesn't get trapped, and gently pat hands dry thoroughly). Bathing removes bacteria and other germs from the skin, which can reduce skin infections. Just use lukewarm water instead of hot and as with all dry [skin conditions](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/skin-health), apply a moisturizer to the skin while it's still damp to help lock moisture in and reduce dryness, Dr. Tiernan says. [Psoriasis](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/psoriasis) is an autoimmune disorder that occurs when skin cells grow abnormally, producing thick, scaly, and inflamed patches on the skin. It typically appears on the scalp, knees, elbows, and trunk. But for about 40% of patients with plaque psoriasis, the most common form of the disease (it affects around 7.5 million people in the U.S., per the AAD), it also appears on the hands and feet, according to the [National Psoriasis Foundation](https://www.psoriasis.org/advance/when-psoriatic-disease-strikes-the-hands-and-feet/). With [hand psoriasis](https://www.self.com/story/hand-psoriasis), it tends to show up as dry, scaly, peeling skin on the palms and back of the hands, but can creep up the fingers occasionally as well. Psoriasis can be a complex condition to understand and manage, and the right treatment depends on the type and severity of your symptoms. Your dermatologist may recommend using topical medications, light therapy, or a combination of treatment options, as SELF previously reported. But it's just as important to avoid things that could cause a [psoriasis flare-up](https://www.self.com/story/psoriasis-flare-up-tips) in the first place, which may include trauma or injury to the skin, infections, and stress, Dr. Tiernan says. Psoriasis is also yet another condition that can sometimes appear as dry skin, but if your skin doesn't improve with an increased moisturizing regimen, that's a sign that you may be dealing with an underlying issue like psoriasis. If your skin isn't getting better or is starting to flake and peel more, get in touch with your dermatologist. Can stress cause peeling skin on my hands? \"Any inflammatory dermatitis, such as eczema, can certainly be triggered or exacerbated by stress,\" Dr. Hicks-Graham says.1 Indeed, when we get stressed out, our body goes into fight-or-flight mode and responds by increasing the production of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. Too much cortisol suppresses the immune system and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin. For people living with eczema, or even psoriasis, that can mean a bad or worsening flare-up, according to the National Eczema Association. One way to reduce physiological and mental stress is by doing things like getting enough sleep, exercising (which can be anything from walks outdoors to biking to practicing yoga), meditating, journaling, dancing\u2014basically anything that calms your mind and body. And stress-reducing lifestyle changes aren't helping\u2014or aren't helping enough\u2014consider [finding a therapist](https://www.self.com/story/find-affordable-therapist-guide), if you're able. A trained mental health professional can help you get to the root cause(s) of your stress and offer research-backed solutions. Are there any vitamin deficiencies or infections that can cause skin to peel on hands and fingers? Yes, but thankfully they're not that common. If the skin on your fingertips is suddenly flaky, you may have a vitamin B deficiency, and in particular, [vitamin B3 (niacin)](https://www.self.com/story/what-niacinamide-can-do-for-your-skin), which helps to protect and repair skin. According to a 2021 review in the International Journal of Women's Dermatology, a chronic lack of niacin in your diet can lead to photosensitive dermatitis, which can then result in dry, peeling skin.2 The good news is that it's exceedingly rare to have a niacin deficiency here in the United States (where it's added to breads and cereals in addition to it being naturally available in chicken, turkey, salmon, and other foods) or other high-income nations. A deficiency in vitamin D, which is more common (affecting about 28% of U.S. adults, per a 2018 study in The British Journal of Nutrition), may exacerbate atopic dermatitis, according to a 2020 study in the journal Dermatology\u2014but that research is still preliminary. 3 4 There's also a relatively uncommon fungal infection called tinea manuum that can cause skin to peel. A type of ringworm, the infection often starts on the palms and can spread to the backs of the hands and fingertips, causing red, rash-like sores, that can become dry and itchy, and then ultimately peel. This can easily be treated by your doctor with antifungal medicines. Are there any more causes to know? Finally, there are some (very rare) situations in which peeling skin is a symptom of a much more severe condition\u2014one that may require immediate medical care. In particular, Dr. Boh points to [Steven Johnson syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stevens-johnson-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355936), a severe reaction to a new medication whereby the skin breaks out into a painful rash and blisters before shedding. And Dr. Tiernan notes that [toxic shock syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355384) often comes with peeling skin, too, as well as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, body aches, and confusion. Again, it's unlikely that one of these conditions will sneak up on you, but if your skin is peeling off in large sheets or if the shedding skin is accompanied by extremely tender skin or a fever, see a doctor right away.
