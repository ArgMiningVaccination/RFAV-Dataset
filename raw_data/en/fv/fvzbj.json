Discuss with patient, guardian, and clinical team Myocarditis prior to COVID -19 vaccination Receive any FDA -authorized COVID -19 vaccine if heart has recovered Myocarditis after 1stdose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine but prior to 2nddose Defer 2nddose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine until more information is known However, if heart has recovered, could consider proceeding with 2nddose under certain circumstances. Discuss with patient, guardian, and clinical teamWork Group InterpretationCOVID -19 mRNA vaccines in adolescents and young adults: Benefit -risk discussion Work Group Interpretation 41Initial presentations are reassuring; however, continued monitoring of cases, clinical course, and long -term outcomes of myocarditis after mRNA vaccines will be important Need to follow the benefit -risk balance as we learn more around myocarditis, as well as updates to epidemiology (cases, variants, etc) Currently, the benefits still clearly outweigh the risks for COVID -19 vaccination in adolescents and young adultsCOVID -19 vaccines are recommended for persons 12 years of ageand older in the United States under FDA's Emergency Use AuthorizationCOVID -19 mRNA vaccines in adolescents and young adults Current COVID -19 vaccine policy 4243Questions for ACIP 1.What does ACIP think about the benefit -risk balance of COVID -19 vaccines in adolescents and young adults, in the setting of reports of myocarditis? 2.What additional information or analyses could inform these discussions as we continue to closely monitor this situation?
