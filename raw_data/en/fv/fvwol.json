We are grateful and extend our appreciation to the Western Regional Office, United States Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutrition Services, and WIC Program for providing us with the opportunity to complete this project, via Operational Adjustment Funds. Project T eam Members The following individuals contributed to the completion of this project. Caren Webb, MPH, RD, LD University of Alaska Anchorage Kendra Sticka, MS, MEd, RD, LD University of Alaska Anchorage Fatima Hoger, MS, RD, LD State of Alaska WIC Nutrition Coordinator 1PurPose of AlA skA wic NutritioN c Are PlANs: WIC's goal is to promote and support healthy eating, positive nutrition, and lifestyle behaviors for participants. Though the risk factors themselves remain federally defined, the Alaska WIC Nutrition Care Plans (NCP's) have been revised to change their focus to determining nutrition education topics and issues important to the participant. The NCP's help promote interactive conversation between the CPA and participant, based on the participant's perceived needs and desires. The more individualized and participant focused process, supports positive health outcomes, as the participant sees the counseling discussions as relevant to their specific concerns. The NCP's move away from staff focused education through lectures to giving participant tips and tools to improve in ways that the participant sees as important. The goals of the NCP are to: Provide a reference for suggested appropriate interventions for each risk. Guide the CPA's method of obtaining additional information from a participant regarding their risk(s). Further explore \"where the participant is\" in regard to their risk factor(s) (assessing readiness for change related to each risk). Identify counseling and education strategies and resources that are appropriate for the participant based on their stage of change in regards to the risk topic. Identify key referrals that should be considered for the risk(s). Remind CPA's to document participant's goals and plans for participant follow-up. Uses for the NCP's: Risk reference- during an appointment: - May be used as a reference at certification or education appointments, anytime risks are discussed or education is given; when the CPA feels they need guidance or suggestions for a risk. Risk training- to increase knowledge: - A tool to help staff become more familiar with the risks; and to suggest key education points specific to each risk. To spark critical thinking: - Each participant contact (scenario and situation) is unique and should be handled as such- the NCP's provide key points. The CPA must determine which points are most appropriate and supportive for the individual participant. To practice using open-ended questioning: - Closed ended questions are questions that result in a \"yes-no\" response. They close the conversation because yes-no doesn't lend itself to any type of further detailed conversation. Open ended questions are questions in which the participant must give more information to provide an answer. They open the door for more discussion: Example close ended: Do you eat well? Example open ended: Tell me how eating is going for you? To provide legitimate evidence based references, websites and handouts for each risk: - It can be difficult to determine if a website or reference is a competent, reliable source of information. NCP's attempt to include sites deemed as appropriate, by reputable agencies. 2Policy & Procedures Related to NCP's: Procedures that continue with implementation of the revised NCP's: The certification process is still performed to determine eligibility through nutrition assessment and risk assignment, using the VENA approach and certification guidelines as in the Alaska WIC Policy & Procedure Manual. The participant is to be informed of the risk(s) assigned to them (made aware of the reason for their eligibility). High risk participants are referred to the WIC RD (Registered Dietician) when assigned risks that the state has designated as high risk. The frequency of nutrition education will be per Alaska WIC Policy and Procedure Manual guidelines. Nutrition education is to be documented in the participant's AKWIC computer record. Scope of practice: all staff should be aware of their defined scope of practice and be prepared to make appropriate referrals when they reach the limits of their comfort level. As with any health care professional, the CPA must recognize the extent of their nutrition knowledge. Anytime the CPA is unsure of their knowledge regarding a risk or nutrition topic, they should refer the participant to the RD. Even if a CPA feels comfortable with a particular high risk topic, they must refer all designated high risk participants to the WIC RD. Counseling process changes with implementation of the revised NCP's: NCP's are a tool for staff and are not intended to be a \"form\" given to participants: - For mail-out clinics, the NCP's should not be mailed to a participant. They are a tool that can be used for face-to-face or phone conversations. NCP's are a guide not a \"script\" (not to be \"read\" word-for-word directly to a participant). NCP's present only one sample participant scenario per risk: - They do not include every possible scenario one may experience at the clinic. NCP's present \"suggested\" key education points (messages and interventions) for each risk (based on the federal risk sheet descriptions and justifications). - Depending on the participant's needs the CPA may determine additional points that would be appropriate. Documentation of counseling should include patient centered goals based on the participant's readiness to change, input, and indication of follow-up needed at the next appointment. NCP's include examples using the \"ruler\" or \"scale\" counseling tool. These are used when asking participants to rate their feelings or knowledge: - For example, \"On a scale of 1-10, how comfortable are you with making the change to whole milk?\"\" NCP's are a tool for staff and are not intended to be a 'form' given to participants. \"uNderst ANdiNg terms: The care plans incorporate participant focused methods and tools introduced to Alaska WIC in recent months, including: VENA PCE Motivational Interviewing Stages of Change Critical Thinking What is VENA? VENA is Value Enhanced Nutrition Assessment: The process of completing a comprehensive risk assessment- by streamlining dietary assessment tools to focus on individual nutrition education, support, follow-up, and documentation. What is PCE? PCE is Participant Centered Education: It is a framework for providing nutrition education that places the participant at the center of the nutrition education process. The certifier acts as a counselor or advisor who listens and helps guide the participant. What is Motivational Interviewing? Motivational Interviewing: Is a participant-centered counseling style for eliciting behavior change by helping participants to explore and resolve ambivalence. This means helping the participant consider and recognize that they have a problem, weigh the pros and cons of change, and decide to change (or not!). What are Stages of Change? Risk improvement depends on how motivated the participant is to change. Stages of Change are the cycles the participant goes through to decide if they want to change and deciding what the change will mean to them. Behavior change doesn't occur in one step; it progresses through several steps (stages). The formal Stages of Change Model identifies the following stages: Precontemplation- I'm not interested in change Contemplation- Someday I will change Preparation- I want to change but I am not sure I can Action- I am ready to change Maintenance- I am in the process of changing 34For a more user friendly model, we have used a simplified version of the stages in our care plans, using the following \"levels of readiness\" to change: Not Ready- participant is not motivated & not ready to change: - Staff goal: raise awareness and determine participant's areas of doubt. Unsure- participant has low confidence about changing: - Staff goal: raise awareness, identify barriers to participant's change, and build participant's confidence to change. Ready- participant is motivated to change and confident in ability to change: - Staff goal: help participant plan for change and support participant. What is Critical thinking? Critical Thinking is a skill in exploring and evaluating the participant's situation and interpreting all the information provided. It involves pulling together all of the information available and evaluating it using one's knowledge of evidence and experience. It includes: Gathering and assessing complete information. Evaluating alternatives and options. Recognizing issues and finding solutions. Assuring credibility, not just accepting information. Avoiding basing situation only on one's own individual beliefs. A guide to action. how do NcP's fit iNto APPoiNtmeNt flow? As mentioned, WIC risks are assigned prior to use of the NCP's. Once risks are assigned, the CPA may then use the NCP as a guide. The NCP helps the CPA lead the participant, using a participant-focused approach, to gather additional information on the participant's feelings about their assigned risk. The intent of the NCP's is not to repeat what is already on the WIC applications, but to assist in finding more information and determine the participant's readiness to make changes to improve their risk. The NCP helps the CPA: Determine what issues the participant finds important. Decide what education (knowledge or action) is appropriate for the risk. Determine if the participant wants to change their risk status. It may be that the participant doesn't want to change. The NCP then helps guide the CPA to determine what topic, if any, the participant is interested in and ways to redirect the conversation. Once risks are determined, the NCP's are on hand for the CPA as a reference to look up details for risk factors that the CPA may feel they need help with (i.e., the manual provides help with nutrition concepts, and provides references that will help guide \"what to do\" or \"where to go\" with the participant).\" The NCP then helps guide the CPA to determine what topic, if any, the participant is interested in and ways to redirect the conversation. \"5How do NCP's fit into the Participant Centered Education process? Though the CPA determines the risk(s) that create a participant's eligibility status, in Participant Centered Education (PCE), the participant is involved in discussion of their risk(s) and determining what actions or topics are important to them. Information and education provided on an assigned risk depends on the participant's preferences and desires. How do Stages of Change fit into NCP's? Risk improvement depends on how motivated the participant is to change and what barriers the participant has to making changes. The Stages of Change is a model that describes stages people go through as they make behavior changes. People go from being unaware they have a problem, or not wanting to make a change, to knowing they have a problem and being ready to change, to the process of actually making changes and maintaining that behavior. desigN of NcP's: Each risk code fits on one page. Information on the NCP is specific to the risk; it is not generic nutrition information: - For example, if the risk relates to folic acid, folic acid foods are noted, not every nutrient provided by WIC foods. They provide suggested open-ended questions for gathering information. These are not the only questions that could be used. Layout of the NCP's: Risk Definition: The first section of each NCP , the Description, provides a description of the risk, based on the federal risk criteria. This is a brief synopsis. Additional definition, details and risk justification can be found in the Alaska WIC Risk Manual. The second section of the NCP , Assess Readiness for Change, assists with the first step of WIC counseling; gathering more information from the participant to determine how they feel about their risk(s), what they know about the risk(s), determine how interested they are in the risk(s), and if they are ready or wanting to make any changes. 6From the participant's responses, the CPA will have an indication of how much the participant knows about the topic or condition and how ready they are to change. The client is either: Not Ready Unsure Ready Once you determine the participant's level of readiness to change, follow that row across for guidance on continuing your counseling session based on the appropriate level. For each of the three of levels of readiness (not ready, unsure, ready), the NCP provides counseling strategies under the Try Counseling Strategies column. 7At this point the CPA's counseling strategies should be: Continue to gather information from the participant. - Their level of readiness will lead your conversation: If not ready, you may find out why not or find out if there is another relevant topic that interests them. If unsure, you may find out their hesitation, and how you can best help move them toward being more ready. If ready, this opens the way for you to find out what they have tried, and what they would like you to help them with, whether it is information, support or referrals. Involve the participant in the discussion with open ended questions. Be empathetic to the participant's situation, feelings, and cultural beliefs. Incorporate, when appropriate, participant \"education\". - This is where many CPA's struggle with using PCE. This is not a time to lecture participants but is a time where the CPA can make the participant aware of something they aren't aware of. This can elicit more conversation and provide a clearer understanding of the participant's feelings, needs, and desires. Your critical thinking skills help you decide when, or when not, to provide education. At times you may provide education because you: Feel that providing the education might affect the participant's readiness to change by increasing awareness (i.e. a mom who doesn't know bedtimes bottles can affect teeth just erupting). Feel the participant is in imminent danger (i.e. participant with a Hgb of 5.0 and hasn't seen a Dr.). Use it to continue discussion or to gather even more information (i.e. lactose intolerant avoiding all dairy; may not need to). EXAMPLE: In our lactose risk, you can \"inform\" (educate) a participant, with a simple positive comment, that people with lactose intolerance can sometimes tolerate small amounts of milk products like cheese. It can be worded in a way that can then lead to more conversation- such as asking whether they have tried cheese, what happened when they tried it, or whether they would be interested in trying it if they haven't. Without lecturing you can make a statement that educates and also starts to open up further conversation! You now have a pretty clear idea of what the participant thinks about the risk(s), what they want to do, and how you can support them. As you continue to follow across the rows you will find suggested education under the Try Education column. 8Below we walk through suggested education at each of readiness levels using our lactose intolerance example: Example Not Ready: participant is dealing with their intolerance or likes things as is and doesn't desire any information: You are required federally, to let the participant know what risk(s) you assigned. - This can be a time to provide some brief thoughts on their risk(s) and see if it leads to any further discussion. Offer information on the risk(s) before assuming or giving them a handout. Ask if there is something else they would like help with or information about - they may have a worry or issue other than what you may want to talk about. If high risk, refer to the RD. Example Unsure: Continue to ask questions to gather more information of where the participant is at: - Such as: they aren't sure what to try, aren't sure if it is important to them, they tried things that didn't work, what barriers they have to overcome, etc. Education would be based on the participant's interest. - Since there are many possible participant scenarios and responses, we placed the \"meat\" of the interventions under Unsure-Try Education section. There you will find the science based nutrition care concepts and treatment approaches suggested for the risk. Related medical and clinical issues to be aware of (medication interactions, affect on weight, etc.). Points to pursue or provide in the form of changes that would help improve the risk(s) (suggested foods, supplements, care of side effects of condition, etc.). 9Note: for a participant desiring information, these are the appropriate education approaches for the risk. It is not to say, when appropriate, that these concepts don't also apply to participants who are at another level of readiness. Example Ready: You have a participant who desires help- emotional support, nutrition information or referrals. More open ended questions may be used to fine tune what the participant needs. Record Plan or Goal: A sample chart note is shown for each level of readiness. Education contacts should be documented in the participant's record: Following the patient centered philosophy, notes should reflect the participant's level and what they do or do not plan to do (change). Notes should indicate what follow-up is needed at the next appointment. You are not limited to these goals; again your notes will be individualized for your participant's scenario and situation. Educational Resources: In the final section of the NCP's are the Education Resources: references, learning tools, and handouts related to the risk. These may be materials for a CPA to gain self knowledge or may be handouts or sites that could be provided directly to interested participants. The NCP's provide a few, not the only, resources available. Resources used were those with easy access, typically handouts and websites. They do not include sources like text books, videos, etc. Many of the resources noted apply to multiple risks. If you find a resource listed for one risk that would also be helpful when counseling on another risk, you can certainly mix and match! For example, an \"infant feeding guide\" may be helpful for risk 428 Diet Associated with Complementary Feeding Practices as well as risk 411.4 Developmentally Inappropriate Feeding. In the back of the NCP manual is a summary of all of the resources incorporated in the NCP's. The summary also includes additional resources not listed on the individual NCP's (due to space) that may be helpful. kNowledge st AtemeNts: Within the NCP's are Knowledge Statements. These comments are not intended to be made directly to participants; they just provide health or nutrition information to increase staffs' clinical knowledge. summAry: The NCP's are your guide for providing participant centered counseling and learning more about WIC risks and appropriate interventions. Involve your participants to experience a fulfilling appointment for both of you! 10 Alaska WIC Pr ogram Nutrition Care Plan Version reater risk low birth weight infant; pregnancy complications , anemia, premature rupture membranes, C -sections Assessing Readiness for Change with open en ded questions \"When not pregnant, what weight do you feel best at ?
