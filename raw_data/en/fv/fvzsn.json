AIR, FIRE and WATER 3 Five Elements 4 AIR, FIRE and WATER Qualities AIR Qualities Governs movement and activities of the nervous system Cold Light Dry Irregular Rough Moving Quick Changeable If AIR predominates, movement and change are characteristic of your nature. You will tend to always be on the go, with an energetic and creative mind. As long as AIR is in balance, you will be lively and enthusiastic, with a lean body. Physica l Characteristics of AIR Those with a predominance of AIR usually have a thin, light frame and excellent agility. Their energy comes in bursts, and they are likely to experience sudden bouts of fatigue. AIR t ypes typically have dry skin, thin hair and cold hands and feet. They sleep lightly and their digestion can be sensitive. When the AIR becomes imbalanced, it manifests in the body as weight loss, constipation , hypertension, arthritis, weakness , restlessness, and digestive challenges. All types of pain involve this air qual ity, in that it is too much and need s to balance out. AIR stage of life begins around 50 and gradually increases. 5 FIRE Qualities Controls digestion, me tabolism, and energy production The primary function is transformation . Hot Light Intense Penetrating Pungent Sharp Acidic Those with a predominance of FIRE have a fiery nature that manifests in both body and mind. Physical Characteristics of FIRE FIRE types are usually of medium size and weight. They sometimes have bright red hair, and baldness or thinning hair is common. They have excellent digestion, which sometimes leads them to believe they can eat anything , including spicy food. They have a warm body temperature an d they sleep soundly for short periods of time. When in balance, FIRE types have a lustrous complexion, perfect digestion, abundant energy, and a strong appetite. When out of balance, they may suffer from skin rashes, burning sensations, anger, p eptic ulce rs, excessive body heat, heartburn, and indigestion. FIRE stage of life is 25-50, robus t. 6 WATER Qualities Governs the structure of the body It holds the cells together and forms the muscle, fat, bone and sinew. The primary function is protection. Heavy Slow Steady Solid Cold Soft Oily Physical Characteristics of WATER WATER types tend to have a strong build and excellent stamina. They typically have large, soft eyes, smooth and radiant skin, and thick hair. Those who are predominantly water, sleep soundly and have regular digestion . But when WATER builds to excess, weight gain, fluid retention , lethargy and allergies manifest in the body . When they're out of balance they may become overweight, sleep excessively , and suffer from asthma, diabetes, and depression. WATER stage of life is 0-25. 7 Three Treasures and Catabolism The Three Treasures: \"nutritive supernatural being\" Definition of Catabolism: Noun Biology Catabolism is t he breakdown of complex molecules in living organisms to form simpler ones, together with the release of energy; destructive metaboli sm 8 Session Two Bodywork Body work refers to exercise, Qi Gong, Dao Yin/Yoga, self -massage and self - acupressure. Exercise Get some! Reduces pain and stress Facilitates weight loss to reduce pressure on joints Strengthens the muscles and ligaments to keep joints in place Increases circulation of Qi and Blood Releases endorphins beneficial for the mind and emotions Gets your heart rate up Walking, jogging, cycl ing, swimming, aerobics class, tennis, etc. Stretch before and after Warm up the joints/massage your area of pain before exercise Pace yourself: set a goal and work towards it over a period of time, incrementally Consult your Physical Therapist to learn wa ys to exercise that are best for you If you have pain while exercising, do you need to rest? Is the pain expected? Be aware of your posture and body mechanics, be present, mindful exercise Remember to maintain a balance always: be consistent, don't overdo it, stick with the plan and conserve your energy even when it feels good. 9 Qi Gong Life Energy Cultivation Aligning body breath and mind for the purpose of health, meditation and martial arts training Coordinating slow flowing movements, deep rhythmic breathing and a calm meditative mind Many forms The Daily Dozen Dao Yin Internal Energy Conductance (similar to Yoga) Lao Tzu (a philosopher and poet of anci ent China , wrote Tao Te Ching) \"The developed one keeps his mind unoccupied and his en ergy substantially within. He weakens his ambition and strengthens his bone.\" \"When people are alive, their bodies are soft and supple. When people die, they are still and hardened\". Self-massage & Acupressure See handout on how to do it Entire body or focus on area of pain Tin Man phenomenon/needs oil Locating tender points and applying pressure for a few minutes on and off Tools Physical therapy (PT) exercises Porcupine balls, tennis ball, thera -cane, flat bands 10 Self-Massage How to Self -Massage at Home Air and Water types can use untoasted and unrefined organic sesame oil Fire types can use either a good quality coconut or olive oil The b athro om is an ideal place to massage. B e sure the room is warm enough for your comfort. After a bath or sh ower is a great time, as your muscles will be relaxed and warm. Warm a little oil in your hands; you really don't need very much. Apply sweeping strokes, varying according to the effect you want - larger, softer strokes are more relaxing. Slide over the skin using a steady pressure with the entire surface of your hands. If massaging your shoulders, sweep hands over the whole shoulder, encompassing its shape, then gently glide back to where you began, and repeat several times working the oil into the skin. You can massage your single area of pain or your whole body. Massaging your stomach can aid digestion. Massage the lower right side of the abdomen working your way upwards to just below the rib cage in a firm, circular motion. Continue across and then do wnwards along the opposite side towards the pubic -bone area, and repeat several times. This is a diagram of the abdomen, massaging in the direction of your digestion. right left 11 Deep -tissue massage loosens muscle tissue, releases stagnation and improves circulation. Use slow strokes with deep finger pressure over areas of tension, moving along the muscles. Be careful, however, not to damage delicate tissue if you're recovering from an operation or injury - always reduce pressure if it feels too painful. Massaging after exercise can help prevent the build -up of lactic acid in the muscles, which means you'll feel better the day after, too. Massaging joints before exercise can also assist with less pain and stiffness during your work -out or stretching sessio n/ Massage helps prevent and treat headaches. Use two fingers to apply pressure on the bridge of the nose between the eyebrows (Yintang) and along the eyebrows into the divot next to the eyes. Tension is often carried in our hairlines. Massage at the fr ont hairline and then work your way around the ear and into the back of the scalp. A pply gentle pressure to areas that may feel tender. Repeat this five to 10 times every day for prevention or during an acute phase of headache if it feels good to you. For sinus pain, work along the cheekbones towards the ears with your fingers to ease congestion. To release tension in your jaw, apply a small amount of oil and use your index fingers to perform circular pressure on outer edges of the jaw and in the joint foc using on tender areas. Breathe deeply and enjoy the massage. Before bed, a simple foot massage can aid in relaxation and sleep. Apply a small amount of oil and massage the sole of your foot with your palms and fingers. You can start at the heel and work toward s the base of your toes, massaging your to es and between your toes . Hold your foot in your palm and massage along the sides and arch of the foot. Repeat on the other foot. You may want to wear socks afterwards so as not to slip on the floor or get o il on your flooring. 12 Massage is helpful for: Improving the health of your skin by making it stronger and softer Reviving the skin tone and reduces the effects of dryness from aging Supporting restful sleep patterns Opening the energy channels Nurturin g positive emotions and feelings as you care for yourself Calming the nervous system and sense organs Reducing stiffness in the joints Benefitting sore and tense muscles Helping to ease pain Deep Breathing The mind and body work together. The way your mind controls thoughts and attitudes affects the way your body controls pain. Du20, the \" Hundred Meeting Point \", improves mental state, dizziness, headache, obstruction of the nose, agitation, and heart palpitations due to fright or anxiety. 13 Yintang, is the \" Hall of Impression \". Located at the midpoint of the eyebrows. It is used for acute and chronic fright, frontal headache, dizziness, insomnia, agitation, and restlessness. The Governing Vessel originates in the pelvis an d ascends up, emerging at Du20. It then enters the brain and connects with the Urinary Bladder Meridian along the sides of the spine . It spreads throughout the spine. The right side channe l is the left side of the brain which is the YANG. The left side channel is the right side of the brain and is YIN. 14 Controlled breathing can influence the flow of energy through these channels. Nasal breathing brings air into the sphenoid sinuses to cool the pituitary gland and help regulate the body temperature. The pituitary gland and t he hypothalamus - a part of the interbrain effect the autonomic nervous system, which manages the balance of energy, heat and water in the body. Body temperature, heartbeat or the amount of urine, are all regulated this way, and so are sleep, hunger and t hirst. The pituitary gland also produces a series of hormones tha t either control most of the other hormone glands in the body or have a direct effect on specific organs. 15 Together they regulate all processes having to do with primitive reactions, such as stress, rage, fighting body temperature, thirst, hunger, sexual activity, and survival in general. Between the two, they secrete 16 different hormones including human growt h hormone (reduces liver uptake of glucose, stimulates the immune function). The pineal gland is the major source of melatonin production in the body. It plays a role in circadian rhythm, inducing sleep and seasonal affective disorder. In animals, it play s a key role in hibernation. Nasal breathing has many functions. It promotes ability to smell, filters out dirt and pathogens, and moisturizes and warms incoming breathing stimulates the olfactory nerve; the pas sed to hypothalamus and pineal glands. Yintang and acupuncture points in this area are influential on these glands. When you are feeling sluggish and fatigued, focus on breathing through the right nostril , and when you are excited, agitated or anxious, f ocus on breathing through the left nostril. 16 Breathing Techniques Cooling Breath Practice: mouth breathing inhalation, nasal breathing exhalation. Tongue is connected with organs. Relaxation Breath: 1. Find a comfortable position to sit in and keep your spine (Du channel and urinary bladder channel) straight and open. Close your eyes. Spend a minute or two relaxing your mind. To relax the mind, listen to your natural breath, 'talk to yourself' (maybe say to yourself, \"relax, relax\"; \"inhale, on't need to think about that now\"; \"nothing matters right now, I'm letting that go\"; etc.) 2. You may connect your thumb and first finger (air & ether, lung & l arge intestine) to assist with dilating the bronchi, increases the vital capacity and improve conc entration. Also, touch the tip of the tongue to the roof of the mouth. 3. Using your nose to inhale and exhale, start with a deep breath in, filling up your lungs and your belly. Listen to the noise that the process makes. Exaggerate this noise in the back of your throat if you feel comfortable. Focus on filling up the belly wi th each inhale and focus on emptying the belly with each exhale. Envision the breath at times making cont act with the important glands behind your nose. 4. The lungs negative, or imbalanced emotion, is Grief. In the normal breathing process, air is not comple tely expelled and residual air remains. This is where grief, sorrow, frustration, anxiety and hurt reside. We carry these negative emotions with us in the deep structure of the lung. With de ep breathing, we can throw t hese out and feel more peaceful, a s in the axiom: 'A Sigh of Relief'. 5. You can practice this relaxation breath for a set of 10 or 20. 6. When finished, sit still with your eyes closed and 'feel' how your body feels. You may notice a tingling sensation, a sense of peace or happiness. Your mind may feel clear and happy, you may feel warm or have a sense of your blood pumping through the body in a pleasant way. 7. When you are ready, you may open your eyes and move about as needed. You might notice you see somewhat clearer or brighter. Take note of how you feel so you can remember this feeling when you feel stressed or anxious. 17 Alternate Nostril Breathing Again, prepare as above. 1. Use your right thumb to close the right nostril and your sma ll and ring finger of the same hand to alternatively close the left nostril. 2. Obstruct the left nostril and inhale through the right 3. Close the right nostril and exhale through the left 4. While continuing to obstruct the right nostril, inhale through the left 5. Close the left nostril and exhale through the right 6. Repeat for 5-10 rounds at first, take it slow, and then you can increase up to 20. Meditation Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche: \"We don't meditate to become better people or have special experiences. Meditation is simply the way we relate to our already existing enlighten ed state\". Evidence of meditation dates back approximately 5,000 -3,500 BCE. Description s of meditation techniques date back in Indian scriptures to 3,000 years ago. Many of the world's religions adopted basic concept s of meditation; methods vary from culture to culture. Many believe meditation is an essential cornerstone of spiritual development. Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Taoism, and Christianity, to name a few, all have their forms of meditation. Old Testament: \"Be still and know that I am God\"; Repetitive or counting rosary beads. ZaZen: \"seated meditation\", a meditative discipline practitioners perform to calm the body and the mind , and concentrate enough to experience insight into the nature of existence and the reby gain enlightenment. Suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas, images, attachments, labeling, and thoughts pass by without getting involved with them. Koan: is a story, dialogue, question, or statement which is used in Zen practice to provoke introspection, or doubt. 18 Insight Meditation: Buddhist tradition, mindfulness, Vipassana.

Food feeds our healthy and unhealthy tissue. o Cook more! Use spices! Less eating out and less processed foods. o Avoid poor quality fats, salts and sugars. Replace with healthy fats, healthy salts and sugars (rock salt, sea salt, grade B maple syrup, raw local honey, extra virgin olive oil, untoasted sesame oil). o Eat at the same times every day. Try to stick with proper meal ti mes. If we eat whenever we want, the body will just do whatever it wants. Breakfast, 0700 -0900 (moderate) Lunch, 1100 -1300 (stronger) Dinner, 1700 -1930 (light) Do not nap after lunch. You may rest on your left side to facilitate digestion for 15 minutes, especially if you are Water type. Fire and Air type could benefit from relaxing after lunch. Take a walk after dinner for 15 -20 minutes to facilitate digestion prior to bed. You may notice if you eat a heavy meal before bed, you will have a difficult time sleeping or vivid dreams. Avoid spicy foods for dinner if you have trouble sleeping. No heavy exercise in the evening. 21 When you eat at proper meal times regularly, the body will learn the pattern and digestion will become easier. If we graze all day long, there will be some food going through one process of digestion and other food going through another process. This is confusing to the digestive function and can weaken the spleen. Food should be fully and properly digested prior to giving the body more fo od. If you have a low appetite or feel that you cannot eat, that is okay. Listen to your body and try to wait until the next scheduled mealtime to eat. To stimulate the appetite, you can sip on some hot fennel and ginger tea 30 minutes before your meal. Be mindful of how much you eat. Don't overeat, and avoid eating two hours prior to bedtime. Proper elimination is important, especially for anxiety, low back pain and insomnia. Moving the bowels once per day is very beneficial. If you have constipation, ta lk with your doctor or mod ify your diet. Diet is the most common reason for constipation. Pain poor sleep mood changes poor choices in diet pain medications poor digestion mood changes poor sleep pain Anti-inflammatory diet Spices for cooking and teas to be used to flavor the food, all in moderation (if you are on any anti -coagulant, consult your doctor or prescription) Treat your body like a garden : Nurture, fertilize (healthy food), water, sunshine (vitamin D), till (oxygenation: exe rcise), w eed (sweat, deep breath, water, eliminate). Strengthen spleen Qi: Warm cooked neutral food. 22 Foods to Fight Pain Carotene The carotenoids are antioxidant nutrients found in many fruits and vegetables. The best known is beta carotene (found in foods like cantaloupe, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, carrots, kale, butternut squash, and spinach), but its sister carotenoid, beta -cryptoxanthin, may also reduce rheumatoid arthritis. Researcher s have found that people who eat diets high in beta -cryptoxanthin are half as likely to develop a form of inflammatory arth ritis as those who ate very few. I n fact, adding just one additional serving each day of a food high in beta - cryptoxanthin helped reduce the risk. Best foods for beta -cryptoxanthin: winter squash, pu mpkin, persimmons, papaya, tangerines, red peppers, corn, oranges and apricot. Ginger A helpful food for digestion and reducing inflammation in the body. Ginger cont ains beneficial phytonutrients g inger ols and paradols that seem to have anti -inflammatory effects, and therefore should be considered for arthritis treatment. Ginger contains chemicals that work similarly to som e anti -inflammatory medications. Get creative: grate fresh ginger into stir fries, steep dry ginger powder as a tea, or bake healthy ginger muffins. Green Tea Compared with regular black tea, green tea looks weak but contains a natural antioxidant called epigallocatechin -3-gallate (EGCG) not found in black tea. Studies suggest that EGCG works to stop the production of certain inflammatory chemicals in the body, including those inv olved in arthritis. Preliminary research suggests that EGCG and other catechins in tea may prevent cartilage from breaking down, possibly helping to preserve joi nts longer. 23 Olive Oil In addition to healthy monounsaturated fats, olive oil contains a natural compound called oleocanthal which may help prevent arthritis -related inflammation. This compound blocks the same inflammatory pathways as ibuprofen and aspirin , medications commonly used to fight arthritis pain. If you're also trying to lose weight to manage your arthritis, incorporate olive oil but be stingy with the amounts since all fat (including healthy fat like olive oil) is high in calories. For the highe st antioxidant content, choose \"extra virgin\" olive oil; and note that the stronger the taste, the higher the amounts of oleocanthal the oil is likely to have. Red Grapes Contains resveratrol (also found in Hu Zhang, Bushy knotweek, a Chinese herb for pain by blood invigoration) which can relax tight blood vessels and improve blood flow to damaged back tissue. Your back 's vertebrae and disc s depend on blood vessels to bring healing nutrients a nd oxygen to them. Try one cup daily. Salmon & Sardines, Omega -3 Fats The healthiest of fats for people with arthritis or other inflammatory disorders are omega -3 fats. While other foods increase levels of inflammation in the body, omega -3s actually work to decrease inflammation by suppressing the production of enzymes that erode cartilage. A host of studies have demonstrated that omega -3 fish oils can reduce symptoms of rheu matoid arthritis. Study participants reported greater strength, les s fatigue, reduced joint swelling and tenderness, less joint stiffness, and less overall pain . The best foods for omega -3 fatty acids are salmon (wild, fresh or canned), herring, mackerel ( not king), sardines, anchovies, rainbow trout, Pacifi c oysters, flaxseeds (ground and oil), chia seeds , and walnuts. 24 Soy Contains isoflavanoids, which assist with bone density and has anti -inflammatory properties. A study showed 40 grams of soy protein daily for 3 months, reduced pain and cut pain meds in half. Foods: tofu, soymil k, edamame and m iso. Be consistent for 2 -3 weeks . Tart Cherries/ Sour Cherries Fresh or frozen Morello, Amarelle, Montgomery, & Balaton varieties are best. Look for dark tart cherries over sweet cherries. Serving size is 1 cup. They are high in Vitamin C & betacarotene. Try 20 cherries daily to assist with pain. They supply melatonin and can assist with sleep. Contains anthocyamins, an a nti- inflammatory for muscle pains after exercise, gout, and prevent and treat pain. Other foods with anthocyamins: blackberries, black currants, blueberries, eggplant, elderberries, raspberries, boysenberries, red black grapes, strawberries, and plums. Tomato Juice (or sundried tomatoes) are very high in potassium. Leg cramps are often due to potassium deficiencies, which occur when minerals are flushed out by diuretics, caffeinated beverages or heavy perspiration during exercise. Sip 8 -10 ounces dai ly if you have painful leg cramps, and be sure to inform your doctor if you experience this symptom. Turmeric Pain, inflammation, immune system , eases pain from osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia . Contains curcumin: shuts down cyclooxygenase 2 (an enzyme that makes pain -producing hormones). Use \u00bc to 1 tsp daily onto a savory dish. Add to stir fry, soup or as tea . Bring four cups of water to a boil. Add one teaspoon of group 25 turmeric and reduce to a simmer for 10 minutes. Strain the tea through a fine sieve into a cup, add hone y and/or lemon to taste. Add a teaspoon of ginger (optional) and a pinch of black pepper. Vitamin C A nutrient responsible for the health of collagen, a major component of cartilage. Ex amples : guava, bell peppers (yellow, red, orange, and green), oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, pineapple, broccoli, kidney beans, kiwi, and cauliflower. (High -dose vitamin C supplements can actually be harmful for osteoarthritis sufferers, so talk to your doctor about what's right for you.) Water Eight , 8-ounce glasses of water daily. Drink water warm or at room temperature to preserve the digestive fire and dilate, versus constrict with ice. Flushes out histamine, a pain -triggering compound produced by damaged tissue. Water is the key buildi ng block of cartilage that cushions bones, soft discs and joints. When tissues are well hydrated they can move and glide over each other without causing pain. Whole Grains Fight inflammation that creates pain. High in magnesium that reduces muscle pain. 3-5 servings of whole grains (not refined grain) can lower C -reactive protein in rheumatoid arthritis. Whole grains can assist with weight loss. High Blood Pressure Formula: Pomegranate j uice one glass daily; pomegranate juice is sweet, sour and astring ent. Its actions are to clear heat and moisten dryness. It is also a rich source of potassium, which is known to lower the blood pressure via clearing heat. Kiwi fruits one serving daily; kiwi is sweet, sour and cool. Its 26 actions are to clear heat and engender fluids. It is also a rich source of potassium. Bananas one serving daily; bananas are sweet and cool. Its actions are to clear heat and moisten the intestines. It is also a rich source of potassium. Apples one serving daily; apples are sweet and cool. Its actions are to clear heat and engender fluids. Apples are also an excellent source of dietary fiber. Contain Malic Aids: digestion benefit, weight loss, detoxification. Celery two to four pieces da ily; celery is sweet, bitter and cool. Its actions are to level the liver, anchor the yang and clear heat. Beets two to four servings per week; beets are sweet and cool. Its actions are to clear liver heat, nourish and quicken the blood, and moisten the intestines. Worst Foods to Eat Fried Foods Caloric, high -fat foods like fried chicken, French fries, donuts, and deep -fried appetizers should be avoided by anyone who has arthritis. When eaten in excess, these foods can increase body fat, which puts extra stress on the joints and amplifies the risk of wear and tear. Body fat is not an inert substance; it is metabolically active, capable of producing hormones and chemicals that actually increase levels o f inflammation. To make matters worse, some resta urants fry their foods in hydrogenated oils, which means you may also be getting a dose of dangerous trans fats. Instead of frying, choose a healthier way to prepare your foods; grilling, steaming, roasting, and baking are all better. 27 Refined Carbohydrates Refined carbohydrates are found in anything baked with white flour, such as white bread, rolls, crackers, and most baked goods \u2014 as well as white rice and junky cereals. They're all made by milling whole grains and removing the bran and germ \u2014 the two parts of the grain that contain the most nutrients. Refined carbs produce a state of inflammation in the body, causing increases in cytokines and other pro - inflammatory compounds, which makes arthritis worse. Whole -grain options: whole -wheat brea d, whole -grain cereal, whole -whe at pasta, brown and wild rice, q uinoa, millet, barley. Saturated Fats This category includes fats primarily found in animal products, such as fatty beef, pork, and lamb, poultry skin, ice cream, butter, whole or 2 percent milk, regular cheese, bacon, bologna, salami, pepperoni, and beef sausage. Saturated fats are also found in palm oil and palm -kernel oil found in the ingredient list of any number of items on your shelves, including crackers, cookies, and nondairy creamers . Simple Sugars/ Sugary Candy Found in foods like cookies, fruit juic e, soft drinks, and candy \u2014 are also refined carbohydrates; they send your blood -sugar levels soaring and set off an inflammatory response in the body, making arthritis and its symptoms worse. If you crave sweets, eat fruit with nuts, use cinnamon dates, maple syrup, or honey. Trans Fats In an effort to give baked goods a longer shelf life, scientists took common vegetable oil and added hydrogen molecules in the right places. The resul t was that the liquid oil turned solid \u2014 and dangerous: Trans fats \u2014 found in some baked goods, fast - 28 food items, processed snack foods, and most stick m argarines \u2014 are thought to be at least as damaging (and maybe even worse) as saturated fats in terms of inflammation, heart disease, and other health problems. Choose only products that have 0 grams trans fats and do not contain any partially hydrogenated oils. 29 Session Five Sleep Develop a nighttime ritual for deep sleep. 1.
