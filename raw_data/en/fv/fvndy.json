I am not a fan of cleansing regimens that involve fasting, colonics, or laxatives. I find that a super-clean eating program can do wonders for your body, mind, and soul. I've created a three-day detox plan that is free of caffeine, alcohol, refined carbohydrates, sugar, and sugar substitutes. Try this nutritional detoxification program and in just a few short days, you can look and feel years younger by eliminating a few dietary toxins and focusing on whole, natural foods. I suggest you follow this body detox plan for a minimum of three days, but ideally try for it five. Most likely, you'll feel the positive effects immediately and your body will be smiling from the inside out. If you find that removing junk food from your diet causes feelings of withdrawal (many of my clients have found sugar to be worse than caffeine), try my tips to help you manage these symptoms. 3-day spring cleaning menu and detox plan and recipes The three days of menus are approximately 1,500 calories per day. If you require more or fewer calories, you can simply alter the portion sizes, but do not skip any of the meals or snacks. You'll need to eat frequently to keep your stamina going. Also, it's important to follow these guidelines during your 3 day diet cleanse: - Keep an eye on absolutely everything that goes into your mouth. YES, I even want you to avoid chewing gum and breath mints. - Drinking water is a true necessity, especially when you are cleansing. Almost all of your liquids should be pure, unadulterated water. We usually recommend about 64 ounces per day. - Decaf green tea and hot water with lemon may be added for those people missing their warm morning mug. - If all of these guidelines seem too daunting to take on at once, feel free to mix and match. In other words, you could follow the menus but allow yourself one small cup of coffee. Make it work for you, but remember that the more you adhere to the plan, the bigger difference you'll feel and the more effective your whole body cleanse Day 1 Diet Cleanse: Breakfast: 1 cup of steel-cut or Irish oats (measured after cooking), topped with 2 tablespoons chopped walnuts and 1 cup of fresh or frozen berries.
