This Article spotlights the many structural barriers that Afro - Colombian women face in realizing their right to health and health care in Colombia. The Article draws heavily from conversations and interviews with Afro -descendant Colombian members of Proceso de Comuni dades Negras ( \"PCN \") 5 and community leaders and activists from the rural Pacific Afro -Colombian river communities of San Juan and Naya River. The contributions of the PCN members were solicited at a meeting with the CUNY School of Law Human Rights and Gender Justice Clinic ( \"HRGJC \") 6 and representatives from 1.

The Witness for Peace delegation of citizens of the United States, led by CUNY law student Maricelly Malave, visited two of the sixteen prioritized regions to help implement the Final Agreement of the Peace Accords for the termination of the conflict and the construction of a stable and lasting peace in Colombia. The main purpose of the delegation was to gather testimonies of community leaders of the Conpaz Network about the human rights situation in the community since the signing of the Peace Accords. 9. In addition to facing disproportionately severe barriers to health care, Afro-Colombian and I ndigenous women have also been disproportionately subject to displacement and struggle over land rights, violence (including sexual violence) , human rights violations, and overall have generally had the least access to justice, among other things.

And, since sexual violence is not considered to be a medical emergency by authorities, medical needs of victims are not prioritized. In 2016, the Colombian g overnment signed a peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\"FARC \"), 13 which included groundbreaking racial and gender justice provisions.14 Since that time there has been significant disarmament of the FARC.15 However, by all accounts, the government has failed to fully implement the accord, 16 and the sections focused on gender have been the least implemented17\u2014armed actors continue to commit violence (explaining the unique struggles face d by Afro -Colombian and Indigenous women regarding access to justice in relation to sexual and gender- based violence). 10.

Afro -Colombian and Indigenous women and girls in particular are doubly vulnerable, and they \"continue to live disproportionately in conflict -ridden areas and to be at high risk for displacement and other violence, inc luding sexual and gender -based violence. \"18 Despite Colombia's fairly progressive health laws,19 health care is nearly impossible to access for many victims of sexual violence. The lack of data disaggregated by race or ethnicity makes it difficult to deter mine precisely the impact of gender -based violence on Afro-descendant communities . However, it seems clear from the interviews and discussions conducted for this Article that the combined forces of poverty, discrimination against Afro -Colombian people, and dismissive cultural attitudes toward violence against women effectively prevent Afro -Colombian victims of gender -based violence from accessing adequate health care. This is not a surprise, considering the legacy of slavery and discrimination against Afro - descendant and indigenous people, as well as gender discrimination and cultural stigma surrounding sexual violence. Of those that do seek help, many victims are unable to get the medical attention they need, either because there are no accessible health ca re clinics, or because any available clinic lacks the necessary supplies or resources to handle medical issues associated with sexual violence. 20 Part I of this Article gives a brief overview of the history of race discrimination and violence against women in Colombia and of the specific situation of Afro -Colombian women. This Part describes the hyper -sexualization of Afro -Colombian women and how stereotypes surrounding their sexuality contribute to violence against them.

Based in part on conversations and interviews with Afro -descendant Colombian members at the PCN Meetings and at the Witness for Peace Interviews , Section III.A studies the o n-the- ground reality, demonstrating that in rural areas, where most communities are majority Afro -Colombian, 22 clinics have been shut down at alarming rates23 or have such infrequent hours of operation as to make them virtually useless to some women.24 Ind eed, Indigenous and Afro - 21.

Now since it has been closed it blocks women's ability to do any family planning. Now all women have to go to Cali for reproductive serv ices. It's devastating. Women have had to go to private doctors here. So now poor women literally have no access for reproductive health services. Id. 24.

Appropriate facilities, trained providers, and necessary supplies such as rape kits are often unavailable in existing rural clinics, and psychosocial services are effectively non -existent. 26 Section III.C specifically addresses the many barriers to abortion for survivors of sexual violence. Finally, in the Conclusion, the Article proposes some basic responses to the deficits highlighted in Part III. To bring the provision of health services in line with the law 's mandate, policy makers must consider how the intersection of race, class, and gender uniquely affects Afro -Colombian victims of sexual violence. To obtain health equity, policy makers must address structural and institutional issues that cause the disparities. Specifically, law, policies, and systems must be leveraged to address social determinants of health f or those marginalized by virtue of race, gender, poverty, or any combination of these characteristics . This Article seeks to highlight and examine the issues related to access to health care for Afro -Colombian survivors of sexual violence and to start a conversation that will hopefully lead to viable solutions to improve the reality on the ground for these survivors. I. ROOTS AND REALITY OF VIOLENCE AGAINST AFRO-COLOMBIAN WOMEN Sexual violence against Afro -Colombian women stems from historical antecedents o f race - and gender -based discrimination as well as stereotypes that are still to -date engrained in the sociocultural fabric of the country. While discrimination is one part of the problem, growing conflict and violence in regions with high concentrations o f Afro-Colombian populations, as well as barriers to reporting sexual violence and accessing medical help, further has simply been nonexistent for a long time, and/or services have been overwhelmed by displaced individuals); see infra notes 136, 138, 146- 149 and accompanying text (interviews describing how the difficulty in accessing modern health care has forced many women to rely on \"traditional doctors\" or brave dangerous journeys through paramilitary -controlled areas). 25.

The history of Black/African slavery in Colombia, no t surprisingly, continues to have reverberations on race politics in Colombia today.27 Although much positive change has occurred since total emancipation in 1852, the foundational belief of Colombian identity that Colombia is a \"post -racial \" society fuels the denial of racial discrimination and reproduces , on a daily basis , the invisibility and marginalization of Afro -Colombians.28 In reality, however, there is little political will to address racial discrimination, and the Colombian governme nt has typically only acted when pressured to do so by civil society and international human rights bodies . 29 Interviews with Afro -Colombian women in rural river communities reveal that race-based discrimination is pervasive and part of everyday life: Peop le see my black skin an assume I am not an important person and am not educated. That I have no intellectual capacity. When people actually see me talk about my experience you can see their shock. The government treats Afro -Colombian communities badly. The y discriminate us and keep us in misery. They want to be above us.

Colombian society, like many societies on the planet and especially in Latin America with its complicated and violent colonial past, is plagued with a unique combination of racism and sexism that functions to create a hypersexualization of Black women. This hypersexualization can contribute to and even be used to justify violence against Black women. 48 According to a study of sexual violence against women in the co ntext of armed conflict from 2010 to 2015, \"Afro -descendent women from the ages of 15 -24 residing in housing classified as the lowest income bracket are more exposed to being victims of sexual violence than women from other ethnic origins, age ranges and h ousing brackets. \" 49 42.

One health provider told researchers just last year that women who experience sexual violence may be at fault because of the way they dress: It depends on how the woman is dressed. So if the woman is dressed in a certain way, th en they start yelling things at her or abusing them, because she was dressed that way and she was teasing men to do it. 55 During the Witness for Peace Interviews, community members discussed having experienced that blame firsthand: Reporting [r]ape is ofte n a problem because the government[] staff that takes the testimony of the abused women will ask why they didn't fight the person off and [government staff] will blame them.

They are supposedly the ones who seduce people, and the ones to blame.56 In addition to being a factor in the violence against Afro - Colombian women, cultural attitudes about Indigenous and Afro - Colombian women and their proper role in society also subject women to discrimination in the medical care they receive after incidents of sexual violence. 57 One interviewee recounted: Once when I went to a medical clinic in Cali, Colombia and I noticed they took only the white people, many who arrived after me. When I asked about when we were going to be seen he told me that I had to wait in the line for black people.

Because of historical discrimination against the Afro - Colombian people, and Afro -Colombian women in particular, and because of the enduring poverty plaguing these communities, race- and gender -based sexual violence is most prevalent in predominantly Afro-Colombian FARC -controlled regions. The conseq uences of the violence are only exacerbated by the lack of accessible health care in those same regions. II. LIMITS TO COLOMBIA 'S PROGRESSIVE HEALTH CARE LAW Colombia 's health care law seems expansive and progressive on paper, but it fails to protect all Colombians ' right to health equally. In particular, the law fails to guarantee effective legal protections for survivors of rape and sexual violence. In 1993, Colombia undertook a massive overhaul of its health care system when it enacted Law 100. 75 Colombia 's health care reform was motivated by inefficiency in government -sponsored entities tasked with providing health care services, a mounting budget deficit, and sparse coverage \u2014only 21% of the population had health care prior to the enactment of Law 100.76 The overhaul was intended to change the structure of the entire health care system. 77 The reform of the Colombian health care system had three main goals: (1) the achievement of an antitrust policy, to avoid the state health monopoly; (2) the incorporation of private health providers into the health care market; and (3) the creation of a subsidized health care sector covering the poorest of the population. 78 While the reforms succeeded in increasing insurance coverage, they failed to guarantee the same services to individuals on the private contributory and public subsidized regimes, and decentralization and lack of effective government regulation led to unexpected inefficiencies in the provision of services and collection of countryrep/ColombiaMujeres06eng/Informe%20Colombia%20Mujeres%20Ing.pdf [https://perma.cc/F97R-92PH] ). 75.

A. Separa te but (Un)Equal: Racialized and Class -Based Health Gaps Between the Public Subsidized Plan and the Private Contributory Plan As a part of the overhaul of the health care system in 1993, Law 100 created two parallel health care systems: the private contributory system and the public subsidized plan.89 The contributory plan is available only to workers and families making above minimum wage, and is financed using a mandatory payroll tax\u2014 formal employment is required for coverage through the contributory plan. 90 On the other hand, the subsidized plan is available only to those who submit to means testing by local government. 91 Colombians covered by the subsidized plan have been entitled to the same health services as those covered by the contributory plan only since 2012, when the Colombian Regulatory Body in Health unified the benefits of each plan. 92 87.

First, while the subsidized plan guarantees access to health care, many of the poorest Colombians, who are often indigenous people living in rural departments, do not have any insurance.93 A 2011 study of the uninsured in La Guajira, a rural department, attempted to collect information about the benefits desired and barriers to care faced by these residen ts. 94 Nearly half of those surveyed were indigenous, whose communities tended to be isolated, as are many in rural departments. 95 Uninsured respondents overwhelmingly (88%) reported that a lack of assistance in applying for insurance was their primary reas on for being uninsured, with premiums and co -payments being another concern. 96 Notably, despite the remote nature of the department, few individuals surveyed cited travel time as a barrier to care. 97 While those surveyed generally saw obtaining subsidized care as a better option than being uninsured, a majority still felt that subsidized coverage required longer wait times, and half of female respondents felt it provided lower choices in providers than remaining uninsured. 98 Female respondents in particular expressed a desire for better family care and more doctor choice for patients, and they were attuned to the absence of specialized care under the subsidized plan. 99 Even in rural departments that have equal or higher level s of insurance coverage compared with other localities, there is a significant difference in the availability of treatment and patients ' health outcomes with the subsidized plan, as compared to the 93. Participants need to apply for the subsidized plan's insurance in order to be able to utilize the services. See, e. g., Iamprea & Garc\u00eda, supra note 80, at 59. 94.

Second, it indicates that there seems to be little correlation between tutela claims and availability of treatment, as residents of poorer reg ions have sought a vindication of their right to health care (and therefore an increase in availability of treatment) with limited measurable success. 104 Even in large urban centers, Colombians on the subsidized plan encounter lower survival rates and longe r time-to- treatment from diagnosis than those on the contributory plan. 105 In a study of women receiving surgery for breast cancer at Las Am\u00e9ricas Oncology Institute in Medell\u00edn, for example, 23% of those with subsidized coverage died during the course of the study, compared to 10.3% of those with contributory coverage. 106 The City of Manizales maintains a cancer registry that shows a significant difference in survival between patients with subsidized coverage and patients with contributory coverage. 107 Accord ing to the registry, those with subsidized coverage are less likely to survive breast, lung, prostate, and stomach cancer than those with 100.

B. Limitations of Colombia 's Rape Law While the structure of the health care system in Colombia is one factor that contributes to poor treatment and access to health care for Afro -Colombians, the existing rape laws in the country further worsen the outcomes for survivors of sexual violence. In 2012, the health minister created a protocol , binding on health care providers , that sought to guarantee that health care providers offer victims of sexual violence appropriate post -rape care.110 Through fifteen steps, this law gave health sect or personnel the necessary guidelines to follow in order to maintain the minimum conditions necessary to provide comprehensive care.111 Further, the law provides procedures for voluntary interruption of pregnancy and guarantees access to specialized health care services, including mental health services.112 In the years following the 2012 protocol, implementation of basic reproductive and maternal health care services provided to victims was spotty. So, in 2014, the Colombian Congress passed Law 1719, intending to improve implementation of the 2012 protocol and further protect victims of sexual violence.113 Law 1719 recognizes that \"sexual violence can constitute a crime against humanity and enhances the status of sexual violence survivors so that they can receive reparations, psychosocial support, and free medical care.\"114 108.

The law stated that health care entities had the \"facultad\" (roughly, power/ability or faculty) to complete the protocol, which was interpreted as giving health providers an ability but not an obligation to provide this care. This indication prompted women 's organizations to file a case in the Constitutional Court.117 The Constitutional Court found the \"optional \" interpretation inconsistent with the constitutional right to health and gender equality, and replaced the word \"facultad\" with \"obligaci\u00f3n. \"118 Despite the Constitutional Court ruling that Law 1719 requires health professionals to provide comprehensive medical and psychosocial care with dignity to victims of sexual violence,119 completing the protocol is still treated as optional in many parts,120 probably due to the lack of ramifications for those who violate it. 115.

A 2009 report by Doctors Without Borders highlights the obstacles to filing a report due to possible retribution.122 Many women fear their aggressors will threaten them or their families:123 It is well known that there are criminal actors involved with the police and penal system who communicate with paramilitari es anytime witnesses come forward about a rape or murder they were involved in. We have seen that if someone denounces the rape or murder the police still release the suspected person then the witness is usually killed shortly afterward . 124 Further, women are often judged for being raped and are often re- victimized by degrading comments, denial of humane services ( such as in cases where young women getting abortions are denied anesthesia) or denial of services outright.125 Although the Colombian government ha s an obligation to enforce penalties for perpetrators of sexual violence, women often feel shame or are afraid 121.

In this region, there is only one Class 1 hospital, which is a hospital with resources for basic check -ups and wellness, located in Puerto Merizalde, an Afro- Colombian community located in the low zone.135 This so -called \"hospital\" has no electricity or potable water, is reluctant to prescribe medication due to scar ce supplies , and is rarely staffed.136 At the same time, there are no pharmacies or any places to get modern medicines of any kind.137 The doctor s practicing at this clinic are interning in rural medicine and are not usually knowledgeable about the unique diseases endemic to such a rural territory. 138 The cases that are seen in Merizalde usually involve pregnant women and people wounded from daily tasks in the river community, such as mining, cutting wood, and other labor. 139 Naya is also a malaria endemic zone and in general mosquito bites cause many d ifferent diseases in the community. 140 Occasionally, people from this region with cases like these die due to the lack of doctors and adequate hospitals. 141 Nora Isabel Castro Panameno (\" Chava \"), a leader of the Humanitarian Space in Payita Buenaventura, reports the following about the conditions at Merizalde: The Puerto Merizalde hospital (PM Hospital) for many years was criticized for being so bad.

Literally, it takes about 8 days to contact them on the phone because they never answer . The only way to have a chance is to go in person. To get an appointment in person you have to go the night before to make sure you get to speak to someone. You need to go around 12am and stay the whole night in line and hope you get in. I did it once and slept on the ground there hoping to be seen when the window opened at 8am. They told me that they were only seeing 20 or 30 people that day and that I had to go back again another day and try to make it earlier. It is a miserable situation. They simply turn people away and you have to go all the way back home. It is so dangerous to stay there sleeping all night . . . It's almost impossible to be seen there. 152 Even if a patient can manage to get in to see a doctor, the hospital often is not equipped to handle the case: Once was the case of my sister, who was bitten by a snake when she was two months old. We had to take her to Buenaventura. From Buenaventura she was taken to Cali (another 3 hours away) because the Buenaventura hospital did not have what she needed. She was in Cali hospital for 6 months. Another case from my family is the case of my brother who I have had to get out of the river during an emergency.

There is always some kind of problem. Basically in the city people have to rely on private clinics but they are very expensive. 153 The reality for most inhabitants of this region is that if they need health care, they will have to figure out how to make what is typically a day- long journey to find a functioning hospital: When people get sick in the river. First people could try to get from their town to Puerto Merizalde and see if Hospital San Augustin hospital can help them. From this area to PM it can take about 4 -5 hours. The service there in Puerto Meriz alde is a little better but still very limited. It is a little better in PM because they have medicines in PM that other river clinics cannot because we don't have any access to refrigerators because there is not power here. In PM there is a generator so they keep vaccines and anything that needs to be refrigerated there. But still many people end up needing to go all the way to Buenaventura. 154 Another major problem in the Naya River Basin is internal displacement of river communities living on the frontline with paramilitary violence.155 According to reports, Afro -Colombian and Indigenous people make up a majority of displaced people,156 and the main victims of forced displacement are children and women, w idows, and female heads of household.157 Once Nayero community people are displaced, the closest shelter to the river opening is Puente Nayero, a Humanitarian Space in Buenaventura where many internally displaced people temporarily settle.

We were internally displaced from our town due to paramilitary violence against our town and the town next to ours. There was a massacre in the town next to ours where 5 people were slaughtered. Paramilitaries threatened to do the same to our town so we left. The government put us in a coliseum in Buenaventura where we were staying for about a year. She got thrombosis and went into a coma for several days and then she died. So many people got sick while we were in that displacement camp. So many women got urinary tract infections. People would have horrible outbreaks on their skin. It was miserable. 161 Because of inadequate infrastructure, governmental assistance services entitled to survivors are often late to arrive or never arrive, and families who remain in the area waiting for assistance run the risk of continuous threat f rom the same armed actors that displaced the community on the river. Furthermore, since there is no electricity service to the area and no potable water, the sanitation problems in the territory are exacerbated and certain medical resources become impossib le to provide. 162 As a result, because hospitals are inaccessible and, in the instance that survivors can endure the journey to these hospitals, hospital resources are generally inadequate, Afro -Colombian survivors of sexual violence \u2014including internally d isplaced populations due to escalating conflict in the region\u2014rarely if ever receive adequate care.

Health c are and services provided in the clinics in the poorest departments are generally of lower quality than elsewhere, and facilities are often not properly equipped and are generally inferior. 163 Rural residents have fewer medical appointments and fewer proced ures than urban residents, and the care that is available is of lower quality. 164 For example, none of Colombia 's poorest departments (Choc\u00f3 , La Guajira, Amazonas, Vichada, Vaupes, and Guainia) have chemotherapy chairs available, and only one has a pediatric ICU. 165 This may contribute to the elevated maternal and infant mortality rates in poor, rural regions: children under five are 2.3 times more likely, on average, to die in poor departments than children in rich departments, and women are consider ably more likely to die due to pregnancy- related causes in poor, rural departments. 166 Decentralization has meant that health care responsibilities that were previously the exclusive domain of the government are now being shared with private entities .167 This has allowed national entities to avoid responsibility for these deficiencies by shifting blame to other actors. Such deficiencies are even more pronounced when it comes to health care for victims of sexual violence. Through the Ministry of Health 's resol ution 459, which does not specifically address the needs of victims of conflict- related violence, and Law 1719, which focuses on the needs of that population, victims of sexual violence are supposed to receive comprehensive health care from Colombian provi ders.168 Comprehensive care should include appropriate care for physical injuries, which might involve \"injuries to their breasts, or rectal injuries, burns, gunshot wounds, or lacerations, \" or other scarring or injuries that can result from female genital cutting or strangulation. 169 Appropriate care should also include pregnancy testing, STI testing and treatment, counseling and social support 163.

Afro-Colombian and Indigenous women face many obstacles in getting services due to this population 's location in conflict -ridden rural areas.173 Appropriate facilities, trained providers, and necessary supplies are almost always unavailable in rural areas, which is especially critical when timely treatment is required, and, for the most part, the type of comprehensive care necessary and mandated by law to treat rape victims is near impossible to obtain for rural survivors of sexual violence. 174 In addition, though the law permits abortion under certain circumstances, it is unavailable in most cases, especially for the poorest segments of society.175 Overall, access to health care for rape survivors in majority Afro -Colombian regions is scarce.176 Perhaps the biggest deficiency in post -rape medical care is in mental health services. Sexual violence can be especially devastating to survivors when emotional or social support is non -existent or when they do not receive appropriate care to recover from mental damage. 177 Apart from the immediate physical and mental stress, women are at increased risk of developing long -term health problems such as \"chronic pain, physical disability, misuse of drugs and alcohol 170.

As mothers and Afro -Colombian women, we suffered a lot because we knew our children were witnessing something so horrible that we couldn't protect them from. Our children saw how people were killed, chopped up into pieces, and how they screamed as they were dying.

In the rural communities of Valle del Cauca, traditional medicine and medicine made locally in the communities has a strong presence. Unfortunately, traditional medicine is not recognized in the medical centers or contemporary hospitals. 198 For the Afro -Colombian population, ancestral, plant -based medicine is culturally important to natural healing processes,199 but homeop athic traditional medicine is not covered under state health plans and generally not practiced by health care providers, who overwhelmingly are not Afro-descendant.200 To help lessen the impact of diseases and because of the lack of access to health clinics, Afro -Colombian people rely heavily on ancestral practices and traditional medicine. People turn to \"comadronas \" and \"yerbateros, \" as the traditional doctors are called, who make all their remedies using ancestral teachings. This is how the majority of al l diseases are treated in the area. Traditional medicine specialists handle everything from childbirth to simple headaches, as well as treatment for people with fever or exhaustion. Such traditional medicine is entirely lacking at state hospitals and clinics for survivors ' emotional and physical healing. In addition to the particular services that are lacking, Afro - Colombian advocates for survivors of gender -based sexual violence criticized the lack of confidentiality a woman has when she reports an incident to the authorities, which contributes to the very low reporting statistics.201 When Afro -Colombian women do choose to report a crime it is likely that their names and other personal information will be exposed to the public.202 Doctors Without Borders has reported that: [P]olice and prosecutors have initiated investigations without redacting names or other personal information from claims, revealing claimants' identities to the general public.

These barriers are much the same as the barriers to receiving post -rape care, seen in the form of legal provisions and administrative roadblocks exercised by medical professi onals, patients' lack of knowledge concerning the law, cultural stigma, 213 and patients ' lack of financial resources.214 Afro-Colombian women, Indigenous women, and women from low -educated and low -income sectors of the population, as well as women in situati ons of forced displacement, are affected the most by such barriers, and are more exposed to illegal and unsafe abortions because of difficulties in accessing reproductive health services.215 208.

If a woman is unaware of her legal rights, an advocate is crucial to her navigation of the complex system. Legal support and counseling are needed sometimes just to determine whether a woman 's situation falls within the three legal indications, and psychological evaluation is required if a woman i s seeking abortion based on her psychological health.

As often perceived with respect to receiving post-rape medical treatment, but true as it pertains to receiving an abortion, when a pregnancy results from an incident of rape or incest abortion is only available after the incident has been duly reported to the authorities.243 However, as discussed above, a majority of victims either wait to report sexual violence or do not report it at all .244 A study published in Reproductive Health highlighted that on average, women waited seventy -two d ays to report a rape.245 Given that the average number of days between a woman reporting a rape and receiving an abortion is seventy -nine, the average woman who delays reporting her rape would be twenty- one weeks pregnant by the time she could receive an abortion , which is not enough time to obtain an abortion at a primary care facility given the fifteen week time limit . 246 For many women, these delays eliminate altogether the option of terminating the pregnancy. Even if a victim herself does not delay in reporting, administrative roadblocks can have the effect of causing delays that render abortion effectively unavailable. Women sometimes face delays because clinic personnel erroneously tell them they must obtain j udicial authorization in the form of signatures or stamps for an abortion to be completed, 247 even though the only authorization the law actually requires is a doctor 's certification that continuing a pregnancy would harm a woman 's physical or mental health or that the fetus is not viable.248 In the case of rape or incest, the facility is not permitted to ask the woman about the validity of her 242.

Cultural Obstacles to Abortion Afro-Colombian and Indigenous women typically face obstacles in obtaining abortions before the gestational limit at a higher rate than other women. 252 Specifically , cultural obstacles play an important role in creating these disparities. Accessing abortions before the gestational limit is harder for Indigenous women who do not speak Spanish and may not have access to a translator. 253 Further, many Afro -Colombian wome n feel that being the victim of a forced sexual interaction is taboo \u2014Afro-Colombian and Indigenous women often fear being blamed by members of the public sector who are supposed to help them. 254 Often this stems from a lack of connection with the state afte r almost five decades of living in areas ruled by guerilla or paramilitary groups.255 All of these factors make it harder for women to report the crimes, which is a requirement for abortion access. 256 Even where abortion services are offered, and where victims can get past administrative hurdles, many \"women who dare to demand the terminati on of pregnancy usually face resistance and are offered psychological or psychiatric services to talk them out of their decision. \"257 The Colombian government allows doctors to deny abortion services even to women who meet the criteria set out by the 249.

Financial Barriers to Abortion Finally, the cost of abortion d rugs and lack of funding for private organizations make abortion services inaccessible for many poor women. The majority of abortions in Colombia are performed by private non -profit organizations. 266 However, if these sites do not have enough funding, they cannot provide free or low -cost services.

Ordering the drug over the phone or online requires an international cell -phone plan, an internet connection, or, at the very least, an address where it can be shipped.

CONCLUSION There is a health crisis in Colombia, but this crisis primarily affects the poor. The disparities have the greatest effect on w omen living in rural and remote areas, Indigenous and Afro -Colombian women, and women who have been victims of conflict -related violence . Under the government 's subsidized health insurance scheme, technically no one gets turned away, but the quality of public health care is radically inferior to the private facilities. For people living in rural areas, there are very few health care options. For survivors of sexual violence in rural river communities, there is basically no post -rape care. For a certain segm ent of the population, violence is rampant, and health care is near non- existent. donations were to cease, the problems described above would likely resurface to the same extent. 720 COLUMBIA HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REVIEW [51.2 Laws protecting victims of violence and guaranteeing minimal health care are in place in Colombia and have been clarified and confirmed by the Constitutional Court. At this point, it is clear that the social determinants of health, such as poverty, infrastructure, race, and stigma, are the real obstacles in the path of Afro-Colombian victims in need of health care. Poor or nonexistent implementat ion of treatment protocols prevents victims of sexual violence from receiving the health care rights promised to them by law. In order to guarantee that even the poorest and most vulnerable segments of society have access to adequate health care, policy makers must address the structural and institutional issues surrounding race, gender, and poverty that are at the root of the problem. Furthermore, comprehensive care for a victim of sexual violence must include not just appropriate care for physical injurie s, but also pregnancy testing, STI testing and treatment, counseling and social support services, and secure facilities that allow for privacy and an assurance of confidentiality. In addition, traditional medicine should be incorporated into emotional and physical healing, and victims must have access to abortion, as well as the availability of and counseling regarding other alternative courses of action. Finally, full treatment also requires the availability of aesthetic reconstruction for burns, laceratio ns, genital mutilation, and other scarring that frequently results from sexual violence. 2020 ] Making Rights a Reality 721 Because many of the principal stipulations of the 2016 peace deal with FARC274 have not materialized in any definitive way, there has been little progress in shifting s ocial attitudes around the normalization of sexual violence. Thus, the culture of sexual violence that existed during those most intense moments of armed conflict largely remain to this day. 275 Much of this violence, sexual and otherwise, is suffered dispro portionately by Afro -Colombian women.276 Overall, these problems are difficult to address in a male - dominated political system and society.277 Since 2008 there has been wholesale legal transformation, but it could take generations for accompanying social transformation. The law cannot be relied upon as the sole method of altering behavior. If a law is regularly not enforced, the prohibited conduct is legitimized. Without the cultural influence, the immoral and illegal behavior will not be controlled. Even the best -intentioned law will not have the anticipated effect on the lives of real people if those called upon to evaluate the underlying incidents are laden with biases about the crime and its victims. The law must be viewed as having external legitimacy \u2014it must be seen as reflecting a majority cultural perspective. The ultimate success and utility of the law will therefore depend on the erosion of deep -rooted gender inequality and racism in the legal system, as well as in the broader s ociety. Health equity issues implicate not only public health laws, but also civil rights, human rights, and poverty. In Colombian tradition and culture, racism and violence against women are endemic. Sexual abuse is so common that it is discussed in a casual 274.
