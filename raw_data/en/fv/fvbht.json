Clinical competence in a variety of clinical settings: a. All students should be familiar with those specific clinical objectives for the basic diseases seen in the practice of rheumatology. b. Demonstrate familiarity and basic knowledge as a consultant. c. Possess communication skills that will allow the student to interact with peers and professionals. d. Qualities of professionalism and humanistic skills will be demonstrated as is appropriate for patient care. 2. Lifelong learning: a. Students will demonstrate proficiency at attending and participating in conferences. b. Students will demonstrate that they are reading the medical literature as pertains to their patients. This will include participating in discussions about patient care; participating in the rheumatology journal club; & providing pertinent review articles regarding patients on the consult service. |Objectives| |How to appropriately order IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS | 1. Understand the appropriate use of immunologic tests 2. understand the clinical utility of specific immunologic tests |Description of course activities| |In order to achieve the goals and objectives for the rotation a number of experiences are available to the students. These include: A) The inpatient rheumatology consultation experience where the student will see patients on the inpatient consultation service. This will be supervised by both the rheumatology fellow and attending physician. They will also be responsible for follow up of these patients during their hospitalization. Essential in this role of consultant is the development and refinement of clinical evaluation skills of patients with rheumatic diseases. These skills include the development of appropriate differential diagnosis, assessing the need for hospitalization, diagnostic evaluation strategies and treatment plans. Essential in this rotation will be developing skills in providing consultation services, to include communicating with the referring physicians and ensuring support for continuing care of the patients' rheumatic condition. A student will be called upon to perform literature research on topics appropriate to the case at hand. Through this experience the student will also develop a comprehensive understanding of the indications, contraindications, techniques, complications of arthrocentesis as well as the interpretation of results from this procedure. Faculty supervision is required in developing these skills. B) The ambulatory rheumatology experience where all students will be required to attend the general rheumatology clinics in the Primary Care Pavilion (PCP), the Victory Lakes Town Center (VLTC) clinics, and in the TDCJ. Dedicated attending faculty members will appropriately supervise this experience. The goal of this experience will be for the student to gain expertise in the outpatient evaluation and management of rheumatic problems. The experience provides an opportunity to develop an understanding for the natural history of these conditions. A student may also have the opportunity to observe a faculty member in clinic to obtain additional experience. C) Didactic Conferences which are held on a regularly scheduled basis with attendance required of all students. These conferences will include the weekly teaching conferecnes, journal club sessions, radiology conference & clinical rheumatology conference. In the journal club, the student may be required to present recent articles on rheumatology for discussion and critical review. In the radiology conference, all x-rays obtained in the previous week will be reviewed with a faculty radiologist. In the clinical rheumatology conference, the faculty or rheumatology fellow will discuss a specific rheumatologic disease topic. The faculty on the consultation service will also hold non-scheduled didactic teaching sessions to cover additional topics that arise from the patients on the service. D) Rheumatology Core Curriculum & Recommended Reading is in addition to participating in the organized didactic conferences established. This is a series of self-study clinical cases developed by the American College of Rheumatology to illustrate diseases and clinical problems in rheumatology. Each case has a clinical presentation; questions regarding the case and detailed discussion of the case and answers for each problem. The ACR Core Curriculum is available for viewing by slideshow in the Rheumatology Division area, with access to the ACR website, www.rheumatology.org. It is encouraged that all students complete as many cases as possible during the rotation. All students are also asked to read the chapters on Rheumatology topics in their Internal Medicine textbook of choice during the rotation. | 1.

The primary care specialties all deal with a large number of patients with chronic and acute musculoskeletal. In addition, because of the relationships with other organ systems, the rotation will also prove of value to people interested in subspecialties such as Ophthalmology, Dermatology, Neurology - 12 VLTC Clinic||1 5 12:00 Grand Rounds - Consult r| |Wednesday||8 - 12 TDC clinic - Noon teaching conference||1 - 5 Consult Rounds| |Thursday||8 - 12 PCP Rheumatology Clinic - Medical Grand 5 Consult - 12 normal do not participate in research in one month elective - However, this is available to interested candidates including lab experience| |1.

Each AI should describe how the four key Year-4 EPAs that our school has identified as being Year-4 skills are assessed. The Year-4 objectives are: | 1. Entering and discussing orders/prescriptions.Specify how the student will be given formative feedback on their clinical skills. | | B. | | Year-4 students should demonstrate mastery of EPAs they developed in the clerkship year, including recommending and interpreting common diagnostic and screening tests, and performing general procedures of a physician. They should be able to demonstrate masterfully and independently skills they mastered in Years 2-3, including efficiently performing comprehensive admission-notes and succinct daily progress notes and perform accurate, concise, and hypothesis-driven clinical presentations, form clinical questions and retrieve evidence to advance patient care. They should be able to demonstrate basic understanding of and beginning mastery of collaborate as a member of the interprofessional team and identify system failures and contribute to a culture of safety improvement. List advanced clinical skills that a student will be assured an opportunity to practice. | | C. | | How specifically will this AI build on developing skills from the clerkship year to prepare students for internship? | | D. | | What opportunities will typically be available to all students who take this AI (procedures, required presentations, etc.)? What opportunities may be available based on patient load/presentation or student initiative (ie. Writing a case report)? | | E. | | An AI should have expectation of a minimum of 32 hours per week of clinical responsibilities. Duty hours should be capped at ACGME limits for an intern, thus up to 24 hours followed by 4 hours of activities related to patient safety, education, and handoff. Students cannot work more than 80 hours per week averaged over 4 weeks. They can only have 1 day off in a 7-day work week with 8 hours off between shifts. Clinical responsibilities will vary depending on specialty, but how is the student functioning with work commensurate to a PGY1 with an appropriate level of training? | | F. | | How is the student demonstrating drawing clinical conclusions and/or developing a management plan and documentation as an intern would do? | | G. | | How and by whom will midpoint feedback be provided to the student? How will you remediate deficiencies identified at midpoint? | | H. | | Acting Internship students often seek letters of recommendation following their experience. How many different Faculty will work directly with the student and have knowledge of the student's abilities to detail in a written evaluation? Describe the degree of supervision and interaction with faculty vs. residents or other providers and how feedback will be obtained if more direct work is with residents or other providers. "}
