Correspondence address: 21415 I: Role of Glutathione and alpha-Lipoic Acid in the Treatment of Mercury Toxicity Lyn Patr ick, ND Abstract Mercury exposure is the second-most commoncause of toxic metal poisoning. Public health concern over mercury exposure, due to contamination of fish with methylmercury andthe elemental mercury content of dental amalgams, has long been a topic of political and medical debate. Although the toxicologyof mercury is complex, there is evidence for antioxidant protection in the prevention of neurological and renal damage caused bymercury toxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid, a coenzyme of pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, has been used in Germany as an antioxidant and approved treatment for diabetic polyneuropathy for 40 years. Researchhas attempted to identify the role of antioxidants, glutathione and alpha-lipoic acid specifically, in both mitigation of heavy metaltoxicity and direct chelation of heavy metals. This review of the literature will assess the role of glutathione and alpha-lipoic acid in thetreatment of mercury toxicity. (Altern Med Rev 2002;7(6):456-471) Mercury: Sources of Exposure According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, mercury is listed as the third-most frequently found(lead and arsenic are first and second), and the most toxic substance in the United States. 1 This figure originates from the U.S. Government's Priority List of Hazardous Substances. This list includes, in order of priority, substances that have been found at hazardous waste sites on theNational Priorities List (Superfund sites) that \"pose the most significant potential threat to humanhealth due to their known or suspected toxicity and the frequency of exposure.\" Of 1,467 hazardous waste sites listed on the NationalPriorities List in 1998, toxic levels of mercury were identified in 714. Mercury toxicity is also considered the second-most common cause ofacute heavy metal poisoning, with 3,596 cases reported in 1997 by the American Association of Poison Control Centers. 2 Annual worldwide emissions of mercury into the atmosphere have been estimated at 2,200 metric tons.3 One-third of these emissions are es- timated to originate from natural sources (volca- nic eruptions and decay of mercury-containingsediment) and two-thirds from man-made sources. Twenty-five percent of total worldwide emissions come from fossil fuel combustion. In the UnitedStates, 26 percent (64.7 tons/year) of atmospheric mercury emissions come from medical waste incineration, such as cremation. 4 There are currently 1,782 advisories (one per body of water) issued by the U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency (EPA) in 41 states inthe United States restricting the consumption of any locally caught fish or shellfish due to their mercury content. Sixteen states have issued state-wide or statewide-coastal advisories recommend- ing restricting the consumption of fish caught in the state or along the coastline due to methyl-mercury contamination. 4 The EnvironmentalCopyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc.

The Environmental Working Group estimates thatmore than 25 percent of children in utero in the United States would be exposed to levels of mer- cury above the EPA safe reference dose (0.1 \u00b5g methylmercury/kg body weight/day) for at least 30 days during gestation and would have an in- creased risk for neurological damage. 5 The ATSDR considers anyone who lives in close proximity to a former mercury mining site, recycling facility, municipal or medical incinera-tor, or coal-fired electric generating plant to be at risk for mercury toxicity. Anyone who routinely consumes contaminated fish, subsistence hunterswho consume meat or organ tissues of marine mammals or feral wildlife, individuals with a \"large number\" of dental amalgams, pregnant ornursing women (and their developing fetuses and breast-fed babies), those who use consumer prod- ucts containing mercury (skin-lightening creamsor antiseptic facial products, mercury-containing diuretics or laxatives, and teething powders), or those living or working in buildings painted withmercury-containing latex paint are also considered at significant risk. Mercury-containing latex paint was removed from paint manufacturing in 1991but may still be available in the reserve invento- ries of contractors and warehouses. 4 Mercury is found in the environment in three basic states: elemental mercury or mercury vapor, inorganic mercury, and organic mercury (ethyl-, methyl-, alkyl-, or phenylmercury). Eachform has an individual toxicological profile and metabolic fate. The most frequent source of mer- cury exposure is open to debate. On an individualexposure basis, the estimated intake and retention of elemental mercury vapor (from dental amal- gams and atmospheric pollution) in non-occupa-tionally exposed individuals has a much broader range (3.9-21.0 \u00b5g/day) than either inorganic (4.3 \u00b5g/day) or methylmercury exposure. 6Elemental Mercury Elemental mercury, in thermo- meters, thermostats, dental amalgams, and mer- cury added to latex paint, eventually enters a va- porized state. Eighty percent of inhaled elemen-tary mercury vapor is absorbed and can cross the blood-brain barrier or reach the placenta. 2 Mer- cury vapor the gastrointestinal tract is and excreted in the feces. 6 Mer- cury vapor in the kidneys, however, the main re- pository for elemental mercury, is carried to allparts of the central nervous system as a lipid- soluble gas. Mercury vapor can also be oxidized to inorganic mercury by catalase and can attachto the thiol groups in most proteins - enzymes, glutathione, or almost any structural protein. 7 Elemental mercury can also be methylated by microorganisms in soil and water and potentially the human gastrointestinal tract,8 where it can then be transformed into organic methylmercury, theform found in fish, fungicides, and pesticides. El- emental mercury and its metabolites have the toxic effect of denaturing biological proteins, inhibit-ing enzymes, and interrupting membrane trans- port and the uptake and release of neurotransmit- ters. 7 Chronic exposure most commonly manifests as a triad of increased excitability and irritability, tremors, and gingivitis.2 Less commonly, chronic exposure causes central and peripheral nervoussystem damage, manifesting as a characteristic fine tremor of the extremities and facial muscles, emo- tional lability, and irritability. Rarely, significantexposure can cause acrodynia or \"pink disease,\" involving a pink rash on the extremities, pruritis, paresthesias, and pain. 9 Inorganic Mercury Inorganic mercury (mercury salts) is found in cosmetic products, laxatives, teethingpowders, diuretics, and antiseptics. 2 Inorganic mercury can be formed from the metabolism of elemental mercury vapor or methylmercury.7 Al- though inorganic mercury does not normally reach the placenta or cross the blood-brain barrier, it has been found in the neonatal brain due to the ab-sence of a fully formed blood-brain barrier. 6 In- organic mercury is complexed with glutathione inPage 458 Alternative Medicine Review Volume 7, Number 6 2002Mercury Toxicity Review Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc.

Chronic exposure to inorganic mercury salts primarily af- fects the renal cortex10 and may manifest as renal failure (dysuria, proteinuria, and and excessive salivation).Irritability and occasionally acrodynia can occur. 2 Organic Mercury Considered the most toxic and most fre- quent form of mercury exposure, organic mercury is found in fish, poultry that has been fed fishmeal, pesticides, fungicides, insecticides, and thimero-sal-containing vaccines. Thimerosal, which is 49.6-percent ethylmercury (a form of organic mercury), has been used as a preservative in vac-cinations since the 1930s. It is currently mixed with DTaP, HIB, and hepatitis B vaccines or is used in the manufacturing process for vaccines,with resultant trace amounts being present in the final product. Based on existing Centers for Dis- ease Control (CDC) recommendations for vacci-nations, a typical six-month-old child, if receiv- ing all thimerosal-containing vaccines, could potentially be injected with as much as 187.5-200\u00b5g of methylmercury; the equivalent of more than 1.0 \u00b5g per day. This amount exceeds the refer- ence limits for exposure to mercury set by the EPAof 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/day. 11 In the United States, at the FDA's request, all vaccines are currently being produced as thimerosal-free or thimerosal-reduced(> 95-percent reduction) vaccines. Thimerosal- preserved vaccines are still available and used in clinical practice. Methylmercury is almost completely ab- sorbed (95-100 percent) in the human gastro- intestinal tract, 2,7 90 percent of which is eventu- ally eliminated through the feces. Methylmercury is present in the body as a water-soluble complex, mainly with the sulfur atom of thiol ligands,7 and crosses the blood-brain barrier complexed with L- cysteine in a molecule resembling methionine. Methylmercury is absorbed into the placenta andstored in the fetal brain in concentrations that ex- ceed maternal blood levels. 12 After being released from cells in a complex with reduced glutathione,methylmercury is degraded in the bile duct to an L-cysteine complex. Only 10 percent of methyl- mercury is eliminated through the kidneys. The rest either undergoes enterohepatic recycling ordemethylation by microflora in the intestine and immune system and eventual elimination through the feces. Most methyl mercury in animal exposure studies is degraded to, and eliminated as, inorganic mercury at the rate of one percent per day. 7 At least one study has demonstrated the capacity of two common forms of gastrointestinal yeast to con- vert inorganic mercury to methylmercury.8 Demethylation by intestinal microflora is a cru- cial step in the elimination of methylmercury from the body, but research has not yet identified themechanisms or the microbes responsible for this detoxification system. 7 Enterohepatic reabsorption is also a significant event in the metabolism ofmethylmercury; more than 70 percent is re- absorbed from the gut and returned to the liver. 7,13 Inorganic mercury has been found as the major form of mercury in brain tissue in humans fatally exposed to methylmercury.14 The conver- sion of methylmercury to inorganic mercury isthought to take place in phagocytic cells in the liver or in the astroglial cells of the brain. 7 The majority of toxicity due to methyl- mercury exposure involves the central nervous system. Methylmercury can cause demyelination, autonomic dysfunction, sensory nerve conductiondelay, abnormal neuronal migration, and abnor- mal central nervous system cell division. Chronic toxicity symptoms include paresthesia, peripheralneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, akathisia, spastic- ity, memory loss, vision, dysarthria, impaired hearing, smell and taste, trem-ors, and depression. 2,7 Methylmercury exposure also appears to increase risk for cardiovascular disease. In a long-term prospective study, both intake of nonfatty freshwater fish and hair mercury content demon- strated a statistically significant correlation withincreased risk for acute myocardial infarction. 15 Men with the highest hair mercury had a 2.9-foldincreased risk for cardiovascular death. An exami-nation of the same cohort found a significant cor- relation between hair mercury and increased riskAlternative Medicine Review Volume 7, Number 6 2002 Page 459Review Mercury Toxicity Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc.

No Reprint Without Written PermissionEthylmercury (fungicides, thimerosal in vaccines, and gamma-globulin) also causes renal and central nervous system toxicity and is depos- ited in the liver, kidneys, skin, brain, spleen, andplasma. 7 Ethylmercury, like methylmercury, is me- tabolized to the inorganic form and accounts for 50 percent of the mercury eliminated in urine.Ethylmercury may actually be converted to inor- ganic mercury in the tissues in greater amounts and more rapidly than methylmercury. 7 As with methylmercury, the feces are the main natural route of elimination. Table 1 summarizes the forms of mercury and their pharmacokinetics. Mechanisms of Mercury Toxicity Mercury can cause biochemical damage to tissues and genes through diverse mechanisms,such as interrupting intracellular calcium homeo- stasis, disrupting membrane potential, altering protein synthesis, and interrupting excitatoryamino acid pathways in the central nervous sys- tem. 19 Mitochondrial damage, lipid peroxidation, are of neurotox- icity.19 Over time, both methylmercury and el- emental mercury vapor in the brain are trans- formed to inorganic mercury, and become firmlybound to sulfhydryl-containing macromolecules. 21 Both etc.). The binding and dissociation of these mercury-thiol complexes are believed to control the movementof mercury and its toxic effects in the body. 7 Mitochondrial damage from oxidative stress may be the earliest sign of neurotoxicity withmethylmercury. A study in neural tissue indicates the electron transport chain appears to be the site where free radicals are generated, leading to oxi-dative damage induced by methylmercury. 19 Mercury-Thiol Binding Because the stability constants (energy necessary to form and break bonds) for mercury and thiol complexes (glutathione, albumin,cysteine, etc.) are so high, mercury will bind to any free thiol available and the thiol in the highest concentration will be the most frequently-bound.22 The reaction rate is almost instantaneous.7 Although the mercury-sulfhydryl bond is stable,it is labile in the presence of other free sulfhydryl groups; therefore, methylmercury will beredistributed to other competing sulfhydryl- containing ligands. 23 This is the basis for chelation of heavy metals with sulfhydryl compounds likeDMPS and DMSA - providing free sulfhydryl groups in high concentrations to encourage the metal to move from one sulfhydryl-containingligand to another. The homocysteine,metallothionein, and albumin contain reduced sulfur atoms that bind to mercuric ions and deter- mine the biological fate of mercury compoundsin the body. 24 The complex of methylmercury and cysteine may act as a \"molecular mimic\" for the amino acid methionine and gain entry into thecentral nervous system via the same mechanism methionine uses to cross the blood-brain barrier. 25 Endogenous thiols transport mercury compounds and act to protect them from binding to other pro- teins, preventing functional damage in that tissue. In general, the higher the cysteine or thiol con-centration in a cell medium, the lower the con- centration of intracellular divalent mercury. In other words, higher concentrations of thiols ap-pear to protect against accumulation of mercury, both in vivo and in vitro. 22 Glutathione in Heavy Metal Binding Glutathione is the most common low- molecular weight sulfhydryl-containing compound in mammalian cells, present inmillimolar amounts in most cells. 26 As a result of the binding of mercury to glutathione and the subsequent elimination of intracellular glutathione,levels of reduced glutathione are lowered in several specific types of cells on exposure to all forms of mercury. Glial cells, 27 human erythrocytes,28 and mammalian renal tissue24 have all been found to have significantly lowered levelsAlternative Medicine Review Volume 7, Number 6 2002 Page 461Review Mercury Toxicity Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written Permissionof reduced glutathione, a major source of oxidant protection. Mercury, as well as cadmium, generates highly toxic hydroxyl radicals from the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, which furtherdeplete glutathione stores. 27 There is evidence that glutathione depletion can lead to neurological damage; low levels of glutathione have been foundin Parkinson's disease and cerebral ischemia- reperfusion injury. 29 Glutathione, as both a carrier of mercury and an antioxidant, has three specific roles in pro- tecting the body from mercury toxicity. First, glu- tathione, specifically binding with methylmercury,forms a complex that prevents mercury from bind- ing to cellular proteins and causing damage to both enzymes and tissue. 30 Glutathione-mercury com- plexes also reduce intracellular damage by pre- venting mercury from entering tissue cells and becoming an intracellular toxin. Second, glutathione-mercury complexes have been found in the liver, kidney, and brain, and appear to be the primary form in which mer-cury is transported and eliminated from the body. 24 The transport mechanism is unclear, but com-plexes of glutathione and mercury are the predomi-nant form of mercury in both the bile and the urine. 31 Glutathione and cysteine, acting as carri- ers of mercury, actually appear to control the rateof mercury efflux into bile; the rate of mercury secretion in bile appears to be independent of ac- tual bile flow. When bile flow rate is increased ordecreased, the content of mercury in the bile changes inversely so net mercury efflux from the liver remains unchanged. 32 However, increasing bile levels of both glutathione and cysteine in- creases the biliary secretion of methylmercury in rats.13 Other studies have confirmed this data in animal models.33-35 Conversely, glutathione deple- tion inhibits biliary animal and blocking glutathione pro-duction appears to shut down biliary release of mercury. 35 Cells of the blood-brain barrier (brain cap- illary endothelial cells) release mercury in a gluta- thione complex. Inhibiting glutathione production in these cells inhibits their ability to release mer-cury. 23 Mercury accumulates in the central nervoussystem primarily in astrocytes, the cells that pro- vide the first line of defense for the central ner- vous system against toxic compounds.36 Astrocytes are the first cells in brain tissue to encounter met-als crossing the blood-brain barrier. They also contain high levels of metallothionein and gluta- thione, both carriers for heavy metals. It is hy-pothesized that astrocytes are the main depot of mercury in the brain. 37 In studies with astrocytes, the addition of glutathione, glutathione stimula-tors, or glutathione precursors significantly en- hances the release of mercury from these cells in a complex with glutathione. Fujiyama et al 38 also suggest that conjugation with glutathione is the major pathway for mercury efflux from astrocytes. Glutathione also increases mercury eliminationfrom renal tissue. Studies in mammalian renal cells reveal glutathione is 50 percent as effective as the chelating agent DMSA (2,3-dimercaptosuccinicacid) in preventing inorganic mercury accumula- cells. 39 Third, glutathione increases the antioxi- dant capacity of the cell, providing a defense against hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, hy- droxyl radicals, and lipid peroxides produced bymercury. 30 The addition of glutathione to cell cul- tures exposed to methylmercury also prevented the reduction of cellular levels of glutathione per-oxidase, a crucial antioxidant enzyme necessary for protection against the damaging effects of lipid peroxidation. 30 As an antioxidant, glutathione appears to protect against renal damage resulting from inor- ganic mercury toxicity. The co-incubation of rat renal cells with glutathione and inorganic mercury was significantly more protective of renal cell in- jury when compared to inorganic mercury expo-sure alone. 40 Antioxidant levels - specifically glu- tathione, vitamin E, and ascorbic acid - are de- pleted in renal tissue exposed to mercuric chlo-ride (inorganic mercury), and the addition of glu- tathione increased levels of both vitamin E and ascorbic acid in renal cells exposed to mercuricchloride. 24 Mammalian cell lines resistant to mercury toxicity have been cloned.41 They do not readily accumulate mercury and are resistant to the toxicPage 462 Alternative Medicine Review Volume 7, Number 6 2002Mercury Toxicity Review Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written Permissioneffects of methylmercury or inorganic mercury. An outstanding characteristic of this cell line is that glutathione levels are five times greater in these cells than the parent cells from which theyoriginated. The authors of this study conclude that the mechanisms of resistance were primarily due to glutathione's ability to facilitate mercury effluxfrom cells and the protective binding of mercury by glutathione to prevent cellular damage. The Role of alpha-Lipoic Acid In 1966, German physicians began using alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) therapeutically in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy and liver cirrhosisbecause of their observation that these patients had lower levels of circulating lipoic acid. 42 The ap- plication was subsequently extended to heavymetal intoxication and toxic mushroom poisoning. According to Jones and Cherian, 43 an ideal heavy metal chelator should be able to enter thecell easily, chelate the heavy metal from its com- plex with metallothionein or other proteins, and increase the excretion of the metal without its re-distribution to other organs or tissues. Although no human clinical trial has investigated the use of ALA as a chelating agent in mercury toxicity, thereis evidence ALA satisfies at least two of the above criteria; i.e., absorption into the intracellular en- vironment and complexing metals previouslybound to other sulfhydryl proteins. ALA produced endogenously is bound to proteins, but can also be found unbound in the cir-culation, after exogenous lipoic acid supplemen- tation. 41 In this form it is chemically able to trap circulating heavy metals, thus preventing cellulardamage caused by metal toxicity. 41 Lipoic acid is lipophilic and is able to penetrate cell membranes and reach high intracellular concentrations within30 seconds of its administration. 44 The fact that free ALA crosses the blood- brain barrier is significant because the brain readilyaccumulates lead and mercury, where these met- als are stored intracellularly in glial tissue. 36,45 Oral doses of 10 mg/kg ALA in rats have reached peaklevels in the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and pe- ripheral nerves within 30 minutes of administra- tion, and studies of chronic daily dosing concludeALA reaches all areas of the CNS and peripheral nervous system. 46 ALA has been shown to decrease lipid peroxidation in brain and sciatic nerve tis- sue47 and when given orally to rats, decreased lipid peroxidation in brain tissue by 50 percent.46 In diabetic neuropathy, free lipoic acid may prevent glucose-related oxidative damage by enteringnerve tissue where it acts as both an antioxidant and heavy metal-binding agent. 28 ALA has been administered to humans in doses up to 1,200 mg intravenously without tox- icity, and in oral daily doses of as much as 600 mg three times daily. The only side effects reportedare infrequent nausea and vomiting. No side ef- fects have been reported in oral administration of up to 1,800 mg daily. 41,48 Doses of 500-1,000 mg have been well tolerated in placebo-controlled studies.49 Extrapolation of pharmacokinetic and toxicity data demonstrate safe human dosageswould not be exceeded with oral doses of several grams per day. 41 ALA has been shown to increase both in- tra- and extracellular levels of glutathione in T- cell cultures, human erythrocytes, glial cells, and peripheral blood lymphocytes.50 In rats, oral dos- ing of 150 mg/kg/day for eight weeks significantly increased glutathione levels in the blood and liver.51 ALA has been shown to increase intracel- lular 30-70 percent in murine neu- roblastoma and melanoma cell lines, and in the lung, liver, and kidney cells of mice that had re-ceived intraperitoneal injections of 4, 8, or 16 mg/ kg ALA for 11 days. 52,53 Levels of intracellular glutathione have been shown to increase by 16percent in T-cell cultures at concentrations of 10- 100 \u00b5M (concentrations achievable with oral and intravenous supplementation of ALA). 50 A single oral dose of 600 mg ALA was able to produce a serum concentration of 13.8 \u00b1 7.2 \u00b5M and levels of 100-200 \u00b5M have been reported after 600 mg intravenous administration.54 Increases in glutathione levels seen with ALA administration are not only from the reduc-tion of oxidized glutathione (one of the functions of ALA) but also from the synthesis of gluta- thione. 46 ALA is reduced to dihydrolipoic acidAlternative Medicine Review Volume 7, Number 6 2002 Page 463Review Mercury Toxicity Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc. All Rights Reserved. No Reprint Without Written Permission(DHLA), itself a potent antioxidant. DHLA is able to regenerate oxidized ascorbate, glutathione, co-enzyme Q, and vitamin E, 28 and is responsible for the ability of ALA to increase intracellular gluta- thione levels (Figure 1).55 ALA, through its reduction to DHLA and oxidation back to ALA, has the ability to continuously provide cysteine, the rate-limitingamino acid for glutathione production. ALA is rapidly reduced to DHLA and released in the extracellular environment where it reducesextracellular cystine to cysteine and increases the uptake of cysteine into the cell, 50 increasing glutathione production. ALA does this throughenzyme-catalyzed reactions using NADH or NADPH, the metabolic power resulting from glucose metabolism (Figure 2).51 ALA and Binding of Copper, Iron, Platinum, and Lead ALA and DHLA have been shown to form complexes with manganese (Mn2+), zinc (Zn2+), cadmium (Cd2+), (Fe2+) In many cases, ALA- mediated heavy-metal binding prevents free- radical caused tissue damage DHLA and regenerates glutathione from oxidized glutathione. DHLA also recycles vitamin C from oxidized ascorbate, consequently restoring vitamin E. 1. 2. 3.GSSG GSHDHLA LA DHLA LADHAA AAVit E Vit E radicalPage 464 Alternative Medicine Review Volume 7, Number 6 2002Mercury Toxicity Review Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc.

No Reprint Without Written PermissionIn the case of iron and copper, complexing with ALA can protect cells from damage caused by iron- or copper-induced lipid peroxidation.41 ALA has been shown to bind copper in human lipoproteins57 and, as a result, to inhibit copper- induced peroxidation of low density lipoproteins.ALA has been used to treat Wilson's disease, ef- fectively increasing renal copper excretion and normalizing liver function. 58 ALA is also able to form complexes with ferritin-bound iron both in vitro and in vivo.59 ALA has the ability to displace protein or vitamin Cbound to iron and bind to Fe2 +. DHLA can facili- tate the release of iron from the ferritin molecule and bind iron.41 The brain, particularly the substantia ni- gra and the globus pallidus, contains high levels of iron.46 The high iron content and an increased level of unsaturated fatty acids lead to increased levels of tissue peroxidation.46 ALA has been found to suppress the free radicals initiated by reactionswith iron in the substantia nigra and other parts of the CNS. 46 ALA has also been shown to protect against cisplatin-induced renal damage in rats by binding to platinum that is responsible for renal toxicity.60 At dosages of 25-100 mg/kg (equivalentto 7 grams per 70 kg human adult), ALA restored normal levels of antioxidant enzyme activity, increased reduced glutathione levels, and significantly decreased renal tissue platinumcontent. The dose of cisplatin used in the study (16 mg/kg) is similar to clinical use in cancer treatment. Although the potential toxicity of thishigh dose of ALA is unknown, it is much higher than the 300-1800 mg typically used clinically. 46,48,49 An intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg ALA given to rats for seven days was able to sig- nificantly alter the oxidative stress induced by leadtoxicity. 61 ALA administration increased gluta- thione levels 207 percent in the lead-exposed rats and decreased malondialdehyde levels in the brain,kidneys, and red blood cells, three of the four main targets of lead toxicity. 61 Further studies in cell lines of the fourth target, the reproductive system,found ALA had a protective effect in hamster ova- rian cells, decreasing oxidative stress that causes cellular damage and death as a result of lipidperoxidation. 61 Because lead exposure was high (2,000 ppm injected daily into rats for five weeks) and the length of time ALA was administered wasshort (seven days), there may not have beenFigure 2.

No Reprint Without Written Permissionenough time to see decreases in levels of lead in the brain or kidneys, if that effect were to take place. There were significant improvements in cell viability in ovarian cells exposed to lead that didnot result from direct ALA-iron binding, suggest- ing ALA has a protective effect in lead toxicity aside from its ability to bind and excrete lead. 61 ALA and Cadmium, Arsenic, and Mercury Cadmium, arsenic, and mercury toxicity all involve similar pathways of cellular damage;i.e., mitochondrial damage, inhibition of mito- chondrial enzymes, suppression of protein synthe- sis, and production of free radicals. 62 All three have a strong affinity for sulfhydryl-containing ligands (glutathione, alpha-lipoic acid, etc.), and each re- sult in depressed levels of reduced glutathione.63 The efficacy of ALA as an antioxidant and heavy metal-complexing agent in cadmium, arsenic, and mercury toxicity has been studied in animals -with results that may be applicable to heavy metal toxicity in humans. ALA, at concentrations of 5 mM, was able to protect rat hepatocytes from cadmium toxicity (200 \u00b5M) by preventing decreases in total glu- tathione and increases in lipid peroxidation. 63 An- other cadmium study investigated 1.5-6.0 mM concentrations of ALA or 17-89 \u00b5M DHLA in rat hepatocytes exposed to cadmium.64 Both proto- cols decreased cadmium uptake by hepatocytes and normalized hepatocyte glutathione levels, leading to increased cell viability and survivaldespite the cadmium toxicity. ALA has also been shown (at a 30 mg/kg injected dose) to completely prevent damage that occurs from cadmium-in-duced lipid peroxidation in rat brain, heart, and testes. 65 In addition, ALA completely restored glu- tathione levels in the rat brain that had declined63 percent with cadmium exposure. A frequently quoted article referring to ALA as a heavy metal-complexing agent is thestudy by Grunert. 66 Published in 1960, the inves- tigation used a dog and rat model in which simul- taneous injection of sodium arsenate and ALA inboth animals protected them from fatal arsenic toxicity. It has been shown that in acute arsenicintoxication, lipoic acid can form a complex with arsenic that renders the arsenic nontoxic. 41 Stud- ies dosing mice with arsenic have shown ALA prevents intestinal uptake of arsenic and reducesthe toxic effect of arsenic on enzyme inhibition. 49 ALA has been shown to affect the release of glutathione into bile secretions. In animal stud-ies, increasing amounts of glutathione in bile has been shown to dramatically increase the release of inorganic mercury. ALA given intravenouslyto rats at doses of 37.5-300 \u00b5M/kg was shown to increase inorganic mercury release in bile by 1,200-4,000 percent immediately after mercuryexposure. 67 Levels of released inorganic mercury remained at a 300-700 percent elevation, even three hours after dosing with ALA. If mercury wasinjected 24 hours prior to the administration of ALA, the increase in release of inorganic mercury was substantially less, but was still elevated 140-330 percent. A lower dose of ALA (37.5 \u00b5M/kg) was more effective than higher doses at increas- ing the biliary elimination of methylmercury. There was disconcerting evidence from this study, however, that ALA may also alter the tissue distribution of mercury and other heavymetals. Although levels of inorganic mercury and methylmercury in the kidney dropped signifi-cantly, levels of inorganic mercury also increased significantly in the brain, lung, heart, and liver tis- sue. Methylmercury levels had also increased inthe brain, intestine and muscle of the rats given ALA. The same phenomenon occurred in rats ex- posed to cadmium and given the same doses ofALA. Levels of cadmium in the liver dropped (where cadmium is most frequently stored) but increased in the kidney and muscle. The same wastrue in rats given copper and ALA; all tissues ex- amined had increased levels of copper, except for the liver (where copper usually accumulates)where levels had dropped. 67 In all cases the pat- tern was the same; the tissues that concentrated the metal (blood, spleen, and kidneys in the caseof methylmercury) had reduced concentrations, while other tissues appeared to have a greater con- centration.Page 466 Alternative Medicine Review Volume 7, Number 6 2002Mercury Toxicity Review Copyright\u00a92002 Thorne Research, Inc.

A ratio of 6-8 molesALA per mole mercuric chloride was necessary to allow the mice to survive mercury poisoning. A lower level of ALA actually increased the mer-cury toxicity (a molar ratio of 2 moles ALA to 1 mole mercuric chloride or lower) above control levels. The level of mercuric chloride used in thisexperiment, 20 mg/kg, is high and would only be seen in acute mercury poisoning. In another study of mercury intoxication, an injection of 10 mg/kg/day ALA in rats given an injection of 1 mg/kg/day mercuric chloride prevented damage to nerve tissue caused by lipidperoxidation. 68 ALA significantly reduced lipid peroxidation in the mercury-exposed rats while elevating levels of the antioxidants glutathione,ascorbate, and tocopherol. The mechanism ofprotection was hypothesized to be the scavenging of peroxyl radicals formed in the brain and nervous system, although the authors believed direct complexing of inorganic mercury by ALAwas also a possibility. ALA versus Dithiol-based Chelating Agents (DMPS, DMSA) The ability of ALA to bind inorganic mercury from rabbit renal tissue was compared to glutathione (Figure 3). 69 DMPS was the most efficient chelator, removing 86 percent of the mercury in three hours, with DMSA being the next-most efficient,removing 65 percent of the mercury. In the same time period, penicillamine removed 60 percent, glutathione removed 50 percent, ALA removed35 percent, and EDTA removed 20 percent. Only the levels reached by DMSA and DMPS, how- ever, were statistically significantly different from baseline (p<0.05). Therefore, the effect of ALA and glutathione may show only a trend or an apparent effect and are not comparable to DMPS and DMSA. Although the actual effect of a chelator or heavy metal-complexing agent can- not be determined in a three-hour time period, andacute doses of 10 mg/kg of inorganic mercury would be considered highly toxic in an adult hu- man, there is evidence from this study that ALAis a less efficient binder of inorganic mercury than the recognized chelating agents, DMSA and DMPS. All of the substances were used at a con-centration of 10 mM, a level difficult to reach with ALA oral supplementation. In another comparison study, ALA (25 mg/kg/day) resulted in an insignificant decrease in blood and tissue lead in rats with lead toxicity when compared to the dithiol-based chelatingagent, DMSA (dosed at 90 mg/kg/day) (Table 2). 61Figure 3.

No Reprint Without Written PermissionBoth DMSA and DMPS have been shown to be clinically effective heavy metalchelators in human studies of mercury toxicity, 70-75 particu- larly since they both chelate inorganic only as an chelator, whereas DMPS entershepatocytes 73 and re- nal cells,76 although it is still considered primarily an extracellular che-lator. 73 DMSA is less toxic because of its inability to enter cells or bile,73 with an LD50 of 13.73 mM/ kg, approximately twice LD50 of DMPS, which is 6.53 mM/kg.73 While DMSA has been found to be more effective than DMPS at removing mer- cury from the brain,77 DMPS appears to be more effective at removing mercury from the kidney.78 Conclusion Many unanswered questions remain re- garding ALA and heavy metal detoxification, es- pecially pertaining to mercury. The amount of ALA supplemented versus the amount of toxicmetal stored in the tissues is important, and has been clearly detailed in animal trials. A molar ra- tio of 6-8:1 (ALA:mercury) is necessary for pro-tection and viability in mercury studies; a ratio of 2:3 has been seen in arsenic studies. 66 The ability of ALA to assist or prevent movement of heavymetals from the liver appears to be element-spe- cific. In a previously mentioned study, the biliary release of methylmercury, cadmium, zinc, and cop-per was inhibited by ALA. 69 The evidence that ALA may mobilize heavy metals to other tissues from tissues wherethe metals are most concentrated, specifically the brain, is troublesome. An explanation for this find- ing may lie in the complexing of heavy metalswith glutathione and lipoic acid. Inorganic mer- cury forms stable complexes with ALA or DHLA and could be excreted with DHLA injected lipoic acid could complex with glu-tathione as it passes through the liver, preventing glutathione from carrying other heavy metals such as cadmium, or transition metals such as zinc andcopper, into bile. Speculation aside, there is clear evidence ALA and its reduced form DHLA have the ability to act as both intra- and extracellular heavy metal-complexing agents, with little known toxicity and patterns of heavy metal mobilizationand transport not yet understood in humans. In the absence of data from human trials, however, it can only be suggested that ALA be used as an ad-junct to chelation with the standard dithiols, DMPS and DMSA. Mercury toxicity is a significant clinical entity, as it is ubiquitous in the environment and poses serious risk to human health. The pathol- ogy of mercury toxicity in humans is diverse andencompasses direct damage to tissues and enzyme function as well as indirect damage as a result of oxidant stress. Glutathione has been shown to be a sig- nificant factor in heavy metal mobilization and excretion, specifically with application to mercury, cadmium, and arsenic. Glutathione depletion and glutathione supplementation have specific effects on mercury toxicity, both by altering antioxidantstatus in the body and by directly affecting excre- tion of mercury and other heavy metals in the bile.Table 2.

The re-duced form of ALA, DHLA, appears to have di- rect heavy metal-binding effects. When compared to pharmaceutical dithiol-chelating agents, ALAappears to be able to bind and mobilize heavy metals from tissue, although with much weaker an effect. References 1.
