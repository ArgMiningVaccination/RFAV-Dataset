Private Steam The private steam is $75 for 30 minutes. You are smudged with sage to remove all negative energy and negative vibrations. Then you sit over a warm steam with herbs that strengthen your uterus, lightly cleanse and balance your hormones, while covered in a sauna cape to sweat out toxins and impurities.
