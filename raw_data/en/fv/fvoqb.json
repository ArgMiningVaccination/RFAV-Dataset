You may have had one or more of these symptoms, but don't know what triggers it. If you have an allergy, let a professional diagnose your condition. Your Partner in Lung Health. Banner Health allergists treat patients with mild to severe allergies, including seasonal, food and drug allergies, and those with skin problems. We also work closely with pulmonary specialists on any serious allergy and asthma conditions in your lungs. Immune deficiencies happen when the body can't fight infection or illness. Most problems with the immune system develop over time - unlike HIV or AIDS, which you acquire - and affect adults and kids. If you notice an illness or infection that comes back often, schedule an appointment with an allergist immunologist. Banner Health allergist immunologists work with you to identify your condition. We consider the different types of immune problems and the type of illness or infection you have. Once we make the diagnosis, we work with you on a custom treatment plan. "}
