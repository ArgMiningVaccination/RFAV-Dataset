Recipe key Become a SFNSG insider to get my monthly newsletter packed with the latest hormone-healthy recipes + tips. No spamming or junk mail, EVER. As a nutrition + healthy lifestyle coach I get a lot of questions regarding food + food brands, diets, trends, exercise and pretty much all things wellness. After all there are SO many vitamins, pills, herbs and other medicinal concoctions advertised today it's hard to know: a) what you really should be taking and b) whether or not you're actually benefiting from taking it BECAUSE SPOILER ALERT: Many supps on the market are inorganic, fake and aren't even digested or absorbed properly because of fillers and materials used to manufacture them \u2014 yuck! So I figured it was time to do a post on all things supplements \u2014 and there's no better person to break it down than my Naturopathic Physician + Guru + Partner [Dr. Rhea Abbott](http://lakeviewfamilywellness.com/drrheaabbott/). Dr. Abbott is a graduate of Bastyr University and has been in personal practice for eight years. She practices family medicine, with a special interest in sleep medicine, food allergies and hormonal health. But my favorite thing about Dr. Abbott is her approach with her patients, which is not only about helping them feel better, but educating and empowering them to become their own health advocate and healer in the process. Sound familiar? Just glimpse my [mission statement](https://sofreshnsogreen.com/) She also knows a TON about supplements \u2014 and I totally trust her sound advice. So much so that we're working together on an exciting new package that combines her expertise in supplements, food allergy testing and the medical field with my background in motivational + accountability coaching, nutrition and a balanced, realistic approach to healthy living. Dr. Rhea Abbott, ND As a naturopathic physician, I'm always working to get people to their healthiest place in the most natural way. The ultimate goal is to get everything you need from your diet, but for many of us, the perfect diet is a work in progress and we could use something to fill the gap in the meantime. As the Beatles so aptly put it, \"we get by with a little help from our friends\", so let me introduce you to your new besties in the supplement world: Living happily deep within our large intestine is a mega-metropolis of \"good bacteria.\" These suckers not only help digest the compounds we can't metabolize on our own, they make Vitamin K for us and play an enormous role in regulating our immune system! Taking probiotics can re-establish the good guys to ensure they're abundant and healthy. Yes, food items like yogurt and kimchi have good bacteria cultures in them, but usually in much lower doses than it takes to be therapeutic. I advise patients to take higher doses daily of a product that has a variety of organisms. This is definitely a go-to for patients with immune or digestive troubles! Dr. Abbott recommends anything over 10 billion CFU's with a variety of high quality, third-party tested strands. Personally, I've been using [ this brand](https://shop.seed.com/products/daily-synbiotic?gclid=CjwKCAiAzNj9BRBDEiwAPsL0dxNc1IWzAiM8nDLAjwr-cs62UCb6HUMZZQ4RGdG95O_bnGKH_bs2ZBoCmIAQAvD_BwE&sscid=11k5_3nxxt&) for almost a year and have experienced a big improvement [in my regularity, as well as a reduction in digestive symptoms like bloating, constipation, etc.](https://sofreshnsogreen.com/product/seed-probiotics-subscription/) It includes prebiotics and probiotics, over 24-tested 53 billion AFU's, and no need to refrigerate. *Don't forget to use code SOFRESH15 to save 15% off your purchase. Not all forms of fat are created equal. Omega-3's are a form that promote the creation of anti-inflammatory cholesterol (called \"good\" cholesterol, or HDL) and can help reverse the negative effects of inflammatory cholesterol (called \"bad\" cholesterol, or LDL). Omega-3's can keep joints limber, stabilize mood, clear skin, tonify hair and fingernails and reduce cardiovascular risk. Fish oil is the most common and potent way of getting these fats in supplement form, but they can be found in foods such as avocados, flax, and walnuts. If you're eating fish less than 3x per week, supplementation may be a great idea to get up to speed on your good fats! Both Dr. Abbott and [ I love this brand](https://amzn.to/393FgRo), which features a high concentration of HIGH quality, third-party tested fish-oil from fresh, wild-caught fish, minus any gross smell or taste you might experience from lower quality brands. PS \u2014 If you're pregnant, this [ omega-3 is an amazing prenatal option](https://amzn.to/38ZaI3o) for both you and baby! This mineral is a powerful little guy that can relax smooth and skeletal muscles. It's the magnesium in an epsom salt bath that goes to work on those tight muscles. Because it can dilate blood vessels, I often prescribe magnesium for high blood pressure. When taken orally, magnesium attracts water to it in the intestines, which can help break up constipation and smooth things out to keep you regular \u2014 but be careful! Some people find that more than 500mg at a time loosens things a bit too much Dr. Abbott is not so picky about the brand but emphasizes you get something that combines it with calcium. Cal/Mag is a team! I use and recommend [this brand](https://amzn.to/2Mzr1fJ) to clients experiencing irregularity or constipation and [ this brand](https://amzn.to/3rSHH1R) to clients who are deficient in magnesium and experience symptoms such as low quality sleep/insomnia, headaches, cravings or joint-pain. Vitamin D actually acts much more [like a hormone](https://sofreshnsogreen.com/healthy-lifestyle/balance-hormones/your-guide-on-cooking-for-natural-hormone-balance/) than a vitamin. Our skin can convert sunshine into Vitamin D, but our liver and kidneys need to be healthy to turn it into its active form. Cod liver oil is the only readily available food that contains Vitamin D naturally. When blood levels are between 70-90, we're poised for optimum immune health, mood stability, and bone integrity. Most people in the pacific northwest are hovering in the teens and 20's! I like to pulse high doses of Vitamin D through the winter, but it IS possible to have too much, so I always advise checking blood levels first before using high doses. Dr. Abbott says to make sure you're selecting a supplement that's D3 and not D2. Again, she's not as picky about the brand but warns many you buy off the shelf are very low dose. Don't waste your money on anything less than 1000 IUs. I personally [use and love this option](https://amzn.to/3hT6y1b), which provides 2,000 IUs of high quality vitamin D3 in liquid form, so that's it's easily absorbed in your digestive tract (especially important for people that suffer from digestive issues or leaky gut as the tablets may not break down as effectively). Our pancreas has the very important job of making the enzymes your body needs to digest your food. When the pancreas isn't functioning well, or if we're asking too much of it (nachos, coffee, AND a rib-eye steak?!) then food doesn't break down well and it sits around. This can cause bloating, fullness, gas, heartburn, and burping. Taking digestive enzymes before your meal ensures the ingredients you need for metabolism are in your stomach before the food even gets there. Your bottle of enzymes probably includes lipase (for digesting fats), protease (for digesting proteins) and amylase (for digesting carbs). There are many other enzymes out there, but these are the basics. Both Dr. Abbott and [I love this supplement,](https://amzn.to/38fguih) which includes all of the enzymes mentioned above that are necessary to provide basic digestive support. [This is an especially great option](https://amzn.to/2X8G69Z) if you're sensitive to gluten and dairy. Disclaimer \u2014 Not all supplements are a good idea for everyone. Ask your doctor if you'd like to add these to your routine! From Lauren: Don't forget, supplements are meant to \"supplement\" your diet, not replace it. Eating [nutrient-dense foods and deriving as many vitamins and minerals as you can from food should always come first](https://sofreshnsogreen.com/healthy-lifestyle/balance-hormones/your-guide-on-cooking-for-natural-hormone-balance/) \u2014 with supplements helping to fill in any gaps and optimize your health and wellbeing. Also keep in mind this is a very general guide \u2014 your genetic makeup, environment, diet and lifestyle are unique and different to everyone else on this planet \u2014 so if you want a more tailored, customized approach don't hesitate to [reach out](https://sofreshnsogreen.com/nutrition-healthy-lifestyle-coaching/)!
