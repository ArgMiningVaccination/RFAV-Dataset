[In his testimony ](https://odysee.com/@FrontlineCovid19CriticalCareAlliance:c/Dr-Pierre-Kory-Testifies-on-Maryland-Legislation-to-End-Vaccine-Mandates-2:6)during the hearing in Maryland on Monday, Dr. Kory cited the incontrovertible scientific data about the COVID shots: \"There has been systematic suppression of data showing that these vaccines are neither safe nor effective. The data shows they do not reduce transmission, and the vaccinated are even more likely to get COVID. Any mandate that ignores natural immunity is absurd. There is no rationale for this. 33% of people who received the vaccine have had adverse events. These mandates are killing Americans.\" In Wisconsin, Dr. Kory's home state, this was a portion of [his stunning testimony](https://odysee.com/@FrontlineCovid19CriticalCareAlliance:c/Dr-Pierre-Kory-Testifies-in-Wisconsin-on-Vaccine-Mandates-for-Grade-7-12-Students-March-7-2023%29:9?r=8epNUrGs3obSnw11sN2JT1eydsuxYvjF) on Tuesday. The state legislature was considering the possible suspension of portions of DHS Chapter 144, regarding vaccine requirements for students in grades 7-12. \"People are being fed bad information\u2014 false information. When you do that, you can create a lot of damage. We are in the middle of a humanitarian catastrophe. Life expectancy has dropped from age 79 to 76. Who has to die for this to happen? For this to happen, we must lose an inordinate number of young people. Sudden cardiac death is rare. Yet suddenly, people in the prime of their lives are dropping dead. \"Pharmacy fridges are full of vaccines. People aren't having it anymore.\" BREAKING NEWS\u2014 Following the hearing, Wisconsin's state legislature voted to suspend DHS Chapter 144\u2014giving the choice to vaccinate children back to their parents! [HERE](https://metatron.substack.com/p/turtles-all-the-way-down-vaccine?r=nxypy&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) is a link to learn more about \"Turtles All the Way Down: Vaccine Science and Myth\"\u2014the book referenced by Dr. Kory in his testimony to Wisconsin legislators. The anonymous authors (anonymous so they can preserve their livelihoods and feed their families) have condensed an abundance of information on vaccine science; and provided detailed analyses with data harvested from hundreds of medical articles, books, and websites. This book was written for laypersons and medical professionals alike\u2014and is truly an indispensable guide for parents. [Writing on Substack](https://www.racket.news/p/my-statement-to-congress?utm_source=cross-post&publication_id=1042&post_id=107370013&isFreemail=true&utm_campaign=491610&utm_medium=email), reporter Matt Taibbi shared his opening statement at Friday's \"Hearing on the Weaponization of the Federal Government on the Twitter Files\" for the House Judiciary Committee, in the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government. Taibbi told the committee about a message he received about a year ago which read, \"Are you interested in doing a deep dive into what censorship and manipulation... was going on at Twitter?\" Just one week later, [the first](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1598822959866683394) of what became known as the \"Twitter Files\" reports was released. Taibbi writes: \"The original promise of the Internet was that it might democratize the exchange of information globally. A free internet would overwhelm all attempts to control information flow, its very existence a threat to anti-democratic forms of government everywhere. What we found in the Files was a sweeping effort to reverse that promise, and use machine learning and other tools to turn the internet into an instrument of censorship and social control. Unfortunately, our own government appears to be playing a lead role.\" Then there was this surprise in Taibbi's opening statement: \"Following the trail of communications between Twitter and the federal government across tens of thousands of emails led to a series of revelations. Mr. Chairman, we've summarized these and submitted them to the committee in the form of a [new Twitter Files thread], which is also being released to the public now, on Twitter at @ShellenbergerMD, and @mtaibbi.\" BOMBSHELLS. Read them all. Tjody was a very active healthy 68-year-old when she got her first COVID shot. She believes it led to ongoing health problems. With very little help available, Tjody says the doctors won't confirm or deny that her issues are caused by the vaccine. [WATCH](https://covid19criticalcare.com/tjody-had-no-regular-medications-until-she-had-the-covid-shot/) as she puts her story on the record. This week's [FLCCC Weekly Webinar](https://odysee.com/@FrontlineCovid19CriticalCareAlliance:c/Weekly_Webinar_March08:7?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=dd0b59c0-efcd-452e-80c5-10f6875e1e1a) featured special guest Dr. Harvey Risch, who joined Dr. Kory and host Betsy Ashton for a deep conversation about Randomized Controlled Trials, Observational Trials, and Evidence-Based Medicine. The conversation shed light on how hard you have to dig to know what the real outcomes are of the published studies in high-impact medical journals since so many are intentionally flawed. During the webinar, Dr. Risch\u2014Professor Emeritus of Epidemiology in the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at the Yale School of Public Health and Yale School of Medicine\u2014answered a question from a viewer who wanted to know if there are any new strains of COVID-19 of which people should be aware. Here was his newsworthy answer: \"No, there are no upcoming variants. A remarkable event has actually happened. The current variant, XBB.1.5, is taking its time. It has found a niche in the population and nothing has been able to out-compete it for infectivity. Some strains started to grow and then they went back down and could not compete with it. This is the normal evolution of sub-strains. This Omicron variant, XBB.1.5, has grown to a saturation of over 90% of all the infections and doesn't seem to be getting pushed out by anything. This may be very well be close to end of the endemic status of the infection.\" Thank you, Dr. Risch for joining us for this critical discussion! (Dr. Risch's answer to the above question occurs at 58:26 in [the webinar video.](https://odysee.com/@FrontlineCovid19CriticalCareAlliance:c/Weekly_Webinar_March08:7?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=dd0b59c0-efcd-452e-80c5-10f6875e1e1a)) On [this week's episode of Long (COVID) Story Short](https://odysee.com/@FrontlineCovid19CriticalCareAlliance:c/Role-of-The-Glymphatic-System-in-Sleep-and-Brain-Health:7), our Dr. Been discusses the N3 phase of the sleep. \"This phase of sleep is characterized by delta waves, also called slow wave sleep (SWS),\" said Dr. Been. \"This is the most restorative phase of sleep. An important part of this phase is the increase in the glymphatic convection in the brain leading to clearance of the waste products. Let's review!\" We are very excited to announce that Dr. Suzanne Gazda and Dr. Keith Berkowitz will be joining us as speakers for the second FLCCC Educational Conference in Fort Worth, Texas, April 28-29, 2023.
