Our bodies are self-healing We have over 30-40 trillion cells in our body and they all work together to achieve a state of equilibrium. Cells can heal themselves and the damaged cells can be quickly replaced with new ones. From small injuries to recovering from viral and bacterial diseases, our bodies are intelligent and have an immense capacity to heal. For example, the liver can regenerate and the intestine can regenerate its lining. Lungs are self-cleaning - after a person quits smoking, the lungs begin to heal and regenerate. However, some diseases can impair our immune system and the best approach to treat those issues is with a holistic approach. This is where [naturopathy](/naturopathy) can help. What is Naturopathy? Naturopathy is a holistic treatment method that combines traditional medical practices with conventional medicine to treat underlying health conditions, and not just the symptom. It focuses on optimising health using various principles: - The practitioner will aim to understand the underlying problem that is causing physical issues - The treatment method is designed to treat the problem rather than stopping the symptoms - Our body is self-healing and naturopathic treatments aim to remove the obstacles so the body can heal itself - The treatment is supplemented with proper nutrition, exercise, lifestyle changes and self-care Different types of Naturopathy Treatments Naturopathy explores an extensive variety of treatments to stimulate the body's own healing power or vital force. Our Brisbane [Naturopaths](/naturopathy/naturopaths) offer a wide range of naturopathic treatments including: Hydrotherapy - Water therapy uses either hot or cold water with varying pressure to treat health issues like arthritis, joint and muscle problems. It can also be used to reduce pain, minimise inflammation, relieve stress and promote relaxation. Jacuzzi, sauna, hot tub and mineral baths are commonly used in this technique. Aromatherapy - Essential oils are used to alleviate anxiety, depression, stress, improve mood and overall wellbeing. The essential oils used in aromatherapy are derived from plants and distilled. The essential oils can be applied on the skin - used in massage, baths or used in diffusers. Herbal medicine - Unlike traditional medicines and drugs, herbal medicines are focused on the patient. The use of herbal medicine involves using plants and plant extracts like flowers, roots, leaves, fruit and bark to create medicines. The medicines can be used to prevent and treat a vast range of illnesses. [Iridology](/treatments/iridology) - Eyes are the windows to the soul... but they can also analyse an individual's health. Iridology is the study of iris and it can be used to uncover issues in the body. [Remedial Massage](/remedial-massage) - When muscles and tendons become damaged or impaired, knotted and tense, remedial massage provides a healing treatment that can be gentle or strong, deep or shallow.

[Acupuncture](/acupuncture) - Acupuncture is an ancient practice of natural healing and is one form of the traditional Chinese system of medicine that has been used very effectively for over 5000 years. Acupuncture is gaining respect in the western world as its practice has grown spectacularly over the last 3 or 4 decades. Acupuncture involves the stimulation of certain specific points on the body to enhance the flow of vital energy (Chi). Chi travels on the surface of the body and through internal organs. In traditional Chinese medicine, the central belief is that for the body to function at its peak it must be in balance. Homeopathy - It is a form of alternative medicine and based on the body's capacity to heal itself. \"Like treats like\" is the belief in this practice and natural products are used to treat the condition. In your consultation, the practitioner will customise the medicine based on your lifestyle and health history. Homeopathy can be used for a variety of health issues like headache, allergies, and migraines.
