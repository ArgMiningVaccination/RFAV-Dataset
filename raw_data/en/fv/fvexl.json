In one study, the researchers checked if a 2-week mindfulness meditation training can improve cognitive performance. They also examined if meditation can decrease \"mind-wandering\" or the tendency to get distracted. The results showed that the participants who meditated gained better scores in a reading-comprehension test. They also gained better memory and reported less occurrence of distracting thoughts. And of course, one of the best positive effects of meditating regularly is stress reduction. Experts say that living without stress is impossible because there are a lot of things you cannot control. You can, however, change how you view stress and your response to it. One study aimed to determine the effects of an 8-week meditation program called Mindfulness-Based-Stress-Reduction (MBSR) on stress-related inflammation. When inflammation is not controlled, it can cause a lot of diseases. The researchers found out that MSBR is a better way to reduce \"post-stress inflammatory response\" than another program called the Health Enhancement Program (HEP). It helps people manage physical illnesses Being able to manage the physical symptoms of diseases is one of the positive effects of meditating regularly. According to experts, meditation may be useful to soothe the symptoms of different illnesses, especially those that are affected by stress. Some of those stress-related diseases are [asthma](https://hellodoctor.com.ph/respiratory-health/asthma/facts-about-asthma/), chronic pain, [hypertension](https://hellodoctor.com.ph/heart-health/hypertension/prevent-hypertension/), and tension headaches. What Are The Types of Meditation? Of course, before you can take advantage of the positive effects of meditating regularly, you must first practice it. The good news is, there are several types of meditation to choose from. They are: Mindfulness meditation To get the most out of the positive effects of meditating regularly, you can try mindfulness meditation. The greatest thing about mindfulness meditation is you can do it almost anywhere, anytime. To start, you must focus on your breath and let everything else fade into the background. Note that you must not judge your breathing - it's okay if it's fast, or shallow, or deep. For a few minutes, think of nothing else. If your mind wanders, don't be too hard on yourself. Just get back on focusing on your breathing. The act of not thinking about anything else gives your mind the well-deserved rest it needs. Mantra meditation In mantra meditation, you choose a statement or word and repeat it until it's the only thing you focus on. The simplest mantra is the word \"Ohm,\" but you can change it according to your preference. Body scan meditation You can also gain the positive effects of meditating regularly through body scan meditation. Because it makes you aware of your body, you will also notice if certain parts don't feel well. In Body Scan, you need to focus on your body parts one at a time. Start with your head. Feel the skin, then your eyes, nose, ears, and mouth. Focus on your neck, down to your shoulders, arms, fingers, and further down until you reach your toes. After a body scan meditation, not only has your mind taken a rest, but you also become more aware of your body. "}
