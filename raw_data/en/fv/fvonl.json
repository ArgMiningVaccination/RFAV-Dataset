The pandemicreminds everyone of the value and necessity of public health. In the context of an era that will be shaped by COVID-19, we outline the coming series of challenges and transitions in public health and the needed actions over the next 5 years to reinvent our public health sys- tems. Multiple limitations in cur- rent US and global public healthsystems have been uncovered by the pandemic, including insuf - cient preparedness and surveil- lance capabilities complicated by long-standing and worsening health inequalities and the rapid spread of misinformation that needs to be countered.

The worldwide pandemic caused by severe acute re- spiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a medical andpublic health emergency on anunprecedented scale that beganonly several months ago. Its fullimpact is not yet manifest, andthe course and full consequences of the pandemic are still uncertain. But public health has already beenaltered, and the prevention mea-sures used for epidemic controlhave become household words(e.g., social distancing, contacttracing). The reasons behind therapid spread of coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) in the UnitedStates are becoming clearer (e.g., travel, large gatherings, cryptic transmission) as are the publichealth actions needed to controlspread. 1However, the striking toll of mortality from the virus in theUnited States compared withmany other industrialized nationsis alarming and raises questionsabout preparedness, capacity,political will, and the underlying health of the population. Like other pandemics, this one hasthrived on inequity, causing sub-stantially higher mortality amongthose living in poverty and in someracial and minority groups as wellas in the elderly and chronicallyill. 2,3We are also starting to re- alize the devastating economicimpacts on the United States and the world; these impacts come with sweeping consequences forphysical and mental health andthe health of the population. 4,5The emergence of the pan- demic and the severity of its course have proven to be apowerful and heeded reminder to all of the value of public health. Public health and epidemiologyare now more recognized by thegeneral public and policymakersthan ever before. Part of this visibility relates to media atten- tion (including social media),which is known to affect publichealth policy and practice. 6,7We compared the media hits via Media Cloud8for the terms \"public health \"and\"epidemi- ology \"in the periods January 1 to June 1, 2019, versus January 1 toJune 1, 2020 (Figure 1). Wefound a more than 1000% in- crease in media coverage of public health and epidemiology,an increase that leads to thisquestion: at this extraordinarymoment, how do we turn this increased attention into sustained actions that will enhance publichealth and improve health andequity? We address this question as we consider (1) the future course thatpublic health will take as it addressesthe challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic over thenext 5 years, and (2) the pan-demic 's direct and indirect con- sequences for population health. We acknowledge the strains on resources to support public healthand the competition for gov-ernmental funds across diversesectors. THE PUBLIC HEALTH FAULT LINES The enormous stress of the COVID-19 pandemic has shownthe vulnerabilities of long-standing weaknesses in our public health and health care systems (we do not address the lattersector here). The pandemic hasrevealed disturbing and far-reaching problems in publichealth systems globally and in theUnited States \u2014nationally and at the state and local levels \u2014and spotlighted large populations made vulnerable by chronic ill-ness and health inequalities. 3,9,10 In 1988, the Institute of Medicine de ned the 3 core ABOUT THE AUTHORS Ross C.

Peer Reviewed Analytic Essay 1605AJPH REIMAGINING PUBLIC HEALTHfunctions of public health as as- sessment, policy development, and assurance.11Have these core functions been adequately met aswe confront the pandemic? As-sessment is the capacity to trackthe health status of the populationand identify emerging diseases.Surveillance is the foundation ofassessment in the public health system, and COVID-19 has revealed a system troubled bylack of investments in prepared-ness for surveillance and othercore public health activities.These problems include insuf - cient capacity for testing anddeveloping testing, a lack of sensitive surveillance methods, and insuf cient capability to carry out needed large-scale case in-vestigations. We face thesechallenges even though publichealth surveillance dates back totherst recorded epidemic in 3180 BCE in Egypt 12and has long been a cornerstone of modern public health practice.13 For COVID-19, a surveillancesystem needs to be built that isbased in contemporary datasciences, employs reliable and valid random testing (both for active virus and immunity), and is supported by adequate laboratoryinfrastructure. Policy development during the COVID-19 pandemic hasbeen a patchwork; the lack ofcredible national leadership tak-ing evidence-based approaches has left state and local public health agencies to deal with theirepidemics without coordinatedplanning and optimized resourcemanagement. Even in the con-text of the stresses this pandemichas caused, the gaps have beenevident in the lack of integration across public health agencies and in the lack of channels betweenthe siloed realms of public healthand health care. 14We were in- sufciently prepared; we do not have the needed workforce inplace 15\u2014the assurance function. We are now scrambling to do so. For example, contact tracing as done in the past, although ef-fective, is labor intensive andrelies on self-reported knowledgeof the interpersonal networks ofphysical interactions. 16,17Infor- mation technology has much to offer to support contact tracing, but the development of newtools (e.g., mobile phone appli-cations) is proceeding too slowly. Beyond the failure in meeting the 3 core functions of publichealth, the pandemic pulls backthe curtain on the consequences of long-standing and growing inequalities in the United Statesand the more recently soaring\"deaths of despair \"(i.e., suicide, chronic liver disease, and fataldrug and alcohol poisoning). 18 The number of vulnerable peo-ple is staggering and set to grow because of rising poverty. It is clear that the impact of COVID-19 is widely disparate acrosspopulation subgroups; being ableto work from home and main-taining social distancing are fareasier for those in white-collaroccupations. Well-known social determinants of health remain relevant, including income in-equality, poor housing, unsafeworking conditions, inadequateaccess to medical care, anddisparities in the criminal justice system. 19-21Consequently, the poor are disproportionately af-fected, and being Black or Latinoand also poor ampli es risk fur- ther. For example, in New YorkCity, Blacks 'COVID-19 death rates are more than 2 times higher than those of Whites or Asians. 22 We also see the consequences of failing to reduce the chronicdisease comorbidities that aredriving mortality from COVID-19. We have long known thatchronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes are commonleading causes of death, eventhough they are preventable toa substantial extent. 23A cross- sectional study of 5700 COVID-19 patients from 12 hospitals inNew York City found that the leading comorbidities were hy- pertension,obesity, and diabetes, apattern that seems to be universal. 3 But prevention and controlmeasures for chronic diseases werenot previously suf cient and have now been lessened during thepandemic, as our public health and health care systems have been consumed with the response toCOVID-19; we anticipate thatresources will continue to be di-rected away from chronic diseasesfor the short term. Pandemics create a demand for evidence. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the consequences of our posttruthworld, with its diminution ofscience and propagation offalsehoods, complicating publichealth messaging. We havelearned that reliable scienti c information can be dif cult to come by in the midst of a pan- demic, when news travelsrapidly and much information isderived from social media. OnTwitter, false information spreadsfarther and more quickly thandoes accurate information. 24 Social bots (automated accounts020040060080010001200 Jan 2019 May 2019 Sep 2019 Jan 2020 May 2020Total Stories/Day Month FIGURE 1 \u2014Change in Media Coverage of Public Health and Epidemiology: United States, January 1 -June 1, 2019, and January 1 -June 1, 2020AJPH REIMAGINING PUBLIC HEALTH 1606 Analytic Essay Peer Reviewed Brownson et al.

Misinformation has been de ned as \"information that is contrary to the epistemicconsensus of the scienti c com- munity. \" 26(p434)Misinformation, conspiracy and hatemessages about COVID-19have proliferated (includingChinese stigmatization 27), lead- ing to what some have calledan\"infodemic. \" 28,29 Above all, failures in our re- sponse to COVID-19 can be traced to a lack of public healthinvestment. The United States hasnever supported public health ad-equately, instead spending copi-ously on health care. Per capitaspending on public health is lessthan 3% of total health care ex- penditures, and that proportion is shrinking. 30Following the reces- sion of 2008, public health jobs thatwere lost have not been replaced,and in some regions the volatilityof public health employment ishigher than for any other sector. 31 In the United States the size of local health departments 'work- forces decreased by 50 000 be-tween 2008 and 2017. 32In state-level public health systems,one third of the workforce in-tends to leave in the next year. 33 Adequate investment is neededin all aspects of epidemic pre- paredness (e.g., the Strategic National Stockpile 34) and in fully integrating public health systemsat the local, state, and federal levels. Will the COVID-19 pan- demic nally force us to consider the root causes of our publichealth system 's inadequacies? WINDOWS OF ACTION Before the COVID-19 pan- demic, public health was viewedas entering version 3.0, duringwhich emphasis would be placedon addressing the social deter- minants of health. 35That vision will be broadened by what weterm \"public health reimagined, \" a rapidly evolving strategy thatwill need to be responsive tochanging public health needs. We outline 3 anticipated phases for public health over the next 5years (Table 1), while acknowl-edging the uncertainty of ourprojections of timing. These arebest estimates; we understandthat the precise time frames areunknowable and will be de ned by the course of the pandemic. Phase 1 is focused mainly on response crisis management andshort-term shifting of resources;we are in phase 1 at the moment.The fault lines we noted becameapparent in phase 1 and willcontinue to inhibit prevention and control efforts in later phases. In phase 2, we will seek tomaintain initial gains with thepandemic, while facing its broadand emerging consequences:mental health and chronic diseasemanagement with limited re-sources, for example. The third phase will focus on sustaining and enhancing progress. It will in-volve rebuilding with a slowlyrecovering economy, dealingwith the many public healthproblems that have surfaced, andplanning for the next phase ofpublic health. THE INGREDIENTS FOR CHANGING PUBLIC HEALTH It is imperative that we emerge from the COVID-19 tunnel witha strengthened public healthsystem. Although this necessity isself-evident, the path to achiev- ing it must be articulated. There have been de ning reports that have set new paradigms in publichealth. 11,36,37These challengesand the sequences of the excep- tional opportunities to reexamineand reinvent our public healthsystems. We must build in parton the concept of Public Health3.0, according to which leaders work across sectors to address the social determinants of health. 35 The activities we outline will be-gin to address some of the chal-lenges laid out in phases 2 and 3. As arst ingredient, progress depends highly on leadership andpolitical will. In reviewing progress across a variety of public health areas and settings, we seethat leadership is the most com-mon determinant in promotingthe use of evidence in practiceand policy. 38,39In the COVID- 19 experience, although there hasbeen inadequate leadership at the national level, certain US gov- ernors and mayors have taken earlyand aggressive action in closingschools and businesses, banningpublic gatherings, and convincingthe public of the need to doso. 40,41Some public health leaders at state and local levels have like- wise become trusted gures.42 As public health remains in the forefront, we should be drawingsuch leaders into championing thestrengthening and reforging ofpublic health at this time when therationale for doing so is evident. Aconvening of leaders is needed among policymakers, in public health practice, and in the privatesector. For the future, we needto identify, elect, and sustain anew generation of policy leaderswho will forcefully advocatefor the eld and be fluent in working in the political sector. Our leaders need to be adept at meeting ever-changing commu-nications challenges and, as hasbeen shown in the COVID-19pandemic, they need crisis lead-ership skills (e.g., situationalawareness, decisiveness withflexibility). 43We need to rethink how we categorize and addresspopulation-level risk to have abetter calculus for allocating re-sources \u2014the second ingredient. Decision-making has been por-trayed as balancing the public health and economic conse- quences of the COVID-19pandemic, but decision-makersare often challenged by howto arrive at the correct bal-ance point. 44We have the tools needed to nd the balance point on the public health side, in- cluding risk assessment and health impact assessment.45,46On the economic side, we hear regularreports of multiple indicators,including unemployment andthe extent to which the economyhas been reduced. Public healthdecision-making needs to be made more holistic as we move forward and the immediate im-perative of preventing deathsfrom COVID-19 abates and itsmany indirect health conse-quences emerge. Aside from the direct health and economic impacts of COVID- 19, the pandemic provides an opportunity to view medical andpublic health issues through anew lens, one that embraces theinterconnection of the 2 sectors.Primary care, with its emphasison prevention, is a key bridge. 47 As an example, consider the multilayered comorbidities associated with COVID-19. Intherst layer, the effects of COVID-19 are greatly exacer-bated among individuals withexisting chronic diseases (e.g.,diabetes, cardiovascular and ce-rebrovascular diseases). 4Under- lying these diseases is a set of well-established risk factors, in-cluding unhealthy diet, limitedphysical activity, tobacco use,and lack of cancer screening \u2014 the so-called actual causes ofdeath. 48,49Most evidence-based practices and policies are aimed atAJPH REIMAGINING PUBLIC HEALTH November 2020, Vol 110, No. 11 AJPH Brownson et al. Peer Reviewed Analytic Essay 1607these risk factors.50Yet more fundamental for health are thoserisks in a deeper layer \u2014the social determinants and their rootcauses (structural inequities andunequal allocation of power and resources), which are funda- mental to population health andpatient health. Although they area target of Public Health 3.0,addressing these root causes hasproven intractable, as they arestructurally embedded in oursociety and are a seemingly per- manent barrier to reducing be- havioral and environmental riskfactors. 51 A greater emphasis is needed on a systems approach for ad-dressing social determinants ofhealth that more fully considersthe interconnections between risk factors, the environment, and social and economic fac-tors. 52Race-based discrimination through one system is reinforcedin other, interlocking systems(e.g., housing, transportation, economic segregation) and asystems-based approach identi es the leverage points with thehighest potential for impact. 52,53 These efforts will also require closer integration of data on social determinants of health in elec-tronic health records, which ap-pears to be feasible. 54 It is imperative to examine and reinvent core public health sys-tems\u2014the third ingredient \u2014in part by bringing 21st-century data sciences more fully into public health. For example, sur-veillance systems need to be morecreative and nimble. 55Syn- dromic surveillance, used ex-tensively following 9/11, can beexpanded to incorporate a varietyof real-time data. 55Novel data streams can be integrated in surveillance56and might include communication traces obtainedfrom mobile phones, 17digital surveillance that relies on theInternet (e.g., social media sites),57 and methods that employ arti - cial intelligence and Big Datasimulations. 58In Australia and China, COVID-19 surveillanceis being supported by cell phone applications, but a pub- lic health team needs to be inplace for follow-up, testing, and,in some cases, isolation. Newtracking systems need to ade-quately address privacy con-cerns, including the potential fordiscrimination. 59 Surveillance systems also need to expand beyond health in-dicators to track social de-terminants, such as literacy,unemployment, incarceration,and paying more than 30% ofincome for housing. As we in-vest billions of dollars in research on COVID-19 therapies and vaccines, we likewise need toinvest more fully in appliedpublic health research on newsurveillance methods, contacttracing, and risk communica- tion, and we need to deepenour understanding of livedexperiences. 60 A reinvented public health system will involve new com- munication skills and processes \u2014 thenal ingredient. The COVID- 19 pandemic has already taughtus about the necessity of havingtrusted communication channelsand the capacity to quickly identifyand counter misinformation. First,we need to do a better job of segmenting audiences and reach- ing each with targeted commu-nications. This challenge should bea point of connection betweenpublic health practitioners and theacademic community. Partner-ships will be needed to learn howto better reach all segments of the population using all of the new channels. For the academic andpractice communities, bettercommunication with key stake-holders will be needed to advocateTABLE 1 \u2014Public Health Phases During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Aftermath: United States, March 2020 -April 2025 Phase Period, Mo Characteristics of the Pandemic Prevention and Control Measures Related Health and Economic Challenges 1.

AJPH November 2020, Vol 110, No. 11rebuilding public health systems and advancing evidence-basedpolicies. We already know thatresearchers are adept at commu-nicating with other researchersbut less skilled in reaching non-research audiences. 61Skilled spokespersons are needed. Gen- erally, the public health commu-nity can learn much from businessand social marketing, which tailormessages and target audiencesegments. 62,63 Next, we need to frame in- formation in ways that build support for evidence-based pol- icy. The literature on framingshows that individuals interpretthe same data in different waysdepending on the mental modelthrough which they perceiveinformation. 64For example, the preferences in framing evidence among state-level policymakers varies by political party (e.g.,more Democrats than Republi-cans prefer information presentedas a story affecting their constit-uents, more Republicans thanDemocrats place importance onbudget impact). 65Andnally, we need to systematically and ag- gressively counter misinforma-tion and fake news. 26,28One of the best methods of overcomingmisinformation is to flood the media environment with accu-rate information that is easy tounderstand, is engaging, and can be quickly shared on mobile devices. 66,67 A PATH FORWARD The COVID-19 pandemic will change the world perma-nently in ways not yet predict-able. The events of the pastseveral months have surfacedimmediate health and social needs and pointed directly to the urgent need to redouble ourcommitment to prevention andpublic health investment. Theunaddressed mission of public health complicates and worsensthe effects of the COVID-19pandemic. Without explicit at-tention to social determinants ofhealth, the aftermath of the im-mediate societal outcomes of COVID-19 will be still greater health inequities. When at its best, prevention is invisible. During the COVID-19pandemic, we must keep our eyeson the prize: prevention worksand is an excellent bargain. Weneed to increase the emphasis on return on investment. For a wide range of public health interven-tions, the return on investment islarge\u2014and is highest for legisla- tive approaches. 68 To inform a new vision for public health and to begin toaddress the challenges we have described, a broad group should be brought together to planpublic health reimagined. Wesuggest a potential path forward:looking back to other pivotalmoments in the evolution ofpublic health. In the past, com-mittees of the (now) National Academies of Sciences, Engi- neering, and Medicine have beenformed for the purpose of vi-sionary planning, and that ap-proach might be followed. Giventhe phases to come, an ongoingeffort will be needed by entitiesthat will be heard. Members of planning groups should include not only scienti c leaders and public health educators but, im-portantly, those who would fundand carry out the ndings of this commission (e.g., policymakers,practitioners, business leaders).There are multiple professional stakeholders who are critical to these planning efforts (e.g., theAmerican Public Health Associ-ation, the Association of Schoolsand Programs in Public Health,the Association of State andTerritorial Health Of cials, the National Association of Countyand City Health Of cials). Representation is also needed fromthe public, particularly those ex-periencing inequalities. Any effortshould include a (funded) plan forimplementation and evaluation ofactions. Core elements of any plan must include ongoing re nement and sustainability. 69,70 The lessons of COVID-19 present an opportunity and anurgency to reimagine publichealth. We must recognize thatpublic health is a public good thatdeserves greater investment \u2014 that message has never been more important. We must reach acrossthe silos of the health system,reduce the burden and costs ofpoor health, and advance thescience to identify and respondmore quickly to emerging threatsin our changing world.
