The first paragraph is reprinted below. Two serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines are currently licensed for use in persons aged 10-25 years in the United States. The two vaccines are MenB-FHbp (Trumenba, Pfizer, Inc.) and MenB-4C (Bexsero, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Inc.). In February 2015, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of MenB vaccines among certain groups of persons aged 10 years who are at increased risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease (Category A), and in June 2015, ACIP recommended that adolescents and young adults aged 16-23 years may be vaccinated with MenB vaccines to provide short-term protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease (Category B). Consistent with the original Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure for the two available MenB vaccines, ACIP recommended either a 3-dose series of MenB-FHbp or a 2-dose series of MenB-4C. Either MenB vaccine can be used when indicated; ACIP does not state a product preference. The two MenB vaccines are not interchangeable; the same vaccine product must be used for all doses in a series. In April 2016, changes to the dosage and administration of MenB-FHbp were approved by FDA to allow for both a 2-dose series (administered at 0 and 6 months) and a 3-dose series (administered at 0, 1-2, and 6 months). In addition, the package insert now states that the choice of dosing schedule depends on the patient's risk for exposure and susceptibility to serogroup B meningococcal disease. These recommendations are regarding use of the 2- and 3-dose schedules of MenB-FHbp vaccine (Trumenba) and replace previous ACIP recommendations for use of MenB-FHbp vaccine published in 2015. Recommendations regarding use of MenB-4C (Bexsero) are unchanged.

One finding is that in over just 5 years, the number of new hepatitis C virus infections reported to CDC has nearly tripled, reaching a 15-year high. From a CDC press release: New hepatitis C virus infections are increasing most rapidly among young people, with the highest overall number of new infections among 20- to 29-year-olds. This is primarily a result of increasing injection drug use associated with America's growing opioid epidemic. However, the majority (three-quarters) of the 3.5 million Americans already living with hepatitis C are baby boomers born from 1945 to 1965. Baby boomers are six times more likely to be infected with hepatitis C than those in other age groups and are at much greater risk of death from the virus.

The conference has traditionally occurred just before Memorial Day weekend in even years; however, when CDC announced that the National Immunization Conference would be held in even years, the NCICP steering committee and coalition directors decided to change its conference to the odd years. In 2017, NCICP will be hosted by Immunize Nevada as part of the Nevada Health Conference, November 13-14, 2017, at Green Valley Ranch, Las Vegas. More information about this 2017 conference will be shared when registration opens. Please consider hosting the 2019 National Conference for Immunization Coalitions and Partnerships! The conference is usually hosted by a state immunization coalition, with help from a national volunteer planning committee. If your coalition/organization is interested in possibly hosting the 2019 NCICP conference, please email Lisa Robertson ( [director@VACCINATEINDIANA.ORG](mailto:director@VACCINATEINDIANA.ORG)) at the Indiana Immunization Coalition, by July 31, 2017, for more information and the application form. [Back to top](#Top) IAC clarifies Question of the Week about Td/Tdap vaccine series published in previous issue of IAC Express The Question of the Week (QOTW) featured in the May 17 issue of IAC Express may have generated some confusion because of missing information in the question. The QOTW is reprinted below with an additional sentence added in bold text. A 16-year-old refugee's record indicates 2 doses of Td separated by 1 month and 1 dose of Tdap given 4 months after the second Td. The first dose of Td was given at 16 years of age. Is he up to date? The first two doses of Td are valid because they are separated by at least 4 weeks. However, the minimum interval between the second and third doses of tetanus-containing vaccine is 6 calendar months. So, the Td component of the Tdap dose is not valid because it was given only 4 months after the second dose. The pertussis component can be counted as valid. The patient should receive another dose of Td 6 months after the invalid Tdap dose. If Td is not available, Tdap can be used for this dose. The minimum interval between the second and third doses of tetanus-containing vaccine is 4 weeks when the first dose in the series is given before the first birthday when a 4-dose series is recommended. In this case, the first dose of Td received was at age 16 years. At this age, a 3-dose series is recommended and the interval between the second and third doses is 6 months, as stated in the answer.

A summary made available to the press is reprinted below. HBV infection is widespread in the U.S. territory of Guam. CDC researchers analyzed data from medical records of pregnant women who delivered live born infants at the largest delivery hospital in Guam in 2014 to assess the prevalence of HBV screening and infection among pregnant women. Among 899 women with available data, 18 (2%) tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), an indicator of HBV infection. The 2% HBsAg positivity prevalence from this analysis is more than twice the maternal prevalence estimate for the continental United States (0.9%). Because most of the HBsAg-positive women were born before hepatitis B vaccines was introduced into Guam's infant vaccination schedule, the risk of perinatal HBV transmission is expected to decrease in future years. However, the findings from this study underscore how vital prenatal HBsAg screening is to ensure positive cases are identified. When given within 12 hours of birth, post-exposure prophylaxis is 85% to 95% effective in preventing HBV transmission.

The abstract is reprinted below. BACKGROUND A substantial body of work has related survey-based parental vaccine hesitancy to noncompliant childhood immunization. However little attention has been paid to the connection between parents' own immunization behavior and the immunizations their children receive. METHODS Using the Oregon ALERT Immunization Information System, we identified adult caregiver-child pairs for children between 9 months and 17 years of age. The likelihood of adult-child concordance of influenza immunization per influenza season from 2010-2011 through 2014-2015 was assessed. The utility of adult immunization as a predictor was also assessed for other, noninfluenza recommended immunizations for children and adolescents. RESULTS A total of 450,687 matched adult caregiver-child pairs were included in the study. The children of immunizing adults were 2.77 times more likely to also be immunized for seasonal influenza across all seasons (95% confidence interval, 2.74-2.79), with similar results applying within each season. Adult immunization status was also significantly associated with the likelihood of children and adolescents getting other noninfluenza immunizations, such as the human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV). When adults improved their own behavior from nonimmunizing to immunizing across influenza seasons, their children if not immunized in the previous season were 5.44 times (95% confidence interval, 5.35-5.53) more likely to become immunized for influenza. CONCLUSIONS Children's likelihood of following immunization recommendations is associated with the immunization behavior of their parents. Encouraging parental immunization is a potential tool for increasing children's immunization rates.

They are leaving as soon as the child is 6 months old. We gave her the first dose of Menveo brand MenACWY vaccine today. I know the usual Menveo schedule for an infant is 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. If we maintain usual spacing, she will only get 1 more dose before she leaves. Can we compress the schedule so she can get 2 more doses prior to travel? The meningococcal ACIP recommendations don't clearly state a minimum interval for MenACWY in this situation. However, the minimum interval for a pediatric MenACWY schedule would presumably be 4 weeks like for other pediatric vaccines on a 2-4-6 schedule. You should try to give a third dose before travel begins. About IAC's Question of the Week Each week, IAC Express highlights a new, topical, or important-to-reiterate Q&A.
