It is safe, non-toxic and easily administered. HP is based on 200 years of medical practice and research. HP is the systematic use of nosodes prior to exposure to disease for the purpose of educating your child's immune system. HP stimulates natural immune system response and enhances normal childhood development. When to consider a homeoprophylaxis program The HP Program is designed for parents who have made the decision not to vaccinate their children, but who would like to employ a safe alternative method of disease prevention. No method of disease protection can be guaranteed 100% perfect. The [Program](http://homeopathyminneapolis.com/homeoprophylaxis/starting-hp-program/) is flexible. If there are diseases that you feel have become obsolete or your child has outgrown the risk period of that particular disease the respective nosode may be dropped from the list. [Click here to watch my presentation on homeoprophylaxis.](https://youtu.be/AVI_YyIFZmw) How it works Upon repetition of the particular remedy it is understood that some aspect of susceptibility to that disease has been fulfilled. Research has demonstrated that children who complete the HP Program and then have definite exposure to a disease covered in the program, show greatly reduced incidence of contracting that disease. Supplied with the program are sufficient remedy doses for up to 4 children to complete four years of homeoprophylaxis to the most commonly vaccinated against childhood diseases. Remedies selected are based on current disease prevalence and risk factors. Additional remedies may be added to the Main Program if there are special circumstances or needs i.e., for foreign travel or disease outbreaks. Remedies in the kit are potentized preparations of the disease germ or human discharges produced in relationship to that particular germ (homeopathic nosodes). Remedies are easily administered orally as tiny sugar pellets that dissolve under the tongue. Families must be under the supervision of a homeopath who is certified in the HP Program and trained to administer the protocol. I am formally certified and can supervise your family. As an HP supervisor, I am your point of contact for the duration of the program. Starting the HP Program Many parents have questions about homeoprophylaxis such as: how does the program work; what are the [benefits ](https://www.homeopathyminneapolis.com/homeoprophylaxis)and risks; at what age children can begin the program; and what if my children are partially vaccinated. I encourage you to call me with your questions at 612-824-7808. Once your questions have been addressed, we will set up an appointment to get started. At this appointment we will review the HP protocol, officially register your family into the program, go over nuts and bolts so you know exactly how to give the remedies, and discuss any additional questions you have.

This survey of over 6oo children, collects mothers' reports on the health of their biological children ages 6-12 years old. Key study findings include: Vaccinated children were significantly less likely than the unvaccinated to have been diagnosed with chickenpox and pertussis, but significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with other infections, allergies and developmental disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and/or a learning disability.
