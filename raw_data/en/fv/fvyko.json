As this problem declined globally, the purpose of distributing them changed to the reduction of young child mortality. However, their impact on this has also declined, if not disappeared, as suggested in India by the enormous DEVTA study. This may be because of improved protection against and treatment of the main morbidity involved, measles and diarrhea. At the same time, semi-annual provision of mega-doses of vitamin A is not without risks, in particular linked to children's vaccination status. While a single dose is inexpensive, large-scale implementation of HDVA programs is expensive, particularly the opportunity cost involved in reducing the time health workers involved have to deal with their other commitments. Balancing potential benefits, risks and costs leads us to recommend an immediate cessation of the distribution of HDVA in India. Journal of Nutrition 2009 The American journal of clinical nutrition 2007 Vitamin A supplementation reduces morbidity and mortality in children living in areas endemic for vitamin A deficiency. Routine vitamin A supplementation usually starts only at age 9 mo, but high rates of illness and mortality are seen in the first months of life. The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vitamin A supplementation at the same time as routine vaccination in infants aged 1-3 mo. We recruited 780 newborn infants and their mothers to a randomized double-blind controlled trial in Ifakara in southern Tanzania. In one group, mothers received 60,000 microg vitamin A palmitate shortly after delivery, and their infants received 7500 microg at the same time as vaccinations given at approximately 1, 2, and 3 mo of age. In the other group, mothers received a second 60,000-microg dose when their infant was aged 1 mo, and their infants received 15,000 microg at the same time as the routine vaccinations. VAD was defined as a modified relative dose-respon... International Journal of Epidemiology 2014 The prevalence of vitamin A (VA) deficiency, which affects about one-third of children in developing countries, is falling only slowly. This is despite extensive distribution and administration of periodic (4- to 6-monthly) high-dose VA capsules over the past 20 years, now covering a reported 80% of children in developing countries. This massive programme was motivated largely by an expectation of reducing child mortality, stemming from findings in the 1980s and early 90s. Efficacy trials since 1994 have in most cases not confirmed a mortality impact of VA capsules. Only one large scale programme evaluation has ever been published, which showed no impact on 1-6-year-old mortality (the DEVTA trial, ending in 2003, in Uttar Pradesh, India). Periodic high-dose VA capsules may have less relevance now with changing disease patterns (notably, reductions in measles and diarrhoea). High-dose VA 6-monthly does not reduce prevalence of the deficiency itself, estimated by low serum retinol. It is proposed that: (i) there is no longer any evidence that intermittent high-dose VA programmes are having any substantial mortality effect, perhaps due to changing disease patterns; (ii) frequent intakes of vitamin A in physiological doses \u2014e.g. through food-based approaches, including fortification, and through regular low-dose supplementation\u2014are highly effective in increasing serum retinol (SR) and reducing vitamin A deficiency; (iii) therefore a policy shift is needed, based on consideration of current evidence. A prudent phase-over is needed towards increasing frequent regular intakes of VA at physiological levels, daily or weekly, replacing the high-dose periodic capsule distribution programmes. Moving resources in this direction must happen sooner or later: it should be sooner. An evidence-based systematic review of vitamin A by the Natural Standard Research Collaboration consolidates the safety and efficacy data available in the scientific literature using a validated and reproducible grading rationale. This paper includes written and statistical analysis of clinical trials, plus a compilation of expert opinion, folkloric precedent, history, pharmacology, kinetics/dynamics, interactions, adverse effects, toxicology, and dosing.
