There are currently no satisfactory pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments for FM. New cost-effective strategies that reduce musculoskeletal pain and improve emotional and physical functioning as well as quality of life in people with FM are urgently needed. Tai Chi is a traditional Chinese discipline with both physical and mental components that appears to benefit a variety of chronic conditions. The physical component provides exercise that is consistent with that recommended for FM (muscle conditioning and aerobic cardiovascular exercise), while the mental component has the potential to improve psychological well-being. These effects are especially pertinent for the treatment of individuals with FM. This is a pilot randomized controlled trial of Tai Chi for fibromyalgia. We plan to enroll 60 patients with fibromyalgia over a two year period. Participants are randomized to either a Tai Chi program or an attention control intervention. Assessments are performed at baseline, week 12 and week 24. This study will provide preliminary data on the potential acceptability and safety of Tai Chi for FM and will help guide the design of a future large-scale study of the efficacy of this alternative therapy. |Study Chi Intervention | The tai chi intervention took place twice a week for 12 weeks, and each session lasted for 60 minutes. Classes were taught by a tai chi master with more than 20 years of teaching experience. In the first session, he explained the theory behind tai chi and its procedures and provided participants with printed materials on its principles and techniques. In subsequent sessions, participants practiced 10 forms from the classic Yang style of tai chi 18 under his instruction. Each session included a warm-up and self-massage, followed by a review of principles, movements, breathing techniques, and relaxation in tai chi. Throughout the intervention period, participants were instructed to practice tai chi at home for at least 20 minutes each day. At the end of the 12-week intervention, participants were encouraged to maintain their tai chi practice, using an instructional DVD, up until the follow-up visit at 24 weeks. | Behavioral: Tai Chi Intervention | The tai chi intervention took place twice a week for 12 weeks, and each session lasted for 60 minutes.

Stretches involved the upper body, trunk, and lower body and were held for 15 to 20 seconds. Participants were instructed to practice stretching at home for 20 minutes a day. | Behavioral: Control Intervention | Our wellness education and stretching program similarly included 60-minute sessions held twice a week for 12 weeks.19 At each session, a variety of health professionals provided a 40-minute didactic lesson on a topic relating to fibromyalgia, including the diagnostic criteria; coping strategies and problem-solving techniques; diet and nutrition; sleep disorders and fibromyalgia; pain management, therapies, and medications; physical and mental health; exercise; and wellness and lifestyle management.20 For the final 20 minutes of each class, participants practiced stretching exercises supervised by the research staff.

Categories include the intensity of pain, physical functioning, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, depression, anxiety, job difficulty, and overall well-being.21 The total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. - Mean Change From Baseline of VAS Physicians' Global Assessment of Fibromyalgia Severity [ Time Frame: Wks 12 ]Physicians' global assessment score was assessed separately by the study physician, who was unaware of the group assignment, with the use of a visual-analogue scale (VAS) (range, 0 to 10,with higher scores indicating greater pain). - Mean Change From Baseline of Patient's Global Assessment Score [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ]Patients' global assessment score was assessed separately by the participant, who was unaware of the group assignment, with the use of a visual-analogue scale (VAS) (range, 0 to 10,with higher scores indicating greater pain). - Mean Change From Baseline PSQI Score [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ]The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report measure of sleep quality(range, 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality) - Mean Change From Baseline of 6-Minute Walk Test [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] - Mean Change From Baseline SF-36 Score Physical Component [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ]The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component is the summary score for the physical quality-of-life components (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status) - Mean Change From Baseline SF-36 Score Mental Component [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ]The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Mental Component is the summary score for the mental quality-of-life components (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status) - Mean Change From Baseline CES-D Score [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ]The Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CES-D) Depression Scale (range, 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe depression), is a self-report measure of depressive symptoms. - Mean Change From Baseline CPSS Score [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ]The Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (CPSS) is a self-report score measuring self-efficacy with respect to chronic pain (range, 1 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy).
