Our Unique Approach to Chiropractic Care Traditional chiropractic techniques are focused on segmented mobilization of the spine with no corrective component. At Annapolis Pain Management, we take a more holistic approach to your pain, addressing not only the area of complaint but also the surrounding soft tissue and other joints that may be contributing to your condition. We focus on reducing our patients pain quickly and then take it a step further by looking to create measurable change in posture, functional movement screens, disability index's and more. Examination Our doctors will begin with a thorough examination of your area of complaint as well as your spinal alignment, posture, and level of ability to function with daily activities.If images are needed they can be taken in our office or we will order them through an imaging center. Our long term goal for our patients is to keep them out of pain, we do this through correcting their underlying issues as well as giving our patients the tools they need to self-manage their condition(s). Treatment Plan Once we identify the source of your problem your chiropractor will create a customized treatment plan focused on getting you out of pain as soon as possible. Treatment plans often consist of chiropractic adjustments, exercises for mobility as well as strengthening, posture work, durable medical equipment, and modalities geared towards speeding up the healing process. We measure changes through pre and post posture and radiographic (x-ray) assessment, Functional Movement Screening (FMS), and disability index's. Techniques Used by our Annapolis Chiropractors to Promote Spine Health Manual Adjustment A foundation adjustment technique, called diversified adjusting, involves a manual adjustment that restores movement to the spine or extremity joint. This is the most widely used type of adjustment and is what is commonly understood as a chiropractic adjustment. Instrument Adjustment For our patients who are concerned about hearing any \"popping\" or \"cracking\" during their adjustment, oftentimes we will utilize an instrument to help get movement in the spine with no noise other than the equipment itself. It is a very low force technique which is also great for our older population who may not tolerate manual manipulation treatments. Drop Table A full-spine adjusting technique that emphasizes high speed and low force using an adjusting table with a segmented drop system. This technique allows us to get movement in the spine even when your muscles are very tight or in spasm with little to no discomfort. Dry Needling Therapy Dry needling helps to reduce muscle pain caused by trigger points. Trigger points are bands of tissue or \"knots\" that have formed in the muscle and can be very painful. Dry needling helps the knotted up tissue to relax and be less painful. This is a great drug free option for pain relief. Deep Tissue Laser We offer Class IV Deep Tissue Laser as part of our pain relief services. It is highly effective at assisting in the healing process for a wide variety of both acute and chronic conditions. Spinal Decompression Therapy Spinal decompression therapy can help reduce back pain, neck pain, radiating pain, and nerve pain associated with bulging discs, disc herniations, failed surgery, arthritis, sciatica, spinal degeneration, and more. Conditions Treated With Chiropractic Care A wide variety of conditions can be treated with chiropractic care. For some of these conditions chiropractic adjustments are indicated and for others the doctor will be more focused on treatment plans consisting of soft tissue manual work, exercises, and modalities. Some of the most common conditions we treat are: Small Joint Pain (hands, toes etc) Medium Joint Pain (knee, shoulder, elbow, ankle etc) Large Joint Pain (hip etc) ... and more! Prenatal Chiropractic Care During pregnancy a woman's body is changing drastically each day in preparation for delivery and to accommodate a growing baby! Our chiropractors use gentle and effective techniques to help minimize the strain on the mother's body and to keep her as comfortable as possible throughout her pregnancy. Oftentimes pregnant women will suffer from back pain, neck pain, pelvic pain, hip pain, rib pain, and round ligament pain. All of these things can be addressed by the Chiropractors. Treatment for a pregnant woman is truly tailored to the individual being treated. Typically if adjustments are recommended low force techniques are used like instrument adjusting and drop-table. Positioning of the patient can also vary depending if the mother-to-be is safe and comfortable lying on her back or if she is most comfortable seated. For some patients laying face down on the therapy table is possible using pregnancy pillows designed to support a growing belly. Not only will our Doctors focus on keeping the expectant mother as comfortable as possible throughout pregnancy but they will also work to help maintain as much balance in her changing body to provide an optimal environment for the baby's position in the womb. FAQs About Chiropractic Care A Chiropractor is a Doctor of Chiropractic who specializes in treating musculoskeletal conditions through adjustments/manipulation/mobilization of a joint. Their training also allows them to take x-rays and interpret them as well as provide full physical therapy services if they have completed the additional training and passed their Physical Therapy National Board Exam. All of our Doctors of Chiropractic at APM are highly skilled at performing adjustments, physical therapy, and have proficiency in taking and reading radiographic images (X-rays). Some patients will experience immediate relief after an adjustment while others may experience some soreness (similar to a hard workout). Just like most other treatments that are aimed at fixing a problem versus covering it up, it is the cumulative effect of chiropractic adjustments that leads to a long term positive outcome for a patient. False! However we do find that patients who have received Chiropractic care in the past are more aware of their bodies and in-tune to subtle hints that may be signaling that things are \"off\". For instance tightening across the lower back, decreased range of motion, difficulty maintaining proper posture etc. are all subtle hints that could indicate that your body is not moving like it should be and may make someone who is familiar with chiropractic inclined to come in for treatment.
