Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 1 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 General This HEALTH AND SAFETY PLAN (HASP ) was developed to address disturbance of known and reasonably anticipated subsurface contaminants and comply with Occupationa l Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard 29 CFR 1910.120(b )(4), Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response during anticipated site work for the properties defined as 125 3rd Street in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn , New York (the Site). The Site is defined by Block 462, Lots 6, 8, 42 and 44 on the Brooklyn Borough Tax Map. This HASP provides the minimum requirements for implementing site operations during future remedial measure activities. All contrac tors performing work on this site shall implement their own HASP that, at a minimum, adhere s to this HASP . The contractor is responsible for their own health and safety and that of their subcontractors. Langan personnel will implement this HASP while onsite. The management of the d ay-to-day site activities and implementation of this HASP in the field is the responsibility of the site Langan Field Team Leader (FTL) . Assistance in the implementation of this HASP can also be obtained from the Langan Health and Safety Officer (HSO) and the Langan Health and Safety Manager (HSM ). Contractors operating on the site shall designate their own FTL, HSO and HSM. The content of this HASP may change or undergo revision based upon additional information made available to health and safety perso nnel, monitoring results, o r changes in the work plan . 1.2 Site Location and Background The 20,175 square -foot Site includes Lots 6, 8, 42 and 55 of Block 462 in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Lot 6 is improved with a warehouse with open air parking adjoining the w arehouse to the north and south. Lot 8 is improved with vacant warehouse. Lots 42 is improved with a warehouse, and Lot 44 is occupied by a van rental company. Previous site uses included brewing and bottling (1915 -1938) and p rivate garages (1950 -2007). A Site Location Map is included as Figure 1. 1.3 Summary of Work Tasks 1.3.1 Geophysical Investigation Prior to the commencement of intrusive field activities (i.e., soil borings); a geophysical consultant may conduct a geoph ysical survey using ground penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic detection equipment. Langan personnel will coordinate the geophysical survey. The objective Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 2 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 of the survey will be to identify any underground storage tank (UST) structures, drains, underground utilities, and other subsurface anomalies that may be encountered during the investigation. During this time Langan personnel will inspect the site and confirm sample locations. 1.3.2 Hand Clearing of Borehole Locations If there is no geophysic al survey for utility clearance or the results of the geophysical survey are inconclusive at specific locations subject to intrusive work, the contractor may hand clear each location to confirm utilities or other known or suspected subsurface structures . Hand clearing of a soil boring location should extend to a depth of 5 -feet and be about 1.5 times the anticipated diameter of the borehole when drilled. Lang an personnel will confirm that hand clearing activities are completed to these specifications . 1.3.3 Soil Investigation and Sampling Langan will retain a drilling contractor to advance soil borings to a depth below grade surface (bgs) specified in the work plan. Borings will be installed at the approximate locations indicated in Langan's work plan, but may be moved in the field based on utility clearance and accessibility. The drilling contractor will contact the appropriate utility mark -out authority and make available to their drilling staff the verification number and effective dates. Langan wil l record the verification number and effective dates from the drillers. Langan will also note the location of marked out utilities on the site plan and scan the data into the project folder. Langan personnel will screen soil for visual, olfactory, and ins trumental indicators suggestive of a potential petroleum release. Instrument screening for the presence of volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) may be performed with a duly field -calibrated photoionization detector (PID) (or equivalent). Langan personnel wi ll collect soil samples from the proposed soil boring locations following the sampling plan outlined in the work plan. The borings will be filled with clean soil cuttings , clean sand or bentonite grout and capped at grade to match the surrounding surface after samples are collected. Soil samples will be submitted to a New York State Department of Health ( NYSDOH ) Environmental Laboratory Approval Program (ELAP) -certified laboratory and analyzed in accordance with work plan specifications. 1.3.4 Groundwater Investigation and Sampling Selected soil borings will be converted into groundwater monitoring wells and sampled to evaluate groundwater quality. Groundwater samples will be collected from one or more of the Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 3 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 new and if available, pre -existing monitoring w ells in accordance with the Langan Low Flow Groundwater Sampling SOP (SOP #12). Groundwater samples will be submitted to an approved laboratory and analyzed for constituents as specified in the work plan.

The sub -slab points may be installed using an electric hammer drill to advan ce small diameter borings through the concrete (or equivalent) slab as defined in the work plan. The borings will terminate in and sample from the gravel substrate below the slab. Conditions in the field may require adjustment of sampling locations. Lang an personnel (or contractor) will install VaporPin\u00ae vapor points (or equivalent) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If no point is used, Langan (or contractor) will set a sampling tube defined as an open ended Teflon -lined polyethylene t ubing (or equivalent tubing as approved by the project manager [PM]) . The sampling tube will be set either within the base of the concrete slab or within the support gravel underlying the slab. When using the VaporPin\u00ae or equivalent, the installation sl eeve will provide the necessary annulus seal required for subsequent sampling. However, if a sampling tube as defined above is use, t he annulus at the top of the concrete slab will be filled with bentonite or food grade clay to seal the slab. A sand pack is not required for sub -slab vapor sampling . Unless specified by the work plan, the sub slab points are temporary and will be pulled after the sampling event and the hole will be patched at grade with material similar to the surrounding surface. Langan p ersonnel will confirm that the soil vapor points (implants) are approximately 2 -inches in length constructed of polyethylene material and are connected to the surface by Teflon -line polyethylene material (equivalent materials for the point and tubing are acceptable as approved by the PM). The annulus around the implant will be filled with clean sand to 6-inches above the implant . A 1-foot b entonite slurry will be applied to the top of the sand up to seal the sampling points. The remaining soil vapor poi nt annulus may be backfilled with clean cuttings are sand to grade. Unless specified by the work plan, the vapor points are temporary and will be pulled after Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 4 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 the sampling event and the hole will be patched at grade with material similar to the surroundin g surface.

Monitoring frequency should increase as ambient temperature increases or as slow recovery rates are observed. Refer to the Table 7 to assist in assessing when the risk for heat related illness is likely. To use this table, the ambient temperature and relative humidity must be obtained (a regional weather report should suffice). Heat stress m onitoring should be performed by the HSO or the FTL, who shall be able to recognize symptoms related to heat stress. To monitor the workers, be familiar with the following heat -related disorders and their symptoms: Heat Cramps : Painful spasm of arm, leg o r abdominal muscles, during or after work Heat Exhaustion : Headache, nausea, dizziness ; cool, clammy, moist skin ; heavy sweating ; weak, fast pulse ; shallow respiration, normal temperature Heat Stroke : Headache, nausea, weakness, hot dry skin, fever, rapi d strong pulse, rapid deep respirations, loss of consciousness, convulsions, coma. This is a life threatening condition . Do not permit a worker to wear a semi -permeable or impermeable garment when they are showing signs or symptoms of heat -related illne ss. To monitor the worker, measure: Heart rate : Count the radial pulse during a 30 -second period as early as possible in the rest period. If the heart rate exceeds 100 beats per minute at the beginning of the rest period, shorten the next work cycle by o ne-third and keep the rest period the same. If the heart rate still exceeds 100 beats per minute at the next rest period, shorten the following work cycle by one -third. A worker cannot return to work after a rest period until their heart rate is below 10 0 beats per minute. Oral temperature : Use a clinical thermometer (3 minutes under the tongue) or similar device to measure the oral temperature at the end of the work period (before drinking). If oral temperature exceeds 99.6 \u00b0F (37.6 \u00b0C), shorten the next work cycle by one -third without changing the rest period. A worker cannot return to work after a rest period until their oral temperature is below 99.6 \u00b0F. If oral temperature still exceeds 99.6 \u00b0F (37.6 \u00b0C) at the beginning of the next rest period, shorte n the following cycle by one -third. Do not Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 14 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 permit a worker to wear a semi -permeable or impermeable garment when oral temperature exceeds 100.6 \u00b0F (38.1 \u00b0C). Prevention of Heat Stress - Proper training and preventative measures will aid in averting loss of worker productivity and serious illness. Heat stress prevention is particularly important because once a person suffers from heat stroke or heat exhaustion, that person may be predisposed to additional heat related illness. To avoid heat stress the follow ing steps should be taken: Adjust work schedules. Mandate work slowdowns as needed. Perform work during cooler hours of the day if possible or at night if adequate lighting can be provided. Provide shelter (air -conditioned, if possible) or shaded areas to protect personnel during rest periods. Maintain worker's body fluids at normal levels. This is necessary to ensure that the cardiovascular system functions adequately. Daily fluid intake must approximately equal the amount of water lost in sweat, id., ei ght fluid ounces (0.23 liters) of water must be ingested for approximately every eight ounces (0.23 kg) of weight lost. The normal thirst mechanism is not sensitive enough to ensure that enough water will be drunk to replace lost sweat. When heavy sweati ng occurs, encourage the worker to drink more. The following strategies may be useful: o Maintain water temperature 50 \u00b0 to 60 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0 to 16.6 \u00b0C). o Provide small disposal cups that hold about four ounces (0.1 liter). o Have workers drink 16 ounces (0.5 liters) o f fluid (preferably water or dilute drinks) before beginning work. o Urge workers to drink a cup or two every 15 to 20 minutes, or at each monitoring break. A total of 1 to 1.6 gallons (4 to 6 liters) of fluid per day are recommended, but more may be necess ary to maintain body weight. o Train workers to recognize the symptoms of heat related illness. 3.3.3 Cold -Related Illness If work on this project begins in the winter months, thermal injury due to cold exposure can become a problem for field personnel. Sys temic cold exposure is referred to as hypothermia. Local cold exposure is generally called frostbite. Hypothermia - Hypothermia is defined as a decrease in the patient core temperature below 96 oF. The body temperature is normally maintained by a combinat ion of central (brain and spinal cord) and peripheral (skin and muscle) activity. Interference with any of these mechanisms can result in hypothermia, even in the absence of what normally is Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 15 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 considered a \"cold\" ambient temperature. Symptoms of hypothermi a shivering, apathy, listlessness, sleepiness, and unconsciousness. Frostbite - Frostbite is both a general and medical term given to areas of local cold injury. Unlike systemic hypothermia, frostbite rarely occurs unless the ambient temperature s are less than freezing and usually less than 20 \u00b0F. Symptoms of frostbite are: a sudden blanching or whitening of the skin; the skin has a waxy or white appearance and is firm to the touch; tissues are cold, pale, and solid. Prevention of Cold-Related Illness - To prevent cold -related illness: Educate workers to recognize the symptoms of frostbite and hypothermia Identify and limit known risk factors: Assure the availability of enclosed, heated environment on or adjacent to the site. Assure the availabil ity of dry changes of clothing. Assure the availability of warm drinks. Start (oral) temperature recording at the job site: At the FSO or Field Team Leader's discretion when suspicion is based on changes in a worker's performance or mental status. At a wor ker's request. As a screening measure, two times per shift, under unusually hazardous conditions (e.g., wind -chill less than 20 \u00b0F, or wind -chill less than 30 \u00b0F with precipitation). As a screening measure whenever anyone worker on the site develops hypother mia. Any person developing moderate hypothermia (a core temperature of 92 \u00b0F) cannot return to work for 48 hours. 3.3.4 Noise Work activities during the proposed activities may be conducted at locations with high noise levels from the operation of equipment . Hearing protection will be used as necessary. 3.3.5 Hand and Power Tools The use of hand and power tools can present a variety of hazards, including physical harm from being struck by flying objects, being cut or struck by the tool, fire, and electrocut ion. All hand and power tools should be inspected for health and safety hazards prior to use. If deemed unserviceable/un -operable, notify supervisor and tag equipment out of service. Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCI) are required for all power to ols requiring direct electrical service. Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 16 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 3.3.6 Slips, Trips and Fall Hazards Care should be exercised when walking at the site, especially when carrying equipment. The presence of surface debris, uneven surfaces, pits, facility equipment, and soil piles c ontribute to tripping hazards and fall hazards. To the extent possible, all hazards should be identified and marked on the site, with hazards communicated to all workers in the area. 3.3.7 Utilities (Electrocution and Fire Hazards) 3.3.7.1 Utility Clearan ce The possibility of encountering underground utilities poses fire, explosion, and electrocution hazards. All excavation work will be preceded by review of available utility drawings and by notification of the subsurface work to the N.Y. One -Call--Cent er. 3.3.7.2 Lockout -Tagout The potential adverse effects of electrical hazards include burns and electrocution, which could result in death. Therefore, there is a procedure that establishes the requirements for the lockout/tagout (LOTO) of energy isolat ing devices in accordance with the OSHA electrical lockout and tagging requirements as specified in 29 CFR 1926.417. This procedure will be used to ensure that all machines and equipment are isolated from potentially hazardous energy. If possible, equipm ent that could cause injury due to unexpected energizing, start -up, or release of stored energy will be locked/tagged, before field personnel perform work activities. Depending upon the specific work task involved, Langan's SSC or FTL will serve as the au thorized lockout/tagout coordinator, implement the lockout/tagout procedure and will be responsible to locate, lock and tag valves, switches, etc. SPECIAL NOTE: Project personnel will assume that all electrical equipment at surface, subsurface and overh ead locations is energized, until equipment has been designated and confirmed as de -energized by a utility company representative. Langan will notify the designated utility representative prior to working adjacent to this equipment and will verify that th e equipment is energized or de -energized in the vicinity of the work location. No project work shall be performed by Langan personnel or subcontractors on or near energized electrical lines or equipment unless hazard assessments are completed in writing, reviewed by Langan's SSHO, and clearly communicated to the field personnel. The FTL shall conduct a survey to locate and identify all energy isolating devices. They shall be certain which switches, valves or other isolating devices apply to the equipment . The Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 17 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 lockout/tagout procedure involves, but is not limited to, electricity, motors, steam, natural gas, compressed air, hydraulic systems, digesters, sewers, etc. 3.3.8 Physical Hazard Considerations for Material Handling There are moderate to severe r isks associated with moving heavy objects at the Site. The following physical hazards should be considered when handling materials at the Site: Heavy objects will be lifted and moved by mechanical devices rather than manual effort whenever possible. The m echanical devices will be appropriate for the lifting of moving task and will be operated only by trained and authorized personnel. Objects that require special handling or rigging will only be moved under the guidance of a person who has been specifically trained to move such objects. Lifting devices will be inspected, certified, and labeled to confirm their weight capacities. Defective equipment will be taken out of service immediately and repaired or destroyed. The wheels of any trucks being loaded or u nloaded will be chocked to prevent movement. Outriggers will be fully extended on a flat, firm surface during operation. Personnel will not pass under a raised load, nor will a suspended load be left unattended. Personnel will not be carried on lifting e quipment, unless it is specifically designed to carry passengers. All reciprocating, rotating, or other moving parts will be guarded at all times. Accessible fire extinguishers, currently (monthly) inspected, will be available in all mechanical lifting dev ices. Verify all loads/materials are secure before transportation. Material handling tasks that are unusual or require specific guidance will need a written addendum to this HASP . The addendum must identify the lifting protocols before the tasks are perfo rmed. Upon approval, the plan must be reviewed with all affected employees and documented. Any deviation from a written plan will require approval by the Langan HSM. 3.3.9 Hearing Conservation Under the construction industry standard, the maximum permiss ible occupational noise exposure is 90 dbA (8 -hour TWA), and noise levels in excess of 90 dbA must be reduced through feasible administrative and engineering controls (20 CFR 1926.52). Hearing protection is required when working within 15 feet of vacuum e xtraction equipment and drill rigs. Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 18 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 3.3.9 Open Water Employees working over or near water, where the danger of drowning exists, shall be provided with U.S. Coast Guard -approved life jackets or buoyant work vests. Prior to and after each use, the buoyant work vests or life preservers shall be inspected for defects which would alter their strength or buoyancy. Defective units shall not be used. And should a worker fall into the water, OSHA requires (29 CFR 1926.106(c)) that ring buoys with at least 90 fee t of line shall be provided and readily available for emergency rescue operations. The distance between ring buoys shall not exceed 200 feet. Another remedial action required by OSHA (29 CFR 1926.106(d)) is the use of lifesaving skiffs. OSHA requires th at at least one lifesaving skiff shall be immediately available at locations where employees are working over or adjacent to water and must include the following provisions. The skiff must be in the water or capable of being quickly launched by one person . At least one person must be present and specifically designated to respond to water emergencies and operate the skiff at all times when there are employees above water. When the operator is on break another operator must be designated to provide requis ite coverage when there are employees above water. The designated operator must either have the skiff staffed at all times or have someone remain in the immediate area such that the operator can quickly reach the skiff and perform rescue services. The sk iff operator maybe assigned other tasks provided the tasks do not interfere with the operator's ability to quickly reach the skiff. A communication system, such as a walkie -talkie, must be used to inform the skiff operator of an emergency and to inform th e skiff operator where the skiff is needed. The skiff must be equipped with both a motor and oars. With regard to the number of skiffs required and the appropriate maximum response time, the following factors must be evaluated: The number of work locati ons where there is a danger of falling into water; The distance to each of those locations; Water temperature and currents; Other hazards such as, but not limited to, rapids, dams, and water intakes; Other regulations that present S&H practices and PPE for work on or near water include: 29 CFR 1910, Subpart T (401 - 440) Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 19 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 3.4 Biological Hazards 3.4.1 Animals There is a possibility of encountering wildlife including reptiles, rodents and other small and medium size mammals. The Langan personnel is to av oid interacting with any wildlife. 3.4.2 Insects Ticks and other biting or stinging insects may to be encountered during site operations. Langan personnel should take necessary precautions including donning long sleeve shirts and insecticide to prevent bi tes and stings. After field work, Langan personnel should perform a complete visual inspection of their clothing to insure they are not inadvertently harboring ticks. If they do observe a tick bite, they are to contact the HSM or HSO and report the event . 3.4.3 Plants Poisonous plants may to be encountered during site operations. Langan personnel should take necessary precautions including donning long sleeve shirts and applying preventative poison Ivy/Sumac lotion to prevent or limit effects of exposure . If after field work, Langan employees do observe a reaction to poisonous plant exposure, they are to contact the HSM or HSO and report the event. 3.4.4 Coronavirus 3.4.4.1 General Preventative Measures Field personnel must follow general proper hygiene measures while in the field including: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Cover cough or sneeze with tissue, and throw in trash. Wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds after going to bathroom, before eating, after blowing nose, coughing or s neezing. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Avoid physical contact with other people (e.g., no handshakes). Maintain a safe distance of at least 6 feet from other people (social distancing). Wear face coveri ngs when around other worker to minimize spread of COVID -19. (May Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 20 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 be required in certain states or locations.) 3.4.4.2 Construction Trailers Employees should avoid use of shared construction trailers or where employees cannot maintain a safe distance (mi nimum 6 feet) from other workers. If trailer use is needed, areas such as desks, phones, chairs and other common areas, should be cleaned and disinfected before and after use. Protocols should be developed to minimize trailer use to essential personal, r estrict use from any workers who are ill or showing symptoms of being ill, and ensure a safe distance of 6 feet can be established between workers. 3.4.4.3 Communication Include Coronavirus topics and prevention topics in daily tailgate meetings to ensur e Coronavirus awareness is communicated daily. Discussions can focus on general topics including: social distancing, prevention measures for field personnel, signs and symptoms and recent news on the Coronavirus. Site -specific topics should include minimi zing face -to-face contact, disinfecting/sterilizing field equipment, use of PPE to reduce exposure, site security and other potential exposure issues/concerns. 3.4.4.4 Sick/Ill Workers No Langan employee is permitted to be onsite when ill and/or showing po tential symptoms of the Coronavirus. Symptoms of the Coronavirus may appear 2 -14 days after exposure and can range from mild to severe. The most common symptoms include: fever, fatigue, dry cough and shortness of breath. If an employee or subcontractor is observed being ill or exhibiting symptoms of Coronavirus, employees must immediately utilize their Stop Work Authority and contact their project manager to address the situation. If an employee observes another worker onsite exhibiting symptoms of Corona virus, immediately utilize Stop Work Authority and notify their project manager and site construc tion manager or safety officer. Work should resume when the safety and health of Langan and subcontractors is adequately addressed. 3.5 Additional Safety Anal ysis 3.5.1 Presence of Non -Aqueous Phase Liquids (NAPL) There is potential for exposure to NAPL at this site. Special care and PPE should be considered when NAPL is observed as NAPL is a typically flammable fluid and release s VOCs known to be toxic and/or carcinogenic. If NAPL is present in a monitoring well, vapors from the well casing may contaminate the work area breathing zone with concentrations of VOCs potentially exceed ing health and safety action levels. In addition, all equipment used to monitor or sample Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 21 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 NAPL (or ground water from wells containing NAPL) must be intrinsically safe. Equipment that directly contacts NAPL must also be resistant to organic solvents. At a minimum, a PID should be used to monitor for VOCs when NAPL is observed. If NAPL is expected to be observed in an excavation or enclosed area, air monitoring must be started using calibrated air monitoring equipment designed to sound an audio alarm when atmospheric concentrations of VOC are within 10% of the LEL. In normal atmosp heric oxygen concentrations, the LEL monitoring may be done with a Wheatstone bridge/catalytic bead type sensor (i.e. MultiRAE). However in oxygen depleted atmospheres (confined space), only an LEL designed to work in low oxygen environments may be used. Best practices require that the LEL monitoring unit be equipped with a long sniffer tube to allow the LEL unit to remain outside the UST excavation. When NAPL is present, Langan personnel are required to use disposable nitrile gloves at all times to pre vent skin contact with contaminated materials. They should also consider having available a respirator and protective clothing (Tyvek\u00ae overalls), especially if NAPL is in abundance and there are high concentrations of VOCs. All contaminated disposables in cluding PPE and sampling equipment must be properly disposed of in labeled 55 -gallon drums 3.6 Job Safety Analysis A Job Safety A nalysis (JSA) is a process to identify existing and potential hazards associated with each job or task so these hazards can be elimin ated, controlled or minimized. A JSA will be performed at the beginning of each work day, and additionally whenever an employee begins a new task or moves to a new location. All JSA s must be developed and reviewed by all parties involved. A blank JSA form and documentation of completed JSAs are in Attachment G. 4.0 PERSONNEL TRAINING 4.1 Basic Training Completion of an initial 40 -hour HAZWOPER training program as detailed in OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.120(e) is required for all employees working on a site enga ged in hazardous substance removal or other activities which expose or potentially expose workers to hazardous substances, health hazards, or safety hazards as defined by 29 CFR 1910.120(a). Annual 8-hour refresher training is also required to maintain co mpetencies to ensure a safe work environment. In addition to these training requirements, all employees must complete the OSHA 10 hour Construction Safety and Health training and supervisory personnel must also receive eight additional hours of Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 22 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 specialize d management training. Training records are maintained by the HSM . 4.2 Initial Site-Specific Training Training will be provided to specifically address the activities, procedures, m onitoring, and equipment for site operations at the beginning of each fiel d mobilization and the beginning of each discrete phase of work . The training will include the site and facility layout, hazards, and emergency services at the site, and will detail all the provisions contained within this HASP . For a HAZWOPER operation, training on the site must be for a minimum of 3 days. Specific issues that will be addressed include the hazards described in Section 3.0. 4.3 Tailgate Safety Briefings Before starting work each da y or as needed , the Langan HS O will conduct a brief t ailgate safety meeting to assist site personnel in conducting their activities safely. Tailgate meetings will be documented in Attachment H. Briefings will include the following: Work plan for the day ; Review of safety information relevant to planned tasks a nd environmental conditions ; New activities/task being conducted; Results of Jobsite Safety Inspection Checklist; Changes in work practices ; Safe work practices; and Discussion and remedies for noted or observed deficiencies. 5.0 MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE All pers onnel who will be performing field work involving potential exposure to toxic and hazardous substances (defined by 29 CFR 1910.120 (a)) will be required to have passed an initial baseline medical examination, with follow -up medical exams thereafter, consist ent with 29 CFR 1910.120(f). Medical evaluations will be performed by, or under the direction of, a physician board -certified in occupational medicine. Additionally, personnel who may be required to perform work while wearing a respirator must receive med ical clearance as required under CFR 1910.134(e), Respiratory Protection . Medical evaluations will be performed by, or under the direction of, a physician board -certified in occupational medicine. Results of medical evaluations are maintained by the HSM . Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 23 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 6.0 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE E QUIPMENT 6.1 Levels of Protection Langan will provide PPE to Langan employees to protect them from the specific hazards they are likely to encounter on -site. Direct hired contractors will provide their employees with equivalent PPE to protect them from the specific hazards likely to be encountered on -site. Selection of the appropriate PPE must take into consideration: (1) identification of the hazards or suspected hazards; (2) potential exposure routes; and, (3) the performance of t he PPE construction (materials and seams) in providing a barrier to these hazards. Based on anticipated site conditions and the proposed work activities t o be performed at the site , Level D protection will be used . The upgrading/downgrading of the level o f protection will be based on continuous air monitoring results as described in Section 6 .0 (when applicable) . The decision to modify standard PPE will be made by the site HSO or FTL after conferring with the PM. The levels of protection are described be low. Level D Protection (as needed) Safety glasses w ith side shields or chemical splash goggles Safety boots/shoes Coveralls (Tyvek\u00ae or equivalent) Hard hat Long sleeve work shirt and work pants Nitrile gloves Hearing protection Reflective safety vest Leve l D Protection (Modified, as needed) Safety glasses with sideshields or chemical splash goggles Safety boots/shoes (toe -protected) Disposable chemical -resistant boot covers Coveralls (polycoated Tyvek or equivalent to be worn when contact with wet contamin ated soil, groundwater, or non -aqueous phase liquids is anticipated) Hard hat Long sleeve work shirt and work pants Nitrile gloves Hearing protection (as needed) Personal floatation device (for work within 5 f eet of the water) Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 24 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 Reflective traffic vest Level C Protection (as needed) Full or Half face, air -purifying respirator , with NIOSH approved HEPA filter Inner (latex) and outer (nitrile) chemical -resistant glove s Safety glasses with side shields or chemical splash goggles Chemical -resistant safety boots/s hoes Hard hat Long sleeve work shirt and work pants Coveralls (Tyvek\u00ae or equivalent) Hearing protection (as needed) Reflective safety vest The action levels used in determining the necessary levels of respiratory prote ction and upgrading to Level C are su mmarized in Table 4. The written Respiratory Protection Program is maintained by the HSM and is available if needed. The monitoring procedures and equ ipment are outlined in Section 6 .0 (when applicable) . 6.2 Respirator Fit -Test All Langan employees who may be exposed to hazardous substances at the work site are in possession of a full - or half -face, air -purifying respirator and have been successfully fit -tested within the past year. Fit-test records are maintained by the HSM . 6.3 Respirator Cartridge Cha nge-Out Schedule Respiratory protection is required to be worn when certain action levels (table 2) are reached. A respirator cartridge change -out schedule has been developed in order to comply with 29 CFR 1910.134. The respirator cartridge change -out sc hedule for this project is as follows: Cartridges shall be removed and disposed of at the end of each shift, when cartridges become wet or wearer experiences breakthrough, whichever occurs first. If the humidity exceeds 85%, then cartridges shall be remove d and disposed of after 4 hours of use. Respirators shall not be stored at the end of the shift with contaminated cartridges left on. Cartridges shall not be worn on the second day, no matter how short the time period was the previous day they were used. Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 25 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 7.0 AIR QUALITY MONITORIN G AND ACTION LEVELS 7.1 Monitoring During Site Operations Atmospheric air monitoring results may be collected and used to provide data to determine when exclusion zones need to be established and when certain levels of personal protect ive equipment are required. For all instruments there are Site -specific action level criteria which are used in making field health and safety determinations. Other data, such as the visible presence of contamination or the steady state nature of air con taminant concentration, are also used in making field health and safety decisions. Therefore, the HSO may establish an exclusion zone or require a person to wear a respirator even though atmospheric air contaminant concentrations are below established HASP action levels. During site work involving disturbance of petroleum -impacted or fill material, real time air monitoring may be conducted for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A photoionization detector (PID) and/or flame ionization detector (FID) will b e used to monitor concentrations of VOCs at personnel breathing -zone height. Air monitoring will be the responsibility of the HSO or designee. Air monitoring may be conducted during intrusive activities associated with the completion of excavation, debri s removal, and soil grading. All manufacturers' instructions for instrumentation and calibration will be available onsite. Subcontractors' air monitoring plans must be equal or more stringent as the Langan plan. An air monitoring calibration log is pro vided in Attachment D of this HASP . 7.1.1 Volatile Organic Compounds Monitoring with a PID, such as a MiniRAE 2000 (10.6v) or equivalent may occur during intrusive work in the AOCs. Colormetric Indicator Tubes for benzene may be used as backup for the P ID, if measurements remain above background monitor every 2 hours. The HSO will monitor the employee breathing zone at least every 30 minutes, or whenever there is any indication that concentrations may have changed (odors, visible gases, etc.) since the last measurement. If VOC levels are observed above 5 ppm for longer than 5 minutes or if the site PPE is upgraded to Level C, the HSO will begin monitoring the site perimeter at a location downwind of the AOC every 30 minutes in addition to the employee b reathing zone. Instrument action levels for monitored gases are provided in Table 4. Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 26 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 7.1.2 Metals Based upon the site historical fill, there is a potential for the soils to contain PAHs and metals. During invasive procedures which have the potential for creating airborne dust, such as excavation of dry soils, a real time airborne dust monitor such as a Mini -Ram may be used to monitor for air particulates. The HSO will monitor the employee breathing zone at least every 30 minutes, or whenever there is any indication that concentrations may have changed (appearance of visible dust) since the last measurement. If dust levels are ob served to be greater than 0.100 mg/m3 or visible dust is observed for longer than 15 minutes or if the site PPE is upgraded to Level C, the HSO will begin monitoring the site perimeter at a location downwind of the AOC every 30 minutes in addition to the employee breathing zone. Instrument action levels for dust monitoring are provided in Table 4. 7.2 Monitoring Equipment Calibrat ion and Maintenance Instrument calibration shall be documented and included in a dedicated safety and health logbook or on separate calibration pages of the field book. All instruments shall be calibrated before and after each shift. Calibration checks m ay be used during the day to confirm instrument accuracy. Duplicate readings may be taken to confirm individual instrument response. All instruments shall be operated in accordance with the manufacturers' specifications. Manufacturers' literature, includi ng an operations manual for each piece of monitoring equipment will be maintained on site by the HSO for reference. 7.3 Determination of Background Levels Background (BKD) levels for VOCs and dust will be established prior to intrusive activities within the AOC at an upwind location. A notation of BKD levels will be referenced in the daily monitoring log. BKD levels are a function of prevailing conditions. BKD levels will be taken in an appropriate upwind location as determined by the HSO. Table 4 lists the instrument action levels. 8.0 COMMUNITY AIR MONITOR ING PROGRAM Community air monitoring may be cond ucted in compliance with local standards or the g eneric CAMP outlined below: Monitoring for dust and odors will be conducted during all ground intrusive a ctivities by the FTL. Continuous monitoring on the perimeter of the work zones for odor, VOCs, and dust may be required for all ground intrusive activities such as soil excavation and handling activities. The Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 27 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 work zone is defined as the general area in w hich machinery is operating in support of remediation activities. A portable PID will be used to monitor the work zone and for periodic monitoring for VOCs during activities such as soil and groundwater sampling and .soil excavation . The site perimeter will be monitored for fugitive dust emissions by visual observations as well as instrumentation measurements (if required) . When required, p articulate or dust will be monitored continuously with real -time field instrumentation that will meet, at a minimum, the local standards or, default to the performance standards below: If VOC monitoring is required, t he following actions will be taken based on VOC levels measured: If total VOC levels exceed 5 ppm above background for the 15 -minute average at the perim eter, work activities will be temporarily halted and monitoring continued. If levels readily decrease (per instantaneous readings) below 5 ppm above background, work activities will resume with continued monitoring. If total VOC levels at the downwind p erimeter of the hot zone persist at levels in excess of 5 ppm above background but less than 25 ppm, work activities will be halted, the source of vapors identified, corrective actions taken to abate emissions, and monitoring continued. After these steps work activities will resume provided that the total organic vapor level 200 feet downwind of the hot zone or half the distance to the nearest potential receptor or residential/commercial structure, whichever is less - but in no case less than 20 feet, is b elow 5 ppm above background for the 15 -minute average. If the total VOC level is above 25 ppm at the perimeter of the hot zone, activities will be shut down . If dust monitoring with field instrumentation is required, t he following actions will be taken based on instrumentation measurements : If the downwind particulate level is 100 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m\u00b3) greater than background (upwind perimeter) for the 15 -minute period or if airborne dust is observed leaving the work area, then dust suppress ion must be employed. Work may continue with dust suppression techniques provided that downwind PM10 levels do not exceed 150 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 above the background level and provided that no visible dust is migrating from the work area. If, after implementation of d ust suppression techniques, downwind PM10 levels are greater than 150 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 above the background level, work must be stopped and a re - evaluation of activities initiated. Work can resume provided that dust suppression measures and other controls are succes sful in reducing the downwind PM10 concentration to within 150 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 of the upwind level and in preventing visible dust migration. Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 28 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 8.1 Dust Suppression Techniques Preventative measures for dust generation may include wetting site fill and soil, constructio n of an engineered construction entrance with gravel pad, a truck wash area, covering soils with tarps, and limiting vehicle speeds to five miles per hour. Work practices to minimize odors and vapors include limiting the time that the excavations remain open, minimizing stockpiling of contaminated -source soil, and minimizing the handling of contaminated material. Offending odor and organic vapor controls may include the application of foam suppressants or tarps over the odor or VOC source areas. Foam su ppressants may include biodegradable foams applied over the source material for short -term control of the odor and VOCs. If odors develop and cannot be otherwise controlled, additional means to eliminate odor nuisances will include: direct load -out of soi ls to trucks for off -site disposal; use of chemical odorants in spray or misting systems; and, use of staff to monitor odors in surrounding neighborhoods. Where odor nuisances have developed during remedial work and cannot be corrected, or where the releas e of nuisance odors cannot otherwise be avoided due to on -site conditions or close proximity to sensitive receptors, odor control will be achieved by sheltering excavation and handling areas under tented containment structures equipped with appropriate air venting/filtering systems. 9.0 WORK ZONES AND DECONTAMINATION 9.1 Site Control Work zones are intended to control the potential spread of contamination throughout the site and to assure that only authorized individuals are permitted into potentially hazardous areas. Any person working in an area where the potential for exposure to site contaminants exists will only be allowed access after providing the HSO with proper training and medical documentation. Exclusion Zone (EZ) - All activities which may involve exposure to site contaminants, hazardous materials and/or conditions should be considered an EZ. Decontamination of field equipment will also be conducted in the Contaminant Reduction Zone (CRZ) which will be located on the perimeter of the EZ. The EZ and the CRZ will be clearly delineated by cones, tapes or other means. The HSO may establish more than one EZ where different levels of protection may be employed or different hazards exist. The size of the EZ shall be determined by the HSO allowing Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 29 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 adequate space for the activity to be completed, field members and emergency equipment. 9.2 Contamination Zone 9.2.1 Personnel Decontamination Station Personal hygiene, coupled with diligent decontamination, will significantly reduce the potential for exposure. 9.2.2 Minimization of Contact with Contaminants During completion of all site activities, personnel should attempt to minimize the chance of contact with contaminated materials. This involves a conscientious effort to keep \"clean\" during site activities. All personnel should minimize kneeling, splash generation, and other physical contact with contamination as PPE is intended to minimize accidental contact. This may ultimately minimize the degree of decontamination required and the generation of waste mater ials from site operations. Field procedures will be developed to control over spray and runoff and to ensure that unprotected personnel working nearby are not affected. 9.2.3 Personnel Decontamination Sequence Decontamination may be performed by removing a ll PPE used in EZ and placing it in drums/trash cans at the CRZ. Baby wipes should be available for wiping hands and face. Drums/trash cans - will be labeled by the field crews in accordance with all local, state, and federal requirements. Management plans for contaminated PPE, and tools are provided below. 9.2.4 Emergency Decontamination If circumstances dictate that contaminated clothing cannot be readily removed, then remove gross contamination and wrap injured personnel with clean garments/blankets to avoid contaminating other personnel or transporting equipment. If the injured person can be moved, he/she will be decontaminated by site personnel as described above before emergency responders handle the victim. If the person cannot be moved because of the extent of the injury (a back or neck injury), provisions shall be made to ensure that emergency response personnel will be able to respond to the victim without being exposed to potentially hazardous atmospheric conditions. If the potential for inh alation hazards exist, such as with open excavation, this area will be covered with polyethylene sheeting to eliminate any potential inhalation hazards. All emergency personnel are to be immediately informed of the injured person's condition, potential contaminants, and provided with all pertinent data. Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 30 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 9.2.5 Hand -Held Equipment Decontamination Hand -held equipment includes all monitoring instruments as stated earlier, samples, hand tools, and notebooks. The hand -held equipment is dropped at the first deco ntamination station to be decontaminated by one of the decontamination team members. These items must be decontaminated or discarded as waste prior to removal from the CRZ. To aid in decontamination, monitoring instruments can be sealed in plastic bags or wrapped in polyethylene. This will also protect the instruments against contaminants. The instruments will be wiped clean using wipes or paper towels if contamination is visually evident. Sampling equipment, hand tools, etc. will be cleaned with non -phosphorous soap to remove any potentially contaminated soil, and rinsed with deionized water. All decontamination fluids will be containerized and stored on -site pending waste characterization sampling and appropriate off -site disposal. 9.2.6 Heavy Equipmen t Decontamination All heavy equipment and vehicles arriving at the work site will be free from contamination from offsite sources. Any vehicles arriving to work that are suspected of being impacted will not be permitted on the work site. Potentially con taminated heavy equipment will not be permitted to leave the EZ unless it has been thoroughly decontaminated and visually inspected by the HSO or his designee. 9.3 Support Zone The support zone or cold zone will include the remaining areas of the job site . Break areas and support facilities (include equipment storage and maintenance areas) will be located in this zone. No equipment or personnel will be permitted to enter the cold zone from the hot zone without passing through the decontamination station in the warm zone (if necessitated). Eating, smoking, and drinking will be allowed only in this area. 9.4 Communications The following communications equipment will be utilized as appropriate. Telephones - A cellular telephone will be located with the HSO for communication with the HSM and emergency support services/facilities. Hand Signals - Hand signals shall be used by field teams, along with the buddy system. The entire field team shall know them before operations commence and their use covered during s ite-specific training. Typical hand signals are the following: Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 31 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 Hand Signal Meaning Hand gripping throat Out of air; cannot breathe Grip partners wrists or place both hands around waist Leave immediately without debate Hands on top of head Need assistanc e Thumbs up OK; I'm alright; I understand Thumbs down No; negative Simulated \"stick\" break with fists Take a break; stop work 9.5 The Buddy System When working in teams of two or more, workers will use the \"buddy system\" for all work activities to ensu re that rapid assistance can be provided in the event of an emergency. This requires work groups to be organized such that workers can remain close together and maintain visual contact with one another. Workers using the \"buddy system\" have the following responsibilities: Provide his/her partner with assistance . Observe his/her partner for signs of chemical or heat exposure . Periodically check the integrity of his/her partner's PPE . Notify the HSO or other site personnel if emergency service is needed . 10.0 NEAREST MEDICAL ASSIST ANCE The address and telephone number of the nearest hospital: New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital 506 Sixth Street Brooklyn , New York 718-780-3000 Map with directions to the hospital are shown in Figure 2.

The Emergency Coordinator shall make necessary arrangements to be prepared for any emergencies that could occur. The Emergency Coordinator is responsible for implementing the Emergency Response Plan. 16.2.3 Site Personnel Project site personnel are responsible for kno wing the Emergency Response Plan and the procedures contained herein. Personnel are expected to notify the Emergency Coordinator of situations that could constitute a site emergency. Project site personnel, including all subcontractors will be trained in t he Emergency Response Plan. 16.3 Communications Once an emergency situation has been stabilized, or as soon as practically, the injured Langan personnel should contact Incident Intervention\u00ae at 1-888-479-7787 to report their injuries. For all other commu nications, contact the Langan Incident Hotline at (800) 9 -LANGAN (800-952- 6426) extension 4699 as soon as possible. 16.4 Local Emergency Support Units In order to be able to deal with any emergency that might occur during investigative activities at the si te, the Emergency Notification Numbers (Table 5) will be posted and provided to all personnel conducting work within the EZ. Figure 2 shows the hospital route map. Outside emergency number 911 and local ambulance should be relied on for response to medica l emergencies and transport to emergency rooms. Always contact first responders when there are serious or life threatening emergencies on the site. Project personnel are instructed not to drive injured personnel to the Hospital. In the event of an injur y, provide first aid and keep the injured party calm and protected from the elements Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 35 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 and treat for shock when necessary. 16.5 Pre-Emergency Planning Langan will communicate directly with administrative personnel from the emergency room at the hospital in o rder to determine whether the hospital has the facilities and personnel needed to treat cases of trauma resulting from any of the contaminants expected to be found on the site. Instructions for finding the hospital will be posted conspicuously in the site office and in each site vehicle. 16.6 Emergency Medical Treatment The procedures and rules in this HASP are designed to prevent employee injury. Should an injury occur, no matter how slight, it will be reported to the HSO , immediately. First -aid equipm ent will be available on site at the following locations: First Aid Kit: Contractor Vehicles Emergency Eye Wash: Contractor Vehicles During the site safety briefing, project personnel will be informed of the location of the first aid station(s) that has be en set up. Some injuries, such as severe cuts and lacerations or burns, may require immediate treatment. Any first aid instructions that can be obtained from doctors or paramedics, before an emergency -response squad arrives at the site or before the inju red person can be transported to the hospital, will be followed closely. 16.7 Personnel with current first aid and CPR certification will be identified. Only in non -emergency situations may an injured person be transported to an urgent care facility. Due to hazards that may be present at the site and the conditions under which operations are conducted, it is possible that an emergency situation may develop. Emergency situations can be characterized as injury or acute chemical exposure to personnel, fire o r explosion, environmental release, or hazardous weather conditions. 16.8 Emergency Site Evacuation Routes and Procedures All project personnel will be instructed on proper emergency response procedures and locations of emergency telephone numbers during t he initial site safety meeting. If an emergency occurs as a result of the site investigation activities, including but not limited to fire, explosion or significant release of toxic gas into the atmosphere, the Langan Project Manager will be verbally notified immediately. All heavy equipment will be shut down and all personnel will evacuate the work areas and assemble at the nearest intersection to be accounted for and to receive further Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 36 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 instructions. In the event that an emergency situation arises, the F TL will implement an immediate evacuation of all project personnel due to immediate or impending danger. The FTL will also immediately communicate with the contractor to coordinate any needed evacuation of the property . The FTL or Site Supervisor will gi ve necessary instructions until the Designated Incident Commander (IC) assumes control. After the emergency has been resolved, the FTL or Site Supervisor will coordinate with the IC and indicate when staff should resume their normal duties. If dangers ar e present for those at the designated assembly point, another designated location of assembly will be established. It will be the responsibility of the FTL or Site Supervisor to report a fire or emergency, assess the seriousness of the situation, and initi ate emergency measures until the arrival of the local fire fighters or other first responders, should they be necessary. The FTL, working with emergency responders , may also order the closure of the Site for an indefinite period as long as it is deemed necessary. Under no circumstances will incoming visitors be allowed to proceed to the area of concern, once an emergency evacuation has been implemented. Visitors or other persons present in the area of the emergency shall be instructed to evacuate the area . The FTL will ensure that access roads are not obstructed and will remain on -site to provide stand -by assistance upon arrival of emergency personnel. If it is necessary to temporarily control traffic in the event of an emergency, those persons controlling traffic will wear proper reflection warning vests until the arrival of police or fire personnel. 16.8.1 Designated Assembly Locations All personnel will evacuate the site and assemble at a designated assembly location. The assembly location will be design ated by Langan personnel and discussed during each shift's pre - job safety briefing . 16.8.2 Accounting for Personnel All contractor and subcontractor supervisors are responsible for the accounting of all personnel assembled at the designed assembly area. T he Designated Incident Commander shall be notified if personnel are not found. Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 37 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 16.9 Fire Prevention and Protection In the event of a fire or explosion, procedures will include immediately evacuating the site and notification of the Langan Project Manager o f the investigation activities. Portable fire extinguishers will be provided at the work zone. The extinguishers located in the various locations should also be identified prior to the start of work. No personnel will fight a fire beyond the stage where it can be put out with a portable extinguisher (incipient stage). 16.9.1 Fire Prevention Fires will be prevented by adhering to the following precautions: Good housekeeping and storage of materials. Storage of flammable liquids and gases away from oxidiz ers. Shutting off engines to refuel. Grounding and bonding metal containers during transfer of flammable liquids. Use of UL approved flammable storage cans. Fire extinguishers rated at least 10 pounds ABC located on all heavy equipment, in all trailers and near all hot work activities. The person responsible for the control of fuel source hazards and the maintenance of fire prevention and/or control equipment is the HSO. 16.10 Significant Vapor Release Based on the proposed tasks, the potential for a signif icant vapor release is low. However, if a release occurs, the following steps will be taken: Move all personnel to an upwind location. All non -essential personnel shall evacuate. Upgrade to Level C Respiratory Protection. Downwind perimeter locations shal l be monitored for volatile organics. If the release poses a potential threat to human health or the environment in the community, the Emergency Coordinator shall notify the Langan Project Manager. Local emergency response coordinators will be notified. 16.11 Overt Chemical Exposure The following are standard procedures to treat chemical exposures. Other, specific procedures detailed on the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) will be followed, when necessary.

CONTACT : Wash/rinse affected areas thoroughly, then provide appropriate medical attention. Skin shall also be rinsed for 15 minutes if contact with caustics, acids or hydrogen peroxide occurs. Affect ed items of clothing shall also be removed from contact with skin. Providing wash water and soap will be the responsibility of each individual contractor or subcontractor on -site. 16.12 Decontamination during Medical Emergencies If emergency life -saving first aid and/or medical treatment is required, normal decontamination procedures may need to be abbreviated or omitted. The HSO or designee will accompany contaminated victims to the medical facility to advice on matters involving decontamination when necessary. The outer garments can be removed if they do not cause delays, interfere with treatment or aggravate the problem. Respiratory equipment must always be removed. Protective clothing can be cut away. If the outer contaminated garments cannot be s afely removed on site, a plastic barrier placed between the injured individual and clean surfaces should be used to help prevent contamination of the inside of ambulances and/or medical personnel. Outer garments may then be removed at the medical facility . No attempt will be made to wash or rinse the victim if his/her injuries are life threatening, unless it is known that the individual has been contaminated with an extremely toxic or corrosive material which could also cause severe injury or loss of life to emergency response personnel. For minor medical problems or injuries, the normal decontamination procedures will be followed. 16.13 Adverse Weather Conditions In the event of adverse weather conditions, the HSO will determine if work will continue wit hout potentially risking the safety of all field workers. Some of the items to be considered prior to determining if work should continue are: Potential for heat stress and heat -related injuries. Potential for cold stress and cold -related injuries. Treach erous weather -related working conditions (hail, rain, snow, ice, high winds). Limited visibility (fog). Potential for electrical storms. Earthquakes. Other major incidents. Site activities will be limited to daylight hours, or when suitable artificial ligh t is provided, and Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 39 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 acceptable weather conditions prevail. The HSO will determine the need to cease field operations or observe daily weather reports and evacuate, if necessary, in case of severe inclement weather conditions. 16.14 Spill Control and Respon se All small spills/environmental releases shall be contained as close to the source as possible. Whenever possible, the MSDS will be consulted to assist in determining proper waste characterization and the best means of containment and cleanup. For smal l spills, sorbent materials such as sand, sawdust or commercial sorbents should be placed directly on the substance to contain the spill and aid recovery. Any acid spills should be diluted or neutralized carefully prior to attempting recovery. Berms of e arthen or sorbent materials can be used to contain the leading edge of the spills. All spill containment materials will be properly disposed. An exclusion zone of 50 to 100 feet around the spill area should be established depending on the size of the spi ll. All contractor vehicles shall have spill kits on them with enough material to contain and absorb the worst -case spill from that vehicle. All vehicles and equipment shall be inspected prior to be admitted on site. Any vehicle or piece of equipment tha t develops a leak will be taken out of service and removed from the job site. The following seven steps shall be taken by the Emergency Coordinator: 1. Determine the nature, identity and amounts of major spills. 2. Make sure all unnecessary persons are removed f rom the spill area. 3. Notify the HSO immediately. 4. Use proper PPE in consultation with the HSO. 5. If a flammable liquid, gas or vapor is involved, remove all ignition sources and use non-sparking and/or explosion -proof equipment to contain or clean up the spill (diesel -only vehicles, air -operated pumps, etc.) 6. If possible, try to stop the leak with appropriate material. 7. Remove all surrounding materials that can react or compound with the spill. In addition to the spill control and response procedures described in this HASP , Langan personnel will coordinate with the designated project manager relative to spill response and control actions. Notification to the Project Manager must be immediate and, to the extent possible, include the following information: Time and location of the spill. Type and nature of the material spilled. Amount spilled. Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 40 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 Whether the spill has affected or has a potential to affect a waterway or sewer. A brief description of affected areas/equipment. Whether the spill has been contained. Expecte d time of cleanup completion. If spill cleanup cannot be handled by Langan's on-site personnel alone, such fact must be conveyed to the Project Manager immediately. Langan shall not make any notification of spills to outside agencies. The client will noti fy regulatory agencies as per their reporting procedures. 16.15 Emergency Equipment The following minimum emergency equipment shall be kept and maintained on site: Industrial first aid kit. Fire extinguishers (one per site). 16.16 Restoration and Salvage After an emergency, prompt restoration of utilities, fire protection equipment, medical supplies and other equipment will reduce the possibility of further losses. Some of the items that may need to be addressed are: Refilling fire extinguishers. Refilling medical supplies. Recharging eyewashes and/or showers. Replenishing spill control supplies. 16.17 Documentation Immediately following an incident or near miss, unless emergency medical treatment is required, either the employee or a coworker must contact the Langan Incident/Injury Hotline at 1 -(800) -9- LANGAN (ext. #4699) and the client representative to report the incident or near miss. For emergencies involving personnel injury and/or exposure, the HSO and affected employee will complete and submit an Em ployee Exposure/Injury Incident Report (Attachment C) to the Langan Corporate Health and Safety Manager as soon as possible following the incident. 17.0 SPECIAL CONDITIONS This guideline contains information and requirements for special conditions that m ay not be routinely encountered.

Hydrogen sulfide is used to test and make other chemicals. It is also found as a by -product of chemical reactions, such as in sewer treatment. It is a highly flammable gas and a dangerous fire hazard. Poisonous gases are produced in fires including sulfur oxides. Hydrogen sulfide is not listed as a carcinogen. 17.3.3.2 Health Effects Hydrogen Sulfide can affect employees if inhaled or through contact with skin or eyes. Acute (or short t erm) health effects of hydrogen sulfide exposure include irritation of the nose and throat, dizziness, confusion, headache and trouble sleeping. Inhalation of hydrogen sulfide can irritate the lungs causing coughing and/or shortness of breath. Higher lev els of exposure can cause build -up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), a medical emergency, with severe shortness of breath. Chronic (or long term) health effects of low levels of exposure to hydrogen sulfide can cause pain and redness of the eyes wit h blurred vision. Repeated exposure may cause bronchitis with cough, phlegm and shortness of breath. 17.3.3.3 Protective Clothing and Equipment Respirators are required for those operations in which employees will be exposed to hydrogen sulfide above OSHA permissible exposure level. The maximum OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) for hydrogen sulfide is 20 parts of hydrogen sulfide vapor per million parts of air (20 ppm) for an 8 -hour workday and the maximum short -term exposure limit (STEL) is 10 ppm for any 10 - minute period. Where employees are exposed to levels up to 100 parts of hydrogen sulfide vapor per million parts of air (100 ppm), the following types of respiratory protection are allowed: Any powered, air purifying respirator with cartridge(s); Any air purifying, full -facepiece respirator (gas mask) with a chin style, front - or back - mounted canister; Any supplied air system with escape self -contained breathing apparatus, if applicable; Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 45 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 and, Any self -contained breathing apparatus with a full facepi ece. Respirators used by employees must have joint Mine Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) seal of approval. Cartridges or canisters must be replaced before the end of their service life, or the end of the shift, whichever occurs first. Langan employees that have the potential to be exposed to hydrogen sulfide will be trained in the proper use of respirators. Respirator training is discussed under - Langan's Respiratory Protection Program . Employees with potential exposure to hydrogen sulfide, or when required by the client, will wear a portable hydrogen sulfide gas detector. The detector should have an audible, visual and vibrating alarm. The detector may also provide detection for carb on monoxide, sulfur dioxide and oxygen deficient atmospheres. The hydrogen sulfide monitor will, at a minimum, be calibrated to detect hydrogen sulfide at a level of 20 parts of hydrogen sulfide vapor per million parts of air (20 ppm). Many portable gas detectors will have factory defaults with a low level alarm at 10 ppm and a high level alarm at 15 ppm. Langan employees shall consult clients to determine if any site specific threshold levels exist. If the hydrogen sulfide gas detector sounds and employ ees are not wearing appropriate respiratory protection, employees must immediately vacate the area and meet at the assigned emergency location. Langan employees may not re - enter the site without proper respiratory protection and approval from the client or property owner, if needed. Employees shall wear PPE to prevent eye and skin contact with hydrogen sulfide. Employees must wear appropriate protective clothing including boots, gloves, sleeves and aprons, over any parts of their body that could be expos ed to hydrogen sulfide. Non-vented, impact resistant goggles should be worn when working with or exposed to hydrogen sulfide. 17.3.3.4 Emergency and First Aid Procedures Eye and Face Exposure If hydrogen sulfide comes in contact with eyes, it should be wa shed out immediately with large amounts of water for 30 minutes, occasionally lifting the lower and upper eye lids. Seek medical attention immediately. Skin Exposure If hydrogen sulfide contaminates clothing or skin, remove the contaminated clothing imme diately Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 46 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 and wash the exposed skin with large amounts of water and soap. Seek medical attention immediately. Contaminated clothing should either be disposed of or washed before wearing again. Breathing If a Langan employee or other personnel breathe in hy drogen sulfide, immediately get the exposed person to fresh air. If breathing has stopped, artificial respiration should be started. Call for medical assistance or a doctor as soon as possible. Safety Precautions Hydrogen sulfide is a highly flammable ga s and a dangerous fire hazard. Containers of hydrogen sulfide may explode in a fire situation. Poisonous gases are produced during fires. Langan employees should contact property owners and operators prior to conducting work onsite to be aware of any sit e specific contingency plans, identify where hydrogen sulfide is used at the facility and be informed about additional safety rules or procedures. 19.3.4 Fire Protection/Extinguishers Langan field personnel that have been provided with portable fire exting uishers for use at worksites will be trained to familiarize employees with general principles of fire extinguisher use and hazards associated with the incipient stage of firefighting. Training will be provided prior to initial assignment for field work an d annually thereafter. Portable fire extinguishers shall be visually inspected monthly and subjected to an annual maintenance check. Langan shall retain records of the annual maintenance date. 17.3.5 Overhead lines When field work is performed near overhe ad lines, the lines shall be deenergized and grounded, or other protective measures shall be provided before the work shall commence. If overhead lines are to be deenergized, arrangements shall be made with the client, property owner or organization that operates or controls the electric circuits involved to deenergize and ground them. If protective measures, such as guarding, isolating, or insulating, are provided, these precautions shall prevent employees from contacting such lines directly with any par t of their body or indirectly through conductive materials, tools, or equipment. When unqualified Langan personnel are working in an elevated position near overhead lines, the location shall be such that the person and the longest conductive object they ma y contact cannot Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 47 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 come closer to any unguarded, energized overhead line than the following distances: 1. For voltages to ground 50kV or below - 10 feet; and 2. For voltages to ground over 50kV - 10 feet, plus 4 inches for every 10kV over 50kV. As previously indicated, Langan does not retain qualified employees to perform work on energized equipment. 17.3.5.1 Vehicle and Equipment Clearance Any vehicle or mechanical equipment capable of having parts of its structure elevated near energized overhead lines shal l be operated so that a clearance of 10 feet is maintained. If the voltage of the overhead lines is higher than 50kV, the clearance shall be increased 4 inches for every 10kV over that voltage. If any of the following discussed conditions occur, the clear ance may be reduced. If the vehicle is in transit with its structure lowered, the clearance may be reduced to 4 ft. If the voltage is higher than 50kV, the clearance shall be increased 4 in. for every 10 kV over that voltage. If insulating barriers are ins talled to prevent contact with the lines, and if the barriers are rated for the voltage of the line being guarded and are not a part of or an attachment to the vehicle or its raised structure, the clearance may be reduced to a distance within the designed working dimensions of the insulating barrier. Employees standing on the ground may not contact the vehicle or mechanical equipment or any of its attachments, unless the employee is using protective equipment rated for the voltage; or the equipment is locat ed so that no uninsulated part of its structure (that portion of the structure that provides a conductive path to employees on the ground) can come closer to the overhead line than permitted. If any vehicle or mechanical equipment capable of having parts o f its structure elevated near energized overhead lines is intentionally grounded, employees working on the ground near the point of grounding may not stand at the grounding location whenever there is a possibility of overhead line contact. Additional prec autions, such as the use of barricades or insulation, shall be taken to protect employees from hazardous ground potentials, depending on earth resistivity and fault currents, which can develop within the first few feet or more outward from the grounding po int. Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 48 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 17.3.6 Trade Secret Langan employees could potentially be provided trade secret information by the client or property owner when site specific information is provided about highly hazardous chemicals. Trade secret means any confidential formula, patt ern, process, device, information or compilation of information that is used in an employer's business, and that gives the employer an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. Langan employees understand that this info rmation should be kept confident and if required, may enter into a confidentially agreement with the client. 17.3.7 Bloodborne Pathogens Langan employees that can reasonably anticipate exposure to blood or other potentially infectious material while at wor k sites shall have training in bloodborne pathogens. Applicable employees would include those trained in first aid and serving a designated role as an emergency medical care provider. Bloodborne pathogens are pathogenic microorganisms that are present in human blood and can cause disease in humans. These pathogens include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus. 17.3.7 .1 Training Langan employees with potential occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infect ious material must participate in a training program. Training must be conducted prior to initial assignment where there would be potential for exposure and annually thereafter within one year of previous training. The training program will be provided t o Langan employees at no cost to them and during working hours. Langan will ensure the training program shall consist of the following: An accessible copy of the regulatory text of 29 CFR 1910.1030 and an explanation of its contents; A general explanation of the epidemiology and symptoms of bloodborne diseases; An explanation of the modes of transmission of bloodborne pathogens; An explanation of Langan's exposure control plan and the means by which the employee can obtain a copy of the written plan; An exp lanation of the appropriate methods for recognizing tasks and other activities that may involve exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials; An explanation of the use and limitations of personal protective o equipment (PPE) to prevent and re duce exposure; o Information on the types, proper use, location, removal, handling and disposal of PPE; Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 49 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 o An explanation of the basis for selection of PPE; o Information on the hepatitis B vaccine, including information on its efficacy, safety, method of adminis tration, the benefits of being vaccinated, and that the vaccine and vaccination will be offered free of charge; o Information on the appropriate actions to take and persons to contact in an emergency involving blood or other potentially infectious materials; o An explanation of the procedure to follow if an exposure incident occurs, including the method of reporting the incident and the medical follow -up that will be made available; o Information on the post -exposure evaluation and follow -up that the o employer is required to provide for the employee following an exposure incident; o An explanation of the signs and labels and/or color coding required by paragraph 29 CFR 1910.1030(g)(1); and o An opportunity for interactive questions and answers with the person conductin g the training session. Langan will develop and implement a written Exposure Control Plan, which will be designed to eliminate or minimize employee exposure to bloodborne pathogens . The Exposure Control Plan will contain the following elements: An exposure determination for employees; The schedule and method of implementation for Methods of Compliance (29 CFR 191.1030(d)), Hepatitis B Vaccination and Post -Exposure Evaluation and Follow -up (29 CFR 1910.1030(f)), Communication of Hazards to Employees (29 CFR 1910.1030(g)) and (h) Recordkeeping (29 CFR 1910.1030(h)); The procedure for the evaluation of circumstances surrounding exposure incidents; Ensure a copy of the Exposure Control Plan will be accessible to employees; and, The Exposure Control Plan shall be reviewed and updated at least annually. Langan employees with occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens include any employees trained in first aid that would be expected to provide emergency medical care. This determination is made without regards to the use of PPE, which could eliminate or minimize exposure. Universal precautions shall be observed to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials. According to the concept of Universal Precautions, all human blood and certain hu man body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for bloodborne pathogens. Under circumstances in which differentiation between body fluid types is difficult or impossible, all body fluids shall be considered potentially infectious materials. Work practice controls shall be used to eliminate or minimize employee exposure, if applicable. Since Langan employees will have occupational exposure only during rendering of first aid, Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 50 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 personnel protective equipment will be utilized to reduce or minimize exp osure. PPE that could be available to Langan personnel when administering first aid includes safety glasses, gloves, and Tyvek suits or sleeves. PPE and first aid kits will be provided to employees at no cost to them. Langan employees that render first a id in office areas will have access to hand washing facilities or restrooms. For first aid rendered at field locations, first aid kits will contain an appropriate antiseptic hand cleanser and clean cloth/paper towels or antiseptic towelettes. After using antiseptic hand cleansers or towelettes, employees shall wash their hands with soap and running water as soon as feasible. After administering first aid, potentially infectious materials, including towels, personnel protective equipment, clothes and bandag es, shall be placed in a container, which prevents leakage during collection, handling, processing, storage, transport, or shipping. All PPE will be dispose of after use. Any equipment or working surfaces which was been exposed to blood or potentially in fectious materials due to an injury, will be decontaminated prior to reuse. Langan will make available the hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination series to all employees who have occupational exposure, and post -exposure evaluation and follow -up to all employe es who have had an exposure incident. These services will be available to the employee at no cost to them through a medical provider. 17.3.7.2 Recordkeeping Langan will maintain training and medical records for each employee with occupational exposure to blood or potentially infectious materials. Medical and training records will be maintained by Langan's H&S Department. Training records will include the following: Dates of the training sessions; Contents or a summary of the training sessions; Names and q ualifications of persons conducting the training; and Names and job titles of all persons attending the training sessions. Training records shall be maintained for 3 years from the date on which the training occurred. Medical records will be will be prese rved and maintained for the duration of employment plus 30 years. All records will be made available upon request to employees, the Assistant Secretary of Labor Health & Safety Plan August 2021 125 3rd Street Page 51 Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170698601 for Occupational Safety and Health, and Director of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Director of OSHA for examination and copying. Medical records must have written consent from employee before releasing. If Langan ceases to do business, all records shall be transferred to the successor employer. The successor employer shall r eceive and maintain these records. If there will not be a successor, Langan will notify current employees of their rights to access records at least three months prior to the cessation of business. 18.0 RECORDKEEPING The following is a summary of required health and safety logs, reports and recordkeeping. 18.1 Field Change Authorization Request Any changes to the work to be performed that is not included in the HASP will require an addendum that is approved by the Langan project manager and Langan HSM to be prepared. Approved changes will be reviewed with all field personnel at a safety briefing. 18.2 Medical and Training Records Copies or verification of training (40 -hour, 8 -hour, supervisor, site -specific training, documentation of three -day OJT, and res pirator fit -test records) and medical clearance for site work and respirator use will be maintained in the office and available upon request.

EQUIPMENT DECONTAMINATION GENERAL: Equipment to be decontaminated during the project may include tools, monitoring equipment, respirators, sampling containers, laboratory equipment and drilling equipment. All decontamination will be done by personnel in protective gear, appropriate for the level of decontamination, as determined by the site HSO. The decontamination work tasks will be split or rotated among support and work crews. Depending on site conditions, backhoe and pumps may be decontaminated over a portable decontamination pad to contain wash water; or, wash water may be allowed to run off into a storm sewer system. Equipment needed may include a steam generator with high -pressure water, empty drums, screens, screen support structures, and shovels. Drums will be used to hold contaminated wash water pumped from the lined pit. These drums will be labeled as such. Miscellaneous tools and equipment will be dropped into a plastic pail, tub, or other container. They will be brushed off and rinsed with a detergent solution, and finally rinsed with cle an water. MONITORING EQUIPMENT: Monitoring equipment will be protected as much as possible from contamination by draping, masking, or otherwise covering as much of the instruments as possible with plastic without hindering the operation of the unit. The PID, HNu or OVA meter, for example, can be placed in a clear plastic bag, which allows reading of the scale and operation of knobs. The probes can be partially wrapped keeping the sensor tip and discharge port clear. The contaminated equipment will be taken from the drop area and the protective coverings removed and disposed in the appropriate containers. Any dirt or obvious contamination will be brushed or wiped with a disposable paper wipe. RESPIRATORS : Respirators will be cleaned and disinfected after ever y use. Taken from the drop area, the masks (with the cartridges removed and disposed of with other used disposable gear) will be immersed in a cleaning solution and scrubbed gently with a soft brush, followed by a rinse in plain warm water, and then allowe d to air dry. In the morning, new cartridges will be installed. Personnel will inspect their own masks for serviceability prior to donning them. And, once the mask is on, the wearer will check the respirator for leakage using the negative and positive pres sure fit check techniques.

HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION NFPA Ratings (Scale 0-4): Health = 1 Fire = 0 Reactivity = 0 Major Health Hazards: Cancer hazard (in humans) Potential Health Effects Inhalation: Inhalation of chrysolite asbestos dust may be irritating. Symptoms include a cough and chest pain. Chronic exposure may cause asbestosis, interstitial fibrosis of the lung tissue, which may develop within 4 years to 9 years, but onset may be typically delayed 20 years to 40 years after first exposure. Death from asbestosis may be due to respiratory or cardiac failu re. Secondary lung infections may also occur. Chronic exposure of asbestos to workers may also cause pleural effusion as early as 3 years to 4 years after initial exposure. Chronic exposure of asbestos to workers also increases the chance of pl eural and peritoneal mesotheliomas, bronchogenic carcinoma, lung cancer, and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and larynx. The latent period for mesothelioma is 3 years to 40 years; for lung cancer, 15 years to 30 years. Skin Contact: Direct contact may cause irritation. Asbestos fibers may penetrate the skin and result in \"asbestos corns\", due to thickening of the skin around the implanted fiber. These corns usually occur on the hands and forearms, and they disappear on removal of the fibers. Eye Contact: Direct contact may cause irritation w ith redness due to mechanical action. Ingestion: Acute exposure by cause gastrointestinal i rritation. Chronic exposure of asbestos fibers may be involved in cancers of the buccal cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum. Listed as a Carcinogen/ Potential Carcinogen: Yes No In the National Toxicology Prog ram (NTP) Report on Carcinogens. In the International Agency for Re search on Cancer (IARC) Monographs. By the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). X X X 4. FIRST AID MEASURES Inhalation: If adverse effects occur, remove to uncontaminated area.

Substance: Asbestiform Grunerite 2. COMPOSITION AND (EINECS): Not assigned. SRM Nominal Concentration (% by weight or volume): > 90 Component: Magnetite (as an impurity) Other Designation: iron < 5 EC Classification: T Carcinogen Category 1 EC Risk (R No.): 23, 45, 48 EC Safety (S No.): 45, 53 (a) Hazardous components 1 % or greater; carcinogens 0.1 % or greater are listed in compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200. 3. HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION NFPA Ratings (Scale 0-4): Health = 1 Fire = 0 Reactivity = 0 Major Health Hazards: Cancer hazard (in humans) Potential Health Effects Inhalation: Inhalation of grunerite asbestos dust may be irritating. Symptoms include a cough and chest pain. Chronic exposure may cause asbestosis, interstitial fibrosis of the lung tissue, which may develop within 4 years to 9 years, but onset may be typically delayed 20 years to 40 years after first exposure. Death from asbestosis may be due to respiratory or cardiac failure . Secondary lung in fections may also occur. Chronic exposure of asbestos to wo rkers may also cause pleural effusion as early as 3 years to 4 years after initial exposure. Chronic exposure of asbestos to workers also increases the chance of pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas, bronchogenic carcinoma, lung cancer, and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and larynx. The latent period for mesothelioma is 3 years to 40 years; for lung cancer, 15 years to 30 years. Skin Contact: Direct contact may cause irritation. Asbestos fibers may penetrate the skin and result in \"asbestos corns\", due to thickening of the skin around the implanted fiber. These corns usually occur on the hands and forearms, and they disappear on removal of the fibers. Eye Contact: Direct contact may cause irritation w ith redness due to mechanical action. Ingestion: Acute exposure by cause gastrointestinal irritation. Chronic exposure of asbestos fibers may be involved in cancers of the buccal cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum.

HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION Potential Health Effects: Eye: Contact may cause mild eye irritation including stinging, watering, and redness. Skin: Severe skin irritant. Contact may cause redness, itching, burning, and severe skin damage. Prolonged or repeated contact can worsen irritation by causing drying and cracking of the skin, leading to dermatitis (inflammation). Not actually toxic by skin absorption, but prolonged or repeated skin contact may be harmful (see Section 11). Inhalation (Breathing): No information available. Studies by other exposure routes suggest a low degree of toxicity by inhalation. Ingestion (Swallowing): Low degree of toxicity by ingestion. ASPIRATION HAZARD ! This material can enter lungs during swallowing or vomiting and cause lung inflammation and damage. Signs and Symptoms: Effects of overexposure may include irritation of the nose and throat, irritation of the digestive tract, nausea, diarrhea and transient excitation followed by signs of nervous system depression (e.g., headache, drowsiness, dizziness, loss of coordination, disorientation and fatigue). Cancer: Possible skin cancer hazard (see Sections 11 and 14). Target Organs: There is limited evidence from animal studies that overexposure may cause injury to the kidney (see Section 11). Developmental: Inadequate data available for this material. Pre-Existing Medical Conditions: Conditions aggravated by exposure may include skin disorders and kidney disorders. No. 2 Diesel Fuel (MSDS #0041) Page 4 of 9 4. FIRST AID MEASURES Eye: If irritation or redness develops, move victim away from exposure and into fresh air. Flush eyes with clean water. If symptoms persist, seek medical attention. Skin: Immediately remove contaminated shoes, clothing, and constrictive jewelry and flush affected area(s) with large amounts of water. If skin surface is damaged, apply a clean dressing and seek immediate medical attention. If skin surface is not damaged, cleanse affected area(s) thoroughly by washing with mild soap and water. If irritation or redness develops, seek immediate medical attention. Inhalation (Breathing): If respiratory symptoms develop, move victim away from source of exposure and into fresh air. If symptoms persist, seek medical attention. If victim is not breathing, clear airway and immediately begin artificial respiration. If breathing difficulties develop, oxygen should be administered by qualified personnel. Seek immediate medical attention. Ingestion (Swallowing): Aspiration hazard; Do not induce vomiting or give anything by mouth because this material can enter the lungs and cause severe lung damage. If victim is drowsy or unconscious and vomiting, place on the left side with the head down. If possible, do not leave victim unattended and observe closely for adequacy of breathing. Seek medical attention. 5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES Flammable Properties: Flash Point: >125\u00b0F/>52\u00b0 OSHA Flammability Temperature: 500\u00b0F/260\u00b0C Unusual Fire & Explosion Hazards: This material is flammable and can be ignited by heat, sparks, flames, or other sources of ignition (e.g., static electricity, pilot lights, or mechanical/electrical equipment, and electronic devices such as cell phones, computers, calculators, and pagers which have not been certified as intrinsically safe). Vapors may travel considerable distances to a source of ignition where they can ignite, flash back, or explode. May create vapor/air explosion hazard indoors, in confined spaces, outdoors, or in sewers. Vapors are heavier than air and can accumulate in low areas. If container is not properly cooled, it can rupture in the heat of a fire. Extinguishing Media: Dry chemical, carbon dioxide, or foam is recommended. Water spray is recommended to cool or protect exposed materials or structures. Carbon dioxide can displace oxygen. Use caution when applying carbon dioxide in confined spaces. Water may be ineffective for extinguishment, unless used under favorable conditions by experienced fire fighters. Fire Fighting Instructions: For fires beyond the incipient stage, emergency responders in the immediate hazard area should wear bunker gear. When the potential chemical hazard is unknown, in enclosed or confined spaces, or when explicitly required by DOT, a self contained breathing apparatus should be worn. In addition, wear other appropriate protective equipment as conditions warrant (see Section 8). Isolate immediate hazard area, keep unauthorized personnel out. Stop spill/release if it can be done with minimal risk. Move undamaged containers from immediate hazard area if it can be done with minimal risk. Water spray may be useful in minimizing or dispersing vapors and to protect personnel. Cool equipment exposed to fire with water, if it can be done with minimal risk. Avoid spreading burning liquid with water used for cooling purposes. No. 2 Diesel Fuel (MSDS #0041) Page 5 of 9 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES Flammable. Keep all sources of ignition and hot metal surfaces away from spill/release. The use of explosion-proof equipment is recommended. Stay upwind and away from spill/release. Notify persons down wind of the spill/release, isolate immediate hazard area and keep unauthorized personnel out. Stop spill/release if it can be done with minimal risk. Wear appropriate protective equipment including respiratory protection as conditions warrant (see Section 8). Prevent spilled material from entering sewers, storm drains, other unauthorized drainage systems, and natural waterways. Dike far ahead of spill for later recovery or disposal. Use foam on spills to minimize vapors (see Section 5). Spilled material may be absorbed into an appropriate material. Notify fire authorities and appropriate federal, state, and local agencies. Immediate cleanup of any spill is recommended. If spill of any amount is made into or upon navigable waters, the contiguous zone, or adjoining shorelines, notify the National Response Center (phone number 800-424-8802). 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE Handling: Open container slowly to relieve any pressure. Bond and ground all equipment when transferring from one vessel to another. Can accumulate static charge by flow or agitation. Can be ignited by static discharged. The use of explosion-proof equipment is recommended and may be required (see appropriate fire codes). Refer to NFPA-704 and/or API RP 2003 for specific bonding/grounding requirements. Do not enter confined spaces such as tanks or pits without following proper entry procedures such ASTM D-4276 and 29CFR 1910.146. The use of appropriate respiratory protection is advised when concentrations exceed any established exposure limits (see Sections 2 and 8). Do not wear contaminated clothing or shoes. Keep contaminated clothing away from sources of ignition such as sparks or open flames. Use good personal hygiene practices. High pressure injection of hydrocarbon fuels, hydraulic oils or greases under the skin may have serious consequences even though no symptoms or injury may be apparent. This can happen accidentally when using high pressure equipment such as high pressure grease guns, fuel injection apparatus or from pinhole leaks in tubing or high pressure hydraulic oil equipment. $Empty& containers retain residue and may be dangerous. Do not pressurize, cut, weld, braze, solder, drill, grind, or expose such containers to heat, flame, sparks, or other sources of ignition. They may explode and cause injury or death. $Empty& drums should be completely drained, properly bunged, and promptly shipped to the supplier or a drum reconditioner. All containers should be disposed of in an environmentally safe manner and in accordance with governmental regulations. Before working on or in tanks which contain or have contained this material, refer to OSHA regulations, ANSIZ49.1 and other references pertaining to cleaning, repairing, welding, or other contemplated operations. Storage: Keep container(s) tightly closed. Use and store this material in cool, dry, well-ventilated areas away from heat, direct sunlight, hot metal surfaces, and all sources of ignition. Post area $No Smoking or Open Flame.& Store only in approved containers. Keep away from incompatible material (see Section 10). Protect container(s) against physical damage. Outdoor or detached storage is preferred. Indoor storage should meet OSHA standards and appropriate fire codes. 8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION Engineering controls: If current ventilation practices are not adequate to maintain airborne concentration below the established exposure limits (see Section 2), additional ventilation or exhaust systems may be required. Where explosive mixtures may be present, electrical systems safe for such locations must be used (see appropriate electrical codes). No. 2 Diesel Fuel (MSDS #0041) Page 6 of 9 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Respiratory: A NIOSH certified air purifying respirator with an organic vapor cartridge maybe used under conditions where airborne concentrations are expected to exceed exposure limits (see Section 2). Protection provided by air purifying respirators is limited (see manufacturer\"s respirator selection guide). Use a positive pressure air supplied respirator if there is a potential for an uncontrolled release, exposure levels are not known, or any other circumstances where air purifying respirators may not provide adequate protection. A respiratory protection program that meets OSHA\"s 29 CFR 1910.134 and ANSI Z88.2 requirements must be followed whenever workplace conditions warrants a respirator\"s use. Skin: The use of gloves impervious to the specific material handled is advised to prevent skin contact, possible irritation and skin damage (see glove manufacturer literature for information on permeability). Depending on conditions of use, apron and/or arm covers may be necessary. Eyes/Face: Approved eye protection to safeguard against potential eye contact, irritation, or injury is recommended. Depending on conditions of use, a face shield may be necessary. Other Protective Equipment: Eye wash and quick-drench shower facilities should be available in the work area. Thoroughly clean shoes and wash contaminated clothing before reuse. It is recommended that impervious clothing be worn when skin contact is possible. 9.

TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION Diesel Fuel No. 2 (CAS# 68476-34-6) Carcinogenicity: Chronic dermal application of certain middle distillate streams contained in diesel fuel No. 2 resulted in an increased incidence of skin tumors in mice. This material has not been identified as carcinogen by NTP, IARC, or OSHA. Diesel exhaust is a probable cancer hazard based on tests with laboratory animals. Target Organ(s): Limited evidence of renal impairment has been noted from a few case reports involving excessive exposure to diesel fuel No. 2. Naphthalene (CAS# 91-20-3) Carcinogenicity: Naphthalene has been evaluated in two year inhalation studies in both rats and mice. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there is clear evidence of carcinogenicity in male and female rats based on increased incidences of respiratory epithelial adenomas and olfactory epithelial neuroblastomas of the nose. NTP found some evidence of carcinogenicity in female mice (alveolar adenomas) and no evidence of carcinogenicity in male mice. Naphthalene has not been identified as a carcinogen by IARC or OSHA. 12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION Not evaluated at this time 13. DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS This material, if discarded as produced, would be a RCRA $characteristic& hazardous waste due to the characteristic(s) of ignitability (D001) and benzene (D018). If the material is spilled to soil or water, characteristic testing of the contaminated materials is recommended. Further, this material, once it becomes a waste, is subject to the land disposal restrictions in 40 CFR 268.40 and may require treatment prior to disposal to meet specific standards. Consult state and local regulations to determine whether they are more stringent then the federal requirements. Container contents should be completely used and containers should be emptied prior to discard. Container ?insate? could be considered a RCRA hazardous waste and must be disposed of with care and in compliance with federal, state and local regulations. Large empty containers, such as drums, should be returned to the distributor or to a drum reconditioner.

Use spark-free tools and explosion proof equipment. 5. Empty containers retain product residue (liquid/vap or), and can be dangerous. 6. Do not pressurize, cut, weld, braze, solder, drill, or expose empty containers to heat, sparks or open flames. Conditions for safe storage, including any incompat ibilities 1. Iron, galvanized iron, and steel are suitable metal s for tanks. 2. Storage should be located away from any area subjec t to fire hazards. Storage tanks located in the ope n or underground minimize the danger of fire, vapor and health probl ems. 3. All openings in the system should terminate outdoor s and be protected by flash screen. 4. Electrical installation should conform to the Natio nal Electrical Code. 5. Storage tanks should be electrically bonded and gro unded to prevent dangerous accumulations of static electricity. (see NFPA pamphlet \"Static Electricity\") 6. Natural ventilation is all that is needed for outdo or storage installation. 7. For indoor storage : Good natural ventilation may b e sufficient. The generally considered maximum allo wable concentration is 100 ppm by volume in air for an ei ght-hour working exposure. If other than natural ve ntilation is required, 4 the ventilation equipment should be designed to han dle the heavy ethylbenzene vapor. Since ethylbenzen e vapor is heavier than air, a down draft mechanical exhaust is indica ted in those operation in which general ventilation should be to ensure a substantial air flow away from the work area. All v entilating systems require periodic inspection. SECTION 8-EXPOSURE CONTROLS, PERSONAL PROTECTION Control parameters OSHA- Final PELs : ppm TWA. ppm. TLV-STEL : ppm. Taiwan TWA : 100 ppm (skin).

Process should be located at least 17 meter (50 fee t) away from open flames and all high temperature o perations likely to cause ignition of the ethylbenzene vapor. 2. In venting ethylbenzene vapors, consideration should be given to possible halogenation of the vapors by low concentrations of free chlorine and bromine with th e resultant formation of lacrimations. 3. Process should be designed so that the operator is not exposed to direct contact with ethylbenzene or the vapor. The technical problems of designing equipment, providin g adequate ventilation and operating procedures whi ch promise maximum security and economy, can best be handled b y competent engineers. 4. It is essential for safety that equipment be used a nd maintained as recommended by the manufacturer. 5. Tanks used to store or process ethylbenzene should be closed vessels vented to a safe point of discharge in the outside atmosphere away from operating stations , roadways, and at least 17 meter (50 feet) from po ssible sources of ignitions. All sparks, flames, heated surface, or other sources of ignition should be kept away from all vents. It is advisable, to provide suction on vessels when inspection or observation o penings are made, to minimize or eliminate escape o f vapors. Personal protective equipment Personal respirators (NIOSH Approved): If the exposure limit is exceeded, a half-face orga nic vapor respirator may be worn for up to ten time s the exposure limi t or the maximum use concentration specified by the appropri ate regulatory agency or respirator supplier, which ever is lowest. A full-face piece organic vapor respirator may be wor n up to 50 times the exposure limit or the maximum use concentration specifi ed by the appropriate regulatory agency or respirat or supplier, whichever is lowest. For emergencies o r instances where the exposure levels are not known, use a full-face piece positive-pressure, air-supplied respirator. oxygen-deficient atmospheres.)

NOTE (1): ALL WHMIS required information is included in appropr iate sections based on the ANSI Z400.1-1998 format. T his gas mixture has been classified in accordance w ith the hazard criteria of the CPR and the MSDS c ontains all the informat ion required by the CPR. 3. HAZARD IDENTIFICATION EMERGENCY OVERVIEW : This gas mix ture is a colorless gas which has a rotten-egg odor (due to the pres ence of Hy drogen Sulfi de). The odor cannot b e relied on as an adequate w arning of the pr esence of this gas mixture, because olfactory fatigue ide (another component of this gas mixture) are tox ic to humans in relati vely low concentrations. Ov er-ex posure to this gas mix ture can cause skin or eye irritation, nausea, dizziness, headaches, co llapse, unconsciousness, coma , and death. Additionally , releases of this gas m ixture may produce ox ygen-deficient atmospheres (especially in sma ll confined spaces or ot her poorly -ventilated env ironments); MS OF OVER-EXPO SURE BY RO UTE O F EXPO SURE : The most significant route of over-exposure for this gas mixture is by inhalation. NON-F LAMMA BLE GA S MIXT URE MSDS - 50018 EFFECTIVE DA TE: JUNE 7, 2010 PAGE 1 OF 6 INHA LATION: Due to the small size of an individual cylinder of this gas mixture, no unusual health effects from over-exposure to the produc t are anticipated under rout ine circumstances of use. A potential health hazard associated w ith this gas mixture is the potential of inhalation of Hydrogen Sulfide, a component of this gas mixture. Such over-exposures may occur if this gas mixture is used in a confined s pace or other poorly -ventilated area. Over-exposures to Hy drogen Sulfide can cause dizziness, headac he, and nausea. Over-exposure to this gas could result in respiratory arrest, coma, or unconsciousness, due to the presence of Hy drogen Sulfide. Continuous inhalation of low conc entrations of Hydrogen Sulfide may cause olfactory fatigue, so that the odor is no longer an effective warning of the presence of this gas. A summary of exposure concentrations and observed effects are as follow s: CONCENTRA TION OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE OBSERVED EFFECT 0.3-30 ppm Odor is unpleasant. 50 ppm Eye irritation. Dry ness and irritation of nose, throat. Slightly higher than 50 ppm Irritation of the respiratory system. 100-150 ppm Temporary loss of smell. 200-250 ppm Headache, vomiting nausea. Prolonged exposure may lead to lung damage. Exposures of 4-8 hours can be fatal.

Death occurs w ithin 0.5 - 1 hour of exposure. > 600 ppm Rapid onset of unconsciousness, coma, death. > 1000 ppm Immediate respiratory arrest. NOTE: This gas mixture contai ns a maximum of 250 ppm Hy drogen Sulfi de. The higher concentration values here are presented to delineate the complete health effects which have been observed for humans after exposure to Hy drogen Sulf ide. 3. HAZARD IDENTIFICATION (continued) Inhalation over-exposures to at mospheres containing more than the Threshold Limit Value of Ca rbon Monoxide (25 ppm), another co mponent of this gas mixture, can result in serious health consequences. Carbon M onoxide is classified as a c hemical asphy xiant, producing a toxic action by combining w ith the hemoglobin of the blood and replacing the available oxy gen. Through this replacement, the body is deprived of the required oxygen, and asphy xiation occurs. Since t he affinity of Carbon Monoxide for hemoglobi n is about 200-300 times that of oxy gen, o nly a small amount of Carbon Monox ide will cause a tox ic reaction to occur. Car bon Monox ide ex posures in ex cess of 50 ppm w ill produce sy mptoms o f poisoning if breathed for a sufficiently long time. If this gas mixture is released in a small, poorly ventilated area (i.e. an enclosed or confined space), sy mptoms which may develop include the follow ing: CONCENTRA TION OF CARBON MONOXIDE OBSERVED EFFECT All exposure levels: Over-exposure to Carbon Monox ide can be indicated by the lips and fingernails turning bright red. 200 ppm: Slight sy mptoms (i.e. headache) after several hours of exposure. 400 ppm: Headache and discomfort exper ienced w ithin 2-3 hours of exposure. 1,000 -2000 ppm: Within 30 minutes, slight palpitations of the heart occu rs. Within 1.5 hours, there is a tendency to stagger. 200-2500 ppm: Within 2 hours, there is mental confusion, headaches, and nausea. Unconsciousness w ithin 30 minutes. >2500 ppm: Potential for collapse and death before w arning sy mptoms. Additionally , if mixtures of this gas mi xture contain less than 19.5% Oxy gen and are re leased in a small, poorly ventilated are a (i.e. an enclosed or confined space), an oxy gen-defici ent environment may occur. Individuals breathing such an atmosphere may experience sy mptoms w hich include headaches, ringing in ears, dizziness, drow siness, unconsciousness, nausea, vomiting, and depression of all the senses. Under some circumstances of over-exposure, death may occur. The follow ing effects associated w ith various levels of oxy gen are as follow s: CONCENTRA TION OF OXYGEN OBSERVED EFFECT 12-16% Oxy gen: Breathing and pulse rate incr eased, muscular coordination slightly disturbed. 10-14% Oxygen: Emotional upset, abnormal fatigue, disturbed respiration. 6-10% Oxygen: Nausea, vomiting, collapse, or loss of consciousness. Below 6%: Convulsive movements, possible respiratory collapse, and death. SKIN and EYE CO NTACT: Hydrogen Sulfide, a component of this gas mixture, may be irritating to the skin. Inflamma tion and irritation of the ey es can occur at very low airborne concentration of Hydrogen Sulfide (less than 10 ppm). Exposure ov er several hours result in \"gas ey es\" or \"sore burning. Above 50 ppm of Hy drogen Sulfide, there is an inte nse tearing, blurring of vision, and pain w hen looking at light. Over-exposed individuals may see rings around bright lights. Most sy mptoms disappe ar when exposure ceases. How ever, in serious cases, the ey e can be permanently damaged. HEALTH EFFECTS O R RISKS FRO M EXPO SURE: A n Explanation in Lay Terms . Over-exposure to this gas mixture may cause the follow ing health effects: ACUTE : Due to the small size of the individual cy linder of this gas mixture, no unusual health effe cts from exposure to the product are anticipated under routine circumstances of use. How ever the Hy drogen Sulf ide and Carbon Monoxide components of this gas mixture are toxic to humans. Over-exposure to this gas mi xture can cause nausea, dizziness, headaches, collapse, unconsciousness, coma, and death. Due to t he presence of Hydrogen Sulfide, over-exposures to this gas mixture can also irritate the skin and ey es; severe ey e contamination can result i n blindness.

SOLUBILITY RATE (nBuAc = 1): Not applicable. EXPANSION RATIO: Not applicable. VAPOR PRESSURE @ 70\u00b0F (21.1\u00b0C) (psig) : Not applicable. SPECIFIC VOLUME (ft3/lb): 13.8 COEFFICIENT WATER/OIL DISTRIBUTION : Not applicable. The following information is for this gas mixture. ODOR THRESHOLD : 0.13 ppm (Hydrogen Sulfide) APPEARANCE AND COLOR: This gas mixture is a colorle ss gas which has an rotten egg-like odor, due to the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide. HOW TO DETECT THIS SUBS TANCE (warning properties): Continuous inhalation of low concentra tions of this gas mixture may cause olfactory fatigue, due to the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide, so t he odor is not a good warning property of a release of this gas mixture. In terms of leak detection, fittings and joints can be painted with a soap solution to detec t leaks, which will be indicated by a bubble fo rmation. Wet lead acetate paper can be used for leak detection. The paper turns black in the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide. Cadmium chloride sol utions can also be used. Cadmium solutions will turn yellow upon contact with Hydrogen Sulfide. 10. STABILITY and REACTIVITY STABILITY : Normally stable in gaseous state. DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS : The thermal decomposition products of Methane in clude carbon oxides. The decomposition products of Hydrogen Sulfide include water and sulfur oxides. The other com ponents of this gas mixture do not decompose, per se, but can r eact with other compounds in the heat of a fire. MATERIALS WITH WHICH SUBSTANCE IS INCOMPATIBLE : Titanium will burn in Nitrogen (the main component of this gas mixture). Lithium reacts slowly with Nitrogen at ambient temperatures. Components of this gas mixture (Hydrogen Sulfide, Methane) are also incom patible with strong oxidizers (i.e. chlorine, bromine pentafluoride, oxygen, oxygen difluoride, and nitrogen trifluoride). Carbon Monoxide is mildly corrosive to nickel and iron (especially at high temperatures and pressures). Hydrogen Sulfide is co rrosive to most metals, because it reac ts with these substances to form metal sulfides. HAZARDOUS POLYMERIZATION : Will not occur. CONDITIONS TO AVOID : Contact with incompatible materials. Cylinders exposed to high temperatures or direct flame can rupture or burst.

SENSITIZATION OF PRODUCT: The components of this gas mixture are not k nown to be skin or respiratory sensitizers. REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY INFORMATION : Listed below is information concerning the effe cts of this gas mixture on the human reproductive system. Mutagenicity : The components of this gas mixture are not reported to cause mutagenic effects in humans. REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY INFORMATION (continued) : Embryotoxicity : This gas mixture contains components t hat may cause embryotoxic effects in humans; however, due to the small total amount of the components, embryotoxic effects are not expected to occur. Teratogenicity : This gas mixture is not expected to cause teratogenic effects in humans due to the small cylinder size and small total amount of all components. The Carbon Monoxide component of this gas mixture wh ich exists up to 1%, can cause teratogenic effects in humans. Severe exposure to Carbon Monoxide during pregnancy has caused adverse effects and the death of the fetus. In general, maternal symptoms are an indicator of the potential risk to the fetus since Carbon Monoxi de is toxic to the mother before it is toxic to the fetus. Reproductive Toxicity : The components of this gas mixture are not report ed to cause adverse reproductive effects in humans. A mutagen is a chemical which causes permanent changes to genetic material (DNA) such t hat the changes will propagate through generation lines. An embryotoxin is a chemical which causes damage to a developing embryo (i.e. within the firs t eight weeks of pregnancy in humans), but the damage does not propagate across generational lines. A teratogen is a chemical which causes damage to a developing fetus, but the damage does not propagate across generational lines. A reproductive toxin is any substance which interferes in any way with the reproductive process. BIOLOGICAL EXPOSURE INDICES (BEIs) : Biological Exposure Indices (BEIs) have been deter mined for components of this gas mixture, as follows: CHEMICAL DETERMINANT SAMPLING TIME BEI CARBON MONOXIDE Carboxyhemoglobin in blood Carbon monoxide in end-exhaled air End of shift End of shift 3.5% of hemoglobin 20 ppm 12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION ENVIRONMENTAL STABILITY: The gas will be dissipated rapidly in well-ventilated ar eas. The following environmental data are applicable to the components of this gas mixture. CARBON MONOXIDE: Atmospheric Fate: A photochemical model was used to quant ify the sensitivity of the tropospheric oxidants ozone (O 3) and OH to changes in methane (CH 4), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and NO emissions and to perturbations in climate and strato spheric chemistry. In most cases, increased CH 4 and CO emissions will suppress OH (negative coefficients) in increased O 3 (positive coefficients) ex cept in areas where NO and O 3 influenced by pollution are sufficient to in creased OH. In most regions, NO, CO, and CH 4 emission increased will suppress OH and increased O 3, but these trends may be opposed by strato spheric O3 depletion and climate change. HYDROGEN SULFIDE: Water Solubility = 1 g/242 mL at 20 \u00b0C. Plant toxicity: Continuous fumigation of plants with 300 or 3000 ppb Hydrogen Sulfi de caused leaf lesions, defoliation, and re duced growth with severity of injury correlated to dose. At higher (3.25 and 5.03 ppm) Hydrogen Sulfide, signific ant reductions in leaf CO2 and water vapor exchanges occurred, and stomatal openings we re depressed. When Hydrogen Sulfide gas was applied to 29 species of green plants for 5 hours, young, rapidly elongating tissues were more sensitive to injury than older ti ssues. Symptoms included scorching of youn g shoots and NON-FLAMMABLE GAS MIXTURE MSDS - 50018 EFFECTIVE DATE: JUNE 7, 2010 PAGE 5 OF 6 12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION(continued) leaves, basal and marginal scorchi ng of older leaves. Mature l eaves were unaffected. Seeds exposed to Hydrogen Sulfide gas showed delay in germination. Persistence: Converts to elem ental sulfur upon standing in water. Major Species Threatened: Aquatic and animal life plants ma y be injured if exposed to 5 ppm in air over 24 hours. Biodegradation: Microorganisms in soil and water are involved in oxidation-reduction r eactions that oxidize hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur. Members of the genera Beggiatoa, Thioploca, and Thiotrix function in transition zones bet ween aerobic and anaerobic conditions where both molecular oxygen and hydrogen sulfide are found. Also, some photosyn thetic bacteria oxidize hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfu r. Members of the families Chlorobiaceae and Chromatiaceae (purple sulfur bac teria) are obligate aerobes and are phototropic, and are found i n waters with high H 2S concentrations. The interactions of these or ganisms form part of the global sulfur cycle. Bioconcentration: Does not have bioaccumula tion or food chain contamination potential. NITROGEN: Water Solubility = 2.4 volumes Nitrogen/100 volumes water at 0 \u00b0C; 1.6 volumes Nitrogen/100 volumes water at 20\u00b0 C. EFFECT OF MATERIAL ON PLANTS or ANIMALS: No evidence is currently available on this gas mixture's effects on plant and animal life.

HAZARD IDENTIFICATION EMERGENCY OVERVIEW: This is a colorless, odorlessgasmixture.Releases of this gas mixture may produce oxygen-deficient atmospheres (especially in confined spaces or other poorly-ventilated environments); individuals in such atmospheres may be asphyxiated. Isobutylene, a component of this gas mixture, may cause drowsiness and other central nervous system effects in high concentrations; however, due to its low concentration in this gas mixture, this is unlikely to occur. SYMPTOMSOFOVER-EXPOSURE BY ROUTE OF EXPOSURE: The most significant route of over-exposure for this gas mixture is by inhalation. INHALATION: Due to the small size of an individual cylinder of this gas mixture, nounusual health effects from over-exposure tothe product are anticipated under routine circumstances of use. The chief health hazard associatedwiththis gas mixture is when this gas mixture contains less than 19.5% Oxygenand is released in a small, poorly-ventilated area (i.e. an enclosed or confined space). Under this circumstance, an oxygen-deficient environment may occur. Individuals breathing such an atmosphere may experience symptoms which include headaches, ringing in ears, dizziness, drowsiness, unconsciousness, nausea, vomiting, and depression of all the senses. Under some circumstances of over-exposure, death may occur. The effects associated with various levels of oxygen are as follows: NON-FLAMMABLE GAS MIXTURE MSDS - 50054 EFFECTIVE DATE:MAY 5, 2008 PAGE 1 OF 4 CONCENTRATION OF OXYGEN OBSERVED EFFECT 12-16%Oxygen: Breathingandpulse rate increase, muscular coor- dination slightly disturbed. 10-14%Oxygen: Emotional upset, abnormal fatigue, disturbed respiration. 6-10% Oxygen: Nausea, vomiting, collapse, or loss of consciousness. Below 6%: Convulsivemovements, possible respiratory collapse, and death. HEALTH EFFECTS OR RISKS FROM EXPOSURE: An Explanation inLayTerms. Over- exposure to this gas mixture maycause the following health effects: ACUTE: Due to the small size of the individual cylinder of this gas mixture,nounusual health effects from exposure to the product are anticipated under routine circumstancesof use. The most significant hazard associated with this gas mixture when it containslessthan 19.5%oxygenisthe potential for exposure to oxygen-deficient atmospheres. Symptoms of oxygen deficiency include respiratory difficulty, ringing in ears, headaches, shortnessof breath, wheezing, headache, dizziness, indigestion, nausea, unconsciousness, and death. The skin of a victim of over-exposure may have a blue color. Additionally, Isobutylene, a component of this gas mixture, may cause drowsiness or central nervous system effects in high concentrations; however, due to its low concentration in this gas mixture, this is unlikely to occur.

FIRST-AID MEASURES RESCUERS SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO RETRIEVE VICTIMSOF EXPOSURE TO THIS GAS MIXTURE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. At a minimum, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus must be worn. No unusual health effects are anticipated after exposure to this gas mixture, due to the small cylinder size. If any adverse symptom develops after over-exposure to this gas mixture, remove victim(s) to fresh air as quickly as possible. Only trained personnel should administer supplemental oxygenand/orcardio-pulmonary resuscitation if necessary. Victim(s) who experience any adverse effect after over-exposure to this gas mixture must be taken for medical attention. Rescuers should be taken for medical attention if necessary. Take a copy of the label and the MSDS to physician or other health professional with victim(s). MEDICAL CONDITIONS AGGRAVATED BY EXPOSURE: Acute or chronic respiratoryconditionsmay be aggravated by over-exposure to this gas mixture. RECOMMENDATIONS TO PHYSICIANS: Administer oxygen, if necessary;treat symptoms and eliminate exposure. 5.

UNUSUAL FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARDS: This gas mixture isnotflammable; however, containers, when involved in fire, may rupture or burst in the heat of the fire. Explosion Sensitivity to Mechanical Impact: Not sensitive. Explosion Sensitivity to Static Discharge: Not sensitive. SPECIAL FIRE-FIGHTING PROCEDURES: Structural firefighters must wear Self- Contained Breathing Apparatus and full protective equipment. 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES LEAK RESPONSE: Due to the small size and contentofthecylinder,anaccidental release of this gas mixture presents significantly less risk of an oxygen deficient environment and other safety hazards than a similar releasefrom a larger cylinder. However, as with any chemical release, extreme caution must be used during emergencyresponse procedures. In the event of a releaseinwhich the atmosphere is unknown, and in which other chemicals are potentially involved, evacuate immediate area. Such releases should be responded to bytrainedpersonnel using pre- planned procedures. Proper protective equipment should be used. In case of a leak, clear the affected area, protect people, and respond with trained personnel. Allow the gas mixture to dissipate.Ifnecessary,monitorthesurrounding area (and the original area of the release) for oxygen. Oxygen levels must be above 19.5% before non-emergency personnel are allowed to re-enter area. If leaking incidentally from the cylinder, contact your supplier. 7. HANDLING and USE WORKPRACTICES AND HYGIENE PRACTICES: Be aware of any signs of dizziness or fatigue; exposures to fatal concentrations of this gas mixture could occur without any significant warningsymptoms, due to oxygen deficiency. Do not attempt to repair, adjust, or in any other way modify the cylinders containing this gas mixture. If there is a malfunction or another type of operational problem, contact nearest distributor immediately. STORAGE AND HANDLING PRACTICES:Cylinders should be firmly secured to prevent falling or being knocked-over. Cylinders must be protected from the environment, and preferably kept at room temperature (approximately 21!C [70!F]). Cylinders should be stored in dry, well- ventilated areas, away from sources of heat, ignition, and direct sunlight. Protect cylinders against physical damage. Full and empty cylinders should be segregated. Use a first-in, first-out inventory system to prevent full containers from being stored for longperiods of time. These cylinders are not refillable. WARNING! Do not refill DOT 39 cylinders. To do so may cause personal injury or property damage. SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR HANDLING GAS CYLINDERS: WARNING! Compressed gases can present significant safety hazards. During cylinder use, use equipment designed for these specific cylinders. Ensure all lines and equipment are rated for proper service pressure. PROTECTIVE PRACTICES DURING MAINTENANCE OF CONTAMINATED EQUIPMENT: Follow practices indicated in Section 6 (Accidental Release Measures). Make certain that application equipment is locked and tagged-out safely. Always use product in areas where adequate ventilation is provided. 8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS - PERSONAL PROTECTION VENTILATION AND ENGINEERING CONTROLS: No special ventilationsystemsor engineering controls are needed under normal circumstances of use. As with all chemicals,usethis gas mixture in well-ventilated areas. If this gas mixture is used in a poorly-ventilated area, install automatic monitoring equipment to detect the levels of Nitrous Oxide and Oxygen. RESPIRATORY PROTECTION:Nospecialrespiratory protection is required under normal circumstances of use. Maintain oxygen levels above 19.5% in the workplace.

Residual gas in this type of cylinder is not an issue because toxic gas mixtures are prohibited. Calibration gas mixtures typically packaged in these cylinders are Nonflammablen.o.s.,UN 1956. A small percentage of calibration gases packaged in DOT 39 cylinders are flammable or oxidizing gas mixtures. For disposal of used DOT-39 cylinders, it is acceptable to place them in a landfill if local laws permit. Their disposal is no different than that employed with other DOT containers such as spray paint cans, household aerosols, or disposable cylinders of propane (for camping, torch etc.). When feasible, we recommended recycling for scrap metal content.CALGAZwilldothis for any customer that wishes to return cylinders to us prepaid. All that is required is a phone call tomakearrangements so we may anticipate arrival. Scrapping cylinders involves some preparation before the metal dealer may accept them. We performthisoperation as a service to valued customers who wantto participate.

Vapors may be ignited rapidly when exposed to heat, spark, open flame or other source of ignition. When mixed with air and exposed to an ignition source, flammable vapor s can burn in the open or explode in confined spaces. Being heavier than air, vapors may travel long distances to an ignition source and flash back. Runoff to sewer may cause fire or explosion hazard. Hazardous Combustion Products Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and non-combusted hydrocarbons (smoke). Extinguishing Media SMALL FIRES: Any extinguisher suitable for Class B fires, dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fire fighting foam, or gaseous extinguishing agent. LARGE FIRES: Water spray, fog or fire fighting foam. Water may be ineffective for fighting the fire, but may be used to cool fire-exposed containers. Unsuitable Extinguishing Media None Fire Fighting Equipment/Instructions Small fires in the incipient (beginning) stage may typically be extinguished using handheld portable fire extinguishers and other fire fighting equipment. Firefighting ac tivities that may result in potential exposure to high heat, smoke or toxic by-products of combustion shou ld require NIOSH/MSHA- appr oved pressure-demand self- contained breathing apparatus with full facepiece and full protective clothing. Isolate area around container involved in fire. Cool tanks, shells, and containers expo sed to fire and excessive heat with water. For massive fires the use of unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzl es may be advantageous to further minimize personnel exposure. Major fires may require withdrawal, allowing the tank to burn. Large storage tank fires typically require specially trained personnel and equipment to extinguish t he fire, often including the need for properly applied fire fighting foam. * * * Section 6 - Accidental Release Measures * * * Recovery and Neutralization Carefully contain and stop the source of the spill, if safe to do so.

If spontaneous vomiting occurs, keep head below hips, or if patient is lying down, turn body and head to side to prevent aspiration and monitor for breathing difficulty. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Keep affected person warm and at rest. GET IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION. Most important signs and symptoms, both short-term and delayed with overexposure Adverse Effects: Irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. Symptoms may include redness, itching, and inflammation. May cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and signs of nervous system depression: headache, drowsiness, dizziness, loss of coordination, disorientation and fatigue. Aspiration hazard. May cause coughing, chest pains, shortness of breath, pulmonary edema and/or chemical pneumonitis. Repeated or prolonged skin contact may cause drying, reddening, itching and cracking. Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed Notes To Physician: INHALATION: This material (or a component) sensitizes the myocardium to the effects of sympathomimetic amines. Epinephrine and other sympathomimetic drugs may initiate cardiac arrhythmias in individuals exposed to this material. Administration of sympathomimetic drugs should be avoided. SKIN: Leaks or accidents involving high-pressure equipment may inject a stream of material through the skin and initially produce an injury that may not appear serious. Only a small puncture wound may appear on the skin surface but, without proper treatment and depending on the nature, original pressure, volume, and location of the injected material, can compromise blood supply to an affected body part. Prompt surgical debridement of the wound may be necessary to prevent irreversible loss of function and/or the affected body part. High pressure injection injuries may be SERIOUS SURGICAL EMERGENCIES. INGESTION: This material represents a significant aspiration and chemical pneumonitis hazard. Induction of emesis is not recommended. 5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES Suitable extinguishing media For small fires, Class B fire extinguishing media such as CO2, dry chemical, foam (AFFF/ATC) or water spray can be used. For large fires, water spray, fog or foam (AFFF/ATC) can be used. Firefighting should be attempted only by those who are adequately trained and equipped with proper protective equipment. Unsuitable extinguishing media Do not use straight water streams to avoid spreading fire. Specific hazards arising from the chemical This product has been determined to be an extremely flammable liquid per the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard and should be handled accordingly. May accumulate electrostatic charge and ignite or explode. Vapors may travel along the ground or be moved by ventilation and ignited by many sources such as pilot lights, sparks, electric motors, static discharge, or other ignition sources at locations distant from material handling. Flashback can occur along vapor trail. For additional fire related information, see NFPA 30 or the Emergency Response Guidebook 128. Hazardous combustion products Smoke, carbon monoxide, and other products of incomplete combustion. Explosion data Sensitivity to Mechanical Impact No. Sensitivity to Static Discharge Yes. SDS ID NO.: 0127MAR019 Product name: Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades0127MAR019 Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Page 4 of 23Revision Date: 06/01/2016_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters Firefighters should wear full protective clothing and positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with a full face-piece, as appropriate. Avoid using straight water streams. Water may be ineffective in extinguishing low flash point fires, but can be used to cool exposed surfaces. Avoid excessive water spray application. Water spray and foam (AFFF/ATC) must be applied carefully to avoid frothing and from as far a distance as possible. Keep run-off water out of sewers and water sources. Additional firefighting tactics FIRES INVOLVING TANKS OR CAR/TRAILER LOADS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after the fire is out. Do not direct water at source of leak or safety devices; icing may occur. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles: if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. EVACUATION: Consider initial downwind evacuation for at least 1000 feet. If tank, rail car or tank truck is involved in a fire, ISOLATE for 5280 feet (1 mile) in all directions; also, consider initial evacuation of 5280 feet (1 mile) in all directions. 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES Personal precautions: Keep public away. Isolate and evacuate area. Shut off source if safe to do so. Eliminate all ignition sources. Protective equipment: Use personal protection measures as recommended in Section 8. Emergency procedures: Advise authorities and National Response Center (800-424-8802) if the product has entered a water course or sewer. Notify local health and pollution control agencies, if appropriate. Environmental precautions: Avoid release to the environment. Avoid subsoil penetration. Ethanol in gasoline phase seperates in contact with water. Monitor downstream for dissolved ethanol or other appropriate indicators. Methods and materials for containment:Contain liquid with sand or soil. Prevent spilled material from entering storm drains, sewers, and open waterways.

Use only non-sparking tools. Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Avoid breathing fumes, gas, or vapors. Use only with adequate ventilation. Avoid repeated and prolonged skin contact. Use personal protection measures as recommended in Section 8. Exercise good personal hygiene including removal of soiled clothing and prompt washing with soap and water. Do not cut, drill, grind or weld on empty containers since explosive residues may remain. Refer to applicable EPA, OSHA, NFPA and consistent state and local requirements. Hydrocarbons are basically non-conductors of electricity and can become electrostatically charged during mixing, filtering, pumping at high flow rates or loading and transfer operations. If this charge reaches a sufficiently high level, sparks can form that may ignite the vapors of flammable liquids. Sudden release of hot organic chemical vapors or mists from process equipment operating under elevated temperature and pressure, or sudden ingress of air into vacuum equipment may result in ignition of vapors or mists without the presence of obvious ignition sources. Nozzle spouts must be kept in contact with the containers or tank during the entire filling operation. Portable containers should never be filled while in or on a motor vehicle or marine craft. Containers should be placed on the ground. Static electric discharge can ignite fuel vapors when filling non-grounded containers or vehicles on trailers. The nozzle spout must be kept in contact with the container before and during the entire filling operation. Use only approved containers. A buildup of static electricity can occur upon re-entry into a vehicle during fueling especially in cold or dry climate conditions. The charge is generated by the action of dissimilar fabrics (i.e., clothing and upholstery) rubbing across each other as a person enters/exits the vehicle. A flash fire can result from this discharge if sufficient flammable vapors are present. Therefore, do not get back in your vehicle while refueling. Cellular phones and other electronic devices may have the potential to emit electrical charges (sparks). Sparks in potentially explosive atmospheres (including fueling areas such as gas stations) could cause an explosion if sufficient flammable vapors are present. Therefore, turn off cellular phones and other electronic devices when working in potentially explosive atmospheres or keep devices inside your vehicle during refueling. High-pressure injection of any material through the skin is a serious medical emergency even though the small entrance wound at the injection site may not initially appear serious. These injection injuries can occur from high-pressure equipment such as paint spray or grease or guns, fuel injectors, or pinhole leaks in hoses or hydraulic lines and should all be considered serious. High pressure injection injuries may be SERIOUS SURGICAL EMERGENCIES (See First Aid Section 4). Storage Conditions: Store in properly closed containers that are appropriately labeled and in a cool, well-ventilated area. Do not store near an open flame, heat or other sources of ignition. Incompatible Materials Strong oxidizing agents. 8.

In a similar study, no increased risk of kidney cancer was observed among petroleum refinery workers, but there was a slight trend in the incidence of kidney cancers among service station employees, especially after a 30-year latency period. Altered mental state, drowsiness, damage (so-called Petrol Sniffer's Encephalopathy), delirium, seizures, and sudden death have been reported from repeated overexposure to some hydrocarbon solvents, naphthas, and gasoline. ISOPARAFFINS: Studies in laboratory animals have shown that long-term exposure to similar materials (isoparaffins) can cause kidney damage and kidney cancer in male laboratory rats. However, in-depth research indicates that these findings are unique to the male rat, and that these effects are not relevant to humans. C9 AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS: A developmental inhalation study was conducted in laboratory mice. Increased implantation losses, reduced fetal weights, delayed ossification and an increased incidence of cleft palate were observed at the highest exposure level (1,500 ppm). This exposure level was extremely toxic to pregnant female mice (44% mortality). Reduced fetal body weights were also observed at 500 ppm. A multi-generation reproduction inhalation study was conducted in laboratory rats. Reductions in pup weights, pup weight gain, litter size, and pup survival were observed at 1,500 ppm, an exposure level at which significant maternal toxicity was observed. Reduced pup weight gain was also observed at 500 ppm. PENTANES: Studies of pentane isomers in laboratory animals indicate exposure to extremely high levels (roughly 10 vol.%) may induce cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) which may be serious or fatal. BUTANES: Studies in laboratory animals indicate exposure to extremely high levels of butanes (1-10 or higher vol.% in air) may cause cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) which may be serious or fatal. TOLUENE: Case studies of persons abusing toluene suggest isolated incidences of adverse effects on the fetus including birth defects. Abuse of toluene at high concentrations (e.g., glue sniffing and solvent abuse) has been associated with adverse effects on the liver, kidney and nervous system, and can cause CNS depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. Studies of workers indicate longterm exposure may be related to impaired color vision and hearing. Some studies of workers suggest longterm exposure may be related to neurobehavioral and cognitive changes. Some of these effects have been observed in laboratory animals following repeated exposure to high levels of toluene. Several studies of workers suggest longterm exposure may be related to small increases in spontaneous abortions and changes in some gonadotropic hormones. However, the weight of evidence does not indicate toluene is a reproductive hazard to humans. Studies in laboratory animals indicate some changes in reproductive organs following high levels of exposure, but no significant effects on mating performance or reproduction were observed. Case studies of persons abusing toluene suggest isolated incidences of adverse effects on the fetus including birth defects. Findings in laboratory animals have been largely negative. Positive findings include small increases in minor skeletal and visceral malformations and developmental delays following very high levels of maternal exposure. Studies of workers indicate long-term exposure may be related to effects on the liver, kidney and blood, but these appear to be limited to changes in serum enzymes and decreased leukocyte counts. Adverse effects on the liver, kidney, thymus and nervous system were observed in animal studies following very high levels of exposure. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear at this time. XYLENES, ALL ISOMERS: Overexposure to xylene may cause upper respiratory tract irritation, headache, cyanosis, blood serum changes, nervous system damage and narcosis. Effects may be increased by the use of alcoholic beverages. Evidence of liver and kidney impairment were reported in workers recovering from a gross overexposure. Effects from Prolonged or Repeated Exposure: Impaired neurological function was reported SDS ID NO.: 0127MAR0190127MAR019 Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Product name: Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Page 10 of 23Revision Date: 06/01/2016_____________________________________________________________________________________________ in workers exposed to solvents including xylene. Studies in laboratory animals have shown evidence of impaired hearing following high levels of exposure. Studies in laboratory animals suggest some changes in reproductive organs following high levels of exposure but no significant effects on reproduction were observed. Studies in laboratory animals indicate skeletal and visceral malformations, developmental delays, and increased fetal resorptions following extremely high levels of maternal exposure with evidence of maternal toxicity. The relevance of these observations to humans is not clear at this time. Adverse effects on the liver, kidney, bone marrow (changes in blood cell parameters) were observed in laboratory animals following high levels of exposure. The relevance of these observations to humans is not clear at this time. 1,2,4-TRIMETHYLBENZENE: The following information pertains to a mixture of C9 aromatic hydrocarbons, over 40% of which was composed of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. A developmental inhalation study was conducted in laboratory mice. Increased implantation losses, reduced fetal weights, delayed ossification and an increased incidence of cleft palate were observed at the highest exposure level (1,500 ppm). This exposure level was extremely toxic to pregnant female mice (44% mortality). Reduced fetal body weights were also observed at 500 ppm. A multi-generation reproduction inhalation study was conducted in laboratory rats. Reductions in pup weights, pup weight gain, litter size, and pup survival were observed at 1,500 ppm, an exposure level at which significant maternal toxicity was observed. Reduced pup weight gain was also observed at 500 ppm. Embryotoxicity has been reported in studies of laboratory animals. Adverse effects included increased implantation losses, reduced fetal weights, delayed ossification and an increased incidence of cleft palate.<n><n> N-HEXANE: Long-term or repeated exposure to n-hexane can cause peripheral nerve damage. Initial symptoms are numbness of the fingers and toes. Also, motor weakness can occur in the digits, but may also involve muscles of the arms, thighs and forearms. The onset of these symptoms may be delayed for several months to a year after the beginning of exposure. Testicular atrophy and partial to full loss of the germ cell line were observed in sub-chronic high-dose inhalation studies of laboratory rodents. These effects appeared irreversible. Rodent reproduction studies have shown evidence of reduced fetal weight but no frank malformations. CUMENE: Overexposure to cumene may cause upper respiratory tract irritation and CNS depression. Studies in laboratory animals indicate evidence of respiratory tract hyperplasia, and adverse effects on the liver, kidney and adrenal glands following high level exposure. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear at this time. Findings from lifetime laboratory rodent inhalation studies were as follows: In F344/N rats: an increased incidence of renal carcinomas and adenomas, respiratory epithelial adenomas, and interstitial cell adenomas of the testes. In B6C3F1 mice: an increased incidence of carcinomas and adenomas of the bronchi and lung, liver neoplasms, hemangiosarcomas of the spleen, and adenomas of the thyroid. ETHYLBENZENE: Findings from a 2-year inhalation study in rodents conducted by NTP were as follows: Effects were observed only at the highest exposure level (750 ppm). At this level the incidence of renal tumors was elevated in male rats (tubular carcinomas) and female rats (tubular adenomas). The incidence of tumors was also elevated in male mice (alveolar and bronchiolar carcinomas) and female mice (hepatocellular carcinomas). benzene as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" (Group 2B). Studies in laboratory animals indicate some evidence of post-implantation deaths following high levels of maternal exposure. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear at this time. Studies in laboratory animals indicate limited evidence of renal malformations, resorptions, and developmental delays following high levels of maternal exposure with evidence of maternal toxicity. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear at this time. Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated evidence of ototoxicity (hearing loss) following exposure levels as low as 300 ppm for 5 days. Studies in laboratory animals indicate some evidence of adverse effects on the liver, kidney, thyroid, and pituitary gland. BENZENE: Studies of workers exposed to benzene show clear evidence that overexposure can cause cancer and other diseases of the blood forming organs including Acute SDS ID NO.: 0127MAR0190127MAR019 Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Product name: Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Page 11 of 23Revision Date: 06/01/2016_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), and Aplastic Anemia (AA), an often fatal disease. Some studies suggest overexposure to benzene may also be associated with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Findings from a case control study of workers exposed to benzene was reported during the 2009 Benzene Symposium in Munich included an increase in Acute Myeloid Leukemias (FL) in some occupational categories. Some studies of workers exposed to benzene have shown an association with increased rates of chromosome aberrations in circulating lymphocytes. One study of women workers exposed to benzene suggested a weak association with irregular menstruation. However, other studies of workers exposed to benzene have not demonstrated clear evidence of an effect on fertility or reproductive outcome in humans. Benzene can cross the placenta and affect the developing fetus. Cases of AA have been reported in the offspring of persons severely overexposed to benzene. Studies in laboratory animals indicate that prolonged, repeated exposure to high levels of benzene vapor can cause bone marrow suppression and cancer in multiple organ systems. Studies in laboratory animals show evidence of adverse effects on male reproductive organs following high levels of exposure but no significant effects on reproduction have been observed. Embryotoxicity has been reported in studies of laboratory animals but effects were limited to reduced fetal weight and minor skeletal variations. Benzene has been classified as a proven human carcinogen by OSHA and a Group 1 (Carcinogenic to Humans) material by IARC. The current proposed IARC classification for benzene is summarized as follows: Sufficient evidence for Acute Myeloid Leukemia; limited evidence for Acute Lymphatic Leukemia, Chronic Severe jaundice, neurotoxicity (kernicterus) and fatalities have been reported in young children and infants as a result of hemolytic anemia from overexposure to naphthalene. Persons with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to the hemolytic effects of naphthalene. Adverse effects on the kidney have been reported in persons overexposed to naphthalene but these effects are believed to be a consequence of hemolytic anemia, and not a direct effect. Hemolytic anemia has been observed in laboratory animals exposed to naphthalene. Laboratory rodents exposed to naphthalene vapor for 2 years (lifetime studies) developed non-neoplastic and neoplastic tumors and inflammatory lesions of the nasal and respiratory tract. Cataracts and other adverse effects on the eye have been observed in laboratory animals exposed to high levels of naphthalene. Findings from a large number of bacterial and mammalian cell mutation assays have been negative. A few studies have shown chromosomal effects (elevated levels of Sister Chromatid Exchange or chromosomal aberrations) in vitro. Naphthalene has been classified as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans (2B) by IARC, based on findings from studies in laboratory animals. CARBON MONOXIDE: is a chemical asphyxiant with no warning properties (such as odor). At 400-500 ppm for 1 hour headache and dyspnea may occur. If activity is increased, symptoms of overexposure may include nausea, irritability, increased respiration, tinnitus, sweating, chest pain, confusion, impaired judgement, dizziness, weakness, drowsiness, ataxia, irregular heart beat, cyanosis and pallor. Levels in excess of 1000 ppm can result in collapse, loss of conciousness, respiratory failure and death. Extremely high concentrations (12,800 ppm) can cause immediate unconsciousness and death in 1-3 minutes. Repeated anoxia can lead to central nervous system damage and peripheral neuropathy, with loss of sensation in the fingers, amnesia, and mental deterioration and possible congestive heart failure. Damage may also occur to the fetus, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, cardiovascular system and other organs. WHOLLY-VAPORIZED UNLEADED GASOLINE: Lifetime exposure to wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline produced an increased incidence of liver tumors in female mice exposed to the highest exposure concentration (2056 ppm) and -2 urinary globulin-mediated kidney tumors in male rats. No exposure-related tumors were observed in male mice or female rats. The male-specific rat kidney tumors are not considered relevant to human health. Mice receiving lifetime repeated skin application of various petroleum naphthas exhibited an irritation-dependent increased incidence of skin tumors. Additional studies suggest that these tumors occur through a mechanism that may not be relevant to human health.

Unleaded gasoline has been identified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). COMBUSTION ENGINE EXHAUST: Chronic inhalation studies of gasoline engine exhaust in mice, rats and hamsters did not produce any carcinogenic effects. Condensates/extracts of gasoline engine exhaust produced an increase in tumors compared to controls when testing by skin painting, subcutaneous injection, intratracheal instillation or implantation into the lungs. Gasoline exhaust has been classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Adverse effects related to the physical, chemical and toxicological characteristics Signs and Symptoms Irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. Symptoms may include redness, itching, and inflammation.

Ensure complete irrigation of the eye by keeping eyelids apart and away from eye and moving the eyelids by occasionally lifting the upper and lower lids. Seek medical attention without delay; if pain persists or recurs seek medical attention. Removal of contact lenses after an eye injury should only be undertaken by skilled personnel. Skin Contact If skin contact occurs: Immediately remove all contaminated clothing, including footwear. Flush skin and hair with running water (and soap if available). Seek medical attention in event of irritation. Inhalation If fumes or combustion products are inhaled remove from contaminated area. Lay patient down. Keep warm and rested. Prostheses such as false teeth, which may block airway, should be removed, where possible, prior to initiating first aid procedures. Apply artificial respiration if not breathing, preferably with a demand valve resuscitator, bag-valve mask device, or pocket mask as trained. Perform CPR if necessary. Transport to hospital, or doctor. Ingestion If swallowed do NOT induce vomiting. If vomiting occurs, lean patient forward or place on left side (head-down position, if possible) to maintain open airway and prevent aspiration. Observe the patient carefully. Never give liquid to a person showing signs of being sleepy or with reduced awareness; i.e. becoming unconscious. Give water to rinse out mouth, then provide liquid slowly and as much as casualty can comfortably drink. Seek medical advice. Most important symptoms and effects, both acute Print Date: 06/05/2017 Continued...See Section 11 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed for naphthalene intoxication: Naphthalene requires hepatic and microsomal activation prior to the production of toxic effects. Liver microsomes catalyse the initial synthesis of the reactive 1,2-epoxide intermediate which is subsequently oxidised to naphthalene dihydrodiol and alpha-naphthol. The 2-naphthoquinones are thought to produce haemolysis, the 1,2-naphthoquinones are thought to be responsible for producing cataracts in rabbits, and the glutathione-adducts of naphthalene-1,2-oxide are probably responsible for pulmonary toxicity. Suggested treatment regime: Induce emesis and/or perform gastric lavage with large amounts of warm water where oral poisoning is suspected. Instill a saline cathartic such as magnesium or sodium sulfate in water (15 to 30g). Demulcents such as milk, egg white, gelatin, or other protein solutions may be useful after the stomach is emptied but oils should be avoided because they promote absorption. If eyes/skin contaminated, flush with warm water followed by the application of a bland ointment. Severe anaemia, due to haemolysis, may require small repeated blood transfusions, preferably with red cells from a non-sensitive individual. Where intravascular haemolysis, with haemoglobinuria occurs, protect the kidneys by promoting a brisk flow of dilute urine with, for example, an osmotic diuretic such as mannitol. It may be useful to alkalinise the urine with small amounts of sodium bicarbonate but many researchers doubt whether this prevents blockage of the renal tubules. Use supportive measures in the case of acute renal failure. GOSSELIN, SMITH HODGE: Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products, 5th Ed.

Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The basic types of engineering controls are: Process controls which involve changing the way a job activity or process is done to reduce the risk. Enclosure and/or isolation of emission source which keeps a selected hazard \"physically\" away from the worker and ventilation that strategically \"adds\" and \"removes\" air in the work environment. Ventilation can remove or dilute an air contaminant if designed properly. The design of a ventilation system must match the particular process and chemical or contaminant in use. Employers may need to use multiple types of controls to prevent employee overexposure. Employees exposed to confirmed human carcinogens should be authorized to do so by the employer, and work in a regulated area. Work should be undertaken in an isolated system such as a \"glove-box\" . Employees should wash their hands and arms upon completion of the assigned task and before engaging in other activities not associated with the isolated system. Within regulated areas, the carcinogen should be stored in sealed containers, or enclosed in a closed system, including piping systems, with any sample ports or openings closed while the carcinogens are contained within. Open-vessel systems are prohibited. Each operation should be provided with continuous local exhaust ventilation so that air movement is always from ordinary work areas to the operation. Exhaust air should not be discharged to regulated areas, non-regulated areas or the external environment unless decontaminated. Clean make-up air should be introduced in sufficient volume to maintain correct operation of the local exhaust system. For maintenance and decontamination activities, authorized employees entering the area should be provided with and required to wear clean, impervious garments, including gloves, boots and continuous-air supplied hood. Prior to removing protective garments the employee should undergo decontamination and be required to shower upon removal of the garments and hood. Except for outdoor systems, regulated areas should be maintained under negative pressure (with respect to non-regulated areas). Local exhaust ventilation requires make-up air be supplied in equal volumes to replaced air. Laboratory hoods must be designed and maintained so as to draw air inward at an average linear face velocity of 0.76 m/sec with a minimum of 0.64 m/sec. Design and construction of the fume hood requires that insertion of any portion of the employees body, other than hands and arms, be disallowed. Personal protection Chemwatch: 9-407181 Catalogue number: Print Date: 06/05/2017 Continued...Eye and face protection Safety glasses with side shields. Chemical goggles. Contact lenses may pose a special hazard; soft contact lenses may absorb and concentrate irritants. A written policy document, describing the wearing of lenses or restrictions on use, should be created for each workplace or task. This should include a review of lens absorption and adsorption for the class of chemicals in use and an account of injury experience. Medical and first-aid personnel should be trained in their removal and suitable equipment should be readily available. In the event of chemical exposure, begin eye irrigation immediately and remove contact lens as soon as practicable. Lens should be removed at the first signs of eye redness or irritation - lens should be removed in a clean environment only after workers have washed hands thoroughly. [CDC NIOSH Current Intelligence Bulletin 59], [AS/NZS 1336 or national equivalent] Skin protection See Hand protection below Hands/feet protection Wear chemical protective gloves, e.g. PVC. Wear safety footwear or safety gumboots, e.g. Rubber NOTE: The material may produce skin sensitisation in predisposed individuals. Care must be taken, when removing gloves and other protective equipment, to avoid all possible skin contact. Contaminated leather items, such as shoes, belts and watch-bands should be removed and destroyed. The selection of suitable gloves does not only depend on the material, but also on further marks of quality which vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Where the chemical is a preparation of several substances, the resistance of the glove material can not be calculated in advance and has therefore to be checked prior to the application. The exact break through time for substances has to be obtained from the manufacturer of the protective gloves and has to be observed when making a final choice. Personal hygiene is a key element of effective hand care. Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturizer is recommended. Suitability and durability of glove type is dependent on usage. Important factors in the selection of gloves include: \u00b7 frequency and duration of contact, \u00b7 chemical resistance of glove material, \u00b7 glove thickness and \u00b7 dexterity Select gloves tested to a relevant standard (e.g. Europe EN 374, US F739, AS/NZS 2161.1 or national equivalent). \u00b7 When prolonged or frequently repeated contact may occur, a glove with a protection class of 5 or higher (breakthrough time greater than 240 minutes according to EN 374, AS/NZS 2161.10.1 or national equivalent) is recommended. \u00b7 When only brief contact is expected, a glove with a protection class of 3 or higher (breakthrough time greater than 60 minutes according to EN 374, AS/NZS 2161.10.1 or national equivalent) is recommended. \u00b7 Some glove polymer types are less affected by movement and this should be taken into account when considering gloves for long-term use. \u00b7 Contaminated gloves should be replaced. For general applications, gloves with a thickness typically greater than 0.35 mm, are recommended. It should be emphasised that glove thickness is not necessarily a good predictor of glove resistance to a specific chemical, as the permeation efficiency of the glove will be dependent on the exact composition of the glove material. Therefore, glove selection should also be based on consideration of the task requirements and knowledge of breakthrough times. Glove thickness may also vary depending on the glove manufacturer, the glove type and the glove model. Therefore, the manufacturers' technical data should always be taken into account to ensure selection of the most appropriate glove for the task. Note: Depending on the activity being conducted, gloves of varying thickness may be required for specific tasks. For example: \u00b7 Thinner gloves (down to 0.1 mm or less) may be required where a high degree of manual dexterity is needed. However, these gloves are only likely to give short duration protection and would normally be just for single use applications, then disposed of. \u00b7 Thicker gloves (up to 3 mm or more) may be required where there is a mechanical (as well as a chemical) risk i.e. where there is abrasion or puncture potential Gloves must only be worn on clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Application of a non-perfumed moisturiser is recommended. Body protection See Other protection below Other protection Employees working with confirmed human carcinogens should be provided with, and be required to wear, clean, full body protective clothing (smocks, coveralls, or long-sleeved shirt and pants), shoe covers and gloves prior to entering the regulated area. [AS/NZS ISO 6529:2006 or national equivalent] Employees engaged in handling operations involving carcinogens should be provided with, and required to wear and use half-face filter-type respirators with filters for dusts, mists and fumes, or air purifying canisters or cartridges. A respirator affording higher levels of protection may be substituted. [AS/NZS 1715 or national equivalent] Emergency deluge showers and eyewash fountains, supplied with potable water, should be located near, within sight of, and on the same level with locations where direct exposure is likely. Prior to each exit from an area containing confirmed human carcinogens, employees should be required to remove and leave protective clothing and equipment at the point of exit and at the last exit of the day, to place used clothing and equipment in impervious containers at the point of exit for purposes of decontamination or disposal. The contents of such impervious containers must be identified with suitable labels. For maintenance and decontamination activities, authorized employees entering the area should be provided with and required to wear clean, impervious garments, including gloves, boots and continuous-air supplied hood. Prior to removing protective garments the employee should undergo decontamination and be required to shower upon removal of the garments and hood.

Nevertheless inhalation of vapours, fumes or aerosols, especially for prolonged periods, may produce respiratory discomfort and occasionally, distress. Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual. Inhalation of naphthalene vapour is linked with headache, loss of appetite, nausea, damage to the eyes and kidneys. According to animal testing, long term exposure may cause excessive weakness and increased salivation, weight loss,difficulty breathing, collapse, and evidence of damage to the skin, liver and lungs. IngestionAccidental ingestion of the material may be damaging to the health of the individual. Ingestion of naphthalene and related compounds may produce abdominal cramps with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, profuse sweating, listlessness, confusion, and in severe poisonings, coma with or without convulsions. Irritation of the bladder may also occur, producing urgency, painful urination, and the passage of brown or black urine with or without albumin or casts. Skin ContactSkin contact is not thought to have harmful health effects (as classified under EC Directives); the material may still produce health damage following entry through wounds, lesions or abrasions. There is some evidence to suggest that this material can cause inflammation of the skin on contact in some persons. Workers sensitised to naphthalene and related compounds show an inflammation of the skin with scaling and reddening. Some individuals show an allergic reaction. Open cuts, abraded or irritated skin should not be exposed to this material Entry into the blood-stream, through, for example, cuts, abrasions or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected. EyeAlthough the liquid is not thought to be an irritant (as classified by EC Directives), direct contact with the eye may produce transient discomfort characterised by tearing or conjunctival redness (as with windburn). Long term exposure to naphthalene has produced clouding of the lens (cataracts) in workers. ChronicInhaling this product is more likely to cause a sensitisation reaction in some persons compared to the general population. Skin contact with the material is more likely to cause a sensitisation reaction in some persons compared to the general population. There is ample evidence that this material can be regarded as being able to cause cancer in humans based on experiments and other information. Based on experiments and other information, there is ample evidence to presume that exposure to this material can cause genetic defects that can be inherited. Ample evidence exists from experimentation that reduced human fertility is directly caused by exposure to the material. Animal testing indicates that inhalation of naphthalene may increase the incidence of respiratory tumours and may aggravate chronic inflammation. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are found in a number of materials such as coal tar, tobacco smoke, petroleum and air pollution. Some substituted derivatives have been identified as extremely liable to cause cancer, especially that of the lung and genito-urinary tract.

Vendor Data Very toxic to aquatic organisms, may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment. Do NOT allow product to come in contact with surface waters or to intertidal areas below the mean high water mark. Do not contaminate water when cleaning equipment or disposing of equipment wash-waters. Wastes resulting from use of the product must be disposed of on site or at approved waste sites. For naphthalene: Environmental Fate: Naphthalene may be reach surface water and soil through transportation in water or being carried by air. Most airborne naphthalene is in a vapour form and hence deposition is expected to be slow. A minimal amount of naphthalene emitted to the air is transported to other environmental components mostly by dry deposition. Naphthalene in surface water may volatililize into the atmosphere, depending on environmental condiditons. It remains in solution in water, with only small amounts associated with suspended material and benthic sediments. While naphthalene is readily volatilized from aerated soils, it adheres to soils with a high organic content. Adsorption to aquifer material reduces transportation of naphthalene through groundwater, and the presence of nonionic organic compounds such as tetrachloroethene may enhance sorption to materials that contain low carbon content. Bioconcentration of naphthalene is moderate in aquatic organisms. It is readily metabolized by fish, and invertebrates that are placed in pollutant free water rapidly eliminate any traces of the pollutant. While bioaccumulation in the food chain is unlikely, exposure of cows and chickens to naphthalene could lead to naphthalene being present in milk and eggs. While the data on the transport and partitioning of methylnaphthalenes in the environment is limited, the characteristics of these chemicals are similar to naphthalene, so they are expected to behave in a similar manner to naphthalene in the environment, and produce the same effects on aquatic organisms. Biodegradation of naphthalene occurs relatively quickly in aquatic systems. Methylnaphthalenes are biodegraded under aerobic conditions after adaptation. Degradation rates are highest in water constantly polluted with petroleum. Naphthalene biodegradation rates are higher in sediment than in the water column above it. Methylnaphthalenes biodegrades more slowly. Reported half-lives in sediments were 46 weeks for 1-methylnaphthalene and ranged from 14 to 50 weeks for 2-methylnaphthalene. In soils, the potential for biodegradation is an important factor for biological remediation of soil. Studies on biodegradation of PAHs suggest that adsorption to the organic matter significantly reduces the bioavailability for microorganisms, and thus the biodegradability, of PAHs, including naphthalene. Biodegradation is accomplished through the action of aerobic microorganisms and is reduced in anaerobic soil conditions. Naphthalene biodegrades to carbon dioxide in aerobic soils, with salicylate as an intermediate product. Abiotic degradation of naphthalene seldom occurs in soils. As with naphthalene, 1-Methylnaphthalene is easily volatilised from aerated soil, and the biodegradation half-life averages between 1.7 and 2.2 days. Ecotoxicity: Acute toxicity data on naphthalene for several fish species (freshwater and marine), show 96h LC50 values range from 1.8 to 7.8 mg/L. Comparable results were obtained with other vertebrates (amphibians). From chronic toxicity tests, a precise NOEL is not clearly determined. A NOEC of 0.12 mg/L was observed in a 40 days test on juvenile pink salmon, but 50% mortality at 0.11 mg/L was calculated for trout fry exposed during hatching.Several data are also available for invertebrates, showing 48h EC50 values ranging from 2.1 to 24 mg/L. While chronic data on freshwater invertebrates and algae are questionable, a 50% photosynthesis reduction was observed at 2.8 mg/L in 4 hours experiments.QSAR prediction models give results consistent with experimental short-term data on fish daphnia and algae. For Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH's): Environmental Fate: A general rule for biodegradation of PAHs is that parent compounds tend to degrade faster than alkylated analogs. Less is known about the biodegradability of resins and asphaltenes, but the current knowledge suggests these are not very biodegradable and will persist in the environment for a long time. The more hydrophobic a compound, the greater the partitioning to non-aqueous phases. Atmospheric Fate: PAHs travel through the atmosphere as a gas or attached to dust particles. They are carried by air currents and deposited by dry or wet (rain, dew, etc.) deposition. Aquatic Fate: When deposited in water PAHs sink to the bottom of lakes and rivers. Some will move though the soil to contaminate groundwater. PAHs are ubiquitous in the marine environment, occurring at their highest environmental concentrations around urban centres. The availability of organic carbon controls, to a large extent, the partitioning behaviour of PAHs in sediment. Mixed microbial populations in sediment/water systems may degrade some PAHs, with degradation progressively decreasing with increasing molecular weight. Terrestrial Fate: The rate of degradation is dependent on nutrient content and the bacterial community in soil. PAHs in soils undergo a weathering process such that the lighter chain fractions are removed (primarily by volatilization). Heavier fractions bind to soil organic matter and remain behind in the top soil horizon. As the mixture of PAHs age, bioavailability changes as the fraction remaining bind more tightly. In general, the more soluble a PAH, the higher the uptake by plants while the reverse is true for uptake by earthworms and uptake in the gastrointestinal tract of animals. Ecotoxicity: The primary mode of toxicity for PAHs in soil dwelling terrestrial invertebrates is non-specific non-polar narcosis. The uptake of PAHs by earthworms occurs primarily by direct contact with the soluble phase of soil solution. Microbial degradation of PAHs is a key process in soils. Biodegradation of PAHs may take place over a period of weeks to months. The lipid (fat) phase, of all organisms, contains the highest levels of PAHs. Accumulation of PAHs occurs in all marine organisms, however; there is a wide range in tissue concentrations resulting from variable environmental concentrations, level and time of exposure, and species ability to metabolize these compounds. In fish, bile and liver accumulate the highest levels of PAH and metabolites. In invertebrates, the highest concentrations can be found in the internal organs, such as the liver and pancreas; tissue concentrations appear to follow seasonal cycles which may be related to variations in lipid content or spawning cycles.

Return to supplier for reuse/ recycling if possible. Otherwise: If container can not be cleaned sufficiently well to ensure that residuals do not remain or if the container cannot be used to store the same product, then puncture containers, to prevent re-use, and bury at an authorised landfill. Where possible retain label warnings and SDS and observe all notices pertaining to the product. Legislation addressing waste disposal requirements may differ by country, state and/ or territory. Each user must refer to laws operating in their area. In some areas, certain wastes must be tracked. A Hierarchy of Controls seems to be common - the user should investigate: Reduction Reuse Recycling Disposal (if all else fails) This material may be recycled if unused, or if it has not been contaminated so as to make it unsuitable for its intended use. If it has been contaminated, it may be possible to reclaim the product by filtration, distillation or some other means. Shelf life considerations should also be applied in making decisions of this type. Note that properties of a material may change in use, and recycling or reuse may not always be appropriate. Chemwatch: 9-407181 Catalogue number: Print Date: 06/05/2017 Continued...DO NOT allow wash water from cleaning or process equipment to enter drains. It may be necessary to collect all wash water for treatment before disposal. In all cases disposal to sewer may be subject to local laws and regulations and these should be considered first. Where in doubt contact the responsible authority.

TEL (+61 06/05/2017 Print Date: MATERIAL (POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS) COMPOSITION/INFORMATION ON INGREDIENTS Ingredients Name: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) HAZARD IDENTIFICATION Reports of Carcinogenicity: YES HEALTH HAZARDS ACUTE AND CHRONIC ! Eyes: Moderately irritating to eye tissues. ! Skin: Can be absorbed through intact skin, may cause de-fatting, potential for chloracne. ! Inhalation: Possible liver injury. ! Ingestion: Slightly toxic; reasonably anticipated to be carcinogenic. EFFECTS OF OVER-EXPOSURE Can cause dermatological symptoms; however, these are reversible upon removal of exposure source. FIRST AID MEASURES !Eyes: Irrigate immediately with copious quantities of running water for at least 15 minutes if liquid or solid PCBs get into them. !Skin:Contaminated clothing should be removed and the skin washed thoroughly with soap and water. Hot PCBs may cause thermal burns. !Inhalation: Remove to fresh air; if skin rash or respiratory irritation persists, consult a physician (if electrical equipment arcs over, PCBs may decompose to produce hydrochloric acid). !Ingestion: Consult a physician. Do not induce vomiting or give any oily laxatives. (If large amounts are ingested, gastric lavage is suggested). PROCEDURES Standard fire-fighting wearing apparel and self-contained breathing apparatus should be worn when fighting fires that involve possible exposure to chemical combustion products. Fire fighting equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and decontaminated after use. UNUSUAL FIRE/EXPLOSION HAZARD If a PCB transformer is involved in a fire-related incident, the owner of the transformer is required to report the incident. Consult and follow appropriate federal, provincial and local regulations. Note:When askarel liquid becomes involved in a fire, toxic by-products of combustion are typically produced including polychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, both known carcinogens. The structures of these chemical species are as follows: Note: 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin is one of the most potent teratogenic, mutagenic and carcinogenic agents known to man. SPILL RELEASE PROCEDURES Cleanup & disposal of liquid PCBs are strictly regulated by the federal government. Ventilate area. Contain spill/leak. Remove spill by means of absorptive material. Spill clean-up personnel should use proper protective clothing. All wastes and residues containing PCBs should be collected, containerized, marked and disposed of in the manner prescribed by applicable federal, provincial and local laws. HANDLING AND STORAGE PRECAUTIONS Care should be taken to prevent entry into the environment through spills, leakage, use, vaporization, or disposal of liquid. Avoid prolonged breathing of vapours or mists. Avoid contact with eyes or prolonged contact with skin. Comply with all federal, provincial and local regulations. OTHER PRECAUTIONS Federal regulations require PCBs, PCB items, storage areas, transformer vaults, and transport vehicles to be appropriately labelled. RESPIRATORY PROTECTION Use OHSA approved equipment when airborne exposure limits are exceeded. Full facepiece equipment is recommended and, if used, replaces need for face shield and/or chemical splash goggles. The respirator use limitations specified by the manufacturer must be observed. VENTILATION Provide natural or mechanical ventilation to control exposure levels below airborne exposure levels. PROTECTIVE GLOVES:Wear appropriate chemical resistant gloves to prevent skin contact. EYE PROTECTION: Wear chemical splash goggles and have eye baths available. OTHER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Wear appropriate protective clothing.

Symptoms of exposure may include cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, sneezing, wheezing and shortness of breath. Ingestion: Ingestion in an unlikely route of exposure. If dust is swallowed, it may irritate the mouth and throat. Skin contact: No adverse effects are expected. Eye contact: Particulates may cause abrasive injury. Chronic effects: Prolonged inhalation of respirable crystalline silica may cause lung disease, silicosis, lung cancer and other effects as indicated below. The method of exposure that can lead to the adverse health effects described below is inhalation. A. SILICOSIS The major concern is silicosis, caused by the inhalation of respirable crystalline silica dust. Silicosis can exist in several forms, chronic (or ordinary), accelerated, or acute. Chronic or Ordinary Silicosis is the most common form of silicosis, and can occur after many years (10 to 20 or more) of prolonged repeated inhalation of relatively low levels of airborne respirable crystalline silica dust. It is further defined as either simple or complicated silicosis. Simple silicosis is characterized by lung lesions (shown as radiographic opacities) less than 1 centimeter in diameter, primarily in the upper lung zones. Often, simple silicosis is not associated with symptoms, detectable changes in lung function or disability. Simple silicosis may be progressive and may develop into complicated silicosis or progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). Complicated silicosis or PMF is characterized by lung lesions (shown as Section 10: Stability and Reactivity Section 11: Toxicological Information U.S. SILICA COMPANY Safety Data Sheet Silica Sand, Ground Silica and Fine Ground Silica Page 6 of 9 radiographic opacities) greater than 1 centimeter in diameter. Complicated silicosis or PMF symptoms, if present, are shortness of breath and cough. Complicated silicosis or PMF may be associated with decreased lung function and may be disabling. Advanced complicated silicosis or PMF may lead to death. Advanced complicated silicosis or PMF can result in heart disease secondary to the lung disease (cor pumonale). Accelerated Silicosis can occur with prolonged repeated inhalation of high concentrations of respirable crystalline silica over a relatively short period; the lung lesions can appear within five (5) years of initial exposure. Progression can be rapid. Accelerated silicosis is similar to chronic or ordinary silicosis, except that lung lesions appear earlier and progression is more rapid. Acute Silicosis can occur after the repeated inhalation of very high concentrations of respirable crystalline silica over a short time period, sometimes as short as a few months. The symptoms of acute silicosis include progressive shortness of breath, fever, cough, weakness and weight loss. Acute silicosis is fatal. B. CANCER IARC - The International Agency for Research on Cancer (\"IARC\") concluded that \"crystalline silica in the form of quartz or cristobalite dust is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)\". For further information on the IARC evaluation, see IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 100C,\"A Review of Human Carcinogens: Arsenic, Metals, Fibres and Dusts \" (2011). C. AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES Several studies have reported excess cases of several autoimmune disorders, -- scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis -- among silica-exposed workers. D. TUBERCULOSIS Individuals with silicosis are at increased risk to develop pulmonary tuberculosis, if exposed to tuberculosis bacteria. Individuals with chronic silicosis have a three-fold higher risk of contracting tuberculosis than similar individuals without silicosis. E. KIDNEY DISEASE Several studies have reported excess cases of kidney diseases, including end stage renal disease, among silica-exposed workers. For additional information on the subject, the following may be consulted: \"Kidney Disease and Silicosis\", Nephron, Volume 85, pp. 14-19 (2000). F. NON-MALIGNANT RESPIRATORY DISEASES The reader is referred to Section 3.5 of the NIOSH Special Hazard Review cited below for information concerning the association between exposure to crystalline silica and chronic bronchitis, emphysema and small airways disease. There are studies that disclose an association between dusts found in various mining occupations and non-malignant respiratory diseases, particularly among smokers. It is unclear whether the observed associations exist only with underlying silicosis, only among smokers, or result from exposure to mineral dusts generally (independent of the presence or absence of crystalline silica, or the level of crystalline silica in the dust). Sources of information: The NIOSH Hazard Review - Occupational Effects of Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica published in April 2002 summarizes and discusses the medical and epidemiological literature on the health risks and diseases associated with occupational exposures to respirable crystalline silica. The NIOSH Hazard Review is available from NIOSH - Publications Dissemination, 4676 Columbia U.S. SILICA COMPANY Safety Data Sheet Silica Sand, Ground Silica and Fine Ground Silica Page 7 of 9 Parkway, Cincinnati, OH 45226, or through the NIOSH web site, www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/silica, then click on the link \"NIOSH Hazard Review: Health Effects of Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica\".

Taiwan BEI : 1 mg/l (before on duty). Engineering control 1. Process should be located at least 17 meter (50 feet) away from open flames and all high temperature operations likely to cause ignition of the styrene monomer vapor. 2. In venting styrene monomer vapors, consideration should be given to possible halogenation of the vapors by low concentrations of free chlorine and bromine with the resultant formation of lacrimations. 3. Process should be designed so that the operator is not exposed to direct contact with Toluene or the vapor. The technical problems of designing equipment, providing adequate ve ntilation and operating procedures which promise maximum security and economy, can best be handled by competent engineers. 4. It is essential for safety that equipment be used and maintained as recommended by the manufacturer. 5. Tanks used to store or process Toluene should be closed vessels vented to a safe point of discharge in the outside atmosphere away from operating stations, ro adways, and at least 17 meter (50 feet) from possible sources of ignitions. All sparks, flames, heated surface, or other sources of ignition should be kept away from all vents. It is advisable, to provide suction on vessels when inspection or observation openings are made, to minimize or eliminate escape of vapors. Personal protective equipment Eye Protection: Safety glasses equipped with side shields are recommended as minimum protection in industrial settings. Chemical goggles should be worn during transfer operations or when there is a likelihood of misting, splashing, or spraying of this material. A suitable emergency eye wash water and safety shower should be located near the work station. Skin protection: Wear impervious protective clothing, including boots, gloves, lab coat, apron or coveralls, as appropriate, to prevent skin contact. Clothing: Avoid skin contact. Wear long-sleeved fire-retardant garm ents (e.g., Nomex\u00ae) while working with flammable and combustible liquids.

Symptoms (treatments as indicated in Section 4) Eye: The liquid produces a high level of eye discomfort and is capable of causing pain and severe conjunctivitis. Corneal injury may develop, with possible permanent impairment of vision , if not promptly and adequately treated. There is evidence that material may produce eye irritation in some persons and produce eye damage 24 hours or more after instillation. Severe inflammation may be expected with pain. There may be damage to the cornea. Unless treatment is prompt and adequate there may be permanent loss of vision. Conjunctiv itis can occur following repeated exposure. Skin: Contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption. The material may cause moderate inflammation of the skin either follo wing direct contact or after a delay of some time. Repeated exposure can cause contact dermatitis which is characterized by redness, swelling and blistering. Entry into the blood-stream, through, for example, cuts, abrasions or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected. Ingestion: Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual. Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration into the lungs with the risk of chemical pneumonitis ; serious consequences may result. (ICSC13733). Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments. The liquid may produce gastrointestinal discomfort and may be harmful if swallowed. Ingestion may result in nausea, pain and vomiting. Vomit entering the lungs by aspiration may causepotentially lethal chemical pneumonitis. Inhalation: Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual. There is some evidence to suggest that the material can cause respiratory irritation in some persons. The body's response to such irritation can cause further lung damage. Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by sl eepiness, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of co-ordination, and vertigo. Inhalation of high concentrations of gas/vapour causes lung irritation with coughing and nausea, central nervous depression with headache and dizziness, slowing of reflexes, fatigue and inco-ordination. If exposure to highly concentrated solvent atmosphere is prolonged this may lead to narcosis, unconsciousness, even coma and possible death. The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined sp ace may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmospher e developing. Before starting c onsider control of exposure by mechanical ventilation. Chronic exposure: There has been some concern that this material can cause cancer or mutations but there is not enough data to make an assessment. Substance accumulation, in the human bo dy, may occur and may cause some concern following repeated or long-term occupational exposure.

Some of the material will become associated with benthic sedi ments, and it is likely to be spr ead over a fairly wide area of sea floor. Marine sediments may be either aerobic or anaerobic. The material, in probability, is biodegradable, under aerobic conditions. Evidence also suggests that the hydrocar bons may be degradable under anaerobic conditions although such degradation in benthic sediments may be a relatively slow process. 3. Under aerobic conditions the material will degrade to water and carbon dioxide, while under aerobic processes it will produce water, methane, carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide. 4. Based on test results, as well as theoretical considerations, the potential for bioaccumulation may be high.
