About Herbal Remedies Herbal remedies are any herbs, botanical (plant-based) supplements, or dietary supplements you take for their health benefits. These may come as tablets, capsules, powders, teas, liquid extracts, and fresh or dried plants. Some herbal remedies can help prevent or manage side effects of cancer or your treatment. The herbal remedies that can help you depend on what symptoms you have and what treatment you're getting. Even though herbal remedies can feel safe, they may not all be safe. Herbal remedies do not go through the same testing as prescription medications to make sure they work and are safe. Some herbal remedies may be harmful. This is because they can: - Affect how your other medications work. - Raise or lower your blood pressure. - Thin your blood and increase your risk of bleeding. - Keep radiation therapy from working as well as it should. - Change how your body reacts to sedation (medication to make you calmer) or general anesthesia (medication to make you sleepy). Talk with your healthcare provider about any herbal remedies or other supplements you are taking. They can provide an open and safe space to talk about these products.
