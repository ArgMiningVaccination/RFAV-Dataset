Its curved pine seat is both light and comfortable.The cherry wood feet are joined to the top using traditional mortise and tenon joinery.Ancient Chinese stools and American Windsors were both design inspirations for these pieces. The woods used in making the benches has been sourced from either small, local sawmills, or has been sawn right here on the craftsman's own sawmill from locally salvaged trees. After assembly, they are finished with a layer of shellac, hand rubbed, and then waxed to a soft, low sheen.All materials are non-toxic.(Shellac is used to coat M&M's!) The Adjustable Arc has a curve sawn into one side of the feet.This feature allows you to find the seating angle which is most comfortable for you.And the flat side of the foot allows you to sit comfortably with your legs in front of you without falling backwards.Handy when you need to stretch! It is currently available in two sizes. Large: 18\" X 7.5\" X 8\" at the highest point Medium: 18\" X 7.5\" X 7\" at the highest point.
