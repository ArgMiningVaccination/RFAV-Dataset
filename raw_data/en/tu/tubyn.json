During visits, I take time to listen to each patient and look at the whole person, and take time to discuss both natural and conventional strategies to help patients feel better. I utilize functional lab testing and therapies including nutrition and lifestyle recommendations, herbal and focused nutrient supplementation, acupuncture and mind-body therapies, depending on an individual's needs. I am passionate about educating patients about their health so they feel empowered to live life to its fullest and feel their best.
