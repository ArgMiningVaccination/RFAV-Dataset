2006 performance-informed budget submission for the U.S. Department of Justice (Department, DOJ). Similar to last year, no large-scale content c hanges have been made to the information provided in prior DOJ Budget Summaries. We have, however , continued to improve the appearance of certain charts and tables and eliminated duplicative information in an effort to provide the necessary performance-related information, while keeping the size of the document relatively the same. OVERVIEW OF FY 2006 BUDGET SUMMARY CONTENT: PART I: Part I provides a summary of the Department's reques ted items by each of our four strategic goals. Revised in FY 2003, these strategic goals outline our critical mission areas and highlight funding requests necessary to achieve further results in FY 2006. As required by the Office of Management and Budget 's (OMB) Circular A-11, this budget summary also serves as the Department's consolidated annual performance planning document. The FY 2005 Revised Final/FY 2006 Performance Plan, provides the FY 2005 and FY 2006 targeted levels of performance we plan to achieve for key performance indicators. This plan aligns resources (FTE and $) to each strategic goal. Where resources ar e overarching or administrative in nature, costs have been allocated among our four strategic goals. Additionally, Part I contains an overview of ex ternal evaluations of performance under the (PMA) and OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) process. The Department has been working diligently to integrate budget and performance, one of the five government-wide PMA items. Part I also includes results from OMB's PART assessm ents conducted during the last fiscal year. PART II: In past Budget Summary documents, much of the information presented in our summary tables was repeated in subsequent tables. The Department has continued to reduce redundancy and minimize the possibility of error without sacrificing the information or core exhibits that Congressional staff have found useful in the past. The following tables have been included: Organizational Chart Appropriation Language - and Analysis of any changes Summary of Requirements Crosswalk of Prior Year Availability Crosswalk to Current Year Financial Analysis of Program Improvements and/or Offsets Status of Congressionally Requested Studies, Reports, and Evaluations (where appropriate) Authorization of Appropriations PART III: The final section provides component request info rmation. Similar to past Budget Summary documents, component order of appearance parallels the structure of the Department's appropriation bills. 1 PART ONE: FY 2006 SUMMARY OF REQUEST AND KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES BY STRATEGIC GOAL OVERVIEW The Justice Department's core mission is to preser ve American lives and liberties while working to enhance our capability to prevent terrorist incidents. Established in 1870, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ, the Department) see ks to protect all Americans while preserving their personal freedoms, and to balance strict, tough enforcement of federal laws with abiding respect for individuals and their personal rights. The events of September 11, 2001, redefined the mission of the Department. Under the leadership of the Attorney General, the Department placed the prevention of terrorism and the promotion of national security as our primary mission. During the past three years, the Department has improved information sharing among all levels of law enforcement while continuing to protect classified information appropriately. We have also restructured our internal organizations to respond to the changing environment to accomplish our mission more effectively. In addition to our primary mission, the Department of Justice continues to enforce federal laws vigorously; deter, investigate and prosecute federal crimes, including gun, drug and civil rights violations; incarcerate offenders; partner with state, local, community and faith-based groups to prevent crime, including crimes against child ren; and provide leadership and assistance in meeting the needs of crime victims. Our mission is embedded in public law. Our core values and identified strategic goals and objectives are outlined in The Department of Justice FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan (available on the Internet at http://www.usdoj.gov/jmd/mps/strategic2003-2008/toc.htm). This Plan sets forth long-term objectives and strategies, identifies crosscutting programs, and describes external factors that may affect goal achievement. The Department's FY 2006 budget request totals $21.2 billion in mandatory and discretionary funding. This request represents a decrease of $1.10 billion or 5% of the FY 2005 enacted level funding. This decrease is due in part to one-time discretionary offsets totaling $1.6 billion that are netted in the total resources. Absent those offsets, the Department's discretionary budget grew by $510 million or 2.5% over the FY 2005 enacted level. The Department's four strategic goals provide the basis for this request: STRATEGIC GOAL 1: Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security The prevention of terrorist acts and ensuring the safety of the American people continues to be the Department's primary goal. To support this goal, the FY 2006 budget requests funding of $3.13 billion, an increase of $33 million over FY 2005 enacted levels. STRATEGIC GOAL 2: Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People The Department will continue to vigorously enforce all federal laws; reduce the threat and prevalence of violent crime, gun related crime, illegal drug trafficking, and white collar crime; and uphold the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans. To support this goal, the FY 2006 budget requests funding of $9.21 billion, an increase of $67 million over FY 2005 enacted levels. 3 STRATEGIC GOAL 3: Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or Reduce Crime and Violence The Department strengthens the criminal and juvenile justice capabilities of state, local, and tribal governments by providing grant monies, training, technical assistance and other services to improve the nation's capac ity to prevent and control crime, administer justice, and assist crime victims. To support this goal, the FY 2006 budget requests funding of $2.83 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion from FY 2005 enacted levels. STRATEGIC GOAL 4: Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the Federal Justice System The Department is responsible for ensuring the federal justice system operates effectively, efficiently and securely by pr otecting judicial proceedings; ensuring the safe and secure environment of federal courts ; apprehending fugitives from justice; maintaining and operating the Federal Prison System, including persons awaiting trial and/or sentencing, in a safe, secure, and humane environment; and providing an independent forum for the objective adjudication of disputes between the U.S. Government and aliens or other individuals regarding immigration status. To support this goal, the FY 2006 budget requests funding of $7.63 billion, an increase of $75 million over FY 2005 enacted levels. RESOURCES1 BY STRATEGIC GOAL AND COMPONENT FY 2006 Budget Request by Strategic Goal (Dollars are in Billions) $9.21 $7.63 $3.13 $2.83 Goal 1: Prevent terrorism and promote the Nation's Security Goal 2: Enforce federal laws and represent the rights and interests of the American people Goal 3: Assist state, local, and tribal e fforts to prevent or reduce crime and violence Goal 4: Ensure the fair and efficient operation of the Federal justice system 1 On this page and the following pages in Part 1, the FY 2006 funding totals [$22.8 billion] by Strategic Goal do not include scorekeeping offsets that total $1.643 billion ($314 million in prior year unobligated balance rescissions for the Fede ral Prison System, and rescissions from balances of $1.267 billion fo r the Crime Victims Fund and $62 million for the Assets Forfei ture Fund). 4 FY 2006 BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS, RESOURCES AND K EY PERFORMANCE MEASURES BY STRATEGIC GOAL STRATEGIC GOAL 1: Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security Counterterrorism and National Security. Over the past three years, the Department has diligently reallocated resources to counterterrorism, our top priority. The Depar tment has an established long-term goal of zero terrorist acts committed by foreign nationals within U.S. Borders . Since September 11, 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) counterterrorism workload has more than tripled, from 9,340 cases pending and received in the field to nearly 31,000 in FY 2004. This budget request include s resources for the FBI to provide critical counterterrorism inve stigation capabilities. This funding will allow the FBI to strengthen its effort to identify, track, and prevent terrorist cells from operating in the United States and overseas. Principal increases provide funding to: double the size of the Hostage Response Team, hire 500 addi tional intelligence analysts, enhance the Foreign Language Program b y $26 million, and expand the Legal Attach\u00e9 program. This budget also includes funding for two Presidential initiatives, the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), and the Terror ist Screening Center (TSC). The NCTC, established in May 2003 as the Terrorist Threat Integration Center, is a multi-agency effort that merges and analyzes intelligence information to provide a comprehensive threat analysis to the law enforcement community. When fully operational, the Center will house a database of known and suspected terrorists that officials across the country will be able to access and act upon. The Terrorist Screening Center, which was established by Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-6 on September 16, 2003, and became operational on December 1, 2003, consolidates terrorist watch lists. Several new mandates/requirements have lead to the need for increased resources in this area including: continuing education of state and local law enforcement; more stringent s creening at U.S. borders; a new requirement from the Department of Home land Security's Secure Flight Program that requires TSC to expand its initial screening capabilities to include procedures for screen ing domestic and international airline passengers; and other man dates. To meet these increased requirements, this budget includes 61 positions (8 agents) and $75 million for TSC. Additionally, successful counterterrorism requires the cohesive intelligence, investigative, and prosecutorial efforts of many government agencies, including the federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies participating in the Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JT TF). A key to the success of the JTTF concept remains the melding of personnel from various law enforcement agencies into a single focused unit. Also, since the events of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Attorneys and the Departments Criminal Division have utilized the full cadre of anti-terrorism statutes to prosecute terrorist activities, including disrupting terrorist financing. 5 [ ] Designates the reporting entity FY 2004 Actual FY 2005 (Revised Final) Target FY 2006 Target Strategic Goal 1: Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security Terrorist acts committed by foreign nationals against U.S. interests within U.S. borders [FBI] Zero Zero Zero Strategic Goal 1: Resources Appropriation FY 2004 Actual Obligation FY 2005 Enacted w/Rescissions FY 2006 President's Budget FTE $ thousands FTE $ thousands FTE $ thousands Criminal Division 162 26,544 165 27,230 175 30,992 Federal Bureau 2,007,204 12,765 2,624, 261 13,028 2,850,619 Counterterrorism Fund 0 0 0 0 0 0 U.S. Attorneys 501 78,182 534 98,664 581 86,379 Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) 0 0 0 0 58 8,792 U.S Marshals Service 0 0 0 0 23 3,588 Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force 0 66,486 0 0 0 0 CT Information Tech Fund 0 0 0 0 4 68,992 Administrative/Enablin g 25 0 31,27 8 319 54,01 8 356 84,102 Total Strategic 11,747 $2,209, 694 13,783 $2,804,17 3 14,225 $3,133,464 6 STRATEGIC GOAL 2: Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People Drug Enforcement. For the first time in a decade, drug use has decreased among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders. With extraordinary collaboration between federal law enforcement agencies, in the past two years we have severely crippled internati onal trafficking organizations responsible for the U.S. drug supply. In FY 2004, the Department dismantled 36 Consolidated Priority Organization Target (CPOT)-linked drug trafficking organiza tions and severely disrupted an additional159 organizations. The Department has a long-term goal of disrupting an additional 19 CPOT-linked organizations through FY 2008. A major focus of the Department's drug supply reduction strategy is the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF ) program. Centrally managed within the Department, the OCDETF program combines the resources and expertise of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the FBI, the Bureau of Alc ohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the U.S. Marshals Service, the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Coast Guard, and the litigating forces of DOJ's Criminal Division, Tax Division, and the United States Attorneys' Offices. These organizations combi ne resources in order to identify, disrupt, and dismantle the most serious drug trafficking and money laundering organizations and those primarily responsible for the nation's drug supply. Currently, OC DETF investigations account for approximately 87% of all CPOT- linked investigations. Guns and Explosives. ATF is the lead federal agency responsible for regulating the alcohol and tobacco industries. It plays a key role in the fight against violent crime and terrorism as expl osives and firearms are the preferred tools of terrorists and violent criminal organizations. The Violent Crime Impact Team (VCIT) program helps reduce a community's occurrences of homicide and firearms related violent crime through the use of geographic targeting, aggressive investigation, and prosecution of those resp onsible. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to ensure that the incidents of firearms related violence are reduced, and not relocated to adjacent neighborhoods. This budget provides $30.3 million to support the efforts of the VCIT program. Crimes Against Children and Obscenity. The Department's budget reflects its commi tment to protect America's youngest victims from human trafficking and other forms of exploitation. During the last year, the Department worked aggressively with other law enforcement agencies to target and prosecute a large variety of offenders posing grave threats to children, including large int ernational rings of organized and predatory child molesters and commercial producers and sellers of child abuse images. Through these efforts, more than 150 child victims were rescued. As the nation's experts in the prevention and prosecution of child exploitation and obscenity, the Department's Criminal Division leads its endeavor to enforce federal child exploitation and obscenity laws and prevent the exploitation of children and families. Criminal Division atto rneys prosecute defendants who have violated federal child exploitation and obscenity laws and also assist the 93 United States Attorney Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these of fenses. Additionally, the FBI's Innocent Images National Initiative's (IIN I) mission is to identify, and investigate sexual predators w ho use the Internet and other online services to sexually exploit children, identify and rescue child victims, and establish a law enforce ment presence on the Internet as a deterrent to subjects that exploit children. This budget increases funding by $13.3 million for the Justice Department's efforts to fight child pornography and obscenity, in cluding the Criminal Division programs, IINI, and the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces. 7 [ ] Designates the reporting entity FY 2004 Actual FY 2005 (Revised Final) Target FY 2006 Target Strategic Goal 2: Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People Number of transnational criminal enterprises dismantled (Formerly: Number of organized criminal enterprises dismantled) [FBI] 29 (revised) 19 24 Number of child pornography we bsites or web hosts shut down [FBI] 2,638 2,300 2,300 Percent of high-crime cities (with an ATF presence) demonstrating a reduction in violent firearms crime [ATF] N/A* 55% 60% DOJ's reduction in the supply of illegal drugs available for consumption in the U.S. (2002 Baseline) [OCDETF] N/A** N/A** N/A** Consolidated Priority Organizations Target-linked drug trafficking organizations Disrupted (DEA, FBI [Consolidated data - Associate Deputy Attorney General/Drugs) Dismantled (DEA, FBI [Consolidated data - Associate Deputy Attorney General/Drugs]) 159 Disrupted; 36 Dismantled Disrupted: 151 FBI: 128 Dismantled: 41 FBI: 15 DEA: 26 Value of stolen intellectual property [FBI] Data not available until after 3/31/05 $34 Billion $34 Billion Number of top-ten Internet fraud targets neutralized [FBI] 7 7 6 Number of criminal enterprises engaging in white collar crime dismantled [FBI] 137 (revised) 45 45 Case resolution for all DOJ divisions: (ENRD, data - JMD/BS]) Percent of Criminal Cases favorably resolved Percent of Civil Cases favorably resolved 91% 85% 90% 7 Data not available until after 1/31/05*** 54% 54% 8 [ ] Designates the reporting entity FY 2004 Actual FY 2005 (Revised Final) Target FY 2006 Target Data not available until after Chapter 13 1/31/05*** 80% 80% * ATF data lags two years due to time lag in publication of Uniform Crime Report. ** Measuring reduction in the drug supply is a complex process reflecting of a number of factors outside the control of drug enforcement. Moreover, the impact of enforcement efforts on drug supply and the estimated availability ar e currently not measurable in a single year. Accordingly, DOJ is unable to set in terim goals; however, we remain focused on achieving a long- term reduction of 10%, when compared to the baseline s upply of drugs available for consumption in FY 2002. *** Data lags one year due to the requirement to audit data submitted by Trustees prior to reporting.

In 2001, President Bush and the Attorney General made a commitment to reduce gun crime by removing gun criminals from the streets with Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN). Since 2001, $1.3 billion has been dedicated to PSN, including grants to state and local task forces, increased prosecutorial funding for U.S. Attorneys offices, and additional age nt and training resources for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The initiative is having results. In FY 2004, over 13,000 offenders have been charged. Gun crime has decreased more than 250,000 in the past three years. The Department is locking up predators by enforcing the gun laws, while continuing to protec t the individual Constitutional rights of law-abiding America ns to bear arms under the Second Amendment. This budget provides total funding of $363 million for the PSN efforts, an increase of $138 m illion, 61 % over the 2005 enacted level. These funds will also assist in the Department's established long-term goal of ensuring 80% of high- crime cities with an ATF presence demonstrate a reduction in violent crime through FY 2008. Budget increases will provide $74 million in grant assistance for state/local prosecution of criminal use of firearms; increases for improvements to states criminal hist ory records; and $29 million to make gunlocks available to gun owners to hel p prevent the misuse of firearms, especially by children. State and Local Assistance. State and local law enforcement departments are our critical partners in the war against terror and the fight against crime. America's Missing Broadcast Emergenc y Response (AMBER) Alert network, which began in Texas in 199 6, is a missing child response program that coordinates and utiliz es the resources of law enforcement and media to notify the publ ic when children are kidnapped by predators. In October 2002, the President announced plans to expand the AMBER Alert network. The recovery of 154 children in just the past two years represents over 80 % of all 188 recoveries since AMBER Alert began. This i s a four\u00ad fold increase in recoveries since the program's inception. This budget request includes $5 million in additional resources to expand this critical network across America and return children in imminent danger or harm to their families. 10 Additionally, this budget proposes $20 million for a new Capital Litigation Improvement Grant Program for private defense couns el and public defenders, state and local prosecutors, and state judges to improve the competency of all participants connected with th e trail of state capital cases. Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology. DNA technology has significantly improved the capacity to solve criminal cases, identify the guilty, exonerate the innocent, and protect the public. At the same time, new challenges have arisen inclu ding ensuring that police and medical personnel recognize when to obtain DNA evidence and how to collect and preserve it; training prosecutors on how to effectively present DNA evidence in cour t; and ensuring judges have a solid background in the issues invo lved in DNA evidence in order to make sound judgments about admissibility and the weight to be given the evidence. With the development of DNA technology, came an explosion in the collection of hundreds of thousands of samples from crimes sce nes and offenders that are awaiting analysis in evidence storage lockers and forensic laboratories across the country. Unfortunate ly, the influence of DNA technology to solve many cases has been limited due to inadequate laboratory capacity, outdated information systems, overwhelming caseloads, and a lack of training. The consequence: victims awaiting resolution to their cases, and coun tless offenders who are not being held accountable for their crimes. To realize the vast potential of DNA technology, the current federal and state DNA collection and analysis systems must be impr oved. Through the President's initiative, Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology , more than $1 billion in investments are planned over five years to: 1) improve DNA technology in the criminal justic e system, 2) solve crimes, 3) exonerate the innocent by helping to clear the backlog of unanalyzed samples, 4) train criminal justice prof essionals to make better use of DNA evidence, and 5) promote t he use of DNA in the identification of missing persons. In FY 2006, $236 million will be provided, an increase of $68 million over th e 2005 enacted level. Drug Testing, Treatment, and Graduated Sanctions. More than 1,180 drug courts are currently in operation throughout the United States providing positive alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenders. This program uses the coercive power of the court to force abstinence and alter behavior with a combination of escalating sanctions, mandatory drug testing, treatment, and strong aftercare programs. According to a study released by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) in 2003 from a sample of 17,000 d rug court graduates, within one year of program graduation, only 16.4 % had been rearrested and charged with a felony offense. In FY 2006, $70.1 million will be provided for the Drug Court program . This represents an increase of $30.6 over the FY 2005 enac ted level. The additional funding will increase the scope and quality of drug court services with the goal of improving successful completion of drug court programs. In a recent Bureau of Justice Statistics survey of inmates in state and federal correctional facilities, 33% of state prisoners and 22% of federal prisoners reported committing their current offense while under the influence of drugs. Drug offenders (42%) and proper ty offenders (37%) reported the highest incidence of drug use at the time of the offense. The Residential Substance Abuse Treatme nt Program (RSAT) helps state and local governments implement drug treat ment programs in correctional facilities. This budget pro vides $44.1 million for RSAT to continue more than 300 programs allowing offenders to reenter society addiction-free. 11 Reduce Violence Against Women and Family Violence. Domestic violence affects entire communities, damages children, and has the potential to take lives. The Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that close to 700,000 incidents of domestic violence are documented every year, while other incidents go unr eported. This Administration has obtained over $1.8 billion in funding for violence against women programs since 2001. This budget furthers that commitment and requests $386 million for Violence Ag ainst Women Act of 2000 (P.L 106-386) programs that target domesti c violence and strengthen services for victims and their dependents . Since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, the Justic e Department and the Department of Health and Human Services have made it possible for countless women to change their live s and reclaim their dignity. This request will provide the necess ary funding to target violence against women by administering grant s to help states, tribes, and local communities and transform th e way in which criminal justice systems respond to violent crimes against women and their dependents.

As of January 2005, there were approximately 181,000 inmates in federal custody, and recent inmate population projections indicate that the federal inmate population will increase approximately 10.8% to 200,606 by the e nd of FY 2006. This budget provides $5.1 billion in funding to BOP to maintain safe and secure confinement within all institutions. In addition, $1.2 billion is provided to OFDT to support an average daily detainee population in excess of 60,000. These funds will also as sist in the Department's established long-term goal of maintaining zero escapes and ensuring a reduction in system-wide crowding in federal prisons to 34% by FY 2008. The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) ensures that the federal justic e system operates effectively and securely by providing judicia l and courtroom security to deter and respond to threats and protect federal judges, court personnel, witnesses and other participant s in federal judicial proceedings. This budget will provide the res ources needed for the Department to achieve its long-term 2008 g oal of ensuring that no judicial proceedings are interrupted due to inadequate security as well as to continue to identify, assess, and respond to the threats against court personnel and property; enhance the phy sical security of federal courthouse facilities; and provid e for the long-term protection of federal witnesses and their families. Additionally, the USMS has primary jurisdiction to conduct and in vestigate fugitive matters involving escaped federal prisoners ; probation, parole and bond default violators; warrants generated by DEA investigations; and certain other related felony cases. In FY 13 2004, the USMS apprehended 39,000 federal felons - more than all other law enforcement agencies combined. Working with authorities at the federal, state, and local levels, USMS apprehended or cleared 79,740 fugitives. This budget provides $790.2 for the USMS, which is $42.6 million over the 2005 enacted level. These f unds will also assist in the Department's established long-te rm goal of apprehending or clearing 105,512 federal fugitives by FY 2008.

They are: 1) Strategic Management of Human Capital; 2) Competitive So urcing; 3) Improved Financial Management; 4) Expanded Electronic Government; 5) Budget and Performance Integration; and th e Real Property Asset Management and Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. The Department of Justice is committed to implement ing the strategies of the PMA. The Department has made signifi cant progress in supporting the reforms outlined in the PMA, and the following highlights progress made throughout the end of the fi rst quarter of FY 2005.

The PART evaluates programs in four areas: purpose, strategic planning, program management, and results and accountability, and is intended to be a diagnostic tool for providing critical information during b udget cycles. Annually, the Department uses the results of these assessments in our continuing efforts to improve our programs, processes, and aid in the refinement of our long-term measurable performance goals. The Department has used information from PART reviews to info rm its budget, legislative and administrative decisions throughout FY 2004. Additionally, the Department has continued to make improvements to programs that had previous ly received ratings of \"results not demonstr ated\" and is working equally hard to limi t the number of programs that receive that rating in the future. The Department recently finished the third cycle of OMB's PA RT. By the end of FY 2004 (Budget Year 2006), OMB had conducted PART reviews on eighteen of the Department's programs, including five reassessments representing nearly half of our annual budg et authority. By the end of FY 2006, 31 of the Department's program s will be rated through the PART. The charts that follow prov ide information regarding our annual assessment scores, as well as a full summary of the programs assessed in FY 2004.

An efficiency measure has been developed defining mission related costs vs. overhead costs. This operation will enhance the assessment of the USAOs' management structure, long-term goals/objectives and how the USAOs moni tor and measure performance/productivity. 2 Criminal Justice Services (FBI) 79% Moderately Effective Two effort to improve data collection are under way: 1) A Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is being implemented in order to capture case processing statistics; and 2) A standardized forensic analysis measure is being developed to c apture data regarding casework performed on behalf of state and local enforcement. In conjunction with the new law introducing a Performance-Based Pay System for government-wide Senior Executives Service (SES) e ffective 01/11/2004, FBI is currently in compliance with DOJ's plans for obtaining provisional certification from the Office of Persona l Management and the OMB for a DOJ SES Pay for Performance System. The FBI will adapt its budget formulation and presentat ion process to tie its requested budget items to annual long-term performance measures in its budget requests. 2 Arson & Explosives Programs (ATF) 82% Moderately Effective Provide annual evaluation of Arson & Explosives Programs. 3 Weed and Seed Program (OJP) 62% Adequate Two efforts to improve data collection are underwa y: (1) The Urban Institut e is gathering incident- specific law enforcement data from Weed and Seed Sites; and (2) The Justice Research and Statistics Association is gathering data from sites on crimes which they focus their law enforcement efforts. The FY 2004 Weed and Seed Application Kits will incl ude a provision advising sites that funding will be withheld if sites fail to submit GPRA reports and performance information. 18 FY 2006 Discretionary Budget Authority by Organization F OF D T I CDE OJ P US A GL A FB I US M S DE A BO P 24 % Ot h e r D O J 29 % 4% AFF, RECTF (discretio nary request), and FCSC. $1,642,563,000 Discretionary offs ets and Rescissions are not included in this pie chart.

Counterterrorism-related casework generated from new FBI positions has a direct effect on the OIPR through increased requests for FISA applications. FY 2006 current services resources are 112 positions, 112 workyears, and $31,250,334.

Security and Emergency Planning The Department requests 1 position, 1 workyear, and $186,000 to enhance the Department-wide continuity of operations (COOP) program that is consistent with National and Departmental policies. This program will ensure the continuity of essential government services that could be interrupted in emergency situations. FY 2006 current services resources for COOP are 1 position, 1 workyear, and $93,000. 2. Attorney Diversity The Department requests $750,000 to strengthen hiring and diversity policies for the Department's attorney workforce, including expanding the Attorney Student Loan Repayment Program (ASLRP) and implementing an automated attorney application process. ASLRP will help the Department to attract and retain individuals and create incentives for them to remain in public service. The automated application system will intensify outreach to individuals from different racial, economic, and geographic backgrounds. FY 2006 current services resources for ASLRP are $250,000. No current services resources exists for the automated application system. 3. Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) The Department requests 6 positions, 3 workyears, and $33,000,000 for continued support for the UFMS, including hardware and software acquisition, integration and implementation, and project management activities. This UFMS initiative will improve financial management performance and promote the efficient and effective use of resources. Appropriated resources in the amount of $1,000,000 were received for the UFMS in FY 2005, providing $1,000,000 of FY 2006 current services resources.

Housing of USMS Detainees The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee requests an additional $347,355,000 to house USMS detainees in private, state and local facilities. The Detention Trustee is currently exploring potential cost savings measures. Some of these efficiencies will be realized in FY 2005 and carried over into FY 2006. OFDT anticipates savings of $20,000,000 through management efficiencies such as reducing the average number of days individuals are detained, reducing medical care costs, and utilizing the least expensive available bed space. Based on the anticipated growth rate approximately 79 percent of the total federal prisoner population will be housed in state, local and private facilities, with the remaining 21 percent being housed in federal facilities.

A centralized fund, under the control of the DOJ CIO, will ensure that investments in information sharing technology are well-planned and aligned with the Department's overall information technology (IT) strategy and enterprise architecture. JIST will also ensure that all DOJ components are able to operate in an interoperable environment, particularly with respect to preventing terrorist attacks on the United States. The new JIST includes funding for the JABS and IDENT/IAFIS initiatives that was previously included under the Indentification Systems Integration, as well as transfers of information technology funding from the GA S&E and LAOA accounts. The JIST account includes an increase in 2006 to develop the Department's Law Enforcement Information Sharing Program (LEISP), to provide for secure data communications, to design a framework for a common case management solution, and to upgrade and extend the JCON office automation system.

Law Enforcement Information Sharing Program (LEISP) The CIO requests 1 position, 1 workyear, and $24,560,000 for LEISP, which is a Department-wide strategy to facilitate the sharing of law enforcement knowledge about terrorism, criminal activity and threats to public safety. LEISP will implement the information technology tools needed to promote timely, appropriate and secure sharing of information across the law enforcement community; and coordinate federal information sharing initiatives with those ongoing at state, tribal and law enforcement agencies. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are $5,000,000. 2. Database Applications The CIO requests 1 position, 1 workyear, and $29,470,000 for Information Sharing Database Applications, which will provide the core functionality and architecture to allow law enforcement agents and investigators to easily search through a national index of structured criminal incident records from a myriad of other federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies. In addition to developing an overarching strategy for this information sharing database, the Department will expand two database applications to provide the capability to collect, store, relate, analyze and share data that will enable law enforcement to thwart criminal and terrorist activities. The first application is an enhancement to the National Crime Reporting (NCR) program called the National Data Exchange (N-DEx). The second application is a Regional Data Exchange system called the RDex. There are no FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative. 3. Secure Communications The CIO requests 3 positions, 2 workyears, and $14,962,000 for secure communications including the institution of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and an enterprise-wide, seamless IT infrastructure for electronically sharing, processing, and storing information classified at the Secret (S), Top Secret (TS), and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) levels. PKI will provide for the authentication, encryption and nonrepudiation of electronic communications. A classified infrastructure will create a reliable and secure office automation system which allows attorneys, intelligence analysts, law enforcement officials, and managers the ability to exchange classified electronic data within and between components on a real time basis. FY 2006 current services resources are 3 positions, 3 workyears and $5,900,000. Program Improvements by Strategic Goal (continued) Perm. Pos.

Justice Consolidated Office Network (JCON) The CIO requests 2 positions, 1 workyear and $31,705,000 for the JCON Program, which will provide a much-needed modern office automation system to multiple components, and allow for a move closer to a common architecture throughout the JCON community. An increase in funding is needed to complete deployments at U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Parole Commission and Interpol, and begin deployment to the Bureau of Prisons. Funds will be used to purchase the hardware, software, and services for the upgraded workstations, servers, and network infrastructure needed to effectively implement a modern office automation system. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are 5 positions, 5 workyears and $40,311,000. 2. Case Management The CIO requests 4 positions, 2 workyears and $9,000,000 for a consolidated Case Management System which will provide the initial implementation of a common case management solution for the legal activities of the Department. This solution will serve as a model for the development of a common framework for the processes and systems that support case management functionality across agencies. The implementation of a common solution for the DOJ legal activities, and the adoption of this model as a framework for other case management systems, will provide for: (1) resource conservation through more efficient system operations; (2) faster, more informed case-related decision making; (3) more effective and efficient law enforcement and litigation; and (4) better informed resource allocation through the establishment of standard reporting criteria. There are no current services resources for this initiative. Program Decreases by Strategic Goal Enabling/Administrative - Supports Goals 1-4.................................................................................................................................................................................. -2 -2 -4,698 1. Fingerprint Technology The CIO requests a program reduction of 2 positions, 2 workyears and $4,698,000 to the project that integrates IDENT (the two-print fingerprint identification system employed by DHS) with IAFIS (the ten-print system employed by the FBI). Research by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has demonstrated that ten \"flat\" fingerprints can be taken almost as quickly as two flat fingerprints and that ten flat fingerprints offer search accuracy rates approaching the traditional law enforcement standard of two \"rolled\" fingerprints. Rather than continue to invest in the integration of IDENT and IAFIS, additional FBI resources are requested to improve the availability of IAFIS and to ensure that it possesses the capacity to process all potential transactions. The proposed reduction leaves a balance of $300,000 which will be consolidated into the new JIST account to provide for an oversight capability to coordinate on-going interagency requirements.

The initial IWN deployment in the Seattle-Blaine, WA areas went operational in December 2004. The FBI and USMS users in these areas have migrated onto the system, with ATF and other agencies prepared to do so in FY 2005. Funds will also allow for further Northwest service area expansion and to procure radios for these areas. FY 2006 current services resources are 12 positions, 12 workyears and $98,701,000.

The Supervised Release function is now a permanent, growing feature of the District of Columbia Sentencing and Supervision system. As the number of D.C. \"New-Law\" supervised release offenders rises, the number of revocation hearings is expected to rise dramatically requiring additional resources. In FY 2006, the number of supervised release revocation hearings is expected to exceed the case load for revocation hearings for D.C. offenders sentenced under the \"old law\" (D.C. Code offenders who committed offenses before August 5, 2000), and will continue the upward trend. Revocation hearings are more resource intensive as they are more complicated than parole hearings and often contested at the hearings and through legal channels.

In addition, the budget has been realigned to reflect each component's outputs and full costs by major program activity, including the costs of management and administration, so that a more accurate picture of total activity costs is reflected in the budget. In this way, budget and performance are more closely linked, and provide a better basis on which to make budget decisions. Over time, agencies will be expected to identify effective outcome measures, monitor their progress, and accurately present the associated costs. 1/ The Budget Summary includes 13 FTEs for CIV's Health Care Fraud Litigation enhancement that is not included in MAX.

FTE Amount Strategic Goal One: Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security............................................................................... 22 11 $2,417 Criminal Division 1. Counterterrorism Investigations/Prosecutions The Criminal Division requests 16 positions (12 attorneys), 8 workyears, and $1,781,000 to increase the Division's capacity to support law enforcement efforts, policies, and strategies related to combating international and domestic terrorism. These additional resources will allow the Division to: create a Domestic Terrorism Unit in order to bolster the Division's domestic terrorism capabilities; prosecute international organizations that facilitate entry of illegal aliens into the United States; expand the Division's ability to disrupt terrorist financing; increase our support to the Anti-Terrorism Advisory Councils; enhance weapons of mass destruction investigations and prosecutions; and address the increased mutual assistance and extradition workload in the Office of International Affairs. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are 163 positions (118 attorneys), 163 workyears, and $30,326,000. 2. National Security Counterespionage The Criminal Division requests 6 positions (3 attorneys), 3 workyears, and $636,000 to strengthen the Division's counterintelligence capabilities, address the increasing counterintelligence workload, and enhance its partnership with the intelligence community. Additional resources will also allow the Division to focus on vulnerabilities in our nation's telecommunication infrastructure, and mitigate any transactions in the telecommunications sector that pose a national security risk. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are 21 positions (15 attorneys), 21 workyears, and $3,792,000. GENERAL LEGAL ACTIVITIE S SALARIES AND EXPENSE S (Dollars in Thousands) Strategic Goal Two: Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People..................... ... 122 63 24,275 1. Project Safe Neighborhoods The Criminal Division requests 8 positions (7 attorneys), 4 workyears, and $1,000,000 to enhance the Division's role in the Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) initiative. These additional resources will enable the Division to create a team of experienced prosecutors who can travel to districts needing additional resources or expertise to address their gun violence problems, particularly to assist in prosecuting these crimes. The increased prosecutorial resources will enable the district to significantly increase the number of prosecutions. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are 3 positions (3 attorneys), 3 workyears, and $458,000. 2. Obscenity and Child Exploitation The Criminal Division requests 12 positions (7 attorneys), 8 workyears, and $1,275,000 to investigate and prosecute crimes against children and obscenity violations. Additional resources will allow the Division to build an internationally coordinated strategy to combat the sexual exploitation of children; expand its capacity to target, prosecute, and dismantle the domestic and international criminal enterprises and pornography rings responsible for these crimes; and effectively target purveyors of obscene materials. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are 39 positions (28 attorneys), 39 workyears, and $7,435,000. Civil Division 3. Spent Nuclear Fuel Litigation The Civil Division requests $6.8 million to provide automated litigation support (ALS) for the sixty-six cases filed by nuclear utility companies against the Department of Energy. At issue is a claim for more than $50 billion in damages for the government's alleged failure to begin acceptance of the plaintiff utilities' spent nuclear fuel by January 1998, as mandated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The litigation involves massive amounts of evidence and discovery, complex issues, and multiple parties. Critical to a successful defense in these cases are ALS services provided by an elite team of paralegals who create searchable databases for millions of pages of potentially-relevant documents and who support the attorneys during trials. With billions of dollars at stake, a successful defense of each case is imperative in order to avoid a potentially disastrous impact on the Treasury. There is no dedicated base for this initiative. 4. Office of Immigration Litigation (OIL) The Civil Division requests 58 positions (43 attorneys), 29 workyears, and $5,795,000 to protect our nation by excluding and deporting those aliens who pose a threat to national security, and aliens who otherwise lack entitlement defined by the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Between FY 2002 and FY 2004, OIL's workload doubled to approximately 15,000 cases and will likely top 21,000 by FY 2006 due to stepped-up Department of Homeland Security immigration enforcement actions. The attorney workload jumped from 79 cases in FY 2002 to 142 in FY 2004. By FY 2006, the attorney workload is projected to reach 186 cases - a number that is impossible for any attorney to handle competently. Inadequate resources to defend these cases could result in adverse judgments, hindering the government's ability to pursue a consistent, unified strategy for upholding immigration enforcement actions, consequently undermining our National Security. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are 148 positions (112 attorneys), 156 workyears, and $26,137,000. 5. Health Care Fraud Litigation The Civil Division requests 26 positions (17 attorneys), 13 workyears, and $2,000,000 to handle more than 125 separate health care fraud matters involving numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers and other related entities. The litigation involves the investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical billing and pricing schemes, and fraud against the Medicare drug discount card and prescription drug benefit programs established by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. Total FY 2006 current services for this initiative is $0 direct funding and 33 workyears. Environment and Natural Resources Division 6. Tribal Trust The Environment and Natural Resources Division requests 18 positions (11 attorneys), 9 workyears, and $7,394,000 to defend the United States in lawsuits filed by Indian Tribes for allegations regarding the management of Tribal assets by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The United States' potential exposure in these cases is more than $200 billion. Adequate resources are necessary to limit exposure and establish proper precedent for the United States. These cases differ from lawsuits brought against the United States by individual Tribal members, like Cobell, due to the extent of the potential exposure and the amount of document management/production required. The document management is astronomical; approximately 55 million pages of documents need to be reviewed. $6,119,000 is to cover document related expenses. Total FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are 16 positions (14 attorneys), 16 workyears, and $2,291,000.

The revenue generated from premerger filing fees (recently revised by Section 630 of P.L. 106-553) is available exclusively for antitrust enforcement. Consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act, the 2006 budget proposes to streamline ATR's decision unit structure from 6 program activities to 1 to align the ATR's budget more closely with the mission and strategic objectives contained in the DOJ Strategic Plan (FY 2003-2008). In addition, the budget has been realigned to reflect ATR's outputs and full costs by major program activity, including the costs of management and administration, so that a more accurate picture of total activity costs is reflected in the budget.

National Security and Criminal Prosecutions The USAs request 28 positions (15 attorneys), 14 workyears, and $2,289,000 to handle the influx of counterterrorism cases and referrals from law enforcement agencies and to ensure balance with new investigative resources. The requested funds would help equip United States Attorneys Offices with the necessary tools to keep pace with antiterrorism efforts and allow United States Attorneys to effectively investigate and prosecute criminal activities. The budget provides resources to other components within the Department to more than double the number of counterterrorism agents since September 11, 2001, and additional attorneys are required to handle the cases generated by these new investigative resources. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are $98,664,000 and 567 positions. Strategic Goal Two: Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People....................................................... 125 63 9,611 1. Workforce Imbalance The USAs request 36 positions, 18 workyears, and $1,963,000 for additional paralegals to narrow the gap between the private sector industry average and that which is found in the U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAOs). Currently, the ratio of attorneys to paralegals in the USAOs is 6:1. A study of the private sector ratio suggests that for every three attorneys, one paralegal is needed. Increasing paralegal staff will leverage existing and anticipated attorney resources. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are $227,900,000 and 2,771 positions. 2. Immigration The USAs request 46 positions (25 attorneys), 23 workyears, and $3,748,000 to ensure that there is sufficient U.S. Attorney presence to meet the steadily increasing caseload generated by increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement cases; and these resources will also provide aggressive enforcement of the immigration statutes, which includes aliens who, after deportation, attempt to reenter or are found in the United States illegally, alien smugglers and alien smuggling organizations. FY 2006 current services resources are $35,550,000 and 237 positions. 3. Computer Crime, High Tech and Intellectual Property (CHIP) Units The USAs request 11 positions (6 attorneys), 6 workyears, and $900,000 to expand the CHIP program to substantially increase prosecutions of intellectual property theft, internet fraud and identity theft in order to protect U.S. businesses and its citizens in a global economy. These resources will be used to establish CHIP units in the District of Columbia, the Eastern District of California (Sacramento), the Middle District of Tennessee (Nashville), the Western District of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh), and the Middle District of Florida (Orlando).

The FBI's FY 2006 budget maintains the 4 decision unit structure as appropriated by Congress in FY 2005. In addition, the budget has been realigned to reflect the FBI's outputs and full costs by major program activity, including the costs of management and administration, so that a more accurate picture of total activity costs is reflected in the budget. In this way, budget and performance are more closely linked, and provide a better basis on which to make budget decisions. Over time, agencies will be expected to identify effective outcome measures, monitor their progress, and accurately present the associated costs.

Directorate of Intelligence The FBI requests $26,317,000 in nonpersonnel funding to strengthen the Intelligence Program in three critical areas: program development, intelligence training and analyst recruitment and retention. This request is the next step in the implementation of the Intelligence Program, and supports the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, including specific provisions establishing a Directorate of Intelligence to coordinate the FBI's intelligence activities. FY 2006 current services resources for the Directorate of Intelligence and the College of Analytical Studies are 198 positions, 198 workyears, an d $13,970,000. 2. Field and Headquarter Intelligence Analysts The FBI requests 658 positions, 329 workyears, and $67,420,000 in personnel and nonpersonnel funding to strengthen its Intelligence Program. The requested positions, which are critical to the FBI's Intelligence Program, would address increasing workload requirements, strengthen the Program's strategic analytic capability, and improve its ability to disseminate time-sensitive intelligence throughout the intelligence and law enforcement communities. The request also includes nonpersonnel funding for Contract Adjudicators to support processing of clearances for expanding Counterterrorism and Homeland Security initiatives and contractor intense programs. The FBI requires dedicated analytical resources and funding to ensure that national leaders, FBI executives, and the intelligence and law enforcement communities have the intelligence necessary to set investigative priorities, respond to emerging threats to prevent or neutralize them, and ensure that the most trustworthy workforce that can be assembled is available. FY 2006 current services resources for analysts in the Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Cyber Programs include 1,502 positions and $113,614,000. 3. National Security Field Investigations The FBI requests 791 positions (468 agents), 396 workyears, and $121,614,000 in personnel and nonpersonnel funding to support the increased workload of counterterrorism field investigations and to bolster the Foreign Counterintelligence (FCI) Program. The FBI's role as the leader of the nation's counterterrorism efforts requires that its Counterterrorism Program be adequately staffed and possess the resources required to support field investigative and operational requirements. The request for field agent and support personnel and nonpersonnel funding is designed to provide the necessary resources to protect America against the threat of terrorism. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative and a more detailed description can be found in the FBI's classified budget request. 4. Counterterrorism Operations The FBI requests $39,700,000 in nonpersonnel funding for activities associated with the on-going cost of the global War on Terror. This request includes $21,600,000 for tactical gear, equipment, and vehicles; $13,000,000 for operational travel expenses; $3,100,000 for contractors for Counterterrorism Watch (CT Watch) operations; and $2,000,000 for investigative expenses. FY 2006 current services resources are 6,095 positions, 5,822 workyears and $1,163,405,000. FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES (Dollars in Thousands) 5.

The HRT is the only entity in the law enforcement community possessing a Tier 1 capability, and is available for situations where the only other available option would be the domestic use of the Department of Defense's Special Mission Units to enforce civilian law. Specifically, the requested resources would augment the number of tactical operators, and nonpersonnel funds would provide the proper outfitting, equipment, and gear to allow operations in multiple environments, including those contaminated with chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) material. FY 2006 current services resources include 234 positions, 173 workyears, and $28,992,000. 6. Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) The FBI requests 61 positions (8 agents), 31 workyears and $75,000,000 in personnel and nonpersonnel funding to meet new requirements for the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Secure Flight Program, which requires TSC to expand its initial screening capabilities to include procedures for screening all domestic and international airline passengers. In addition, the TSC's workload continues to increase dramatically as state and local law enforcement officers become more proficient in the use of the TSC, and the U.S. continues to implement more stringent border screening and other screening mandates. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are $29,000,000. 7. Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC) The FBI requests 7 positions, 4 workyears, and $6,023,000 in personnel and nonpersonnel funding to establish base funding for TEDAC, a multi-agency information sharing effort to technically and forensically analyze Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) for the purpose of providing intelligence to the explosives and intelligence communities regarding IEDs used by terrorists. This intelligence may be used to assist in terrorist investigations or to develop strategies to counter or identify the terrorists. In support of this initiative, the ATF is requesting 2 positions and $6,000,000 for TEDAC database development. There are no current services resources for this initiative. 8. Language Program The FBI requests 274 positions, 137 workyears, and $26,299,000 in personnel and nonpersonnel funding for its Foreign Language Program. These positions would enhance the FBI's language translation capacity in counterterrorism and counterintelligence languages, provide the National Virtual Translation Center (NVTC) with a permanent staff of linguists and fund a projected FY 2006 deficit for the FBI's Contract Linguist Program. FY 2006 curren services resources for this initiative are 612 positions, 612 workyears, and $6,202,000. 9. Legal Attach\u00e9 Expansion and Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure The FBI requests 60 positions (7 agents), 30 workyears and $11,419,000 in personnel and nonpersonnel funding to further expand the Legal Attache program, provide additional administrative, operational and technical support to Headquarters and equip the Legat program with adequate personnel and resources to provide IT support to the overseas elements of the program. Funding would support the opening of a new office in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, the expansion of eight existing offices around the world and the placement of three Regional Language Specialists in Jordan, Ukraine, and Pakistan. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are 320 positions, 311 workyears, and $89,617,000. FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION SALARIES AND EXPENSES (Dollars in Thousands) 10. Surveillance The FBI requests 80 positions, 40 workyears and $9,858,000 in personnel funding to enhance the FBI's capabilities in the critical area of surveillance. Successful surveillance operations are essential to many priority national security investigations, and therefore support the FBI's and DOJ's top priorities. FY 2006 current services resources and a more detailed description of the initiative can be found in the FBI's classified budget request. 11. Top Secret (TS)/Sensitive Compartmented Information Operational Network (SCION) The FBI requests $20,000,000 in nonpersonnel funding for TS/SCION, formerly known as the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information Local Area Network (TS/SCI LAN), to be installed in up to 20 Field Offices, and to add 250 users to the Headquarters TS/SCION. The requirement to access TS/SCI information is growing rapidly; it is essential that the agents and analysts supporting critical missions have access to that information and have the ability to share that information in a timely manner to support the intelligence community and prevent terrorist and criminal acts. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are $15,500,000 in nonpersonnel funding. 12. Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) Network Access The FBI requests $7,679,000 in nonpersonnel funding to provide FBI agents, analysts and other FBI professionals who require access to the Internet to perform their mission with secure, high speed Internet access. The FBI's information network operates at a system-high classified SECRET level, and is thus a closed network with no direct access to information from the Internet or other law enforcement and counterintelligence agencies. SBU Network (formerly Internet Caf\u00e9) provides mission-related access over a dedicated communications link to an Internet Service Provider (ISP), allowing FBI agents, analysts and professionals to communicate with federal, state and local partners, including the larger intelligence community. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are $1,500,000 in nonpersonnel funding. 13. Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Management The FBI requests $7,000,000 in nonpersonnel funding for the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). This funding would provide contractor suppor t for the Office of Planning and Policy (OPP), the Office of Program Management (OPM) and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), as well as provide the CTO's Office with adequate resources for Research and Development. Resources would ensure that the FBI's portfolio of projects accurately reflects the FBI's operational requirements, reflects a cohesive enterprise architecture and infrastructure and that the implementation and deployment of high-priority, complex and high risk projects is managed by a team of professionals using consistent processes. FY 2006 current services resources for this initiative are $462,000 in nonpersonnel funding.

The Department is participating to the fullest extent possibl e in the various e-Gov initiatives, which remain a priority management objective. The goals of the President's e-Gov Strategy are to eliminate redundant systems and their associated costs, and significantly improve the government's quality of customer service for citizens and businesses. The FBI is expected to achieve economies of scale and cost savings as a result of its participation in, and implementation of, e-Training and e-Travel. 1. e-Training As part of its e-Training efforts, the Department is implementing the Justice Virtual University (JVU), a web-based learning management system that will provide accessibility and ease of identifying training and development opportunities by a variety of delivery mechanisms across Department business lines saving instructor and travel costs. As a result, the FBI is anticipating cost savings of $2,567,000. 2. e-Travel As part of its e-Travel efforts, the Department is implementing the Electronic Travel Service (eTS), a web-based, end-to-end, travel management system that will be integrated with various legacy financial systems Department-wide, and will serve as the travel solution when the new Unified Financial Management System is implemented. Full implementation of eTS is expected by September 2006, leading to the aggregation and consolidation of travel management functions, reduced paper processes, more efficient travel voucher audits, and improved cycle times. As a result, the FBI is anticipating cost savings of $2,107,000. 3. Drug Program Consolidation The FBI is proposing a reduction of 608 positions (365 agents), 608 FTE and $67,000,000 in personnel funding through the elimination of its direct- funded Drug Program. These resources would be re-directed to other priority programs. At the same time, the FY 2006 President's Budget proposes to increase the OCDETF program by $50,000,000 and 432 positions (365 agents) to expand FBI's participation in OCDETF task forces and drug investigations. 4. Criminal Program The FBI is proposing a decrease of 42 positions (25 agents), 42 workyears, and $5,404,000 in personnel funding to the Criminal Program, through the elimination of criminal investigations in several case classifications. The elimination of these investigations would allow the FBI to continue to focus its resources on its highest priority missions. 5. General Offset The FBI is proposing a decrease of $16,796,000 in nonpersonnel funding, which will be taken across-the-board from travel, miscellaneous services, supplies and equipment.

In support of this initiative, the FBI is requesting 7 positions and 6,023,000 for TEDAC which will provide resources for forensic analysis, information sharing, and the general administration of the TEDAC program. There are no FY 2006 current services for this initiative. Strategic Goal Two: Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People....................................................... 150 75 30,300 1. Violent Crime Impact Teams (VCIT) ATF requests 150 positions (75 agents), 75 workyears, and $30,300,000 to establish Violent Crime Impact Teams (VCIT) in additional locations. Begun as a pilot program in June 2004, VCIT deploys teams of Federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors to work with local law enforcement to curb the rate of violent firearms-related crime in specific geographic areas. ATF is the lead Federal agency in these efforts, actively initiating investigations against violent offenders and firearms traffickers and providing key services to its law enforcement partners. In 57 percent of high-crime cities where ATF has a presence, there has been a greater than average decrease in violent firearms crime according to the most recent Uniform Crime Report statistics (2002). Further, the agency's oversight of the operations of the regulated firearms industry serves to prevent ineligible individuals from entering the firearms industry and ensures that licensees are engaged in lawful business activities. The requested resources will fund teams in approximately 25 cities experiencing high levels of violent firearms-related crime. These teams will be comprised of Federal agents, state and local law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and support personnel to address firearms crime in areas where the need is most critical. There are no permanent FY 2006 current services for this initiative. BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, FIREARMS & EXPLOSIVES SALARIES AND EXPENSES (Dollars in Thousands) Perm. Pos.

The Department is participating to the fullest extent possible in the various e-Gov initiatives, which remain a priority management objective. The goals of the President's e-Gov Strategy are to eliminate redundant systems and their associated costs, and significantly improve the government's quality of customer service for citizens and businesses. ATF is expected to achieve economies of scale and cost savings as a result of its participation in, and implementation of, e-Training and e- Travel. 1. e-Training As part of its e-Training efforts, the Department is implementing the Justice Virutual University (JVU), a web-based learning management system that provides accessibility and ease of identifying training and development opportunities, saving instructor and travel costs. As a result, ATF anticipates cost savings of $226,000. 2. e-Travel As part of its e-Travel efforts, the Department is implementing the Electronic Travel Service (ETS). ETS is a web-based travel management system that will be fully integrated with various legacy financial systems. As a result, ATF anticipates cost savings of $740,000. 3. Explosives license and permit fee collections The budget proposes appropriation bill language that would permit explosives license and permit fees of $3,000,000 to be credited to the ATF appropriation to cover expenses incurred in reviewing applications and issuing and renewing licenses and user permits.

In addition, the budget has been realigned to reflect the BOP's outputs and full costs by major program activity, including the costs of management and administration, so that a more accurate picture of total activity costs is reflected in the budget. In this way, budget and performance are more closely linked, and provide a better basis on which to make budget decisions. Under the FY 2004 and FY 2005 PART processes, the BOP was rated \"Moderately Effective\", and the score should improve even further in future years as the BOP continues to work to include long term goals in the areas of crowding and recidivism rates and strives to improve performance. /1 The FY 2006 current services request includes three adjustments to base unique to BOP. The request includes $5,100,000 for increasing medical expenses incurred on behalf of federal inmates, $10,000,000 for contract bed cost adjustments mandated by the Services Contract Act, and $13,533,000 for utilities cost adjustments due to rising energy prices. /2 The Federal Prison System (FPS) receives reimbursements for the daily care and maintenance of State and local offenders, for utilities used by Federal Prison Industries, Inc., for staff housing, and for meals provided to FPS staff at institutions. The reimbursements received may be used to fund personnel costs. The BOP estimates that 136 FTE are associated with these reimbursements.

Institution Population Adjustment BOP requests $37,194,000 for costs of the increasing inmate population above the number of newly activating beds. The BOP projects that it will have to absorb 4,269 additional inmates between FY 2005 and FY 2006. The additional resources will enable the BOP to meet the marginal costs, $8,712 per inmate, of providing security, food, medical care, clothing, utilities, unit management, education, records and maintenance associated with the population increase. The marginal cost per inmate includes resources ($1,500) associated with additional staffing requirements. 2. Activate Newly Constructed Facilities (USP Tucson, FCI Butner, Secure Women's Facility) BOP requests 937 positions (471 correctional officers (CO)), 666 workyears, and $77,134,000 to begin the activation process for 3 newly constructed facilities (2,752 beds). The facilities include: a 960 bed high security facility (United States Penitentiary (USP)) with a 128 bed workcamp in Tucson, Arizona; a 1,152 bed medium security facility (Federal Correctional Institution (FCI)) in Butner, North Carolina; and a 512 bed secure women's facility in Hazelton, West Virginia. Construction of USP Tucson will be completed in April 2005, and the request includes 399 positions (220 COs), 399 workyears, and $37,647,000 to begin the activation process in October 2005. Construction of FCI Butner will be completed in January 2006, and the request includes 354 positions (182 COs), 206 workyears, and $29,190,000 to begin the activation process in March 2006. Construction of the Hazelton women's facility will be completed in April 2006 and the request includes 184 positions (69 COs), 61 workyears and $10,297,000 to begin the activation process in June 2006. Activation funding has three components: cost of staffing the facility; one time expenses, such as purchase of equipment, background investigations, and providing basic law-enforcement training and marginal costs associated with the inmates. The request includes $6,000,000 for the marginal costs associated with inmate care that will be needed whether inmates are housed at these facilities or at other BOP facilities who may house the inmates on a interim basis. Activation of these facilities will increase bed space capacity and contribute to a reduction in crowding system-wide. The full year operating cost for each facility, net of one-time expenses, is expected to be $38,930,000 for USP Tucson, $35,941,000 for FCI Butner, and $18,500,000 for the secure women's facility.

Activate Expansion Space BOP requests 65 positions (41 correctional officers), 49 workyears and $7,883,000 to activate a 50 cell expansion to the existing Special Housing Unit (SHU) at USP Florence, Colorado and to begin the activation process for a 362 bed low security housing unit at FCI Sandstone, Minnesota. Construction of the SHU cells, that will be used to segregate problem inmates and thereby increase the capability to safely manage the overall population at USP Florence, will be completed in October 2005, and will be available immediately. Construction of the expansion space at FCI Sandstone, that is operating at nearly twice its intended limit, should be completed in February 2006 and the beds will be available for immediate use. Adding bed space at FCI Sandstone is crucial to the safe operations of this institution for staff, inmates and community. FY 2006 current services resources for Federal Correctional Complex Florence and FCI Sandstone is $95,921,000 and $24,053,000, respectively. 4. Contract Confinement BOP requests 5 positions, 3 workyears, and $19,838,000 to begin the process to obtain 1,600 additional beds in contract facilities to house low security and female inmates. The request includes 4 positions, 2 workyears, and $18,560,000 to procure 1,500 low security beds and 1 position, 1 workyear, and $1,278,000 to procure 100 female beds for 6 months each in FY 2006. Using contract beds for the confinement of low security inmates provides a flexible approach to manage this population. FY 2006 current services resources for contract facilities is $599,179,000. The BOP houses over 15 percent of its total population in contract facilities. 5. Residential Re-entry Program BOP requests $6,000,000 to establish a Residential Re-entry Program at 6 institutions that will build partnerships with faith based and community organizations. Each pilot project will accommodate 100-150 inmates and is being developed with the Department's Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives Taskforce. This request supports the President's initiative to establish a Residential Re-entry Program in Federal prisons and will provide opportunities for the development and maturation of the participating inmates' personal growth and faith commitment. FY 2006 current services resources for faith based programs is $4,933,000.

As a result, the BOP is anticipating cost savings of $194,000 . 2. e-Travel As part of its e-Travel efforts, the Department is implementing the Electronic Travel Service (eTS), a web-based, end-to-end, travel management system that will be integrated with various legacy financial systems Department-wide, and will serve as the travel solution when the new Unified Financial Management System is implemented. Full implementation of eTS is expected by September 2006, leading to the aggregation and consolidation of travel management functions, reduced paper processes, more efficient travel voucher audits, and improved cycle times. As a result, the BOP is anticipating cost savings of $401,000 . 3. Federal Prison Camp Closures The BOP proposes to offset the requested program increases by closing two Federal Prison Camps (FPCs). Closure will result in reduction of 133 positions (46 correctional officers), 133 workyears and $12,000,000. The two FPCs are older, less efficient stand alone institutions, and deactivating them will enable the BOP to reduce operational costs. In one case, closure will also enable BOP to avoid $27,000,000 in rehabilitation and infrastructure repair costs that will be needed over the coming years. Additionally, BOP believes this approach will help maintain low per capita costs at other work camps that are co-located with other prison facilities.

In addition, the budget has been realigned to reflect each component's outputs and full costs by major program activity, including the costs of management and administration, so that a more accurate picture of total activity costs is reflected in the budget. In this way, budget and performance are more closely linked, and provide a better basis on which to make budget decisions. Over time, agencies will be expected to identify effective outcome measures, monitor their progress, and accurately present the associated costs. OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS -- JUSTICE ASSISTANCE (Dollars in Thousands) Program Improvements/Offsets by Strategic Goal Pos. FTE Amount Strategic Goal Three: Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or Reduce Crime and Violence..................................................................... 0 0 -$974,649 Counterterrorism Research and Development 0 0 7,000 The $7,000,000 requested would fund the Counterterrorism Research and Development Program, whose goal is the development of practical tools and approaches to improve the ability of state and local first responders to detect and effectively respond to terrorist acts. This program, administered by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), relies on partnerships as a key part of its strategy. These partnerships enable NIJ to continue to work with other government agencies to speed the introduction of new technology that will help law enforcement combat terrorism. There is no base funding. Improving the Criminal Justice System 1. Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program -26 -26 -547,704 The 2006 budget proposes to eliminate funding for this program, with the exception of the Boys and Girls Club program, for which $60,000,000 is requested. This program was appropriated a total of $625,532,000 in 2005. 2. Indian Country Prison Grants 0 0 -5,389 The budget proposes to eliminate funding for this program in OJP, which was appropriated $4,933,000 in 2005 for this program. A new COPS/OJP Tribal Law Enforcement is proposed to streamline activities between COPS and OJP tribal grant programs, and the FY06 proposed budget under COPS is $51,600,000 for similar purposes, which is almost $32,000,000 more than was appropriated under COPS in 2005 for Indian Country. 3. Tribal Courts 0 0 -7,854 The budget proposes to eliminate funding for this program in OJP, which was appropriated $7,893,000 in 2005. A new COPS/OJP Tribal Law Enforcement is proposed to streamline activities between COPS and OJP tribal grant programs, and the FY06 proposed budget under COPS is $51,600,000 for similar purposes, which is almost $32,000,000 more than was appropriated under COPS in 2005 for Indian Country. OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS -- JUSTICE ASSISTANCE (Dollars in Thousands) Perm. Pos. FTE Amount 4. Byrne Discretionary Grants 0 0 -174,571 For FY 2006, the budget does not include funds for Byrne Discretionary Grants. The original purpose of this program was to provide discretionary grant funding in support of a wide array of activities, especially those that demonstrate, test and evaluate innovations and best practices. However, for the past several years, the level of earmarking within this program has severly hampered OJP's ability to address new and innovative criminal justice initiatives. Traditionally, the discretionary grant program served as a vehicle to fund OJP and Administration initiatives in the area of state and local criminal justice improvements in topics ranging from gun safety, drug testing, alternatives to incarceration, and community-based justice. In the 2005 omnibus budget, 100 percent of this discretionary program is earmarked. This program has an 2005 enacted level of $167,756,000; this funding is eliminated in 2006. 5. Bulletproof Vests 0 0 6,158 The 2006 budget proposes an increase of $6,158,000 for this program, resulting in a total funding level of $29,939,000 . The Bulletproof Vest Program helps states, units of local government, and tribal governments equip their law enforcement and corrections officers with armored vests. Of the $6,158,000 enhancement requested, $3,000,000 will be used to institute a testing program for bulletproof vests in NIJ. This program was appropriated $24,666,000 in 2005. 6. Grants for Closed Circuit Television 0 0 57 The 2005 budget proposes an increase of $57,000 for this program, resulting in a total funding level of $986,000 . This program provides grants for equipment and personnel training for either closed-circuit televising or video taping of the testimony of children in criminal proceedings and for assisting courts, other systems agencies, and social service agencies to establish procedures related to the use of these options. This increase is attributable to program realignment proposed in 2006 where administrative funding has been reallocated to more appropriately reflect the true cost of each program. This program was appropriated $970,000 in 2005. OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS -- JUSTICE ASSISTANCE (Dollars in Thousands) Perm. Pos. FTE Amount 7. USA Freedom Corps 0 0 16,016 The 2005 budget proposes to fund the USA Freedom Corps as a separate, standalone program. This program funds two separate initiatives: the Neighborhood Watch Program (NWP) and the Volunteers in Police Service Program (VIPS). The VIPS Program maximizes service and volunteer opportunities for civilians to collaborate with local police agencies. This program was appropriated $2,467,000 in 2005. 8. ChildSafe Initiative 0 0 28,870 The enhancement requested would provide a total of $33,750,000 to continue this initiative in 2006. The goal of Project ChildSafe is to distribute 65,000,000 gun locks throughout the Nation. This program distributes safety kits in partnership with local law enforcement agencies in communities across the country. Each kit contains printed materials on both safe gun storage and gun safety information, as well as a cable- style gun lock. This program is a key part of the Administration's Project Safe Neighborhoods Initiative. This program was appropriated $4,933,000 in 2005. 9. Cyber Fraud and Computer Forensics Program 0 0 -5,709 The 2006 budget proposes total funding for this program of $3,171,000 . This program is designed to provide a nationwide support system for law enforcement agencies involved in the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of economic and high-tech crimes and to support and partner with other appropriate entities in addressing homeland security initiatives, as they relate to these types of crimes. The funding requested in 2006 will be used to: (1) develop and deliver training, at little or no cost, on investigation techniques for cyber and financial crimes; (2) provide investigative support to financial investigations, primarily through financial and visual analysis and public records searches, and (3) improve knowledge of economic and cyber crime issues through applied research. 10. Police Corps -2 -2 -16,156 The FY 2005 enacted level is $14,800,000; funding for this program is eliminated in the 2006 budget. 11. Project Reentry 0 0 5,331 The proposed 2006 increase of $5,331,000 will result in a total funding level of $15,000,000 for this program, which will coordinate its efforts with a larger interagency initiative involving the collaboration of the Departments of Labor and Housing and Urban Development. The funding is part of a four-year, $300,000,000 prisoner initiative to reduce recidivism rates and the societal costs of reincarceration by helping inmates return to live and work in American communities.

Initially, the DCE/SP consisted of two statewide multi-agency marijuana eradication operations, in Hawaii and California. As the stature of the program grew, additional states began to participate, and by 1985 state and local agencies from all 50 states were participating in the DCE/SP. This program is being transferred from DEA ($11,600,000 from base funds) to OJP in FY 2006 and expanded, and will be renamed the Cannabis Eradication Discretionary Grant Program (CEGP).

OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS -- JUSTICE ASSISTANCE (Dollars in Thousands) Program Realignment Consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act, the 2006 budget proposes to streamline the decision unit structure of DOJ components to align more closely with the mission and strategic objectives contained in the DOJ Strategic Plan (FY 2003-2008). In addition, the budget has been realigned to reflect each component's outputs and full costs by major program activity, including the costs of management and administration, so that a more accurate picture of total activity costs is reflected in the budget. In this way, budget and performance are more closely linked, and provide a better basis on which to make budget decisions. Over time, agencies will be expected to identify effective outcome measures, monitor their progress, and accurately present the associated costs. As part of its effort to realign resources to the DOJ Strategic Plan, the 2006 budget proposes to consolidate funding for OJP-administered programs funded under the Justice Assistance appropriation. In 2006, OJP has realigned its management and administration funding to reflect the full cost, both administrative and programmatic, of each OJP program. In order to achieve this, OJP's management and administration resources were redistributed among all OJP programs so that the budgeted administrative costs for each program were more closely aligned with actual administrative costs. The table below depicts the total funds for each program and the net program funds once administrative costs are subtracted. The net program fund amounts correspond to the amounts included for each program under the Justice Assistance appropriation language in the 2006 President's Budget Appendix. Net Program Admin.

In addition, the budget has been realigned to reflect each component's outputs and full costs by major program activity, including the costs of management and administration, so that a more accurate picture of total activity costs is reflected in the budget. In this way, budget and performance are more closely linked, and provide a better basis on which to make budget decisions. Over time, agencies will be expected to identify effective outcome measures, monitor their progress, and accurately present the associated costs. OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS -- STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE (Dollars in Thousands) As part of its effort to realign resources to the DOJ Strategic Plan, the 2005 budget proposes to move funding for programs funded under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance appropriation to the Office of Justice Programs' Justice Assistance appropriation. In 2005, OJP has realigned its management and administration funding to reflect the full cost, both administrative and programmatic, of each OJP program. In order to achieve this, OJP's management and administration resources were redistributed among all OJP programs so that the budgeted administrative costs for each program were more closely aligned with actual administrative costs. As in the past, amounts shown for OJP's State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance include management and administration costs.

The weed and seed strategy is based on the premise that leaders from neighborhood and community organizations, including faith-based organizations, law enforcement and private enterprise, must leverage resources to solve community problems at the local level. Site funding generally provides resources for \"weeding\" activities, which include joint law enforcement operations and community policing, and \"seeding\" activities, which range from prevention activities located in Safe Havens to neighborhood physical improvement and economic development. Consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act, the 2006 budget proposes to streamline the decision unit structure of DOJ components to align more closely with the mission and strategic objectives contained in the DOJ Strategic Plan (FY 2003-2008). In addition, the budget has been realigned to reflect each component's outputs and full costs by major program activity, including the costs of management and administration, so that a more accurate picture of total activity costs is reflected in the budget.

Fundin g may be used to hire tribal law enforcement, prosecutorial, or judicial officers under terms similar t o those of the current COPS Tribal Law Enforcement grant so that tribal communities will need to plan for the financing of salaries after a three-year period of support. Funding may also be used for equipment to upgrade or improve law enforcement, prosecutorial, or judicial operations. In addition, fundin g may be used for basic, necessar y repairs to existin g facilities. Fundin g may be used for new facilities or f o major modifications of existing facilities only where such modification are necessary to safeguard lives or protect the health and safety of Of the amount provided, at least $3,000,000 is available for a comprehensive national study to be conducted in consultation and coordination with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to establish baseline estimates of existing tribal law enforcement operations and needs for use in guiding future DOJ grant decisions and BIA resource allocations. 2.

In 2006, $58,682,000 is requested for this in the Justice Assistance appropriation under the Services for Victims of Crime Decision Unit. 2/ This program is classified by the Administration as a discretionary account. The PSOB Program's mission is to provide financial assistance to the eligible survivors of federal, state, and local public safety officers who have died as the result of traumatic injury or who are permanently and totally disabled as the direct result of a catastrophic injury sustained in the line of duty, and to provide educational assistance to the spouse and children of slain or totally disabled public safety officers. Consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act, the 2006 budget proposes to streamline the decision unit structure of DOJ components to align more closely with the mission and strategic objectives contained in the DOJ Strategic Plan (FY 2003-2008). In addition, the budget has been realigned to reflect each component's outputs and full costs by major program activity, including the costs of management and administration, so that a more accurate picture of total activity costs is reflected in the budget. In this way, budget and performance are more closely linked, and provide a better basis on which to make budget decisions. Over time, agencies will be expected to identify effective outcome measures, monitor their progress, and accurately present the associated costs. As part of its effort to realign resources to the DOJ strategic plan, the 2006 budget proposes to move funding for this program under the Justice Assistance account. In 2006, $58,682,000 is requested for this in the Justice Assistance appropriation under the Services for Victims of Crime Decision Unit.
