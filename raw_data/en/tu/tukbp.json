HILL, DC Founding Executive, Chief Medical Officer/Chairman, Scientific Advisory Committee What's the difference between Turmeric essential oil and turmeric extract? Is Green Mandarin photosensitive? What is the latest research on Copaiba?There is a distinct difference between essential oils and extracts, and it goes well beyond their aromas. An extract is either a part of the plant dried and ground or soaked in liquid, while an essential oil is the volatile aromatic compounds contained within the plant. The distillation process preserves the unique compounds and their properties that are lost when a plant extract is made. Many of the constituents contained in turmeric extract are too large to survive the steam distillation process, so the extract is predominantly made up of various curcuminoids, while the essential oil is composed primary of sesquiterpenes ar-Turmerone and Turmerone. The different compositions result in a different spectrum of benefits. Turmeric essential oil not only imparts a powerfully warm and spicy aroma, but it also, due to its high concentration of ar-Turmerone and Turmerone, helps support healthy immune and nervous system function when taken internally.* It also has a number of benefits for the skin when applied topically. Though the essential oil and the extract yield different results, they are a power couple when used together. Citrus essential oils generally have a photosensitivity warning due to the possible presence of furanocoumarins (organic compounds that bond to DNA and prevent the skin from protecting itself from sunlight). However, we have been unable to detect any of these photosensitive compounds in our source of Green Mandarin. Nonetheless, Green Mandarin has a photosensitivity warning as a precaution. It is categorized as neat, but if you are going to apply Green Mandarin essential oil topically to take advantage of its skin-cleansing and health-supporting properties, we do recommend being cautious while outdoors. With further investigation, we continue to find more benefits from using Copaiba essential oil. In the last three years, we have seen over 50 peer-reviewed publications regarding Copaiba, including our latest AromaTouch\u00ae Hand Technique clinical trial, which provided some intriguing evidence of Copaiba's benefits when applied topically. But internal use is where most of the current research is leading. With its high concentration of endocannabinoid beta-caryophyllene and its ability to influence CB 2 receptors, Copaiba may have powerful antioxidant effects and may support the function of several body systems when ingested, especially the immune and nervous systems.* A recent meta-analysis acknowledged a number of recent publications that highlighted Copaiba's cellular health-supporting and tissue-remodeling benefits. We are just scratching the surface of discovery with Copaiba. Expect more from dTERRA Science on this amazing oil in the future. 4 / SPRING 2019 LIVING MAGAZINE Essential Oil Spotlight Fun Facts: The name Melissa is Greek for \"honey bee.\" The Melissa officinalis plant, sometimes referred to as lemon balm, was nicknamed Melissa because of its sweet, refreshing fragrance, which is known to attract bees.

In the air you breathe, the food you eat, and even the products you use to clean your home, there are substances that can interfere with vital organ function and have a negative impact on your overall well-being.1 Risk for various allergies, digestive sensitivities, respiratory-related illness, and impaired immune system function have all been associated with excessive exposure to environmental toxins.2 Although minimizing exposure is the first step, your body has vital organs and endogenous mechanisms to regulate toxic load. According to research, maintaining adequate levels of hydration may be one of the most important factors in supporting the health of the liver and kidneys\u2014the internal organs that filter blood, detoxify chemicals, and assist the body in the excretion of waste and toxins.3 WHY SO MUCH WATER? Water supports your cleansing organs in several different ways: helping flush liver tissues, assisting the kidneys in filtering and excreting waste, and even in mitigating risk for disease. In a state of dehydration, acid and waste products build up, causing the kidneys to become congested with myoglobin (proteins that carry and store oxygen in muscle cells). The risk for kidney stone formation and urinary tract infections greatly increases, making it more difficult to control toxic load. Fortunately, maintaining adequate hydration is as simple as following the principles of the dTERRA\u00ae Wellness Lifestyle Pyramid. Ensuring your water intake is adequate to support toxic load management is possible with three fundamental lifestyle behaviors: 1. EAT A WHOLE FOODS DIET. Y ou r eceive as much as 30 percent of your daily water from your diet.4 Foods with high water compositions, especially whole fruits and vegetables, are an important contributor to overall fluid intake. In their natural form, fruits and vegetables such as broccoli, watermelon, and leafy greens have a higher than 90 percent water content. Processed foods, especially those high in sugar, can have a hypernatremic effect, actually drawing water from your body. Additionally, research has shown that if you are drinking your calories, you may be tricking your body into a false sense of adequate hydration.5 2. DRINK (WATER) AT EVERY MEAL. T o optimize digestion and support the proper function of the liver and kidneys, you should be consuming water with every meal. Water homeostasis is highly dependent on regular fluid intake, and the kidneys work most efficiently to excrete toxins when there is a fluid excess.6 Dehydration forces your cells to hold onto water to make up for insufficient intake. Furthermore, the ability of your kidneys to eliminate water is limited, making it important to hydrate throughout the day as opposed to drinking a large amount of water in one sitting. 3. IMPROVE HYDRATION WITH SLEEP. In a study published in the journal Sleep, researchers discovered that those who averaged six hours of sleep or less showed several indicators of dehydration.7 The link between sleep and hydration is a little-known hormone called vasopressin, whose primary purpose is to communicate with the kidneys to balance the amount of water in your blood. Like many of our physiological processes, the secretion of vasopressin is regulated by our body's circadian rhythm. While the hypothalamus secretes a consistent stream of vasopressin throughout the day, the vasopressin release peaks in the final stage of your sleep cycle (the rapid eye movement (REM) stage). If late nights or early mornings are precluding you from going through all five sleep phases, you are missing out on peak vasopressin secretion cycles, making it more difficult to maintain sufficient levels of hydration and manage your overall toxic load. 6 / SPRING 2019 LIVING MAGAZINEREFERENCES 1.

T ake time this spring to liven up your self-care routines.Detoxing Your HabitsReduce Stress: 10 / SPRING 2019 LIVING MAGAZINEPractice Meditation In our busy, hectic lives, one of the scarcest commodities can be silence. It's important to take time each day to let go and find some moments of silence. Meditation gives you the opportunity and time to clear all the thoughts from your head and enjoy the peace. A clear head can be a type of reset button allowing you to reprioritize and start your day, or the rest of your day, with a fresh outlook. As you begin your meditation, rub Melissa on your forehead, shoulders, or chest to help promote feelings of relaxation and relieve feelings of stress. Another great option to help with your meditation is to diffuse the dTERRA Peace\u00ae Blend to help create a calming environment where you can truly let go of the stresses you carry with you. Participate in Positive Self-Talk Sometimes we can be our own worst enemy. Kind self-talk can help alter our mindset, promote positive thinking, and reduce the stress that happens when we feel insufficient. This self-talk can be as simple as telling yourself, \"I am enough.\" Or, if you find yourself in a stress-inducing situation, instead of telling yourself, \"This is horrible. Everything is falling apart,\" pause and tell yourself, \"I am capable, and everything will be okay.\" T o help promote feelings of optimism and positivity, apply a drop of dTERRA Cheer\u00ae to your hands and inhale deeply. Alternatively, apply dTERRA\u00ae Jasmine T ouch as a personal fragrance for a consistent aroma that will uplift your mood throughout the day.

Whatever you choose to write about, make sure to take time each day to recognize the simple things that are good in your life. Slow Down and Be Present Our lives can get so hectic; from the time we get up until our head hits the pillow at night, it can feel like we are sprinting from one thing to the next. When we get into the habit of living life at that frantic pace, it can be hard to appreciate the time we spend with others. So, when you're with those who are important to you, pause and be present in the moment. Don't simply think about what you need to do next, but appreciate where you are and who you are with. When we stop the running to-do list in our mind, we can let go of some of our stress and enjoy the everyday moments. T ake advantage of the grounding benefits of dTERRA Balance\u00ae throughout the day by putting a drop or two on the bottom of your feet in the morning.

The islands' rich volcanic soil is ideal for farming, and for thousands of years exotic plant life has thrived there. Among these is the Hawaiian Sandalwood tree\u2014prized for its alluring aroma and unique properties. Sadly, the past few decades of land mismanagement have posed a threat to Hawaiian Sandalwood groves. A new chapter in the story of this remarkable tree has begun; dTERRA and the Hawaiian government are now partnered to protect the future of Hawaiian Sandalwood. Past Located near the western coast of the Big Island of Hawaii, Kealakekua is a region whose history is deeply intertwined with the many unique and endemic species of Hawaii. \"Kealakekua [translated, the Pathway of the Gods] Bay and the surrounding land area have been recognized as one of the most, if not the most, significant historical places in Hawaii. Supported by the abundance of agricultural products from the upland Kona field system and the rich marine resources of the bay, the Kealakekua area became a densely populated settlement and a religious political center.\"\u2014 Excerpts from The State of Hawaii's Kealakekua Stewardship Area Management Plan. Shortly following European contact in the early 1800s, the Sandalwood trade with China boomed and King Kamehameha I himself became heavily involved in the enterprise. The astounding revenue flowing from this trade led to the exploitation of the harvest workers. The Hawaiian natives were compelled to labor in extreme conditions, but the people were not the only ones taxed by the overharvest. The Sandalwood groves in the Kealakekua region were becoming sickly and sparse. Hope on the Horizon Being mindful of the past is essential to dTERRA and the Hawaiian people. dTERRA's involvement with the Kealakekua Mountain Reserve is an opportunity to redefine the future of the islands' native trees\u2014especially the Sandalwood. Lani Yamasaki, a respected native Hawaiian practitioner notes, \"By reforesting the land with iliahi [Sandalwood] and other native plants, iliahi becomes a symbol of regeneration, health, and healing for both the land and the community.\" The reverent approach to Sandalwood management on the Kealakekua Mountain Reserve represents Ka L Hiki Ola or The Dawning of a New Day. A New Safe Haven Kealakekua Moutain Reserve (KMR) is located on an old ranch, which was overgrazed and overlogged, inhibiting natural regrowth. To form the Kealakekua Mountain Reserve, a conservation easement was signed to protect these precious native plants, including Sandalwood trees. This management plan outlines harvesting limitations that must be followed at KMR to guarantee the regeneration and prosperity of the forest At the outset of our efforts, only dead or severely damaged trees will be collected, which will allow existing, healthy trees to grow to full maturity before they are harvested at the appropriate time, under sustainable tree management practices. With these reforestation efforts in place, Sandalwood harvesting will become sustainable and the native groves will flourish once more. Together, the KMR Reserve, the management objectives, an extensive nursery, and our ambitious reforestation efforts will help Sandalwood and other native Hawaiian species thrive for years to come. We anticipate that KMR will be the largest native forest planting effort in the state of Hawaii starting in 2020.

But there is no reason those benefits shouldn't be shared outside your front door as well. A classroom setting is a hodgepodge of stress-inducing stimuli, which makes it an ideal setting for focus-supporting and grounding volatile aromatic compounds. With their ability to support a fun and healthy learning environment, it is no wonder that essential oils are becoming more commonplace in schools. Research shows that many essential oils promote a happy and productive learning environment. When experienced aromatically, whether directly inhaled or diffused, essential oils have been shown to be calming and relaxing while also promoting alertness and focus. The key is to know which oils to use for each situation. In the classroom, a little learning goes a long way. For daily diffusion: The ability to influence moods and emotions is one of the most scientifically validated properties of essential oils. Whether the classroom is in need of a calming or uplifting influence, using the dTERRA Oil Chemistry Wheel is the easiest way to find the day's perfect aromatic complement. Conventional wisdom suggests that floral and citrus oils are best for classroom diffusion, and some proprietary dTERRA blends, such as dTERRA Peace\u00ae and dTERRA Balance\u00ae, were developed specifically for this purpose. Due to its proprietary combination of Lavender, Ylang Ylang, and other calming floral and spice essential oils, dTERRA Peace\u00ae Reassuring Blend is capable of promoting a calm environment. Similarly, the concentration of linalool and bornyl acetate in dTERRA Balance\u00ae Grounding Blend make it an ideal option to promote in-class relaxation and improved response to stress.6 Backed by research: Research has shown that the inhalation of Bergamot is associated with uplifting and relaxing feelings, and it may help reduce feelings of emotional negativity and stress.1,2 Clinical research has shown that Wild Orange essential oil has a calming and relaxing aroma and may promote an uplifting mood in a variety of environments.3 Clinical trials show that inhalation of Lavender and Ylang Ylang may improve anxious feelings and self-esteem.4, 5 At test time: Whether it's a first grader taking their first spelling test or a high schooler facing another AP exam, test time can be one of the most stress-inducing periods for any student\u2014and precisely the time when being alert and focused counts. Research has shown that aromatic usage of essential oils can promote an environment conducive to academic performance. Essential oils with high concentrations of sesquiterpenes, such as Black Pepper and Vetiver, are effective at promoting alertness and focus. In one study, participants exhibited improved focus while completing a visual display terminal after inhalation of Vetiver; these results suggest that diffusion may be particularly useful at test time.7 A study involving the diffusion of Black Pepper showed similar effects.8 18 / SPRING 2019 LIVING MAGAZINEUSING ESSENTIAL OILS IN THE CLASSROOM USING ESSENTIAL OILS IN THE CLASSROOM USING ESSENTIAL OILS IN THE CLASSROOMTaking off the edge: The uplifting effects of Peppermint shouldn't just be used before your workout; they are just as effective at promoting the focus necessary to succeed in the classroom. One study found that inhalation of Peppermint decreased feelings that intense tasks were mentally and physically taxing.9 Other studies have shown similar effects when participants inhaled Basil or Rosemary, suggesting that they may be effective when completing tasks that require mental focus.10, 11 Lastly, dTERRA has developed a blend specifically for this purpose. With its combination of Peppermint, Basil, Rosemary, and citrus oils, dTERRA Motivate\u00ae Encouraging Blend promotes the alertness and focus needed to take on mentally taxing assignments. Conclusion Parents, teachers, and school administrators alike share the same goal: to provide the best environment for children to develop and learn. Due to the profound connection between the olfactory system and moods, emotions, and mental alertness, essential oil diffusion may be an effective method to support that ideal classroom atmosphere. For best results, and to determine the best essential oil to diffuse in your classroom, refer to the dTERRA Oil Chemistry Wheel. References 1. Watanabe E, et al.

A natural-born athlete, Lauren played sports competitively for years until her talents landed her a spot on Brown's prestigious volleyball team. By her senior year, she was named team captain and earned the Second T eam All-Ivy and Academic All-Ivy titles. With 1,090 career kills, Lauren ranks fourth in Brown's volleyball history. After graduation, Lauren pursued a career in sales and very quickly forged a vertical path. After working in many notable organizations, Lauren was looking to a future of corporate success, but then she was presented with a life-changing opportunity to try out for the U.S. Women's Bobsled National T eam. At 30 years old, Lauren had no expectation of even being considered for the team. Yet, three months later, she was selected to represent T eam USA as a rookie member of the Women's Bobsled National T eam in 2015. Age: 34 Hometown: Los Angeles Current Home : Wherever my suitcase is. Family: They are the best people I know. Personal Motto: \"Work harder, work harder, work harder, and stop complaining about it. The ability to work hard and overcome adversity is a gift.\" 20 / SPRING 2019 LIVING MAGAZINE2x Daily 3x Weekly Daily 2x Weekly Daily All Winter T ell us your experience surrounding the Olympics. What was it like to get there? And what emotions did you have once you finally made it to race day? The U.S. Women's Bobsled T eam has medaled in every Olympics since the sport was introduced as an Olympic sport in 2002. With that knowledge, I knew I was going to have to work incredibly hard to carry on that legacy. I can honestly say, I have never worked harder for something in my life. After being placed on the team, I put all my energy into my preparation, and when race day came, I knew I was ready. Competing as an Olympic athlete was one of the most incredible feelings in the world. I felt like a real-life superhero, and it was an honor to represent my country. Where do you draw your inspiration? I am inspired by the legacy of those who came before me, and watching my teammates work so hard and achieve their dreams. It makes me want to match their efforts and follow their examples. What do you hope the audience takes away from your public speeches? I want to open their eyes to what is possible when you work hard and are honest with yourself about the effort you are putting in. Achieving my dream wasn't easy, but it sure was worth it. Lastly, I want my audience to know that it is never too late to try something new. What do you want to be known for or what is your biggest accomplishment? I want to be the person that people look at and say, \"If Lauren can do it, so can I.\" I want to show people that you don't have to be extraordinary to do great things. What are your favorite do-TERRA\u00ae products and how do you normally use them? How did you first get involved with bobsledding competitively? A friend of mine told me about open tryouts for the USA bobsled team. Many of the athletes had retired after the 2014 Sochi Olympics and the coaches were looking for new brakemen and brakewomen for the upcoming season. I only tried out because the Olympic training center was near my home in Denver, so it didn't seem like a huge commitment. I had never been to an Olympic training center and figured it would be a cool experience to see how Olympians train and live. Not long after tryouts, I received an invitation to attend a training camp, and a few months later I found myself at the top of a mountain about to take my first ride. Do you have a routine to get ready for a competition? What is it? Our season is very compact; each week we travel to a new location and compete. Here's a week at-a-glance: On Monday we travel. T uesday through Thursday we do ice training, all building up to race day on Saturday. Because my location changes weekly, it is important to make each hotel feel like home. I like to get organized and unpack so that I feel settled. The biggest component of race preparation, outside of food and actual training, is sleep. Bobsledding is a sport of adrenaline, so it can be hard to unwind at night, especially before a race; I like to diffuse a mixture of Lavender, Clary Sage, and Copaiba to promote relaxation and restful sleep in my Iris diffuser. It fits perfectly on my side table and does not take up much space in my suitcase.

This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.The AromaTouch Technique\u00ae is a scientifically substantiated essential oil application method, shown to reduce feelings of stress and promote relaxation through the use of essential oils on the body.1 But, performing the technique correctly takes a high level of expertise and a significant amount of time. If you haven't had the opportunity to become a certified AromaTouch Technique trainer, or if you don't have an hour to share a powerful essential oil experience with a friend in need, the AromaTouch Hand Technique (ATHT) is a convenient and simple alternative. And, as a recently published clinical trial suggests, the spectrum of benefits offered by ATHT are just as powerful.24 / SPRING 2019 LIVING MAGAZINEThe Process What makes ATHT so amazing is its simplicity. One to three drops of your favorite essential oil, five to ten minutes, and five simple movements are all that you need to provide that human connection and real measurable benefits. Furthermore, unlike the full AromaTouch Technique\u00ae, ATHT is highly customizable and can be catered to address the unique needs of any individual. Whether the recipient needs to be calmed, grounded, or uplifted, the application method remains the same; just use your dTERRA Oil Chemistry Wheel to determine which essential oil to use. Don't leave home without your favorite oils because no setting or situation is too big (or too small) for ATHT. The Study Having already proven the effectiveness of the full AromaTouch Technique in an earlier pilot trial, dTERRA scientists recruited 36 participants to investigate the benefits of ATHT and two of their most popular oils: Copaiba and Deep Blue\u00ae Soothing Blend.2 After a physician evaluated them and they completed baseline measurements, the participants were separated into control and treatment groups. All participants received ATHT from trained practitioners twice a day for five consecutive days for a total of 10 times. A combination of dTERRA Deep Blue blend and Copaiba was applied to the hands of the treatment group, while the control group received the same ATHT protocol with Fractionated Coconut Oil instead. Measures were taken to control for the variances in aroma and color of the oil applied to the separate groups. After completion of the trial period, all participants were reassessed with the same questionnaire and functional tests that were utilized to gather the baseline data. As reported in a recent publication of Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice, the treatment group exhibited clinically significant improvements on both the self-reported questionnaire and the objective functional tests. The results provided robust evidence of the efficacy of Copaiba and Deep Blue\u00ae Soothing Blend, contributed a framework for future clinical trials, and showed that a caring hand and some essential oils are often all that is needed to brighten someone's day.The Service The ATHT trial represents a novel area of research not just for dTERRA, but also for the scientific community. It also provides outreach opportunities in the global dTERRA community. In 2018, dTERRA conducted 36 ATHT care events in the community surrounding their global headquarters in Pleasant Grove, Utah. Most of these events involved dTERRA employees visiting senior care centers and introducing them to the wellness promoting benefits of essential oils and the ATHT. With scientific validation of ATHT in hand, dTERRA has plans to increase the number of community events in 2019. References 1. Bahr T, Rodriguez D, and Allred K.

Migrants are suffering in unhygienic conditions in the border camps without schools or showers. Many are living in pop-up tents while others are crowded into an unheated warehouse without running water and light. To help with the situation, Stevenson and her crew loaded 500 kits into backpacks and hiked across the U.S. border into Tijuana. There they passed out the kits, which were gratefully received.
