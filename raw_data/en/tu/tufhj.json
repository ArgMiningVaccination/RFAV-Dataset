We asked her what made her sign up to the five-day getaway with [Luxury Retreats Bali ](http://www.thehoneycombers.com/singapore/2014/07/luxury-retreats-bali.php)on the cliff tops of Uluwatu Beach and what she took away from the experience. Hi Sally! Why did you go on the retreat? I'd had a tough 10 months at work and needed to do something for myself, take some time out and get back on track to living a happy and healthy life. I love Bali, yoga and wanted to meet some like-minded people, so this retreat was perfect. Describe a typical day at Luxury Retreats Bali. My alarm went off at 6am (although I'm not usually a morning person!) and we'd do our cleansing ritual before our daily morning yoga class. We'd then have a delicious and healthy breakfast, followed by a few hours to relax by the pool, at the beach or go for a massage. After lunch was when we'd have an education lesson (called Dharma talk), which was always interesting and informative, followed by meditation. We'd then have an afternoon cleansing juice or coconut water before more free time or spa treatments. A restorative / zen yoga class would happen at sunset followed by dinner and then into bed early, ready for the next day! How hard is it to survive the detox? Daily yoga? The detox wasn't as hard as I thought, although I'd done a juice cleanse the week prior to going to help prepare my body. The food at the retreat was incredibly tasty, full of flavour and I never felt hungry (I'm sure keeping busy, yoga and relaxing spa treatments helped with this!). Actually, I loved how light and energetic I felt as a result of eating a diet of clean, raw, vegan food for the few days. Daily yoga was brilliant also. The morning practice at sunrise overlooking the ocean was more of a dynamic class, and an excellent way to feel energised for the day ahead. The afternoon yoga class was restorative and included stretching, breathing and gentle movement. What was the best thing you took away from it? Learning more about yoga and Ayurveda (Hindu traditional medicine) as well as simple tools and exercises to do after the retreat to help make your mind and body feel balanced, healthier, lighter and more relaxed. What did you learn about yourself? I learnt what my Ayurvedic dosha (constitution) is - ie.a unique mix of three mind/body principles which are responsible for our 'unique' physical, mental and emotional characteristics and what specific foods, exercises and daily/seasonal routines are right / balancing for me. I found this incredibly fascinating and really accurate! Who should go? Absolutely anyone. The retreat isn't just about yoga and detoxing - it's learning how to live your life in a busy world. It teaches you how to stay grounded and how to lead a healthy and calm existence. Whether you're wanting to escape the daily grind, calm your mind and body, nourish your soul or recharge your energy, this retreat is ideal. Thanks Sally!
