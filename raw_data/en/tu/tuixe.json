With age, the prostate increases in size and constricts the urethral opening. Prostate hyperplasia affects the vast majority of aging men and is a leading cause of urinary problems. Secretions from the prostate drain into the urethra in a region called the transition zone which is the primary site for hyperplasia. I will describe how single cell RNA-sequencing and histological studies led to the identification of two novel cell types, club and hillock, in the urethra and transition zone of the prostate. Unlike prostate cells, these novel urethral cell types do not depend on male hormones for survival. Men with prostate hyperplasia are treated with drugs to reduce the key male hormone dihydrotestosterone and shrink the prostate. Prostate cells in men treated with hormone reducing drugs undergo an unexpected transition to a club cell-like state. This transition is characterized by a reduction in prostate gland size and morphology as well as an increase in NF-KB signaling. This epithelial plasticity appears to be a survival strategy and a protective mechanism in the face of reduced dihydrotestosterone and increased inflammation. The induction of a urethral cell state as a protective mechanism in the prostate highlights understudied aspects of urethral cells in maintaining homeostasis, immune regulation and anti-microbial activity at the urethral barrier. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Distinct gene expression patterns dictate transitions in cell states, such as T cell activation and proliferation. Numerous signaling pathways are triggered in response to T cell activation. These pathways control the expression of target genes to direct downstream immunologic activities. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression during T cell activation remain largely unknown. Trans-acting RNA binding proteins (RBPs) regulate several RNA processing steps during gene expression, which have various functional consequences on the encoded protein. CELF2 (CUGBP, Elav-like family member 2) is an RBP that plays a critical role in T cell function and development primarily by playing a major role in shaping the transcriptome of T cells. Particularly, CELF2 is known as an activation-dependent regulator of alternative splicing in T cells. My work identified a previously unrecognized functional role of CELF2 in regulating a different step of gene expression called alternative polyadenylation (APA) in activated T cells. APA leads to the formation of mRNA isoforms with different 3\u00e2 untranslated region (3\u00e2 UTR). Our mapping of CELF2 binding to RNA revealed that CELF2 binding is enriched in the 3\u00e2 UTR of transcripts, including its own 3\u00e2 UTR. To understand the mechanistic and functional consequences of CELF2 binding to 3\u00e2 UTRs, I first studied the regulation of alternative events in CELF2 3\u00e2 UTR. I showed that CELF2 protein is both necessary and sufficient for the activation-induced APA event in the 3\u00e2 UTR. Next, to understand the mechanism of the APA regulation, I showed that CELF2 competes with the core enhancer proteins of polyadenylation machinery \u00e2 CFIm25 and CstF64 \u00e2 to control the APA event in activated T cells. Next, to study if CELF2 also drives a broader program of activation-induced APA, I compared CELF2 CLIP-Seq data with that of the CFI and CstF complexes and found that CELF2 binding overlaps extensively with APA enhancer activities transcriptome-wide. Further, to directly assess the functional role of CELF2 on APA, I analyzed our RNA-Seq data from Jurkat T cells and found that over a third of 3\u00e2 UTRs that undergo T cell signaling-induced APA are regulated in a CELF2-dependent manner. Finally, to understand how CELF2 regulates the expression of other RBPs in T cells, I focused on RBPs critical for T cell function and development among the CELF2 target genes. I showed that CELF2 represses RBFOX2 protein levels in T cells by regulating the APA event in RBFOX2 3\u00e2 UTR. Notably, my work also demonstrated that CELF2 regulates the translation of hnRNP C. Taken together, these studies uncovered a new mechanism by which APA is regulated in a signal-dependent manner in T cells and increased our understanding of how genes are regulated in response to external cues. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Lipid trafficking mediated by lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) is critical to maintaining cellular homeostasis. One such group of LTPs is the phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) which are essential to transfer phosphatidylinositol (PI) across organellar membranes. PI transferred by PITPs is required to sustain levels of several signalling lipids which are critical to regulate multiple cellular processes. However, what remains unknown is how the activity of PITPs is regulated in vivo. Drosophila photoreceptors are morphologically polarized neurons which express a large multidomain PITP called Retinal Degeneration B (RDGB) protein. RDGB is localized at the interface of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and apical plasma membrane (PM). Loss of RDGB function, or its mislocalization is associated with reduced lipid levels, defects in electrical response to light, all of which culminate in degeneration of photoreceptors, implying its need in supporting physiology (Yadav et al., 2015). RDGB is a multi-domain PITP which in addition to the N-terminal PI transfer domain (PITPd) has additional motif/domains (FFAT, DDHD, and LNS2) which regulate its PI transfer function. An interaction of the ER integral protein called VAP with the FFAT motif of RDGB has previously been reported to be essential for the localization of RDGB at the MCS (Yadav et al., 2018). However, in our study, we show that the FFAT motif of RDGB is insufficient for interaction with VAP as it requires a large unstructured region of RDGB for a stable interaction. Additionally, we observe that a stable interaction with VAP also does not accurately localize RDGB at the ER-PM junction. We identify the C-terminal LNS2 domain of RDGB to be indispensable for the localization and function of RDGB. The LNS2 domain localizes specifically to the apical PM in the polarized photoreceptors of Drosophila. Loss of the LNS2 domain from RDGB leads to reduced light response, altered lipid levels, and also photoreceptor degeneration. Additionally, we observe that the DDHD domain in RDGB tightly regulates the localization of the LNS2 domain. We find this interaction to be indispensable for function, as perturbation of this interaction caused by deleting LNS2 domain leads to loss of RDGB function (Basak et al., 2021). This is attributable to the large misregulated movements of the DDHD domain which now interacts with the PITPd inhibiting the latter's PI transfer activity. Thus, our study highlights the multiple different interactions within the RDGB protein which are critical to modulate its lipid transfer activity at the ER-PM interface which then go on to regulate the structure and function of the photoreceptor neurons (Basak et al., 2019).

The lines are derived from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study that includes both people with PD and unaffected individuals across a wide range of polygenic risk scores (PRS) with both risk variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and monogenic causal alleles. We generated genetic, epigenetic, regulatory, transcriptomic, proteomic, and longitudinal cellular imaging data from iPSC-derived DA neurons to understand key molecular relationships between disease associated genetic variation and proximate molecular events in a PD relevant cell-type. Analyses of all data modalities collected in FOUNDIN-PD suggest that the differentiation to DA neurons, while not fully mature, was successful and robust. The transcriptomic data includes both single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (day 65) and bulk RNA-seq data (day 0, 25 and 65). Similarly, the epigenetic data includes both single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data (day 65) and bulk ATAC-seq data (day 0, 25 and 65). Using scRNA-seq, in total, 416,216 high quality cells were retained. After evaluation, seven distinct broad cell types were identified across all samples including: early neuron progenitors, late neuron progenitors, DA neurons, immature DA neurons, proliferating floor plate progenitors, neuroepithelial-like cells and ependymal-like cells. A number of well-known marker genes were used to annotate the cell types identified using the scRNA-seq data. For example, expression of TH and MAP2 was clearly enriched in the neuronal cell types. Interestingly, scRNA-seq expression data revealed a significant enrichment of expression of genes within PD linked risk loci in the two identified dopaminergic cell types (immature and DA neurons) relative to the other cell types. Moreover, we were able to show some early predictive markers of each line with potential to generate high levels of DA neurons and it is tempting to speculate that sorting iPSCs based on a high expression of SRSF5 may improve differentiation efficiency. Using scATAC-seq, in total, 139,659 cells were retained. We identified similar broad cell types as in the scRNA-seq data. Cell type specific chromatin accessibility was observed at particular genes of interest. For example, a distinct peak was identified at the promoter of TH in scATAC-seq that only appears in DA neurons. These data reveal that DA neurons derived from human iPSC provide a valuable cellular context and foundational atlas for modeling PD-related genetic risk. In addition to making the data and analyses for this molecular atlas readily available, we have integrated these data into the browsable FOUNDIN-PD data portal ( [https://www.foundinpd.org]) to be used as a resource for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of PD. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Cell behavior is controlled through spatio-temporally localized protein activity. Despite unique and often contradictory roles played by Src-family-kinases (SFKs) in regulating cell physiology, activity patterns of individual SFKs have remained elusive. Fyn kinase, an SFK member is especially important as it is a known modulator of processes such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer, fibrosis, is critical for myelination of neurons by oligodendrocytes and controls both long term potentiation as well as long term depression in the CA-1 region of the hippocampus. These functions make Fyn an important drug target for diseases like metastatic cancers and Alzheimer\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2s disease. Studies suggest that Fyn kinase controls signals emanating from different classes of cell-surface receptors by functioning as a signaling node. Despite its importance in controlling various aspects of cellular behavior, knowledge pertaining to how this kinase is itself regulated in the cell, how it performs such varied (and often opposing) functions with such high specificity is lacking due to the paucity of tools that can selectively detect Fyn kinase activity in cells, with current antibodies only providing a pan-SFK readout. In this thesis, I describe novel biosensors, designed for specifically visualizing active conformation of Fyn kinase in live cells. First, by deploying combinatorial library screening, we have successfully isolated a binding protein (F29) targeted specifically to activated Fyn. Using this binding protein, F29, we have engineered a sensitive, minimally perturbing fluorescence-resonance-energy-transfer (FRET) biosensor (FynSensor) that reveals cellular to be spatially localized, pulsatile, sensitive to adhesion/integrin signaling as well as to growth factor stimulations. Additionally, inhibition of focal-adhesion-kinase activity not integrin and growth-factor-signaling, and clarifies how compartmentalized Src-kinase activity may drive cell fate. As a complementary approach to available biosensors for studying kinase function and activity in cells, I also describe briefly, a next-generation, engineered-GFP-based, single-color sensor for endogenous Fyn kinase. As a show that the sensor can sense endogenous Fyn kinase in live-mammalian cells and faithfully reports Fyn activation by means of a fluorogenic readout. Additionally, using this single-color sensor we can perform multi-spectral imaging which allows for judicious use of the available spectral bandwidth (unpublished data). Taken together, work presented in this thesis aims at illustrating how novel biosensors for critical signaling proteins can help gain better insight into their biological functions within the confines of cellular length and time scales.

During these processes, epithelia experience mechanical forces which are generated intrinsically through actomyosin contractility regulated by signaling mechanisms. The response of epithelia to mechanical stress is similar to soft materials like toothpaste or foams. They deform like solids on short timescales but deform like fluids on large timescales. This phenomenon called tissue fluidity is important during development, wound healing, and tumor invasion. For instance, during development, the tissues modulate their dynamics to generate stable tissue shapes. During the initial phase of wound healing, epithelial tissues are very dynamic to close the wound, but during later stages, they reduce their dynamics to maintain their shape and prevent overhealing. In order to understand how epithelial tissues, regulate their dynamics during these processes, it is key to understand the mechanisms that regulate tissue fluidity. During my postdoctoral work, I studied how mechanical stress regulates tissue fluidity in the in vivo model system of the Drosophila pupal wing. I found that mechanical stress regulates the turnover E-Cadherin and modulates tissue fluidity (Iyer et al, Current Biology, 2019). Recent studies have shown a close link between nuclear shape and tissue fluidity. In Drosophila larval epithelial tissues, I found that compression of cells flattens the nucleus and elevates the levels of nuclear scaffold protein Lamin A/C (Iyer et al, Nat Comms, 2021). This suggests a possible role of nuclear mechanics in influencing tissue fluidity. Epithelial tissues epithelia have a composite structure where the ECM acts as an underlying substrate, and the cells above it form another dynamic layer with adhesion between them mediated through various cell-cell junctions along the apicobasal axis. Recent studies have shown that ECM itself can have fluid-like properties. I hypothesize that tissue fluidity emerges from a complex interplay between extracellular matrix (ECM), cell junctions, cytoskeleton, and nuclear mechanics. In my future work, I plan to use biophysical techniques like Laser ablation, FRAP, and FRET, and Traction force microscopy (TFM) combined with high-resolution imaging, and theoretical modeling, to dissect the molecular mechanisms regulating tissue fluidity. Using epithelial cells in culture, and Drosophila epithelium as model systems, I will investigate how tissue fluidity regulates wound healing in epithelia, and how altering fluidity could help inhibit tumor invasion. I believe that the findings from my future work could provide new insights into wound healing and tumor invasion, and form the basis for identifying therapeutic drug targets for regulating wound healing in epithelia and inhibiting metastasis. 10:15 AM, Monday, Jul 26, 2021 | Remote VCSeminar by Dr Sudarshan Gadadhar on 'Tubulin posttranslational modifications: functional implications in mammalian cilia and flagella.' 03:30 PM, Monday, Jul 26, 2021 | Remote VCPresynopsis Thesis Seminar by Ms isoforms G-protein coupled signaling in vivo' 09:00 AM, Friday, Aug 06, 2021 | Remote VCSeminar by Dr Avantika Lal on 'Deep Learning Models to Enhance Epigenomic Data' 03:00 PM, Tuesday, Aug 10, 2021 | Remote VCThesis Seminar by Ms Shreya Das Sharma on 'Characterization of the electrophysiological properties of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (hPSC) from fragile X Syndrome patients' 04:30 PM, Thursday, Aug 12, 2021 | Remote VCPresynopsis Thesis Seminar by Ms Anjali Jaiman 'Glycan variability and control in the Golgi 06:30 PM, Friday, Aug 13, 2021 | Remote VCPublic Lecture by Dr Harsh Mander on 'Can a State Love its People?
