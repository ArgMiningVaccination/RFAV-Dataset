The technique uses precisely placed crystals either on and/or around the physical body. Crystals may also be laid in precise geometric patterns (grids) within the environment. Crystals absorb, focus, direct, detoxify, shift and diffuse energy as they interact with the electromagnetic forces and subtle vibrations within the subtle human or environmental energy field. In the context of crystal healing, illness is dis-ease, the final manifestation of spiritual, environmental, physiological, psychological, emotional, mental, karmic, or ancestral imbalance or distress. Healing means bringing mind, body, spirit and environment back into harmony, restoring the body's natural rhythm and equilibrium. The main influence for healing is the chakra philosophy of disease caused by energy imbalances. The philosophy of modern crystal healing is based on traditional concepts borrowed from Asian cultures, most notably the Chinese concept of Chi, the life energy and the Hindu or Buddhist concept of chakras, which are vortices of this life-energy, said to connect the physical and supernatural elements of the body. Crystal healers believe that crystals and gemstones have properties that facilitate healing. Many sites promoting crystal healing allege that the history of this practice is ancient, dating back at least 6,000 years to the time of the ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia. Ancient Egyptians were among the first documented people to have adorned themselves with crystals \u2014 including lapis lazuli, carnelian and turquoise \u2014 to ward off illness and negative energy. Main principles In crystal healing, stones are assigned various properties to cure ailments and protect against disease by the crystal healer. Amethyst, for example, is believed by some to be beneficial for the intestines; green aventurine helps the heart; yellow topaz provides mental clarity. Colours of the visible spectrum, red through violet are associated with seven chakra points on the body. It is believed that crystals act as conduits for healing- allowing positive, healing energy to flow into the body while negative, disease-causing energy flows out. During a treatment session, a crystal healer may place various stones or crystals on the body aligned with the chakra points, roughly in the regions above the head, on the forehead, on the throat, on the chest, on the stomach, on the gut, and on the genital area. The stones used and their positioning may be chosen for the symptoms reported by the patient. Uses Crystal healing offers excellent stress relief and is particularly useful for people who suffer from migraines, insomnia, panic attacks, pain, stiff joints, digestive disorders, and chronic or severe illnesses such as cancer that require long-term support. It has also been found to be helpful in infertility and behavioural disorders. At an emotional level, crystal healing can stabilise moods and enhance self-esteem. At a mental level, it induces clarity and enhances focus. Association Affiliation of Crystal "}
