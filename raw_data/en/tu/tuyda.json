What Is Aromatherapy? Aromatherapy is a natural healing tradition that uses scents to promote mental, physical and spiritual well-being. Some people turn to aromatherapy as a complementary intervention for traditional medical treatments like medications. At this time, there is not enough evidence to prove that aromatherapy is beneficial for treating any condition on its own. What Are Essential Oils? Essential oils are highly concentrated liquid extracts derived from plants. It's these oils that provide the fragrances for aromatherapy. Stems, roots, leaves, flowers and fruits may be used to produce the oils. Many essential oils are steam distilled. This type of oil is made by heating parts of plants up to high temperatures until they give off vapor. The vapor is then rapidly cooled to produce a liquid. Manufacturers may also grate or scrape peels of fruits or use carbon dioxide to make essential oils. How to Use Essential Oils There are many ways that you can use essential oils for aromatherapy. For a quick and easy approach, add a few drops of essential oil to cotton balls arranged in a bowl. Place the bowl nearby and enjoy the scent as it fills the room. You can also create an aromatherapeutic air freshener by mixing essential oils with water in a reusable spray bottle. The downside to both methods is that the scent is likely to quickly fade. Diffusers provide a solution to this problem. A diffuser is an electrical or battery-operated device that turns essential oils into a fine mist. Some diffusers generate mist by producing ultrasonic vibrations, while others use heat. With a diffuser, you can continuously fill the air with fragrance for an extended period of time, making it easier to use essential oils for stress relief and other concerns. Many models feature timers so that they turn on and off automatically. Topical Use of Essential Oils Some individuals apply essential oils topically to reap the benefits of aromatherapy. Because essential oils are highly concentrated, they may pose a risk for skin irritation if used at full strength. To lower the risk, essential oils are typically diluted with a carrier like vitamin E oil, vegetable oil or jojoba oil. Once the essential oil is diluted, it can be used to lubricate the skin for massage therapy or applied to your pulse points like perfume. Solutions for Specific Concerns The key to aromatherapy is to use essential oils that are believed to be beneficial for your specific concern. Consult an aromatherapist or your medical provider for recommendations for essential oils to relieve stress, improve your mood or address another concern.
