{"title": "Pet Food Labeling Regulations Know The Facts!", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": "Whole Dog Journal", "date": "2001-07-13", "cleaned_text": "Virtually every dog food on the market complies with the labeling regulations and meets the nutrient standards suggested by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO); go look at the fine print on your dog's food label. It will have one of two statements on it, indicating which of two AAFCO standards it supposedly met: either a \"feeding trial\" or chemical analysis of the food. The problem is, that particular food may have passed neither test itself. What? Let's back up. We've talked about AAFCO before (see \"Who's in Charge?\" WDJ December 2000). It's a nongovernment, voluntary, advisory organization of state feed control officials, who interact with and influence state and federal feed industry regulators. Most states require that dog food made and/or sold in their borders meet a standard meant to guarantee nutritional benefit to the dogs who eat it, and most states use AAFCO-developed standards. AAFCO uses two methods to \"prove\" that a food is adequate to the task of keeping dogs alive. The first is a feeding trial, where the food is fed to a certain number of dogs for a certain amount of time, and as long as most of the dogs live, the food gets to go to market with a label that says something like, \"Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that (product name) provides complete and balanced nutrition for (life stage).\" Never mind that, in our opinion, these trials are woefully inadequate; we've discussed that before and we will again in the future. The second standard is basically a chemical analysis that confirms the food contains levels of nutrients that fall within a range determined by AAFCO to be sufficient to support canine life. The way it's supposed to work is that foods that have not been tested in a feeding trial have labels that say, \"(Name of product) is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO nutrient profiles.\" Again, never mind that we and many other pet food-industry critics take issue with the nutrient profiles. We've got other fish to fry today. Pet food 'families' Here is our problem: AAFCO recently amended its regulations to allow foods that are comparable in nutritional adequacy to a food that actually passed a feeding trial to bear the exact same label claim. A food that has passed an actual feeding trial can now serve as the \"lead food\" for a \"family\" of foods; and the standards required for the \"family members\" are not nearly as rigorous (if we can use that verbiage in relation to pet food production) as for the lead food. To be in \"the family,\" a food must meet the following criteria: The moisture content must be similar to the lead food. This requirement simply ensures that dry foods stay in a dry food family, a canned food is in a canned food family, etc. For example, both the lead food and any family members must be under 20 percent moisture (\"dry\" foods), 20-65 percent moisture (\"semi-moist\" foods), or over 65 percent moisture (canned foods). The \"metabolizable energy\" (ME) content of the family member must be within 7.5 percent of the tested food - which more or less means they should have similar calorie counts. This must be validated by feeding the family member food to six animals for 10 days. The first five days are so the animals can acclimate to the food. During the last five days, the animals' stools are collected and their energy content assayed by calorimetry. The difference between the amount of food eaten and the amount of stool excreted, with a correction for urinary losses, equals the ME of the food. This is the only time that the \"family member\" foods must be fed to live animals before they arrive at the retail store shelves. There is an optional test for ME that uses calculations rather than the feeding protocol, but it is unlikely that any manufacturer will ever use it, because it would have to state outright on the label that the food is \"comparable in nutritional adequacy to a product which has been substantiated using AAFCO feeding tests.\" Rather than admit that on the label, manufacturers will most assuredly use the relatively lenient 10-day ME test. The family member must also meet the levels contained in the lead food for a few crucial values: crude protein, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, lysine, and thiamine. (For cat foods, the family members must also meet specified minimums of potassium and taurine.) The family member may claim adequacy for only the same or a less-demanding life stage than the lead food. (Life stages are, in descending order of demand: \"all life stages,\" \"gestation/lactation,\" \"growth,\" and \"maintenance.\") Finally, the family member must meet or exceed the nutrient levels of the lead food or as specified by the AAFCO Nutrient Profiles for all other nutrients, whichever is lower. Good news for manufacturers This is very good news for the pet food manufacturers, because they no longer have to perform expensive feeding tests in order to market a food with the feeding test claim - a \"higher\" standard in most consumers' eyes. This gives family member foods a potential marketing advantage over foods that \"only\" meet the requirements of the AAFCO Nutrient Profiles. The new family rule also allows food makers to fast-track the development and marketing of new formulas. In case you were wondering, this is the mechanism that has permitted the rapid proliferation of such things as special formulas for dogs with sensitive skin or tender tummies, breed-specific formulas, and odor-reducing formulas on the shelves of your local pet superstores and grocery stores. Bad news for consumers Is it good news for you? True - it has resulted in a much wider selection of foods to choose from at the store. But until recently, we used to be able to trust that, if a food claimed it had been tested using AAFCO feeding protocols, it had at the very least kept a handful of dogs alive for six months. Now, we have no assurance at all, because we can't tell which food is a lead food that was really tested, and which one is the copycat. This is particularly bad news because the lead food, which has passed feeding tests, is not itself required to meet the AAFCO Nutrient Profiles. Thus, a family member food could be significantly below the recommendations of the Nutrient Profile for many nutrients, yet never be required to prove it can keep animals going, even for six months. Small differences in formulation could mean big differences in how digestible and bioavailable certain nutrients are to the dog, but the only way you'll find this out is when your dog develops a problem because of it! I know I keep saying this, but it's another case of \"let the buyer beware!\" Always keep an eye on your dog when trying out a new food to make sure it's working for him. He should have good energy, a normal appetite, clear eyes, a shiny coat, no dandruff, and normal stools. If anything seems \"off,\" look to his food first for the cause. On the other hand, if your dog displays every sign of good health and has no worrisome symptoms of chronic health problems (such as recurrent ear infections, \"hot spots,\" or digestive troubles), don't give in to the impulse to switch to the newest food on the pet store shelves just because its bag is newer, shinier, or cheaper, or labeled as just right for Airedale-crosses from the East Coast or all dogs with \"sensitive skin.\" It's probably an untested newcomer to a over-accepting \"family.\" -By Jean Hofve, DVM Dr. Jean Hofve is the Companion Animal Program Coordinator for the Animal Protection Institute, located in Sacramento, California. You are at your wits' end. You were gone for less than an hour, and when you returned home, your dog Maxx had already destroyed your new sofa, defecated on your antique Oriental rug, and inflicted deep gouges in the just-repainted front door frame. You have tried leaving him in the backyard, but he chewed through the fence and got picked up by animal control. You tried crating him, but he scraped his toenails bloody and broke a canine tooth trying to dig and chew through the crate door. When you left him in the garage he tore everything within reach to shreds. When you left him in a covered chain-link dog pen on the back patio, you got complaints from three different neighbors about his nonstop barking and howling. You've even tried showing him the damage and punishing him for it, but it hasn't helped. You hate to think of giving him up, but you don't know what to do with him. If he would only behave himself when you are away from home. Maxx has separation anxiety - a behavior problem that results from a dog's natural instincts to want to be near other members of his pack. It is a normal survival instinct, but one that can often be derailed early in a pup's life through proper conditioning (see \"Learning to Be Alone,\" WDJ July 2001). For you and Maxx, however, it's too late for the proper early stuff. Mad Maxx already has a full-blown case of separation anxiety, and now you need to try to fix it. Conditioned response It won't be easy. Separation anxiety is a panic attack - your dog's classically conditioned response to the terror of being left alone. When you walk out the door, Maxx doesn't sit around and muse about whether or not to eat the sofa. Separation anxiety behavior is not a conscious choice - it just happens. In fact, his anxiety begins before you even leave the house; your dog can tell from your morning routine whether this is a get-up-and-go-to-work day (which leaves Maxx home alone) or a relax-and-stay-at-home day. As soon as Maxx determines that it's a work day, he starts to worry, and every step in the routine increases his anxiety. The 5a.m. alarm clock. The rush to put Maxx out to potty and then toss him his food dish. The shower and shave. The suit and the shiny shoes instead of blue jeans and sneakers. Coffee and a banana instead of bacon and eggs. The grab for the briefcase and car keys, the pause at the front door for dramatic hugs and kisses to Maxx, and the fervent admonitions to behave himself while you're gone. Phew! By the time the door closes in his face and you rush down the sidewalk to the car, Maxx is already worked up into a high state of arousal. He makes no conscious decision to go on a destruction binge - he is simply stressed to the max. Effective ways for him to relieve his stress include chewing, digging, urinating, defecating, and vocalizing. Anxiety or hijinks? Most separation anxiety behavior happens within 30 minutes of the owner's departure and within a similar period before the owner's anticipated return. This is one of the keys to determining whether Maxx's behavior is truly an anxiety reaction or simply a bout of puppy hijinks. If you can leave and come back in an hour to an unscathed home but four hours puts Maxx over the top, chances are you're dealing with boredom, excessive energy, or a housetraining issue rather than true separation anxiety. (Some dogs will become destructive in their efforts to go outside to relieve themselves if they are very committed to not soiling the house.) If, on the other hand, your dog displays immediate signs of anxiety upon your exit, he's a candidate for SA retraining. If you can just get the anxious dog through the first half-hour or so, and avoid raising his anxiety level at homecoming time, you are usually home free. Simple - but not easy. This task is best accomplished through a program of counter-conditioning and desensitization (CC&D) - fancy terms to describe getting Maxx to like something he now intensely dislikes or fears. In this case, the \"something\" is being left alone. The challenge with using CC&D for separation anxiety is that ideally you start with a very low level stimulus that the dog can tolerate, associate it with something wonderful (like the dog's favorite treats), and gradually work up to a level of normal stimulus, while taking care not to trigger the unwanted response during the process. If you are desensitizing a dog to loud noises, for example, it is relatively easy to prevent his exposure to noisy environments between training sessions. It's considerably more difficult for the average pet owner to design a schedule that leaves Maxx alone for no more than a few seconds at first, then minutes, then hours, during the weeks or months that it takes to build his tolerance to being alone. If you are truly committed to working through the problem, and have the time and energy, you can get through this. Managing Maxx So, where do you start when you can't confine him, you can't trust him loose in the house or yard, and you can't punish him? What are you supposed to do with a Mad Maxx who is rapidly wrecking everything you possess? You need to do two things: Manage his environment while his behavior is being modified so he can't hurt himself or destroy the things around him. Using counter-conditioning and desensitization, teach Maxx that it is safe for him to be alone. Let's start with the easy one: managing the environment. This means not leaving Maxx alone until he has decided that being alone is okay. You might be able to find a friend, neighbor, or relative who is home during the day, where Maxx can stay and be safe. Perhaps you are fortunate enough to work in a place where your dog could come to the office with you. It never hurts to ask! Doggie daycare is another excellent option. Commercial daycare centers are thriving in an increasing number of communities around the country; there might be a good one near you. Be sure the daycare operator knows that Maxx has separation anxiety and understands how to deal with it - that he can't be left alone and must not be punished for anxiety-related behavior. Sometimes, although only very rarely, getting another dog can help. If you are considering this, you should only get a second dog because you want one and are committed to keeping the newcomer whether it helps Maxx's problem or not. Be careful - you could end up with two dogs with separation anxiety/destructive behavior! Finally, there are pharmaceuticals that have appeared on the market relatively recently that purport to help with resolving a multitude of canine behavior problems. Clomicalm (clomipramine hydrochloride) is the one most commonly prescribed for separation anxiety, but must be used in conjunction with a good behavior modification program in order to be truly effective; the drug alone will not solve the problem. Maximized training A behavior modification program will help your dog understand that he can survive being left alone. Depending on the severity of the problem, this may happen relatively quickly, or it may take a long time and never be completely resolved. If you have a Velcro dog who can't even tolerate you being in the next room, you will need to start with very small steps. Here's one program for working with separation anxiety: 1. Teach your dog to accept a tether with you standing right next to him (See \"Tethered to Success,\" WDJ April 2001). When he is comfortable on the tether, take one step away, say \"Yes!\" before he has a chance to get upset (or Click! your clicker, if he is clicker-trained), then step back to him and feed him a treat. Repeat this step until he shows no sign of anxiety when you are one step away. Be sure that you remain very matter-of-fact about stepping away. If you get excited or emotional, so will he. 2. Now, gradually increase the length of time that you remain one step away before you \"Yes!\" (or Click!) and return, until he will tolerate your one-step distance for a full minute or longer. Vary the longer times with shorter ones, so he doesn't start to get anxious about the exercise getting harder and harder each time. You want him to never know how long you will be gone, and at the same time you are teaching him that you always return. 3. Now take two steps away, say \"Yes!\" and immediately return to feed him a treat. Repeat at this distance until he is comfortable with you being two steps away, then again gradually increase the time at this distance. 4. Very gradually increase the distance, repeating the exercise at each new step until he is calm, then increasing the time at each new distance. If he panics at any point, you have moved too quickly - go back to the previous distance and work there again until he is calm. The take another half-step, if necessary, to avoid triggering his panic. 5. When he will remain calm while you walk to the other side of the room, sit down, and read a magazine, you are ready for the next phase. Start the exercise as before, but this time walk to the doorway to another room, step outside briefly, \"Yes!\" and step back into the room before he has a chance to get upset that you are out of sight. Return and reward. Repeat this until he is calm about you stepping out of the room, and then gradually increase the length of time that you remain out of sight. 6. Now, sometimes close the door as you step out of the room, briefly at first, then for longer periods. 7. Do the same exercise with each of the doors leading from the room, including the door that leads to the outside. Sometimes leave the door open, sometimes close it. Be sure to return and reward each time before your dog goes into panic mode. If he starts acting anxious at any time, slow down, and go back to a part of the exercise that he can tolerate. Then, when he is calm, proceed more slowly to the step that upset him. 8. Now take him off the tether and repeat Step 6, closing the door each time to prevent him from following you out of the room. Start with very brief departures, so he doesn't have time to start digging at the door. Gradually increase the length of time you are out of the room, but remember to intersperse the longer ones with short ones so he never knows how long you will be gone. Remember, too, to remain calm yourself. If you start getting anxious or excited about the process, so will he. 9. When he is comfortable with you stepping outside for several minutes, start adding bits of your departure routine to the exercise. Pick up your keys, step outside briefly, return, \"Yes,\" and reward. Then put the keys down. Go outside, open and close the car door, then come back inside. \"Yes\" and reward. As he gets better with pieces of the routine, add more pieces. 10. Assuming that you drive a car to work or school, the next step is to actually start the car engine, then come back inside and reward. Start the car engine, then vary the amount of time you wait before coming back in to reward. Drive down the driveway, then drive back to the house, come back in and reward. Your goal is to gradually increase the length of time you can be outside to 30 minutes or more. If you can hit the magic 30-minute mark, you are well on your way to success. Pacing is key Be sure to proceed through these 10 steps at a pace that your dog can tolerate. Short, successful sessions at first (five to 10 minutes), are better than long, frustrating sessions that end in failure. You may be able to proceed through the steps in a week or two if your dog's separation anxiety is mild, but it is more likely that it may take you several weeks, or months, to work up to 30 minutes. If you aren't making any progress at all, talk to your veterinarian about adding Clomicalm to the equation. Fixing separation anxiety is hard work, and it's easy to get frustrated with your dog's destructive behavior. Remember that he's not choosing to do it out of spite or malice - he is panicked about his own survival without you, his pack, there to protect him. It's not fun for him - he lives in the moment, and the moments that you are gone are long and terrifying. If you make the commitment to modifying his behavior and succeed in making him brave about being alone, you will not only have saved your home from destruction, you will have enhanced the quality of your dog's life immensely, and perhaps saved him from destruction, too. The powerful Akita lunges at the Scottie, her mouth agape, teeth flashing. With a guttural growl, her jaws close around the neck of the little black dog. She pins the wiry terrier to the ground, where he struggles, belly up, in a fruitless attempt to sink his own teeth into his attacker's leg. As a handful of spectators laugh from a nearby doorway, the Scottie's struggles subside until he is motionless on the floor, the Akita pinning him to the ground with her superior weight. What horror is this? Are we witness to the awful bloodsport of underground dogfighting? Far from it. Rather, this is a perfectly happy scene from a perfectly well-managed dog daycare center. Shortly after the Akita pinned the Scottie to the floor, the little black dog leaped up unscathed, chased the big dog around the room three times, and then took his turn pinning her to the floor amidst a reciprocal chorus of happy growls and snarls. It's all in a day's play. Once upon a time, it was commonplace for groups of dogs to wrestle and romp together. Farmers and ranchers kept at least several dogs at a time: some to herd livestock and protect the homestead, some for hunting, one or two to kill rats in the barn, and maybe an unusually fortunate small house dog. The dogs had the run of the farm, romped and ran together, and led doggie lives. In a society more casual than today's, even town dogs tended to roam freely in compatible packs, sorting out their differences with an occasional scuffle that rarely turned into anything serious. In modern society, our dogs are more likely to stay at home, safely confined to the house or the fenced backyard, plied with vaccinations, toys, and regular meals. As a result, while many of today's dogs live longer, healthier lives than their ancestors did, they also miss out on socialization and exercise with their canine pals. Most dogs today also lack the stimulation of a real job - the herding, hunting, ratting, carting, or guarding that they were bred to do. Left home alone all day while their families are at work and school, they are bored, lonely, restless, and unemployed. Without the opportunity to interact regularly with others of their own kind, they even forget how to speak \"dog,\" and when they do meet up with other canines they are often socially inept, fearful, or aggressive. The sad result is a growing population of pets who exhibit inappropriate behaviors in the home, and who are \"not good with other dogs.\" Daycare to the rescue Enter the rapidly growing phenomenon of commercial doggie daycare. Our ancestors would have laughed heartily at the notion, but an increasing number of dog owners are realizing the benefits of paying to provide their dogs with a day full of activity and supervision. Imagine the relief of owners who realize (often too late!) the difficulty of housetraining the new puppy when no one is home to take her outside regularly; now they can happily drop Puddles off at daycare in the morning, knowing that the staff can further the pup's understanding of proper potty behavior. Those who have dogs with separation anxiety can stop administering tranquilizers (and stop taking them themselves), knowing that their house is not being systematically reduced to toothpicks in their absence. In addition, in a well-supervised daycare program, Timid Tess can learn how to be a dog. She won't be allowed to run with scissors, and she will learn how to play well with others. Bouncing Bob, who now spends his days at home sleeping, storing up energy for wild greetings and demands that you pay attention to him when you get home, can romp with his pals all day and come home just as exhausted as you are after a tough day at the office. A tired dog is a well-behaved dog. Many doggie daycare programs also offer training packages, grooming services, pickup and delivery, and will even transport Fido to his vet appointments for you. Others go above and beyond, including massage, aromatherapy, and hydrotherapy in their service packages. Some provide you with photos to take home - action shots of Fido and Friends at play. Still others hold special events, such as holiday parties and outings to nearby dog-friendly parks, for you to socialize with your dog's pals and their owners. You might even find one that operates a retail pet supply store for the convenience of one-stop shopping for your dog's food, training tools, toys, and other accessories. Many benefits A dozen doggie daycare operators polled recently on a daycare e-mail list were in almost unanimous agreement that the top two benefits of their services were exercise for Fido - which tires him out and promotes good manners, and the opportunity for him to socialize with other dogs - an important ongoing experience if Fido's owner wants him to be friendly with others of his kind. They also listed numerous other benefits, including socialization with humans, relief from boredom, prevention of destructive behavior, a chance for the dog to have fun, and a lessening of owner guilt, for those who feel badly about leaving Fido home alone all day. All of these benefits help to create a strong bond between dog and owner; a relationship that is vitally important in order to ensure that the dog will be a beloved family member for the rest of his life. Daycare operators offered words of wisdom to owners looking for a suitable facility for their dogs. Jamie Lewis, of Zip A Dee Doo Dog Daycare, near North Hollywood, California, stressed the importance of having knowledgeable and caring staff, who can provide constant supervision and monitoring of the dogs. From responses to the poll, a ratio of one staff person for every 10 dogs seems to be the accepted norm, ideally with a second person on the premises at all times in case of emergency. Cleanliness and safety, which go hand-in-glove with vaccination requirements and disease control, were also at the top of the list for almost all of the operators who responded. Several emphasized the importance of confirming that the staff's dog handling and training philosophies are in alignment with yours, and making sure that the dogs actually play together for most of the day and are not simply stuffed into crates or kennels. Amy Preston, owner of My Dog's Place in Mystic, Connecticut, voiced the feelings of many of the daycare operators regarding a comprehensive screening process for potential canine clients. \"Unfortunately, not all dogs are suited for daycare,\" Preston says. \"We screen three times, the first time over the phone. If nothing pops up there, we mail them an information packet that includes all the good stuff about daycare, as well as the risks and requirements, and a lengthy questionnaire that tries to uncover everything from food bowl aggression to grooming needs. If this doesn't scare them away, we make an appointment for an intake interview, where we carefully introduce the dog to our own dogs, one at a time, starting with the most mellow dog of the opposite sex. Although this may seem daunting, clients should see that this is in the best interest of their dogs. Careful screening will help create a safer environment for all.\" Mary Watcher of Animal Watchers & More, Inc., in Vermilion, Ohio, joined several of the other operators in cautioning owners to beware of overcrowding. A general rule of thumb is to allow 100 square feet for each large dog; 50 to 60 square feet for small to medium-sized dogs. This should be an enriched environment, offering toys to play with; obstacles for the dogs to run under, around, and through; hiding places and beds for dogs who want a time-out; and matted floors for safety. Robin Barbour of Puppy Playland LLC in San Ramon, California, summed it up. \"Use your own good judgment. If you get a bad feeling about the intake process, or anything just doesn't appear 'right,' don't leave your dog there. You are putting your faithful friend's welfare in someone else's hands. Make sure you are comfortable doing so.\" The right stuff Not surprisingly, doggie daycare centers have an endless supply of anecdotes that they are willing to share - some funny, others poignant. Kellyann Conway of Maritime Pet Kennel, Inc., in Tarpon Springs, Florida, tells of Alex, a Doberman client who had been coming to daycare religiously, once or twice a week, for the five years since they had opened. One day Alex's mom called the center to tell them that Alex had been diagnosed with a rare liver disease and, according to his doctor, probably only had a month or so left to live. Because Alex loved daycare so much, she wanted to continue bringing him for as long as possible. The Conways agreed, as long as the veterinarian agreed. Alex lived for another 15 months. Owner and vet were both convinced that the combination of exercise, fun, and friends, as well as the anticipation of going to doggie daycare, kept Alex going. His blood counts taken the day after daycare were always noticeably improved, and he even ate all of his food on daycare days. Just like us, having something in life to look forward to and enjoy can keep our dogs happier, healthier, and better behaved. Maybe it's time to look for a doggie daycare center near you. Few among us have not at one time or another hefted a ball, drawn our arm back, and pitched it with all of our strength while urging our dog to retrieve. Dogs across the decades have obligingly charged after the small round prey-object and eagerly brought it back for another go. What is it about the basic ball that brings joy to canine and human hearts alike? A rousing game of fetch is a team sport; it requires a thrower and a retriever. Dog and owner work together, or the game doesn't happen. This partnered activity helps to cement the dog/human relationship. It's also a perfect outlet for a dog's excess energy. The ball-fetching dog gets to satisfy his hard-wired instinct to chase and catch prey, while benefiting from the regular exercise that promotes good physical and mental health. Besides, there is something intrinsically soul-satisfying about watching a dog in hot pursuit of a ball, stretching his legs in full flight across open space, whether it's with the lithe grace of a sighthound, the determined strides of a retriever, or the scrabbling charge of a stubby-legged terrier. Once upon a time, the tennis ball was the ubiquitous dog toy. In recent years, dog-toy makers have waxed creative; today's canine consumers have an impressive variety to select from. There are little balls, big balls, rubber balls, plastic balls, balls on ropes, balls that float, balls that make noise, and balls that dispense treats, to mention just a few. What are the qualities that distinguish average balls from super balls? We compared our past favorites with some newer models from pet store shelves and the pages of pet supply catalogs. We settled on the following criteria to use in our search for the perfect ball: durability, safety, aesthetic appeal (canine and human), and, of course, value - cost compared to function. The ideal ball is indestructible, endlessly engaging, and not all that expensive! The perfect orb serves many purposes - as a training tool, fetch toy, or a prop for tricks. The safest ball may also keep Fido self-entertained when the humans are gone (see \"Safety First,\" below.) Like all dog toys, the best balls will invite attention and play from both dog and human, and should be priced affordably and consistent with their quality. We selected nine new balls to test, choosing products that appeared to fit our criteria, and tested each to see if they fulfilled their promise. We also re-examined three of our favorites from past reviews. Here are our findings: Click here to view \"A Focus on Safety, Durability, and Cost\" Click here to view \"One Dog Toy Does Not Fit All Dogs\" Let's face it: Most dogs aren't crazy about going to the vet. And why should they be? After all, vet visits are stressful at best. They often mean a new environment, slippery floors, and even more slippery exam tables. Vet offices are full of funny smells, scary sounds, strange people, and unknown animals. Plus, the poking and prodding they are subjected to can be uncomfortable and sometimes even painful. It may be overwhelming for even the most easygoing dog. Reasoning with your dog may help some (\"Oh, honey, it's for your own good!\"). But what will help even more is getting your dog accustomed to the types of experiences that he is likely to encounter on visits to the veterinarian. The following seven tips can help you help your dog learn to tolerate the occasional \"well-dog\" health examanination. They will also help your dog be better prepared to accept necessary medical treatment in case of a serious illness or injury. 1. Take your dog by the vet's office, just to say hello. \"One of the best things you can do,\" says E.V. Sharp, DVM, of Creekside Veterinary Hospital in Soquel, California, \"is just to stop by every once in a while. Bring your dog in, weigh him, and walk out again.\" New places are sometimes anxiety producing - just because they are new. Stopping by occasionally reduces your dog's anxiety by simply transforming the vet's office from an unknown to a known environment. Better yet, take along some great treats, preferably something that is incredibly special to your dog like steak or hot dogs. Ask the receptionist, the vet tech, and even your veterinarian to give your dog a few treats, too. If you have a puppy, start your \"social\" vet visits as early as possible. But don't worry if you have an older dog or a dog that is already anxious about vet visits. Fun and happy social visits can dramatically reduce an adult dog's stress level too. Be sure to call ahead and tell your vet what you want to do. Ask if there is a good time to stop by for a few minutes. You'll want to make sure that your social visit is convenient for the vet and the office staff. You'll also want to make sure they are not dealing with an emergency or an infectious disease at the time of your visit. 2. Take the time to touch your dog everywhere, every day! Getting your dog accustomed to being touched all over is essential for your dog's comfort during an examination. In a routine exam, a veterinarian may look in your dog's eyes, ears, and mouth, listen to his heart and lungs, touch and probe his belly, manipulate his joints, and take his temperature. Dogs that are handled, petted, and touched all over daily will be less likely to perceive this as invasive, and more likely to regard it as affectionate (if somewhat personal!) touching. In addition, when you regularly spend time touching your dog, you will be more likely to notice changes such as lumps, swelling, or tenderness that may indicate health problems. One great way to help your dog learn to tolerate being handled is to make it part of play and relaxation. When you play rowdy games such as fetch, wrestle, or tug-o-war with your dog, you can encourage the game and help your dog tolerate touch through play pats, ruffling his fur, and gentle roughhousing. When you spend quiet time with your dog, stroke and pet him all over. Play with your dog's ears, muzzle, belly, and around his tail. Try holding your dog's paw while you rub his tummy. Massage his shoulders and hips. Stroke your dog's ears and gently place your finger inside the ears. Touch around his legs and in between his toes. \"It's also a good idea to pinch them every once in a while,\" said Dr. Sharp. Not hard of course, but enough that a little needle pinch for vaccinations or drawing blood won't be a totally unusual experience. Another very important part of this routine is to take note of your dog's sensitive spots. Most dogs have one or more spots where they prefer not to be touched. Some dogs don't like to have their paws touched. Others may not like their hips, ears, or tails touched. You can help even the most reluctant dog accept the handling of sensitive areas with a little patience and some great treats. Have your dog near you in a comfortable position. Then feed your dog his favorite treats while briefly touching the sensitive spot. For example, if your dog is sensitive about having his paws handled, gently and quickly stroke your dog's paw and then give him a slice of hot dog or another great treat. Once your dog is happy about the brief touch (because he knows the hot dog is coming!), you can leave your hand on his paw just a little bit longer before giving him the treat. Gradually work up to holding the paw, then giving gentle squeezes, and eventually touching between his toes. (For more details on this technique, see \"Classical Conditioning,\" WDJ June 2001.) Don't try to rush it or push your dog to do anything that is uncomfortable. The goal is to help your dog learn to accept or even enjoy being touched everywhere. If your dog exhibits any aggression around being touched, please consult with a behaviorist to help you work through the problem. When your dog is happy about being touched all over, ask friends, a trainer, or other family members to touch your dog, too. The more dogs are accustomed to being handled by different people, the easier it will be for them to be handled during regular vet visits or in the case of an illness. Remember being a kid and wanting to dress your animals up? That can actually help, too! \"If your dog enjoys it, put things on them,\" Dr. Sharp said, laughing at the idea. Bandanas, doggie sweaters, booties, dog packs, and other items can help your dog accept things like bandages or Elizabethan collars if the need ever arises. 3. Play with your dog's mouth. \"Probably the hardest thing we deal with regularly are dogs who are not used to having their mouths handled,\" says Dr. Sharp. She recommends brushing your dog's teeth regularly to help them get used to having their mouths handled. \"It really pays off! It's good for the dog and the vet. It can extend times between teeth cleanings, too.\" With some dogs, Dr. Sharp notes, it can even mean the difference between being able to perform teeth cleanings with the dog awake and having to give the dog anesthesia. In Dr. Sharp's opinion, it's not as important to brush the teeth really well as it is just to do it! Even brushing the outsides of the teeth can make a big difference. Always use canine toothpaste; people toothpaste isn't safe for dogs. Plus, the great flavors available in doggy toothpaste, such as chicken, beef, or malt, can make brushing all the more enjoyable for your dog. Another good exercise is opening your dog's mouth, looking in, and then immediately popping a treat in his mouth. Your dog will learn that your opening his mouth means treats are coming. Dogs can also learn to enjoy having their mouths' handled if you dab a little peanut butter, yogurt, or cottage cheese on your finger and then rub your finger over your dog's gums or along the roof of his mouth. Your dog will get used to having fingers in his mouth, plus he'll get a special taste treat. 4. Get your dog used to being leaned over, held onto, and picked up. Even dogs that are handled regularly can have a tough time when someone leans over them, holds them down, or picks them up - understandably so! But during routine vet visits and especially during an emergency, your dog may need to be lifted onto a table, the veterinarian will need to lean over your dog, and your dog may need to be held for vaccines or exams as well as for emergency procedures. Bending over your dog from various positions in play and other activities can help him learn to accept this behavior from humans. In addition, you can help your dog tolerate being held through everyday affectionate behaviors. For example, if your dog enjoys a good belly rub, try reaching over your dog's shoulder to rub his belly. In our home, for example, we routinely kiss the tops of our dogs' heads, reach around their shoulders to rub their tummies, and give them great big gentle bear hugs. All of these activities are fun, and help our dogs accept and even enjoy being leaned over and held onto (plus we get lots of dog kisses in return!). Smaller dogs are more often used to being carried, but for some larger dogs, the only time they are physically picked up is at the vet's office. That in and of itself can be a traumatic experience. You can set up specific training times to familiarize your dog with being lifted, or you can incorporate this into regular activities. When you groom your dog, for example, consider lifting him on to a low table. If you are not sure how to lift your dog properly (for your safety and his), ask your veterinarian, groomer, or trainer to show you how to easily and safely pick up your dog. 5. Teach your dog to sit, stand, lie down, and turn around. Basic training can really help lower your dog's stress at the veterinary clinic. Your dog will be a whole lot more relaxed if you can ask him to move his own body, rather than having to push, pull, or cajole your dog into position. The basic behaviors that are essential for ease during vet exams include: Sit and down. Because many dogs want to flop over or slink away instead of holding still, knowing sit and down can make it easier on both your dog and the vet during an exam. Relax. Also known as \"roll on your side,\" this trick is great for positioning dogs when the vet needs to scrutinize just one side of your dog. Stand. This is another basic position that is good for specific exams. Plus, it's easier to pick your dog up from a stand if you need to lift him onto the table. Turn. Veterinarians often want to turn your dog so that he is facing a different direction on the table. Instead of having to physically move your dog, a simple turn behavior (carefully if they are up on a table) can eliminate the need for having to physically manipulate them into position. A few other behaviors that may also be helpful include: \"Touch\" or \"Target.\" If your dog is trained to touch your hand with his nose on cue (see \"Right on Target,\" WDJ March 2001), then you can use a hand touch to help move or position your dog, or to move his head up or down. It may also be useful in helping dogs if they need to be given nose drops! Shake. Also called \"give me a paw,\" this exercise can help turn foot examinations into a fun activity for your dog! Watch me. Any type of eye contact exercise is a good tool to turn his head in a particular direction, but also this is a great exercise to keep your dog occupied while being examined. 6. Familiarize your dog with a muzzle and crate, just in case! Getting your dog used to wearing a soft muzzle doesn't mean your dog is bad, or that he will necessarily bite. For some dogs, using a muzzle is a good way to ensure safety if the vet needs to examine a sensitive place. And, even sweet, gentle, and well-socialized dogs can bite when they are threatened, scared, or hurt; it's an instinctive and normal reaction. Plus, a dog that is seriously ill or has suffered a painful injury may lash out without even realizing what he is doing. Purchasing a soft muzzle (the fabric kind with an opening on the end that allows your dog to take treats while wearing) and helping your dog learn to wear it comfortably can become a fun game - and it will ensure that your dog is prepared, just in case. To help your dog learn to wear a muzzle, simply hold a treat on the \"nose\" part of the muzzle. Let your dog put his nose through and take the treat. Have your dog do this several times every day for a week or more. When your dog becomes excited when he sees the muzzle (because he knows it means treats), you can slip it on for a few seconds, feed your dog a treat or two, and then take it right back off. After a week or more at this stage, you can start leaving it on for a few seconds at a time and gradually increase the time. Keep this game fun! Once your dog can comfortably wear the muzzle for a few minutes at a time, you can put it away and bring it out occasionally to remind your dog how much fun the muzzle is to wear. Then, if your dog ever needs to wear a muzzle during an emergency, he will be prepared. Crate training your dog is equally important. Crates are not only wonderful aids for house training, they also make comfy sleeping quarters and provide safe travel compartments. Your dog's ability to settle into a crate can mean the difference between a stressed-out dog and a comfortable dog if he should ever need an overnight stay at the veterinary hospital. \"We can really tell when a dog is crate trained,\" said Dr. Sharp. \"The dogs who are crate trained, go in and lie down.\" Dogs who aren't crate trained more often bark or cry from being confined. 7. Liberally employ treats and toys. When you do take your dog to the vet for a regular exam or for treatment for an illness, be sure to bring along treats or toys to help reinforce your dog's good behavior. Be generous with your rewards and really let your dog know when he is doing a good job. Use chew toys to help dogs who tend to \"hide\" in the waiting room; this helps many dogs feel safer and more secure. Some dogs will lie under a chair (preferably behind your feet) with a chew toy and settle in until it is their turn to see the vet. You may also want to try TTouch or other types of relaxing massage to help your dog \"de-stress\" while in the waiting room (see \"A Calming TTouch,\" WDJ May 1999). Many dogs who are nervous in a vet's office do very well when given a \"job.\" I've been known to run through my dogs' entire \"trick\" repertoire in the waiting room because it keeps my high-energy working dogs focused and relaxed. Your vet may also find it useful to employ your dog's favorite toy or treat. Dr. Sharp recalls dealing with a Border Collie whose stress reaction manifested itself through aggression; she won him over by playing ball with him in the exam room! \"This was a Flyball dog,\" said Dr. Sharp, \"and playing ball totally broke through his aggressive behavior.\" Keep up the good work! After your dog has become well-accustomed and trained for trips to the vet, it's a good idea to continue with your daily handling and occasionally stop by the vet clinic just to say \"hello.\" And, if your dog has been doing great at the vet and then suddenly, after a traumatic visit, does an emotional backslide, don't worry! Just read back over these tips and re-acquaint your dog to the different elements involved in vet visits. You can help your dog recover and learn to again relax during regular vet exams. -by Mardi Richmond Mardi Richmond lives in Santa Cruz, California, where she teaches Agility for Fun classes and writes about dogs. She is the co-author of Ruffing It: The Complete Guide to Camping with Dogs. A reader asks, Why does my dog eat grass? It makes him throw up. I'd like to train him not to do this, but I'm not sure how. Dogs have been eating grass for so long that one species is called dog grass in their honor. Dog grass or couch grass (Agropyron repens), which is also called quackweed, grows in all but our southernmost states, and it is most commonly found in the upper Midwest. The worlds most experienced canine herbalist was Juliette de Bairacli Levy, whose Complete Herbal Handbook for the Dog and Cat was published in 1955. In its sixth edition (1992, Faber & Faber, London), she wrote, \"The favorite dog medicine, also much eaten by cats, is dog grass or couch grass. Of this herb they eat the leaves and the root, which they either vomit up, with much yellow bile fluid, or excrete. It is a cleanser of the bowels and removes worms. When my dogs cannot get couch grass, they will utilize other grasses, but do so with reluctance. Their next choice after couch grass seems to be wild oats.\" Preventing dogs from eating grass is a serious mistake, she warns, noting that dogs bring on deliberate internal cleansing by eating things that help them expel excess bile, mucus, and other impurities. Feeding clean greens At the same time, dogs fed grass on a regular basis don't seem to crave outdoor grass the way they do if grass isn't part of their diet. \"I know a man who raised barley sprouts commercially for horses,\" wrote wheatgrass pioneer Ann Wigmore in Our Precious Pets (National Humane League, 1987). \"He had great success with restoring fertility to impotent studs. A friend thought that if these sprouts were so great with horses, they might also be great with dogs. He fed them to dogs with wonderful success. I would suggest either rye or barley sprouts for dogs and cats. These sprouts should be better for animals than wheat sprouts. They would serve as a good supplement to commercial pet foods.\" To grow rye or barley grass for pets, soak one cup organically grown grain in one quart water for 8 to 10 hours or overnight. Drain the jar and leave it on its side in a warm location, away from direct sunlight. After 24 to 48 hours, a tiny white rootlet will emerge from each grain. If you don't see this growth, your grain is not viable and should be discarded. Irradiated grain won't sprout, and neither will grain that has been improperly stored. To grow grass, spread the sprouting grain on one inch of moist potting soil or top soil in a plastic garden tray. For best results, create a one-inch channel around the soil for drainage. Cover the tray for two days, then uncover, water it thoroughly and place it in direct sunlight or under grow lights. Water as needed to keep the soil moist. Begin harvesting the grass with scissors or a sharp knife when it is six to eight inches tall. Cereal grasses keep well in the refrigerator if stored with a damp paper towel in plastic zipper bags from which the air is expelled prior to sealing. Cut or mince the grass into tiny pieces, or place a small amount in a blender or food processor with other foods. Begin by feeding a small amount, as little as a fraction of a teaspoon, to be sure your dog will accept the grass. Gradually increase the amount to about one tablespoon per 50 pounds of body weight. Cereal grasses are rich in chlorophyll, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and amino acids. Before fast-acting antibiotics were developed, chlorophyll was the drug of choice for preventing infection, curing ulcers, relieving pain, and treating skin diseases and anemia. Ann Wigmore described how wheat grass and other cereal grasses improved the health and growth of her guinea pigs, parakeets, turkeys, chickens, dogs, cats, monkey, raccoon, and skunk, and she published letters from people who gave grass to their pets to prevent or treat cataracts, fleas, tumors, excessive shedding, diarrhea, anemia, and other illnesses. Theres probably no humane way to train a dog not to seek something its body needs, so the best strategy here may be to add grass to your dogs dinner and respect his practice of herbal medicine. Are you thinking about getting a new dog, or getting ready to bring home a new puppy? Perfect timing! This is an ideal issue for you, as it contains a lot of information that could get a new dog owner off on the right track, and avoid a lot of costly and upsetting mistakes. Take, for example, How to Pick a Winner, featuring the suggestions of trainer Sue Sternberg, nationally known for her work with shelter managers and shelter dogs. Her instructions on conducting a temperament evaluation on dogs you are thinking about bringing home from the shelter could easily make the difference between bringing home an emotionally and behaviorally difficult dog and one who is readily able to bond and blend seamlessly with your family. Training Editor Pat Millers Learning to Be Alone should be required reading for anyone bringing home a new dog or puppy. If people followed her suggestions for the first few days of dog ownership, the incidence of separation anxiety would be vastly reduced. A Positive Influence, written by positive trainer Mardi Richmond, can help anyone who is thinking about hiring a trainer or joining a training class. As Richmond points out, there are wide-ranging and long-term ramifications of your choice of teachers; choose carefully. In addition, reading Dr. Jean Hofves analysis of a recently published study of raw food diets will enable you to confidently spar with anyone who cites the study as reason not to feed raw. And CJ Puotinens article about alternative and complementary treatments for Lyme disease will alert you to the myriad signs of the disease which may recur throughout a dogs life. And if youre not getting a new dog soon, dont worry. Hang onto this issue anyway, because its a certainty that a dog lover like you will find yourself with another dog sooner or later. When I opened her crate that morning, Samantha didn't move. Instead of racing around with a toy in her mouth, our bouncy one-year-old Labrador Retriever stared at us with wide brown eyes, looking frightened. She didn't object when my husband lifted her, but when he set her down, she stood as though frozen. He carried her outside and held her while she urinated. When he let go, she couldn't walk. A few hours later, our vet announced that every joint in her body was inflamed and she had a fever. No wonder our puppy couldn't move. She hurt all over. Samantha had Lyme disease. Lyme disease affects thousands of Americans and their dogs and horses each year. Named for Old Lyme, Connecticut, where it was discovered formally identified in the 1970s, Lyme is a regional disease, with 90 percent of its cases in New England and the Middle Atlantic states. The rest come from the upper Mississippi (Wisconsin and nearby states) and parts of California and Oregon. A few dogs and people with Lyme disease live elsewhere, but they are believed to have been infected during travel or, in some cases, by ticks from migrating birds. Lyme Disease Symptoms in Dogs Veterinarians in the Northeast know Lyme disease well. \"Its symptoms are very noticeable in dogs,\" says Beverly Cappel, DVM, in Chestnut Ridge, NY. \"They look like they're coming down with the flu. They ache everywhere, walk hunched over as though stepping on eggshells, limp, have no appetite, and move in slow motion. Their necks are stiff, their heads ache, they don't want to look up at the light, and they squint.\" Why is Lyme Disease So Scary? The microorganism that causes Lyme disease is Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochete (pronounced SPY-ro-keet) or spiral-shaped bacterium. Leptospirosis and syphilis are also caused by spirochetes, which are extremely difficult to eradicate because they hide in tendons, muscle tissue, lymph nodes, organs such as the heart and brain, and other parts of the body, where they can remain dormant for years. In humans, Lyme disease is often accompanied by a red rash that forms concentric circles (a signature bull's eye rash), splotchy dots, or a wide band. Because its symptoms mimic other illnesses, it is difficult to diagnose. In advanced cases, it can cause vision problems, slowed or irregular heartbeat, facial paralysis, seizures, hearing loss, nerve damage, emotional instability, inflammation of arteries in the brain, and death. According to Max Appel, DVM, PhD, Professor Emeritus at the Cornell University School of Veterinary Medicine and one of the nation's leading authorities on canine Lyme disease, the illness is less ambiguous in dogs. Despite rumors to the contrary, he said in a March 2001 interview, Lyme disease does not cause bladder incontinence in spayed bitches, nor does it manifest in the variety of symptoms common in advanced human cases. \"Lyme disease can be fatal in dogs,\" he explains, \"but its primary symptom is lameness. Dogs can get a rash, but it's rarely seen. In advanced cases, renal (kidney) failure is the leading cause of death.\" Lyme Disease and the Immune System of Dogs Dr. Appel's area of research is the pathogenesis of Lyme disease, the study of how the infection enters the body, moves through the bloodstream, incubates, and causes symptoms. His research group studied hundreds of dogs for more than a decade, defining the illness, conducting vaccination trials, and testing antibiotic treatments. \"We tried four different antibiotics against canine Lyme disease,\" he says, \"and they seemed to have a good effect on clinical signs. The dogs recovered quite nicely, and there was a reduction in the number of spirochetes in the body. But antibiotics cannot eliminate the spirochetes entirely. They hide and, over time, can build up again and cause a relapse.\" One way to trigger a relapse, says Dr. Appel, is by treating the dog with corticosteroids. \"These drugs are immune system suppressants,\" he explained. \"We documented dogs that had been treated with antibiotics and were symptom-free for over a year and a half, but as soon as they were treated with corticosteroids, they went lame with Lyme disease. Steroid drugs are absolutely not a good idea for any dog that has been treated for Lyme disease.\" Injuries, illnesses, and other immune system stresses can also trigger recurrences. A wasp sting reactivated Samantha's Lyme disease eight months after her first attack. Vaccinations, infections, an abscessed tooth, and even emotional stress can impair the immune system enough to let hidden spirochetes flourish. Lyme Disease is transmitted to dogs between 24 and 48 hours after the tick bite. Among medical doctors who treat human Lyme disease, there is much debate about its transmission by vectors other than ticks. The May 2001 edition of Alternative Medicine features a lengthy article on Lyme disease that claims it can be transmitted by fleas, mosquitoes, mites, and human-to-human contact. Dr. Appel disagrees. \"That's speculation,\" he says. \"The agent has been isolated from other vectors, but there is no proof whatsoever that these vectors can transmit the disease. A tick has to feed for 24 to 48 hours before it can transmit any spirochetes. During this time the Lyme disease spirochetes, which live in the mid-gut of the tick, migrate to the tick's salivary gland. This method of transmission is so specific that even other species of tick, such as the dog tick, have not been shown to transmit Lyme disease even if they carry the spirochete. They can transmit other illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis, but not Lyme disease.\" Dr. Appel housed dogs infected with Lyme disease with those that did not have the illness, and their prolonged exposure convinced him that Lyme disease is not transmitted from dog to dog by physical contact or exposure to urine or saliva. Although human babies have been born with the infection, in dogs the transmission from pregnant bitch to developing offspring or from infected mother to nursing puppies has not been documented. Prevent Your Dog from Getting Tick-Borne Illnesses No matter where you live, ticks can be hazardous to your dog's health. In addition to Lyme disease, ticks transmit babesia, ehrlichia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and other infections. Dogs that live where ticks are common should be inspected daily, even if they don't spend much time outside. Samantha's first bite occurred not in our tick-infested woods or fields of tall grass, but during her convalescence after being spayed at seven months, when her only outdoor activities were sedate walks along paved sidewalks. The timing of the bite was unfortunate, for a dog recovering from surgery is far more vulnerable than usual to infections of all kinds. Prompt discovery and removal of ticks is key to preventing transmission of Lyme, says the Centers for Disease Control. \"Transmission of B. burgdorferi from an infected tick is unlikely to occur before 36 hours of tick attachment. Daily checks for ticks and their prompt removal will help prevent infection.\" However, this takes some dedication, as the ticks that transmit Lyme are incredibly tiny. A dog in the wrong place at the wrong time can be bit by dozens or even hundreds of ticks. Deer ticks go through three stages of life (larva, nymph, and adult), and feed only once in each of these stages; a blood meal ends each stage. Larval ticks dine on mice and other small rodents, but nymphs and adults are a threat to dogs. Because they are small and their bites don't itch, ticks are easily overlooked, especially adult deer ticks and the nymphs of any species. Ticks prefer warm, moist conditions, so double-check under collars and around ears. If you aren't sure what a lump or bump is, inspect it with a magnifying glass. Warts, similar skin growths, and nipples can feel like feeding ticks. Tick Removal Be careful when removing a tick to grasp it with tweezers firmly at the head, as close to the dog's skin as possible, and slowly pull straight back. Never twist, press, burn, or apply irritating substances like kerosene to an attached tick because doing so can cause the parasite to expel the contents of its digestive tract, creating an unwanted hypodermic effect. Three-percent hydrogen peroxide, the common disinfectant, is recommended for tick bites because the oxygen it contains destroys the Lyme disease bacteria. Hydrogen peroxide can be liberally poured over bites on light-haired dogs (keep away from eyes and apply directly to the skin) but because it's a bleach, this method is not recommended for black or dark-haired dogs. Using an eyedropper to apply hydrogen peroxide directly to the bite helps prevent unwanted bleaching. Aromatherapist Kristen Leigh Bell, whose Aromaleigh company specializes in products for dogs and cats, created a \"tick tincture\" containing the essential oils of thyme (chemotype thujanol), hyssop (chemotype decumbens), and lavender. While studying with Dr. Kurt Schnaubelt at the Pacific Institute of Aromatherapy, Bell learned that these oils prevent Lyme disease when applied to tick bites, and she adapted the blend for canine use. \"The thyme and hyssop should be the specified chemotypes,\" she explains, \"because unlike other thyme and hyssop oils, they contain no neurotoxic ketones or harsh and burning phenols. As a result, one can take advantage of their powerful antibacterial and antiviral qualities with very little risk. \"I suggest that dog owners use this blend immediately after removing ticks,\" says Bell, \"or upon finding a tick bite or other suspicious bite on a dog's body. It can be applied frequently for a day or two, then daily until the bite heals.\" Dog owners can use Aromaleigh's Canine Tick Tincture or blend their own by combining one tablespoon vegetable base oil (hazelnut, sweet almond, olive, sunflower, jojoba, etc.), six drops thyme (chemotype thujanol), six (chemotype decumbens), and six drops lavender or lavandin essential oil. \"These essential oils are expensive,\" Bell warns, \"and they are not widely available, but it is important not to substitute less expensive essential oils for use on dogs. The use of essential oils in this manner is not a cure, it's a preventive, but with daily grooming, careful tick removal, and the application of this blend, many dogs have avoided tick-borne illnesses.\" Bee propolis, sold in health food stores as a cold and flu preventive, is an excellent topical disinfectant and natural antibiotic. Liquid propolis can be applied to bites, cuts, burns, and other injuries with an eyedropper or mixed with small amounts of aloe vera gel to treat larger areas. Reapply frequently for best results, especially on the day of a tick bite and for the next two to three days. Antibiotics for Lyme Disease Lyme-infected dogs improve so dramatically on antibiotics that many veterinarians regard their response as a Lyme disease test in itself. If an athletic, healthy dog experiences sudden-onset lameness from inflamed, tender joints, and recovers overnight on antibiotics, it's probably Lyme disease. \"In most cases, you see results in 24 hours,\" says Dr. Cappel. Many veterinarians prescribe antibiotics for two to three weeks, but Dr. Cappel recommends longer treatment. \"I find that dogs tend to relapse if you don't really wipe the bacteria out,\" she says, \"so I use antibiotics for at least four weeks. I think this does a better job of finding and killing the spirochetes, so the dog is less likely to have a recurrence.\" According to Connecticut veterinarian Mary Wakeman, DVM, \"One side effect of antibiotic therapy is actually a sign that the treatment is working. It's called the Jarish-Herxheimer reaction and it occurs when the body has an inflammatory response to all those dead spirochetes. Its more common name is the 'die-off' reaction. Depending on how overwhelmed its system is, a dog can experience one to several days of feeling worse than before.\" More importantly, says Dr. Wakeman, the die-off reaction can affect pregnant bitches, causing miscarriage. \"I recommend screening bitches living here in the Northeast with the Lyme Western Blot blood test four to six weeks before they are due in heat,\" she says. \"to be sure they don't have Lyme disease.\" Homeopathy for Treating Lyme Disease Although classical homeopathy does not consider Lyme disease a true illness - like syphilis it is considered a \"chronic miasm\" caused by an immaterial substance that produces disease by disrupting the vital force - one veterinary homeopath in Connecticut takes a different view. After testing different remedies with limited success, Stephen Tobin, DVM, discovered that Ledum palustre in a 1M potency given three times daily for three days is \"about as close as you can get to a specific cure.\" According to Dr. Tobin, this method has cured cats, dogs, and horses with recent and established infections, some of which were first treated with antibiotics. In addition, he uses the Lyme disease nosode, a homeopathic preparation of Borrelia burgdorferi 60x as a preventive, giving one dose (one dropperful) daily for one week, then one dose weekly for one month, and one dose every six months indefinitely. Dr. Tobin says that since he began treating dogs for Lyme disease with homeopathy 10 years ago, he has worked with an estimated 1,000 patients, nearly all with complete success. \"There are other homeopathic remedies that treat the symptoms of Lyme disease,\" he says, \"but I consider Ledum the genus epidemicus for this illness. The 1M strength is not widely sold, but lower strengths are. If your dog develops symptoms, you could try Ledum 30C, and if the symptoms come back, you could order the higher potency. If you spend a lot of time in the woods or have large fields behind your house, Ledum 1M is worth keeping on hand,\" he says. \"The nosode is a good investment for dog owners here in the Northeast,\" he continues, \"for it provides better protection than is generally seen with the vaccine. I don't claim that the nosode offers 100 percent protection, but it does seem to work in most cases.\" While Dr. Tobin finds that Ledum by itself clears most canine Lyme disease, Dr. Cappel uses the nosode for both prevention and treatment. \"I'm convinced that the homeopathics are effective,\" she says, \"but they take longer to work, and I don't like to see animals suffer. I give the Lyme disease nosode at the same time as antibiotics, but I continue the nosode for several months. When I had Lyme disease, I used only the nosode for myself because it was my decision, but when my dog had Lyme, I put her on doxycycline and then the nosode.\" As part of her herbal therapy for Lyme disease, Vermont-based master herbalist Hart Brent recommends giving one dose of Ledum 1M as soon as possible after a tick bite, then giving 10 drops of the Lyme disease nosode once per day. Alternative Lyme Disease Therapies for Dogs With an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 new cases of human Lyme disease diagnosed annually, it's not surprising that holistic health practitioners are experimenting with therapies that support or replace conventional treatment, especially because conventional treatment has adverse side effects and is not always effective. Numerous herbal, nutritional, and even aroma-based therapies have helped people with Lyme disease. In fact, because the treatments worked so well, they have been given to Lyme-infected dogs with excellent results. The following have not been tested in scientifically controlled studies, and they haven't been tried by the veterinarians I interviewed. However, the information offered by the practitioners interviewed below is compelling. If you are interested in using one of the products described below, ask your holistic veterinarian for help. D-Lenolate olive leaf extract Some herbal products are effective alternatives to antibiotics and kill pathogens so effectively that they, too, cause a die-off reaction. Les Nachman, Director of Herbal Technology at East Park Research, which manufactures d-Lenolate olive leaf extract, reports that thousands of human patients have successfully treated their Lyme disease with this product alone. \"D-Lenolate is helpful against any pathogenic involvement,\" Nachman says, \"and it's safe for dogs and other animals. Its only side effect is the die-off that occurs when it kills viruses, bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and parasites such as pinworms.\" The recommended human dose is two capsules three times a day, but Nachman recommends giving dogs, even large breeds, substantially less. \"For a 50-pound dog I'd start with one capsule twice a day,\" he says. \"If that doesn't cause significant improvement, you can increase the dose every day until it does. If a dog doesn't swallow pills readily, hiding the capsules in food works better than mixing the contents with food due to the powder's bitter taste.\" \"Spirochete\" This herbal product, developed by the late Hannah Kroeger at Kroeger Herb Products, contains nettle, yerba santa, goldenrod, monolaurin (a nutritional product that is supposed to coat receptor sites on healthy cell walls so that infectious agents cannot bind with the cell), and organic tobacco. The manufacturer alleges the product to be effective in treating active cases of Lyme, including those that are slow to improve or have complications. The recommended human dosage is two or three capsules twice daily. For dogs, use one capsule per 20 to 25 pounds of body weight daily in divided doses. Teasel root tinture Margi Flint is a practicing herbalist in Massachusetts whose clients include Lyme disease patients undergoing antibiotic therapy. \"Most of these patients respond very well to small doses of a tincture of teasel root (Dipsacus spp.),\" she says. \"The other part of their treatment is hyperthermia, which means high heat, from frequent saunas or steam baths. The spirochetes hate heat, and both the tincture and the heat chase them out of hiding to where antibiotics can reach them.\" While hyperthermia isn't part of her protocol for dogs (\"It's just too hot,\" she says), Flint recommends massaging three drops of teasel tincture into the ear three times per day. \"Place the drops deep in the ear canal or on the skin of the ear flap,\" she explains. \"Use three drops in either ear three times a day for four to six weeks, then one drop in the ear three times a day for four to six weeks, then take a month off. Repeat the cycle if symptoms recur after that.\" Tom Priester, a practicing herbalist in Bradford, New York, used teasel tincture instead of antibiotics to treat his Australian Blue Heelers when they contracted Lyme disease last year. \"I gave it to them by mouth between meals,\" he says. \"The male responded within 24 hours, and the female took even less time. After one week, I reduced the dose from three drops three times a day to one drop three times a day and continued that for six weeks.\" Propolis, Lomatium, and Waltheria Formulas In Vermont, master herbalist Hart Brent developed a separate protocol for treating people in three different stages of Lyme disease; the protocols can be used by dogs as well as people. \"I use a Stage I (early Lyme disease) protocol as a preventive, as soon as a dog is bitten,\" says Brent. \"There is such a time delay between the tick bite and the onset of symptoms in dogs that I consider all dogs that show clinical signs as being in Stage II (disseminated Lyme disease) or Stage III (advanced) when they are first diagnosed.\" In Stage I of Brent's protocol, the patient takes Propolis Formula (tinctures of propolis resin, echinacea root, red root, and licorice root) for four days, followed by three days of Lomatium Formula (lomatium root, witch hazel, elderberry, and prickly ash). This schedule is repeated as needed, usually for at least a month. For a 60-pound dog, Brent recommends 20 to 40 drops of tincture per dose by mouth or applied to the ear flap's inner skin, which absorbs them quickly. In all three protocols, her \"Spirokete\" essential oil blend (peppermint, helichrysum, clove, and myrrh oils) is applied twice daily to the ear skin. For Stage II/Disseminated Lyme disease, which affects the entire body and its organs, she recommends four days of Lomatium Formula alternate with three days of Waltheria Formula (waltheria root, osha root, American ginseng root, and Artemisia annua). For Stage III/Chronic Lyme disease, which is the most advanced stage of the infection, Brent uses four days of Waltheria Formula alternated with three days of Lomatium Formula. Essential oils Aromatherapist Suzanne Catty, of Toronto, Canada, recommends treating canine Lyme disease with antibiotic essential oils such as oregano, winter savory, antibiotics,\" she says, \"these essential oils kill many kinds of bacteria, including spirochetes. Combine these oils, as available, and give one drop of the blend every three hours for three days, up to a maximum of six drops per day for a 50- to 75-pound dog. Only organically grown or wildcrafted, therapeutic-quality essential oils should be used in this manner. I recommend putting the drops in capsules containing herbs that support detoxification or combining them with a tincture of milk thistle seed and goldenseal root, which also support the liver.\" Hydrosols Catty is one of the world's leading authorities on hydrosols, which are also called flower waters, herb waters, or hydrolats. These byproducts of the steam distillation process contain trace amounts of essential oils, are far more concentrated than herbal teas but gentle and nontoxic, have significant therapeutic benefits, and are ideal for use with pets. She notes that some hydrosols, such as Greenland moss, cleanse and support the liver while repairing damage done by bacteria, making them ideal for dogs recovering from Lyme disease. Hydrosols can be added to food or drinking water, using one tablespoon hydrosol per 25 to 30 pounds of body weight per day. Green Terrestrial's Auntie Lyme tea This commercially prepared tea contains nettle, red clover, comfrey, calendula, peach leaf, strawberry leaf, mint, burdock seed, and milk thistle seed. These liver-tonic ingredients are recommended as an adjunct in treating active cases and as a support for those previously treated for Lyme disease. Brew a medicinal-strength infusion by steeping one tablespoon dry herbs in one cup boiling water; keep in a covered pan until cool. Add it to your dog's food or drinking water, using one tablespoon strained tea per 10 pounds of body weight per day. Refrigerate leftover tea for up to a week. Immune-stimulating herbs Many other herbs help repair the body, improve energy, and help fight infection. The Chinese herb astragalus is a powerful immune system strengthener. Ashwaganda, long used in India's Ayurvedic medicine, has anti-inflammatory properties and aids recuperation. Dr. Cappel often adds several drops of an echinacea-goldenseal tincture, or a tincture that combines echinacea, goldenseal, and chaparral, to her protocol. \"These are all good immune system stimulants,\" she explains, \"and although none of them are specifically for Lyme disease, I think they make a difference.\" Lyme Disease Vaccination Controversy Few holistic veterinarians recommend the Lyme disease vaccine, even in dogs that live where Lyme disease is widespread. \"Its side effects are so severe,\" says Beverly Cappel, DVM, \"that I would much rather treat the disease itself. I don't recommend the vaccine, don't carry it, and never use it. When it first came out, we treated dogs (that had been vaccinated elsewhere) for seizures, kidney failure, paralysis, stiff neck, and autoimmune bleeding disorders. Some dogs died and some were permanently damaged. Vaccines don't always work, so a dog that's supposedly protected may get the disease anyway. The newer vaccine causes fewer side effects, but it still has some. No matter how you look at it, I think the risks of vaccination far outweigh the benefits.\" Even the traditional veterinary medical community has some issues with the Lyme vaccine. At the University of California at Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (UCD VMTH), the routine vaccination of household dogs for Lyme disease is not recommended. According to the UCD VMTH Vaccination Protocol for Dogs and Cats, \"Lyme Disease is not a proven problem in California, therefore, most dogs are at low risk. Moreover, there is no evidence at this time that infection leads to any significant chronic disease problem in dogs or that infected dogs are public health risks. Vaccine reaction problems occur occasionally and may outweigh health benefits. We do not stock Lyme Disease vaccine.\" The Small Animal Vaccination Protocol published by Colorado State University's Veterinary Teaching Hospital says that the Lyme may be recommended for CSU client animals on an \"at risk\" basis, but are not a part of the routine Colorado State University protocol for small animals. Clearly, the Lyme vaccine should not be administered to every dog, and even people who live in areas with a high concentration of the disease should consider how much exposure to ticks their dogs really have before using the Lyme vaccine. We'd suggest that people living in Lyme \"danger zones,\" whose dogs are frequently outdoors, use all appropriate tick repellents, examine their dogs daily, and discuss the Lyme vaccine with their holistic veterinarians. Building Your Dog's Immune System Finally, I can attest that hands-on therapies that support a dog's immune system help prevent recurrences. In addition to her early treatment with antibiotics, nutritional supplements, and herbal support therapies, I credit Samantha's monthly acupuncture treatments and chiropractic adjustments for her athletic, Lyme-free middle age. CJ Puotinen, a frequent contributor to WDJ, is the author of, The Encyclopedia of Natural Pet Care, and Natural Remedies for Dogs and Cats. She lives in New York. Ask trainer Sue Sternberg where you should get a dog and, without hesitation, she'll tell you to go to an animal shelter. She should know - as a nationally recognized dog trainer and owner of Rondout Valley Kennels, a boarding kennel, training and behavior center, and private shelter in Accord, New York, she regularly works with shelters across the country, and counsels families who have adopted from them. In addition, Sternberg has produced several booklets and videotapes about issues specific to shelter dogs and shelter dog adoption. The booklets include Temperament Testing for Dogs in Shelters and A Guide to Choosing your Next Dog from the Shelter; the videos include The Controversial Pit Bull about temperament testing Pit Bulls in shelters, and Training Your Shelter Dog. She also is a frequent and popular speaker at all sorts of dog-related venues. Setting aside all of the arguments for buying a puppy from a breeder, Sternberg emphatically pronounces that you should adopt a dog from a shelter because, as she says, \"it's the right thing to do. Because there are great dogs in animal shelters, and because dogs in shelters need homes. There is no need to get a puppy from a breeder in order to raise it right - getting your dog at an early age is no guarantee of how he will turn out. Plus, you can find all the great qualities you could ever want in a shelter mixed-breed dog or puppy, or in one of the thousands of purebreds waiting in shelters on any given day.\" Of course, there are plenty of canine train wrecks desperately seeking homes in animal shelters as well - dogs who will cause heartache and trauma for the average dog owner. Sternberg offers tips to help prospective adopters find the diamonds in the rough world of animal sheltering. Before you visit a shelter There are a number of steps you need to take before you even set foot inside the shelter door. Doing some pre-visit homework can greatly increase your odds of finding the perfect pup. Here are Sternberg's suggestions: Visit Petfinder on-line, at www.petfinder.org. This web site lists shelters across the country, and can pinpoint the ones in your area starting with those closest to you. You can also search for specific breeds or breed mixes. Caution: If all dogs on a particular shelter's website are described the same way (sweet, friendly, loving) then the shelter probably doesn't know the personalities of their dogs very well, or chooses not to be forthcoming with the information. This would be a good shelter to avoid. Petfinder is not a complete list of all shelters, so you also need to check your local phone book for others in your area. You should be willing to travel a good distance, as much as three hours or more, to find the right dog at the right shelter. Contact the shelters on your list and ask about their return policy. A good shelter will always accept any dog as a return that they have adopted out at any time in his life, for whatever reason the owner may be unable to keep him. You should not expect a refund if you must return your dog, but shelters that refuse to take a dog back after 30 days (or whatever time limit) are not accepting full responsibility for the lives that pass through their hands. Ask the shelters about their adoption procedures. You will want to be able to visit with your prospective new family member outside of the kennel. If that is not allowed by a shelter, cross that one off your list. Ask the shelters about their criteria for making dogs available for adoption. Good shelters do temperament testing, and do not make dogs available who have a prior history of biting. Some dogs are not appropriate for our human society. A shelter who places all dogs up for adoption and never euthanizes is doing a disservice to potential adopters. Don't go to such a shelter. Sit in on a dog training class (or several). Find a trainer you like, who is kind to dogs and motivates them with treats, toys, and praise. (A selection of trainers from across the country is available from the APDT Trainer Locator at www.apdt.com.) Ask the instructor for good shelter referrals. If there are students in the class with shelter dogs, ask them which shelter they adopted from and what their experiences were. Avoid shelters where others have had negative experiences. Talk to the trainer you like about accompanying you to the shelter to select a dog. You should expect to pay a fee for this service, so you may want to arrange to have her visit with you once you find one or more possible adoption candidates. When you do start visiting shelters, look beyond a slick exterior. A good shelter is made up by people who care, and the good dogs in their kennels. There are lots of old, rundown, dark and damp shelters that have great dogs and are staffed by wonderful people, and there are others that are just as wretched as they look. There are also bright, pretty, high-tech modern shelters that treat people and animals well, and still others that are all window-dressing, forgetting to treat their human and canine clients with compassion. Avoid rigid preconceptions about what kind (age, breed, sex, size, color, coat length) of dog you want. Be prepared to enter the shelter with an open mind. Size, for example, is not a good indicator of energy level or adaptability to a small house - many large dogs are better suited to apartment life than are the typically high-energy but small Jack Russell Terriers. The shelter visit Although it's best to avoid preconceptions about what model of dog you are looking for, Sternberg advises that it is very important to know what to look for behaviorally. \"A high level of sociability will contribute more to a dog's success in a home than any other trait,\" Sternberg says. \"Overall, be looking for a dog that really likes people and wants to be with them, who is affectionate, congenial, and bonds easily and strongly. These are the dogs who are most fun, and the least worry to live with.\" Stand firm on this behavior criteria as you progress through Sternberg's 12-step program for adoption success: 1. As you enter the shelter, get a reading on the attitude of staff and volunteers. Are you greeted warmly and treated well? If you are asked to fill out a questionnaire, are the interviewers genuinely interested in who you are and helping you find the right dog, or are you grilled like a criminal? Any concerns about your answers should be used to help educate, not condemn you. If you feel like you are getting the thumbscrews and third-degree, leave. It would be almost impossible to concentrate on your task in an environment like this. 2. When you enter the kennels, make a quick pass through without stopping to schmooze the dogs. Pen and paper in hand, make note of any dogs that stand out for you. Ideally, you might find four or five who do. 3. On your second pass-through, stop and visit with each of the dogs you noted. Put your hand up to the kennel wire or bars. The dog should readily come up to visit you and sniff your hand. Remember, these dogs are socially deprived, and should be seeking your attention. When a candidate sniffs your hand, tell him he's a good dog, and move your hand back and forth, slowly, several times, about five inches each way. A social dog will follow your hand. Remember, you want a social dog - a well-socialized, outgoing, and friendly dog is the least liable to be aggressive. If the dog jumps at your faces, barks at you, lunges or, alternatively clings to or retreats to the back of the kennel, cross him off your list and move on to the next dog. 4. When you have identified the dogs on your list who are very social, take them out of their kennels one at a time, to a quiet room if possible. (Not all shelters can provide this luxury. Do the best you can - find a relatively quiet corner somewhere.) Stand with the dog for five minutes, and totally ignore him. The dog should look at you in a warm way, and try to worm his way into your affections - leaning on you, nudging, licking, trying to cuddle. Jumping up is okay if it is done as attention-seeking, not in an attempt to bowl you off your feet as he bounces away from you. If an employee is with you and the dog is seeking attention from the employee, that's okay - it just means the dog has already formed a bond with that person. If in five minutes the dog shows little or no interest in you or in other humans who are with you, put him back. He is not a good candidate. 5. If he is very social, pet him slowly and gently down his back. He should stand still and enjoy this, or lean into you, seeking more contact. If he shakes you off after you've touched him (\"Yuck, people cooties!\") or moves or lunges away from your touch, he's telling you he doesn't like being petted, or being around you. This dog is at risk for being aggressive anytime people touch him in a way that offends him. Put him back. 6. If he passes the petting test, ask a shelter staff member if you can feed him a meal - a small bowl of kibble, or a handful of biscuits that you brought with you. You want to test him for resource guarding - another behavior that puts him at high risk for biting. Put a bowl of food or pile of treats on the floor, enough that it will take him about 45 seconds to finish it. Now (BE CAREFUL!) talk to him, then pet him gently on the back. (Do not try to take the food away!) You want him to wag his tail, wag his tail harder, or even stop and look at you as if to say, \"Hi! I'm eating right now, I'll be back with you shortly.\" He may even stop eating and prefer to be with you. However, if he stiffens, blocks you with his body, glares at you, lowers his head into the dish, growls, or tries to move the food away from you, he is a resource guarder, and not a good adoption choice. 7. If he passes the first food test, up the ante. Ask the shelter staff if you can give him a chew hoof, pig ear, rawhide, or some other very valuable object. Again, you want to see if he is cooperative or competitive with this resource. Slowly move toward him and look for any of the guarding signs described in the previous step. If you see them, stop the test. If not, slowly reach for the object from a distance of at least two feet, then jerk your hand back. Repeat this step three times. You are looking for a dog who is relaxed about your approach. If you see any signs of guarding, don't adopt. Have the staff person retrieve the valuable object and put the dog away. 8. If the dog is still with you, your next step is to pet him all over. He should actively enjoy being petted, perhaps wag his tail, even lick you. He should not mouth you, even gently. If he does, put him away. Mouthiness, even done gently, is a sign of resistance, and may escalate to a bite if someone, such as a child, ignores the sign and keeps on petting or touching. 9. Now take out a toy (that you brought with you for this purpose, or one that the shelter provides, if they prefer) and see if he will play some sort of game with you: fetch, tug-o-war, or chase. Play the game for three to four minutes - enough to get him excited and aroused. Then abruptly stop the play, and put the toy up, preferably on a shelf where he can see it. Take note of how long it takes him to disengage from playing and return to you to settle and socialize, perhaps sit or lie down next to you. Ideally, he will do this within two minutes. If he is still aroused after five minutes, put him away. This is the kind of energy level that the average dog household is not equipped to deal with. (If, on the other hand, you are looking for the next World Frisbee or Agility Champion, he might be a candidate.) 10. Take the dog for a walk on leash, outside if possible. Don't worry if he pulls, or is very distracted - these are behaviors that are normal for shelter dogs, and can be retrained. Do watch for aggressive behavior toward other dogs or people while he is on leash. If you see any, put him away and cross him off your list. 11. If this dog is still on your list when your walk is done, have a staff person put him back in his kennel, then watch him as other strangers pass by, especially children, big men, and anyone who moves or dresses oddly. Avoid a dog who barks or lunges at anyone who walks by - this is a sign of inadequate socialization. If your dog will be around children, look for a dog who wants to greet passing children first. A dog who will live with children must worship little humans, not just tolerate them. 12. If you still have one or more candidates in the running, ask the shelter staff if you can put them on temporary hold while you make arrangements to return with your kids and spouse (if you have them) and trainer. You may also want to bring your current dog, if you have one, so your trainer can help with the first introduction. Shelter staff may tell you that they can't put a dog on hold, because if someone else wants to adopt in the meantime and you don't return for some reason, he might miss out on his best chance for a home. This is reasonable. However, they should be willing to note that you are interested on the dog's paperwork, and give you a reasonable amount of time to return, so the dog isn't selected for euthanasia before you can get back with your crew in tow. When you do return, your trainer will be able to help you make an educated final decision about which of the dogs on your short list is the best choice for a long relationship with your family. The Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association (JAVMA) recently published an article written by two veterinarians about homemade and commercially made raw meat-based diets. (A similar article, based on the same data, was published in the AKC Gazette.) The article has been regarded by many proponents of homemade diets as a warning shot fired by the commercial-food -producing community and their traditional veterinary medical footsoldiers over the bow of the raw feeding ship. The authors - who are both faculty members at prominent veterinary schools - stated that many arguments exist to support both sides of the issue - that, on one side, raw food diets are healthful, and on the other, that raw food diets can put dogs at risk of nutritional imbalances, complications from ingesting raw bones, and bacterial contamination. Further, they suggested that \"neither side has provided evidence to prove that their argument is correct.\" Generously, they proposed that they would \"objectively assess whether raw food diets prepared by typical pet owners are nutritionally balanced and safe.\" So far, so good. Some objective, scientifically based research studies about raw diets would benefit everyone. Inadequate design However, in our opinion, the study the authors designed and set up was woefully inadequate for the purposes they intended - unless the purpose was, as some raw diet proponents suspect, to simply publish an article that was critical of raw diets, without regard for the actual results of the study. To begin with, the authors performed a single analysis of five different diets, including a single sample of three homemade meals that included raw meats and other foods, and two commercial raw meat-based diets. The authors suggested that each of the homemade diets was prepared according to a raw-diet expert's outline - one based on Dr. Ian Billinghurst's BARF (Bones and Raw Food) diet, one based on Wendy Volhard's \"Natural Diet,\" and one based The commercial diets included Steve's Real Food for Dogs (a frozen raw-meat-based food that includes fruits, vegetables, and supplements) and Sojourner's Farm, a grain-based supplement that is added to fresh raw meat. The authors said they prepared this diet to the manufacturer's directions. Poor sampling Before we talk about the analysis itself, a word about the samples tested by the authors. While the authors proposed that their study would enable them to draw conclusions about the nutritional adequacy and balance of the raw food diets, they knew what the ingredients were in only the two commercial diets. They asked three people they knew who regularly fed a raw-food diet to their dogs to prepare a sample of the diet; however, the authors admit that \"Exact recipes of the diets were not provided to us.\" Therefore, even though these three samples were taken to be representative of the feeding theories forwarded by Dr. Ian Billinghurst, Wendy Volhard, and Kymythy Schultze, they could not even know whether the owners were preparing the diets correctly, according to instructions given by the originators of the diets. In fact, it's fairly clear that the diets were not precisely representative of the raw-food diet experts. For example, the article mentions that all the diets contained \"entire breasts or legs of chickens.\" However, none of the three homemade diet programs recommend these cuts - Billinghurst and Schultze both recommend chicken wings, necks and backs, which have less meat and more bone, to get the proper calcium/phosphorus balance. Volhard's basic diet uses beef plus a calcium supplement. All three diets also include occasional feeding of organ meats, but we do not know whether these were included. Complicating the analysis even more, the samples of homemade diets may have been even less representative of the total diet because of the way they were collected. The person who provided the authors with a sample of a diet based on Kymythy Schultze's \"Ultimate Diet\" told Schultze that, for two weeks, every time he fed his dog, he would throw a little bit of whatever he was feeding into a bag in the freezer. So, if he fed the dog a banana as a snack, he put a chunk of banana in the bag, and if he fed two pounds of meat, a chunk of meat was added. Food items were not added to the bag in proportion to the amount of the item actually being fed to the dog. Surely the authors must have been aware that a sample collected in this manner could not fairly represent any diet. But because they did not insist that all participants provide them with an exact recipe for their samples, they have no way of knowing whether the samples are prepared according to the diet originator's directions. Too many conclusions from too little data The first and most obvious problem is that the authors drew conclusions about complex feeding programs from analyzing a single sample - and one that was not guaranteed to resemble the diet it was supposed to represent. Unfortunately, the next set of problems are even more egregious. The authors submitted the five samples to a testing laboratory for analysis of various nutrients, such as protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals, as well as contaminants like bacteria. They then compared these results against the standard for commercial dog food, the AAFCO Nutrient Profile. The result? According to the article, \"All the diets tested had nutrient deficiencies or excesses that could cause serious health problems when used in a long-term feeding program.\" The authors concluded, \"There are clearly nutritional and health risks associated with feeding raw food diets.\" This study, with its accompanying tables indicating the various \"nutrient deficiencies and excesses\" of the raw diets, published as it was in a peer-reviewed, reputable veterinary publication, undoubtedly convinced many readers (most of them veterinarians) that raw food diets are harmful. Doing the math Fortunately, the article was also read - closely - by people who refused to accept the tables and text at face value, and actually \"did the math\" to double-check the authors' allegations. Steve Brown, President of Steve's Real Food for Dogs (the maker of one of the two commercial diets studied by the authors) challenged the figures published in the JAVMA article. Brown has had his diet analyzed by commercial laboratories many times in order to be able to provide a \"Guaranteed Analysis\" on the label of Steve's Real Food for Dogs that proved the nutritional completeness of his product; he was convinced that, in at least the case of his food, the authors' numbers could not be correct. Brown was subsequently provided with \"corrected\" data by the authors' attorneys. Sixty percent of the values were different the second time around. No, there was no new testing done, but all the values were recalculated and the majority - as published in JAVMA - were wrong. In more than a dozen instances, the original values were \"off\" by a factor of 10 or more - in five instances, the decimal point had been put in the wrong place. For at least seven values, when the initial error was corrected, the food then met those requirements. For the two commercial raw diets, only one value out of 28 stayed the same; the magnitude of the errors ranged from 4 to 91 percent. In a letter to the editor of JAVMA, one of the authors apologized for their \"inadvertent computational errors.\" Pressed by Brown and others, JAVMA later published a set of \"corrected tables;\" Brown has found yet more flaws within these tables. However, the authors do not seem to be in a frame of mind to let facts get in their way. In the May 15 issue of JAVMA, one of the authors wrote, \"Even considering these corrections, nutritional imbalances were present, and the overall reservations about raw food diets expressed in our article remain unchanged.\" Real science One of the major tenets of a \"scientific\" study is that it must be replicable. Precise methodology should be followed so that other scientists can duplicate the experiment, to see whether the same results occur. However, no one can replicate this data - the authors don't even know what was in the food! No recipe, not even a list of ingredients, nothing. Another philosophically vexing problem with this entire issue is the authors' discernible prejudice. They acknowledge that the arguments in favor of raw food diets are \"plausible,\" but then seem to spend the rest of the paper trying very hard to prove how terrible such diets are. This is hardly an example of \"scientific\" thinking, which should be open-minded, unbiased, and rational. The fact is, no studies have been done to compare the relative healthfulness of raw versus commercial diets - and, conducted in a scientific fashion by a neutral party, this is going to be what it takes to put this controversy to rest. The tragedy of this flawed study is that the damage has already been done. There are 65,000 veterinarians in the AVMA, and most of them receive this journal. All but about 3,000 of them practice conventional medicine, recommend commercial dog foods, and prescribe commercial therapeutic diets. This article has given them seeming justification for their skepticism about raw food diets. Even if corrections are published, these readers' opinions have already been influenced. Although JAVMA has printed a series of small corrections and letters to the editor on the topic, without a highly publicized retraction, correction, and/or apology - given about the same space and prominence as the original article - it is unlikely that many will feel it necessary to reconsider their newly solidified positions. As far as we're concerned, one of the oddest parts of this whole tale is the report from one participating owner who said that, in all the time he was dealing with the authors, they never once asked him if his dog was healthy. Wouldn't that be the first question to ask? -By Jean Hofve, DVM Dr. Jean Hofve is the Companion Animal Program Coordinator for the Animal Protection Institute, located in Sacramento, California. Thank goodness, I have never owned a dog with separation anxiety. This complex behavior challenge can be one of the most difficult to live with, and one of the toughest to resolve. The dog who panics when left alone may manifest a range of behaviors that the average owner finds intolerable, including serious household destruction (I've heard about dogs who have clawed holes through the walls of their homes, all the way through the outdoor siding), self-injury from biting or clawing at doors or walls, hysterical vocalization (nonstop whining, crying, barking, howling, and/or screaming), and inappropriate defecation and urination - on floors, carpets, beds, and owners' possessions. Separation anxiety (SA) stems from a dog's natural survival instinct to stay in close proximity to the pack. In the wild, a canine who is left alone is more likely to die, either from starvation, since he has no pack to hunt with, or from attack, since he has no pack mates for mutual protection. Given the vital importance of a dog's canine companions, it speaks volumes about their adaptability as a species that we can condition them to accept being left alone at all! We're lucky we don't have far more SA problems than we do, especially in today's world, where few households have someone at home regularly during the day to keep the dog company. Recipe for Failure It's not enough that dogs are naturally inclined to become anxious when left alone. Many well-intentioned but misguided owners of new dogs inadvertently set the stage for SA by doing all the wrong things when they first bring their new dog home. For example, lots of families adopt their new dog or puppy at the beginning of the summer, when the kids will be home to spend a lot of time with him. Other new-dog parents may take several days off from work, or at least arrange to bring the dog home on a Friday afternoon so they have the entire weekend to help the new kid settle in. On its face, this is a thoughtful approach to acclimating the dog to his new life. What better way to help him feel comfortable and welcome than to give him a couple of days of your loving company? It's true that spending extra time with the newcomer can help smooth the transition for him, but unless you take some important precautions, you could be setting him up for a rude awakening on Monday morning when you go back to work, leaving him alone all day to wonder and worry the pack is ever coming back to rescue him from solitary confinement. Recipe for Success The key to SA is to never trigger it in the first place. This is without a doubt one of those behaviors where it is well worth investing in many ounces of prevention, lest you end up spending many beginning with making a wise selection of your new family member. Dogs adopted from animal shelters seem to have a higher than average incidence of SA. We don't know whether this is because dogs with SA are more likely to be recycled through shelters by their frustrated owners, or because the stress of shelter life triggers SA in previously unaffected dogs. It's likely that both explanations play a significant role. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't adopt from a shelter. It means that you need to look for signs of potential SA whatever the source of your new dog, and especially if you adopt from a shelter or rescue group. Dogs who seem anxious in general are more likely candidates for SA, particularly those who are worried and clingy. Velcro dogs who won't leave your side in the get-acquainted area, even though they have just met you, can be hard to resist. \"She loves me already,\" you think to yourself. \"How can I possibly leave her here to face the risk of euthanasia?\" Indeed, that kind of instant bond can be very endearing in the moment. It is far less so when you get home from a hard day's work to find your sofa cushions in shreds, and dog feces and urine smeared across the kitchen, or worse, a note from your landlord informing you that elderly Mr. Jones with a heart condition who lives in the apartment next door called 11 times today to complain that someone was screaming at the top of their lungs in your living room. If you do think that's your furry soulmate glued to your leg in the get-acquainted room, do a simple test. Place an inexpensive pillow or cushion that you have purchased at Goodwill for this very purpose on the chair or floor, and leave the dog alone in the room for 10 minutes. Wait outside, close enough that you can hear any activity. Ideally, the shelter will have a one-way window into the room, so you can watch her but she can't see you. Now, take note of what she does. A certain amount of activity is normal. She might explore the room, playfully chew on the pillows or other dog toys, snuffle at the door, and stand up on her hind legs to look out the window. She might even whine or bark a bit to see if anyone responds. As long as she seems relatively calm, and settles down after several minutes, you're not looking at SA behavior, despite her instant and endearing connection to you. You will still need to take precautions not to trigger SA once you get her home, but again, that's easier than undoing an existing condition. If, however, she charges in a panic from one end of the room to the other, digs frantically at the door, flings herself bodily at the window, shreds the pillow into tiny pieces and proclaims her distress vocally and insistently, you are looking at a serious behavior challenge. If you choose to adopt her anyway, be prepared to enter into a long-term, potentially costly relationship with a good, positive behavior counselor and a doggie daycare facility. Puppies are less likely to come complete with a fully developed set of SA behaviors, but again, some are more likely candidates than others. Puppies will naturally exhibit some concern at being isolated from their littermates, but the pup who happily visits with you or explores his new environment is a safer bet than the one who shows immediate distress and a single-minded determination to return to his siblings. A conscientious breeder who makes an effort to separate littermates for brief, non-traumatic periods between the ages of six to eight weeks can help set the stage for a puppy who is able to tolerate being left alone when he arrives in his new home.
