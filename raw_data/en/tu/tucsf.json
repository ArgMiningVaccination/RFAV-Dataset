S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs - B ureau of Justice Assistance EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO TERRORISM: BASIC CONCEPTS SM ii FEDERAL EMERGE NCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION NATIONAL FIRE ACADEMY FOREWORD The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was established in 1979. FEMA's mission is to focus Federal efforts on preparedness for, mitigation of, response to, and recovery from emergencies encompa ssing the full range of natural and manmade disasters. FEMA's National Emergency Training Center (NETC) in Emmitsburg, Maryland, includes the United States Fire Administ ration (USFA), its National Fire Academy (NFA), and the Emergency Management Institute (EMI). To achieve the Academy's legislated ma ndate (under Public Law 93-498, October 29, 1974), \"to advance the professional developm ent of fire servi ce personnel and other persons engaged in fire prevention and contro l activities,\" the National Fire Academy has developed an effective program linkage with established fire training systems which exist at the state and local levels . Academy field courses have been sponsored by the respective state fire traini ng systems in every state. The staff of the National Fire Academy is proud to join with state and local fire agencies in providing educational oppor tunities to the members of the nation's fire services. This course addresses the special needs of responders to incidents which may have been caused by terrorist action. The response to terrorism program builds upon the firm foundation provided by the Hazardous Materials curriculum offered at the Academy and adds specialized information concerning such topics as: current Department of Justic e definitions of terrorism; a history of terrorism; agents utilized by terrorists; suspicious circumstances; self-protection at potential terrorist scenes; crime scene considerations; and specialized incident command issues.

During the next two days you will ex plore a wide variety of issues and concerns faced by responders when operat ing at a potential terrorism incident. From the smallest pipe bomb to the horror of the Oklahoma City bombing, terrorism presents added concerns to those involved in emergency response. This course addresses the special requirements of those incidents with a special emphasis on self protection for first responders. Biological Nuclear Chemical Incendiary Explosives Terrorist incidents involving biological, nuclear, incendiar y, chemical, or explosive ( B- NICE ) materials are considered technological hazardous incidents by nature. For this reason, this course is approached from the poi nt of view of a hazar dous materials incident with additional complicating factors. This al lows us to build upon the proven structure of hazardous materials response in order to address terrorist incidents. WELCOME AND INTRODUCTION SM 0-3 COURSE GOALS At the completion of this course, you will be able to: 1. Define and discuss terrorism including identifying significant incidents that have occurred within the United States. 2. Recognize circumstances and on-scene key indicators which may signify a suspicious incident. 3. Implement appropriate se lf-protective measures. 4. Define scene security consideratio ns unique to terrorist incidents. 5. Make appropriate notifications. 6. Define and describe defensive consid erations associated with biological, nuclear, incendiary, chemical, and e xplosives (B-NICE) incidents. 7. Describe command and contro l issues associated with crime scene activities. 8. Define and describe recovery and termin ation issues associated with terrorism incidents. TARGET AUDIENCES This course is primarily designed to addr ess the needs of fire service personnel, emergency medical services providers, and ha zardous materials responders, all trained to at least the operations level of hazardous materials response. Due to the broad scope of the subject matter, the course can be used to address the needs of those without prior hazardous materials training and provide benefits to law enforcement personnel, emergency communications personnel, emerge ncy management personnel, public works management, public health workers, armed forces, and disaster response agencies. WELCOME AND INTRODUCTION SM 0-4 COURSE STRUCTURE The body of this course is or ganized into five modules: Module 1: Understanding and Recognizing Terrorism will help the responder recognize suspicious circ umstances in advance. Module 2: Implementing Self-Protective Measures assists the student in utilizing time, distance and shielding to protect themselves from dangerous exposure. Module 3: Scene Security defines isolation, evacuation and control issues unique to terrorism incidents. Module 4: Tactical Considerations covers specific defensive measure utilized in each major category (B-NICE) of incident. Module 5: Incident Command Overview gives a broad picture of: local, State, and Federal resources; making appropriate notifications; specialized crime scen e considerations; and operating in a multi-jurisdictional command system under the Federal Response Plan (FRP). Individual and small group activities will be s cattered throughout the course. At the end of the course there will be a comprehensive activity and a final exam. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES: Your Student Manual is designed to serve as a reference afte r you leave the class, and for that purpose includes additional materials beyond that presented in class.

ENABLING OBJECTIVES The students will: 1. Define domestic and international terroris m per the current Department of Justice definition. 2. Illustrate, through case histories, various types of pot ential incidents. 3. Define differences and similarities between responding to terrorist and non-terrorist incidents. 4. Recognize suspicious circumstances wh ich may indicate possible terrorism. UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING TERRORISM SM 1-2 INTRODUCTION The threat of terrorism affects all communities both nationally and internationally. History has shown that no community is im mune. Terrorism transcends all geographic and demographic boundaries. All jurisdictions , suburban, urban and rural are at risk. Terrorists, both international and \"home gr own,\" have demonstrated they have the knowledge and capability to strike anywhere in the world. While not all the incidents we cite here have been determined to be terro rism, they are all suspicious criminal acts which may be linked to terrorist activity. A Sampling of Suspicious In cidents in Recent History Eastern USA (East of the Mississippi River). In February 1993, the World Trade Center was damaged by a vehicle bomb, killing 6 people. In July 1993, a member of the Animal Libera tion Front set a fire in a Michigan State University research facility. In April 1996, members of the Georgia Mili tia were arrested for plotting to make dozens of pipe bombs. In October 1996, seven men with connections to a local anti-government paramilitary group were arrested on charges of plo tting to blow up the Criminal Justice Information Services comp lex near Clarksburg, WV. UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING TERRORISM SM 1-3 In 1995, a Harrisonburg, VA neurologist was ch arged with possession of ricin with intent to use it to kill his former boss. In September 1996, a Staten Island, NY ma n accused of stockpiling weapons was arrested by ATF agents. In 1996, a Romanian immigrant was stopped as he attempted to board a flight in Tampa, FL carrying five explosive devi ces, weapons, and 180 rounds of ammunition. In January 1997, several letter bombs were sent to the offices of the Al Hayat Publishing Company offices in the Nati onal Press Building in Washington, DC. In 1996 and 1997, numerous bombing incide nts occurred in the Atlanta area including at least two with confirmed secondary devices. Central USA. In April 1995, the Alfred P. Murrah Federa l Building in Oklahoma City was bombed. 168 people were killed and hundreds injured. In March 1995, members of the Patriot's C ouncil in central Minnesota were arrested and charged with manufacturing ricin to kill law enforcement officers. In November 1995, charges were filed ag ainst an \"anti-government prophet\" in Muskogee, OK, for plotting a series of bombi ngs against abortion c linics, civil rights offices and government facilities. In May 1996, an explosion blew out the windows in a building housing an FBI field office in Laredo, TX. In August 1996, a person was sentenced for plotting to bomb the office of the IRS in Austin, TX. In December 1995, a man charged with possession of ricin in Arkansas killed himself in his jail cell. Also in 1996, a man identified as a memb er of an anti-government freeman group was apprehended in Topeka, KS, and aut horities found a bomb-tr iggering device in his car. Western USA. In October 1995, the Amtrak Sunset Limite d was derailed by sabotaged tracks near Hyder, AZ. This incident killed one and seriously injured 12. In December 1995, there was an attempted bombing of the IRS building in Reno, NV. In January 1996, an explosion took place outside of a U.S. Forest Service headquarters in Espanola, NM. In April 1996, a bomb exploded in the truck of a federal employee, injuring him and his wife in Vacaville, CA. In April 1996, Theodore Kaczynski was a rrested as the suspected Unibomber. In June 1996, members of the Viper Militi a were arrested in Phoenix, Arizona and charged with conspiracy to make bombs and use deadly weapons. In June 1996, members of the Washington St ate Militia and a Seattle-based Freeman group were arrested on fede ral conspiracy charges. UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING TERRORISM SM 1-4 Most of these items were taken from e ither Terrorism in the United States 1995 published by the FBI or Security Awareness Bulletin , number 3-96, published by the Department of Defense Security Institute, Richmond, VA. Several articles, including the one from which much of this material was obtained, are in Appendix A of your Student Manual. In addition to the above, according to mate rials provided on the FEMA Internet site, attacks in Puerto Rico account ed for about 60 percent of a ll terrorist incidents between 1983 and 1991 that occurred on Un ited States territory. DEFINING TERRORISM The general definition of terrorism is as follows: Terrorism \u2014 A violent act or an act dangerous to human life, in violation of the criminal laws of the United States or any segment to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population or any segment thereof, in fu rtherance of political or social objectives (US Department of Justice). The Federal Bureau of Investigation further de fines two types of terrorism that occur in the United States. Domestic terrorism involves groups or individuals whos e terrorist activit ies are directed at elements of our government or population without foreign direction. International terrorism involves groups or individuals whose terrorist activities are foreign-based and/or directed by countries or groups outside the Un ited States or whose activities transcend national boundaries. We indicated earlier that inci dents involving B-NICE agents are considered technological hazardous incidents. This is a broad field that includes hazmat as one subtopic. Criminal incidents also comprise a broad field. Wher e those two types of incidents overlap, we find a select group of incident s including arson, environmental crime, industrial sabotage, non-terrorist bombings, weapons of mass dest ruction, and, of course, B-NICE terrorism. While the Department of Justice uses a very narrow definition of terrorism, the concerns of public safety responders go well beyond that limited scope. In this program we will study terrorism, bombings and weapons of ma ss destruction described as Biological, Nuclear, Incendiary, Chemical, a nd Explosive (B-NICE) incidents. However, criminals that resort to weapons of mass destruction re gardless of their motive will not be restricted by any definition or category. We need to be concerned with the broader field of criminal incidents that offer a variety of threats to public safety and responders alike. UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING TERRORISM SM 1-5 Bombings include a wide variety of incident s not related to terrorism. The following information is taken from the FBI Bomb Data Statistics page.

Infected corpses were used long before the ge rm theory of disease. Biological toxins extracted from plants were used to poison wells and assassinate leaders as far back as any history can trace. Here are some exampl es of terrorism over the past 300 years. 18th century: Infected corpses were used by the Russians against areas held by Sweden; The Puritans performed many acts of viol ence against other religious groups, especially the Catholics and Quakers prio r to and after the Revolutionary War; Organized violence against government taxation included Shay's Rebellion (1786) and the Whiskey Rebellion (1791); and British officials provided blankets from smallpox patients to Native Americans. 19th Century: Planned assassination of Tsar Alexander II; 12 additional assassinations of public o fficeholders took place following that of President Lincoln; The Ku Klux Klan began acts of terrorism; In 1886, a peaceful labor rally at the Haym arket Square in Chicago was disrupted when an unknown person threw a bomb, killing seven; Catholic churches were burned in Bost on, Philadelphia and other cities from the 1830s - 1850s; and Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) activists use 3,000 pounds of dynamite to blow up the Hill and Sullivan Company mine at Wadner, Idaho, along with a boarding house and bunkhouse. 20th Century: The 1950 assassination attempt on President Truman by Puerto Rican nationalists resulted in the death of one DC police o fficer during a gun battle outside the Blair House; In 1954, five members of congress were wounded by gunfire during an attack by Puerto Rican nationalists; One of 49 bombing attributed to the Pu erto Rican group FALN between 1974 and 1977 was the Frances Tavern bombing in New York City. Four people died in this event; In 1975, a bombing by Croatian nationalist s killed eleven and injured 75 at LaGuardia Airport in New York City; In 1976, Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean ambassador to the United States. was killed along with one of his associates in a car bombing in Washington, DC; In 1981, a man was killed when a bomb planted by a group calling itself the Puerto Rican Armed Resistance detona ted in a men's bathroom at Kennedy International Airport in New York City; UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING TERRORISM SM 1-7 In 1983, a bomb detonated in the cloak room next to the U.S. Senate in the Capitol Building. Two left-wing radicals plead guilty to the attack; During the latter half of the 20th century there were numerous airline hijackings and bombings; The 1993 World Trade Center bombing; The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing; The 1994 Matsumoto and 1995 Tokyo chemical attacks; and Multiple bombings in Atlanta in 1997. Victims of the Tokyo Subway Incident As you can see, extremists have used property destruction and violence to generate fear and compel societal change throughout history. However, one major change has happened recently. Prior to modern times, terrorists usually granted certain categories of people (e.g., women, children, clergy, elderly, infirm, etc.) immunity from attack. Like other warriors, terrorist s recognized innocents people not involved in conflict. For example, in late nineteenth-century Russia, radicals planning the assassination of Tsar Alex ander II, the leader of Russia, aborted several planned attacks because they risked harming innocent people. Historically terrorism was direct; it intended to produce a political effect through the injury or death of the victim. The development of bureaucratic states resulte d in a philosophical change among terrorist groups. Since modern governments are designe d to be more dependent upon processes and structure than unique individuals, the death of a single individual, even a president or prime minister, will not n ecessarily produce the major di sruption terrorists desire. Terrorists have reacted by turning from targ eting prominent individua ls to attacks aimed at a wider range of target s including those historically considered immune. UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING TERRORISM SM 1-8 Nighttime Operations at Oklahoma City Events such as the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City incidents, and various clinic bombings are designed to create a public atmosphere of anxiety and undermine confidence in government. Their unpredictability and apparent randomness make it virtually impossible for governments to protect a ll potential victims. Modern terrorism offers its practitioners many advantages. First, by not recognizing inno cents, terrorists have an infinite number of targets. They select their target and determine when, where, and how to attack. The range of choices gives terrorists a high probability of success with minimum risk. If the attack goes wrong or fails to produce the intended results, the terro rists can deny responsibility. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CHALLENGE The emergency response challenge is profound. On the one hand, you have a hazardous materials or mass casualty incident. From that standpoint, you can and should use recognized protocols such as the Incident Command System (as referenced in 29 CFR 1910.120) in order to effectiv ely respond to the needs of the victims and the pub lic. On the other hand, the scene is compounded by two complicating factors which all responders will have to take into account deliberate targeting of re sponders and crime scene considerations. Preparing Responders for Entry Automobiles damaged in a bombing Terrorists have a history of utilizing secondary devices and/or booby traps to target emergency responders. In January 1997, a bomb went off outside of an Atlanta ab ortion clinic. One hour after the initial detonati on, a second bomb went off close to the point at which the incident command post had been esta blished. It resulted in several injuries to responders. If parked automobiles had not absorbed some of the blast, several deaths could have occurred. UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING TERRORISM SM 1-9 If the incident is a potential act of terrorism, it is also a crime scene . While there will be similarities between terrorist and non-terrorist events such mass casualty incidents (e.g., major transportation and hazmat accidents), crime scene considerations will add a complicating factor to responder operations. This will be discussed further in modules 3 and 5. Regardless of the mechanism or motive behind the incident, responders should remain focused on reducing the impact of the event as efficiently and safely as possible. Terrorist or non-terrorist event, all responders should follow established operating guidelines that are pertin ent to their respective agency. All responders on the scene should operate under an incident command system (as referenced in 29 CFR 1910.120) and utilize some type of personnel accountability system that is compatible with all participating agencies. Decontamination Operations Recognizing suspicious incidents may be diffi cult, but being extrem ely alert to clues, surroundings and events will greatly assist in identification. Clues such as occupancy location, type of event, timing of the event a nd on-scene warning signs will help with this process. Examples of these clues are: 1. Occupancy or location: Symbolic and historical targets include those which represent some organization or event which is particularly offensive in the mi nds of extremists. Examples of this might include Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Fi rearms (BATF) offices for those who oppose all forms of gun control or Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offices for tax resisters. Public buildings or assembly areas provide the opportunity fo r attention-getting mass casualties. Some of these public buildings are also symbolic targets, so the terrorist can cause massive casualties and link the owner/ope rator of the building or assembly area with danger in the minds of the public. Ex amples of these would include shopping malls, convention centers, entertainment ve nues, and tourist destinations. UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING TERRORISM SM 1-10 Controversial businesses are usually those which have a history of attracting the enmity of recognized groups which include extremis t elements. Abortion clinics, nuclear facilities, and furriers all fall into this category. Infrastructure systems include those operations which are necessary for the continued functioning of our society. Major cities are full of targets such as power plants, phone companies, water treatment plants, mass trans it, and hospitals. Attacks on any of these have the potential to disrupt entire regions and cost hundreds of millions of dollars to correct. 2. Type of event: Certain types of events shoul d raise your awareness of possi ble terrorism involvement. In general they can be categorized as follows. Explosions and/or incendiaries are among the favorite weapons of terrorists. Any bombing or suspicious fire may involve terr orist involvement, especially combined with location or occupancy factors as listed above. Incidents involving firearms are always treated as susp icious. If they occur in conjunction with other indicat ing factors, terrorism is a definite possibility. Non-trauma mass casualty incidents have occurred as the arse nal of terrorism increases in sophistication. When large numbers of victims are generated without obvious (physical) injury, you may susp ect terrorist involvement. 3. Timing of the event: For many years to come, April 19 will be a day around which government facilities operate at heightened state of security awareness. Since it is the anniversary of both the fire at the Branch Davidian compound in W aco, Texas and the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City, it has b ecome a rallying point for anti-government extremists. Outside of significant anniversaries, events that occur on specific days of the week and times are worth treating with suspicion. A fire at a government building during the weekend or during a time when few people are likely to be present may also involve terrorism or other criminal activity. UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING TERRORISM SM 1-11 4. On-scene warning signs When you arrive on the scene, you should alwa ys watch for signs that you are dealing with a suspicious incident. Unexplained patt erns of illnesses or deaths can be due to chemical, radiological or biological agents. So me of these substances have recognizable odors and/or tastes. Unexplained signs and sy mptoms of skin, eye, or airway irritation may be due to chemical contamination, as can unexplained vapor clouds, mists and plumes. Always keep on the lookout for chemical cont ainers, spray devices or lab equipment in unusual locations. Watch for items or contai ners that appear out of place at unusual incidents, which might indicate a secondary devi ce. When dealing with fires, spot fires and fires of unusual behavior may also arous e your suspicions, as can anything that appears not to be \"normal\" for a given incident scene. UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING TERRORISM SM 1-12 Activity 1.1 Recognizing Suspicious Incidents Purpose This activity is designed to assist you in making quick decisions concerning the possibility of criminal activity at an incident and to justify your decision. Directions to Students 1. You will have ten minutes to complete th e group discussion and return to the class. 2. Meet as a group and discu ss the scenario. Determine wh at outward warning signs and indicators would alert you to the possibility of criminal activity. 3. Also discuss any special chal lenges that will face the res ponder as a resu lt of deciding that this incident is possi bly due to criminal activity. 4. Record your responses on a flip chart and return to the class. 5. Each group will have five minutes to report th eir findings to the class. Be prepared to provide a justification for each one of th e warning signs or indicators you mention.

List Outward Warning Signs or Indicators and Justification List Special challenges: UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING TERRORISM SM 1-16 SUMMARY The threat of terrorism is real and can potential ly affect all of us. According to Terrorism in the United States 1995 , published by the Department of Justice, \"Terrorists in the United States continued a general trend in which fewer attacks are occurring in the United Stat es, but individual attacks are becoming more deadly.\" \"Extremists in the United Stat es continued a chilling trend by demonstrating interest in - and experimenting with - unconventional weapons. Over the past ten ye ars, a pattern of interest in biological agents by cr iminals and extremists has developed.\" \"America and Americans have also been a fa vorite choice of target for terrorists. Reprisals for U.S. legal action against domestic and in ternational terrorists increase the likelihood that Americans will be the target of terrorist attack s either in the United States or overseas.\" Emergency responders need to always be aw are of their surroundings and alert for any suspicious incidents. Protecting yourself fr om a violent terrorist act begins with recognition of the event. MODULE 2: IMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES TERMINAL OBJECTIVE The students will be able to define the im plementation of appropriate self-protective measures. ENABLING OBJECTIVES The students will: 1. Define the appropriate use of sh ielding at B-NICE incidents. 2. Define the use of time and distance as pr otective measures at B-NICE incidents. 3. Define the basic steps of emergen cy decon and routine post-exposure decon. IMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES SM 2-2 INTRODUCTION TO TIME / DI STANCE / SHIELDING CONCEPTS Protection of the first responder is based on avoiding or minimizing exposure through the principals of time, distance and shielding. Time \u2014 Use time as a tool prot ect yourself at a crime scene. Spend the shortest amount of time possible in the hazard area or exposed to the hazard. An example of utilizing time constraints is rapid entries to execute reconnaissance or rescue. The less time you spend in the affected area, the less likely you are to become injured. Minimizing time spent in the affected area will also reduce the chance of contaminating the crime scene. Overhead photo showing initial perimeter Distance \u2014 Maximize your distance from the hazard area or th e projected hazard area. One example of utilizing distance would be avoiding contact by following the recommended guidelines in the current edition of the North American Emergency Response Guidebook (NAERG) or your Standard Operating Procedures or Guidelines. Shielding \u2014 Use appropriate shielding to address specific hazards. Shielding can be vehicles, buildings , chemical protective clothing and personnel protective equipment includ ing structural fire protective clothing and positive-pressure, self-contained breathing apparatus. Responders should use all three forms of protection whenever possible. Just because you feel pr operly shielded does not mean that you can spend excessive time in close proximity to a contaminated site. Remember: All forms of protection can be defined in terms of time, distance and shielding. PPE is a type of shielding IMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES SM 2-3 Decontamination While not strictly speaking a form of self-pro tection, decon is vital to prevent, reduce and remove contamination of both responders and victims. Victim decon is performed to prepare contaminated victims for transport to medical care facilities. The overall procedure is to flush with water, remove contaminated clothing, flush again, cover the victim, and transport to medical care. A second form of emergency decon is mass decon which is designed for addressing large numbers of contaminated victims. In this case contaminated clothing is removed and the victim is flushed with water before being covered and sent to medical facilities. Emergency decon of a contaminated victim Responder decon is the standard decon of responders who have been protected by appropriate ppe. Follow your lo cal protocols for this task. TYPES OF HARM To implement self-protective measures one must first understand the various types of harm you can be exposed to. Harm can be categorized utilizing the acronym TRACEM, which provides an easy way to remember: Thermal; Radiological; Asphyxiation; Chemical; MechanicalIMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES SM 2-4 Thermal harm may refer to harm caused by either ex treme heat, such as that generated by burning liquids or metals, or extreme cold from cryogenic materi als such as liquid oxygen. While heat usually comes to mind as an exa mple of thermal harm, cryogenic fluids such as the Liquid Oxygen stored here c an also cause tremendous harm due to extreme cold. Radiological harm refers to danger from alpha partic les, beta particles or gamma rays. ALPHA PARTICLE BETA PARTICLE GAMMA RAYS PAPER LEADSKIN The above chart shows the relative penetrating power of the three types of radiation. Asphyxiation is caused by a lack of oxygen in th e atmosphere. One common cause of this is heavier than air gases such as ar gon, carbon dioxide, or chemical vapors in a confined space.IMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES SM 2-5 Chemical harm is posed by toxic or corrosive materials. These can include acids such as sulfuric, caustics such as lye, and chemical toxins ranging from cyanides to nerve agents. Etiological harm comes from either disease-causing organisms such as bacteria, rickettsia, and viruses or toxins derived from living organisms. Mechanical harm is any sort of physical trauma such as gunshot wounds, slip, trip and fall hazards, and injury from bomb fragments or shrapnel. IMPLEMENTING SELF-PROTECTION AT THE SCENE OF AN ARMED ATTACK Types of Harm (TRACEM) Armed attack incidents can include many differen t scenarios and t ypes of weapons. Harm occurs from physical trauma inflicte d from the weapon(s). Terrorists generally utilize weapons that can kill th e largest number of persons in the shortest amount of time. Mechanical harm is the primary form of harm from an armed attack. Etiological harm may result from contact with blood and other bodily fluids. IMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES SM 2-6 During the discussion on implementing se lf-protective measures, write the various measures discussed in the appropriate place on the chart below. Time Distance Shielding IMPLEMENTING SELF-PROTECTION AT AN EXPLOSION SITE Overview of Bombing Incidents Oklahoma City Bombing incidents can involve a wide variety of ma terials from small pipe bombs to large vehicle bombs. The incident may involve an attack against a fixed target or a group of people such as emergency responders. The incident may be an isolated event or may involve secondary devices, booby traps or suicide bombers. IMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES SM 2-7 Grenade Materials involved wi ll always include some form of explosives. However, the detonation may be designed to disperse biological, chemical or radiological materials. The type of bomb involved may be an improvised explosive device or a commercially manufactured explosive. The bomb itself may be equipped with various switches or controls that can be activated by light, pressure, movement, or radio transmission. For th is reason, untrained personnel should never attempt to neut ralize an unexploded device. Bombs are the most frequent weapons currently used by terrorists. It is important to note that one of the bomb victims may be the bomber. For this reason all victims should be searched for weapons prior to transport. Types of Harm (TRACEM) Thermal harm is a primary hazard to those exposed to the heat generated by the detonation. It is usually not an ongoing risk unless ther e are unexploded materials present. Mechanical harm is the other primary type of harm typically seen at bombing incidents. It can result from blast overpressu re, shockwaves and fragmentation. Radiological harm is a possibility if the de vice was designed for the purpose of dispersing radiological contam ination or detonated in an area containing radiological materials. In this case, the hazard can persist for long periods of time. Chemical hazards can come from products created as a result of the explosive reaction, from chemicals already present at the detonati on site, or could have been included in the device for the purpose of being dispersed. A ll of these potential hazards need to be addressed by responders. Etiological harm will be a primary risk if the device is used as a dispersion mechanism. Otherwise, it may be a secondary risk due to mechanical trauma. IMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES SM 2-8 Implementing Self-Protective Measures When dealing with explosive incidents, th e responder needs to address protection in terms of pre-blast and post-blast scenarios. Pre-blast is defined as that portion of operations that occurs after a written or verbal warning is received and before any actual explosion takes place. Post -blast refers to operations occurring after at least one detonation occurs.

A focused emergency is a situation where a potential or actual point source is located and attempts are ma de to prevent or minimize damage. A public health emergency manifests itself as a sudden demand upon the public health infrastructure with no apparent explanation for the occurrence. Materials include bacteria, rickettsia, viruse s or toxins. These mate rials are inhaled or ingested into the body to cause harm. Bacteria are single-celled organisms that can gr ow in a variety of environments. Dangers to humans come from two directions ; disease-causing bacteria growing in the body and those which grow outside of the human body but produce toxins which may pose a danger. Rickettsia are a class of cellular life smaller than bacteria but larger than viruses. Rickettsia can only multiply inside living cells and cause diseases such as Q fever and typhus. Viruses are the smallest known entity capable of reproduction. They only grow inside of living cells and cause those cells to produce additional viruses. Toxins are poisons produced by living organisms. The organisms may be bacteria, fungi, flowering plants, insects, fi sh, reptiles, or mammals. Types of Harm (TRACEM) Etiological is the primary type of harm posed by biological agents. These materials are classified as class 6 hazardous materials by the US Department of Transportation Chemical harm is a possible secondary hazard at the scene of a clandestine laboratory. Mechanical harm is a possible secondary hazard where explosives have been used to disperse the agent.

List 5 possible secondary forms of harm that may be present at this incident. 4. Identify methods of self-protection th at could be utilized on this incident. IMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES SM 2-13 IMPLEMENTING SELF-PROTECTION AT CHEMICAL INCIDENTS Chemical incidents can include many hazardous materials classes. Materials can be inhaled, ingested, absorbed, or injected. Materials can include in dustrial chemical or warfare type agents. Due to the wide variety of hazards posed by chemical agents, responders should take care to minimize exposure risks under all circumstances. Responder utilizing appropriate PPE Types of Harm (TRACEM) Chemical hazards, of course, include a wide va riety of effects including corrosivity, reactivity, and a variety of syst emic effects which may attack the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, and other bodily functions. This will be discussed in far more de tail later on in Module 4. Thermal harm is also a possibility, since many ch emical reactions create heat. Also the chemicals involved may be flammable. Asphyxiation is a possibility due to the fact that some chemical reactions may deplete oxygen or create gases that displace oxygen. Mechanical harm must be taken into account be cause corrosive chemicals like strong acids can weaken structural elements. Implementing Self-Protective Measures Time Distance Shielding IMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES SM 2-14 IMPLEMENTING SELF-PROTECTION AT AN INCENDIARY INCIDENT Overview of Incendiary Incidents Incendiary incidents involve flammable devices that are either stationary or hand- thrown. Incendiary devices are used in approximately 20-25% of all bombing incidents in the United States. Incendiary materials can include many different chemicals and flammable or explosive devices. Firefighters on the scene Types of Harm (TRACEM) Thermal harm is the primary type of harm from an incendiary. Chemical harm is also possible if the incendiary material releases a chemical hazard, or if other fuels present may generate chemical hazards. Asphyxiation is always a possibility due to the fact that burning depletes oxygen. Mechanical harm is possible from structural damage, thrown devices or secondary events or explosions. Implementing Self-Protective Measures Time Distance Shielding IMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES SM 2-15 IMPLEMENTING SELF-PROTECTION AT A SUSPECTED NUCLEAR INCIDENT Overview of Suspect Nuclear Incidents Terrorist nuclear incidents are most likely going to involve the us e of a radiological explosive dispersion device or other means to spread nuclear materials. Intelligence sources report that th e use of a nuclear device to ca use a nuclear detonation is highly unlikely, if not nearly impossible. Identifyi ng a nuclear incident may be difficult due to the fact that radiation can not be detected by the senses and that symptoms of radiological exposure are generally delayed for hours or days. Types of Harm (TRACEM) Radiological harm is the primary danger from radiol ogical materials. Due to the nature of the materials, this will represent an ongoing hazard, the scope of which will only be determined when the amount and identity of the substance involved is ascertained. Chemical harm is also a concern due to the f act that many radiologi cal substances are also chemical hazards. This is an ar ea often overlooked by responders concentrating on radiation effects. Implementing Self-Protective Measures It is important to note that the use of radi ological detection equipment is the best method to identify if your self-protective m easures are effective and appropriate.

One of the occupants of the van fled on foot after the accident. The second occupant was ejected during the accident and is unconscious next to the vehicl e. When you look in the rear of the van you see a package approximately 12 inches x 12 inches x 8 inches. There are thick rubber gloves and a very thick and heavy apron in the back as well.

List significant warning signs and cl ues available upon arrival at the scene. 2. What is the primary type of harm that can be expected to have already occurred at this incident? 3. List 2 possible secondary forms of harm that may be present at this incident. 4. Identify methods of self-p rotection that could be u tilized on this incident. IMPLEMENTING SELF- PROTECTIVE MEASURES SM 2-18 Summary Self-protection of responders at the scene of a suspected terro rist incident begins with identification of the incident through outward wa rning signs and detection clues. Responders must always be aler t to the possibility that the event they are responding to is designed to position them as targets. Once an incident is suspect, the site should be evaluated for potential harm. This can be accomplished by use of TRACEM as a guide. Once the possibl e harm is identified, self- protection should be implemented us ing time, distance and shielding. This module clearly divides terrorist incident s into six distinct areas. Responders must realize that any one terrorist incident may involve multiple categories. All personnel will need to adapt to the situation as necessary. Areas of terrorism response not discussed in this program are hostage and barricade situations. In such cases, a ll responders should coordinate re sponses in the context of a unified response in order to ensure the safety of all persons involved. MODULE 3: SCENE CONTROL TERMINAL OBJECTIVE The students will be able to define scene control issues involving isolation, evacuation and perimeter control associated with terrorist incidents. ENABLING OBJECTIVES The students will: 1. Identify unique challenges that may confront responders when attempting to implement scene control. 2. State what hazard and risk components in fluence public protection considerations. 3. Describe what resources should be utilized to maintain perimeter security at a terrorist incident. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-2 INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS Approaching a criminal event that has been cr eated by an act of terrorism presents unique challenges to the responder. To effectivel y implement scene control and ensure public safety, emergency responders must quickly a nd accurately evaluate the incident area and determine the severity of danger. Once the magn itude of the incident is realized, attempts to isolate the danger can begin. Establishing control (work) zones early will enhance public protection efforts and better facilitate medical treatment efforts. Initially, when response resources are limited, isolating the hazard area and controlling a mass exodus of panicked and contaminated pe ople will likely overwhelm the best efforts of first arriving responders. Responders must use any and all available resources in an effective and efficient manner in order to prepare the scene for ongoing operations. Responders must be aware that terrorists may still be lurking nearby waiting for responders to arrive. In fact, the responders could be the actual target. Terrorists may also be among the injured. If this is suspected, initia l scene control will likely be delayed and dictated by law enforcement activities. As in all hazardous situations, self-protection is a top priority. A responder who becomes a victim only adds to the burden on available resources. Responder must anticipate the potential for multiple hazard locations . Responders may have to define outer and inner operational perimeters. There may exist several hazards within the outer perimeter that must be isolated, especially when victims are scattered throughout the boundaries of the incident, or multiple targets contain dangers. Multiple hazards can include secondary devices, multiple release points of biological or chemical agents, or even possible sniper locations. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-3 Controlling the scene, isolating hazards and attempting to conduct contro lled evacuations will be resource intensive. Inordinate s ecurity may be needed for the event, so responders should request a dditional assistance early. After a bombing, access to the s cene may be limited due to rubble or debris. Police activity may also interfere with establis hing access and exit avenues for operations. Another problem may involve large numbers of contaminated victims and would-be rescuers moving in and out of the exclusi on zone in an uncontrolled manner. In chemical, biological and nuclear incidents, secondary contamination is a major risk factor. PERIMETER CONTROL Establishing Perimeter Control Perimeter control at terrorist incidents can be established by following recognized methods or standard operating procedures. Maintaining control of the perimeter may be difficult due to the design of the terrorist or panic among the victims. Recognizing and evaluating dangers is critical to implementing perimeter control. Adequately evaluating potential harm will guide decisions and considerations for \"stand- off\" distances, or establishing \"work zones.\" In order to perform this task efficiently and effectively, you should first take time to perform an adequate size-up of the situation. When initially determining your operating perime ter, it is better to overestimate the size of the perimeter than to underestimate. Once a perimeter is establis hed, it is often easier to reduce the perimeter instead of attempti ng to push the public and the press back to increase it after ope rations are set up. Depending on the size and complexity of the incident, the boundaries may need to be divided or identified as having \"outer \" and \" inner \" perimeters . The outer perimeter is the most distant control point or boundary of the incident. It is used to restrict all public access to the in cident. For example, the outer perimeter established after the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Fede ral Building in Oklahoma City enclosed 20 square blocks. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-4 The inner perimeter isolates known hazards within the ou ter perimeter. It is often used to control movement of responders. An ex ample of inner perimeters would be a case where following an explosion, several suspicio us parcels are sighted. The locations of these items would be isolated until such tim e as specialists had rendered the area safe. There are several types of terrorist incident s that may require outer and inner perimeter controls. Incidents involving improvised explosive devices should always have responders thinking about secondary devices. Use inner perimeters to control access to any suspicious area. In cases involving chemical or biological dispersion devices , you may need to use inner perimeters to isolate areas of high suspect contamination as well as possible secondary devices. In cases of radioactive contamination , inner perimeters may be necessary to isolate possible areas of high contamination until specialists with radiation meters have determined th e actual level of danger to responders. Perimeter Control Considerations Perimeter control may be influenced by a variety of factors. They should all be considered and weighed in relation to each ot her when attempting to determine your next course of action. The amount and type of resources on-hand will provide a rough estimate of what it is possible to accomplish. The capability of available resources must also be considered. People should not attempt actions beyond their training. The ability of the resources to self-protect is a related factor. No matter how well personnel are trained, if they are unable to properly protect themselves, they cannot function in a hazardous environment. The size and configuration of the incident , as well as the stability of the incident will also come into play. These factors are the same whether you ar e dealing with a non-criminal hazardous materials incident or a terrorist attack. Never lose sight of th e fact that the behavior of a material is not determined by whether the release was accidental or deliberate. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-5 Establish the Standard \"Control Zones\" As with any hazardous materials incident, you should establish the standard control zones within the outer perimeter. These include the: hot (exclusion) zone; warm zone; and cold (support) zone ACCESS CORRIDOR DECONTAMINATION CORRIDORCOMMAND POST WIND DIRECTION SAFE REFUGE AREAINCIDENT SITEWARM ZONE WARM ZONEHOT ZONECOLD ZONE Mapping Perimeter and Control Zones Because of the potential for secondary and tertiary events, the perimeter and control zones should be mapped. If the incidents escalate, boundaries can be expanded using established reference points that are familiar to on-scene responders. Mapping components should include the topography of the area, and any structures or landmarks . Access and egress points should be clearly marked, as should perimeter boundaries . Responders using detection paper Detection and Monitoring Equipment Using detection and monitoring equipment to substantiate effective perimeter and work zone boundaries is limited. Responders must attempt to identify \"clean\" areas as well as hazardous areas. This is usually accomplished by using detection and monitoring equipment while protected by appropriate personal protective equipment. However, equipment designed to detect hazardous materials may not be immediately available to first responders. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-6 Some detection methods include colormetric tubes, detector kits and detection tic kets. These methods typically include some sort of chemical that turns color when exposed to a specific agent or class of hazard. Detection Paper A device which can perform multiple analyses with colormetric tubes Colormetric tube Biological assays are a means of testing the behavi or of an unknown sample against a specific organism. This is often used to te st for biological agents of various types. Electronic meters may be used to test for vari ous chemicals and radioactivity. As opposed to chemical and/ or biological detectors, radiological detection equipment is often available through hospitals or civil defense organizations. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-7 In most cases, the responder will have to establish the perimeter by observing the scene for outward warning indicators . Developing the ability to recognize those indicators is a major part of this course. Isolation / Stand-off Distance Considerations. The first consideration is to identify the pr oblem from incident information and outward warning signs and detection clues. Incident information refers to information provided pr ior to the first responder arriving on the scene. This information can include written or verbal wa rnings and dispatch information. Outward warning signs and detection clues are collected during incident size-up operations. Decision making for isolation is based upon four main factors. You should first consider the potential of harm to life, critical systems and propert y. If the potential harm is great, drastic measure may be called for. Physical factors such as the topography and meteorological factors should also be considered. Wind direction, time of day, and impending weather should all be taken into account. Lastly, responders must always consider the resources available to implement tactical operations. Consider how to use availabl e resources to achieve tactical goals. When making decisions concerning isolation and stand-off distances, access reference materials such as the North American Emergency Response Guidebook (NAERG) to determine initial isolatio n and protection distances. When limited information is available pertaining to the agent, Guide 111 in the NAERG recommends minimal isolation distances of 50 to 100 meters (160 to 330 ft.) in all directions. When responders suspect radioactive materi als, the use of appropriate detection equipment is essential in determining isol ation distances. Monitoring for radioactive materials at a bombing event should be done ro utinely. Monitoring is the only way to detect the presence of radiation on the scene. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-8 Activity 3.1 Special Delivery Purpose The purpose of this activity is to identify the c oncerns responders s hould consider when faced with a potentially suspect incident involving clues to a specific class of hazard. Directions to Students 1. An emergency call is received from y our town's U.S. Post Office reporting an explosion. Responders arri ve on the scene and discover several postal workers suffering from minor injuries. The workers re port that a loud explosion occurred in the parcel package section which scatte red small debris in all directions. 2. During your initial investig ation, the postal supervisor ad vises you that twenty three workers were inside the building at the time of the explosion. You discover broken pieces of glass in the area where the bl ast occurred as well as a piece of paper displaying a symbol similar to that shown below: 3. Answer the questions below and re cord your answers on a flip chart. 4. Prepare to present you r findings to the group. Questions 1. What are the primary concerns at this point in the incident that need to be addressed by responders on the scene. 2. What secondary concerns should be considered at this event. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-9 PUBLIC PROTECTION CONSIDERATIONS Overview Public safety will largely depend on the ability of responders to effectively conduct a hazard and risk analysis of the affected popul ation. The same basic strategies used by responders to protect the public during a hazar dous materials incident can be applied to a terrorist event. First arrivi ng responders may be required to make rapid decisions that apply to implementing public protection measures because of escalating dangers. This being the case, those responders will need to base decisions on information gathered during the primary size-up. This can be a challenging task at any significant incident when so many demands are placed upon fi rst arriving units. Remember that size-up is a continuous process of gathering information and factoring that information into making the best decision for a particular point in time. During a large scale B-NICE event, consider the follo wing options in defining your approach to protecting the public. Evacuation of all threatened populations. Protect-in-place for all. Combination of evacuation and protect-in-place by evacuating some populations and protecting others in-place. Evacuation Evacuating the public from danger is a decision ba sed on information that indicates the public is at a greater risk by remaining in or near-by the event area. There are several categories of information that may influence your decision to evacuate. You should determine the degree or severity of public dangers or threats as estimated by your hazards and risk analysis. Determine the number of individuals or population area affected by the danger. (This can be determined by using the recommended isolation distances found in the NAERG.) Identify the availability of the resources needed to evacuate the affected population. These resources may include additional fi re/EMS/police personnel, school buses, privately-owned vehicles or public / mass transit. Identify the availability of resources needed to notify the public and provide instructions before and during the evacuation. These may include the use of local media radio and television, mobile public address sy stems and door-to-door contact. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-10 Identify safe passage and refuge areas for the evacuees. In order to do this, you should consider several factors. Evacuation route security should be a major factor. Law enforcement agencies should control all routes of tr avel and provide security at dest ination points so these areas do not become additional targets for terrorists. Also, al ternative shelters and travel routes should be prepared in case the primary areas become endangered. Authorities should determine the appropriate opportunity to conduct the evacuation. Recognizing when the opportunity is availabl e will involve a risk assessment taking into account ongoing law enforcement activities and uncontrolled hazards such as the presence of unexploded bombs or airborne chemical agents. Always anticipate delays when planning the evacuation. Responders must attempt to consider the special needs of the evacuees. A terrorist incident is likely to instill tremendous fear in the affected population. Evacuees should be be provided a continuous flow of accurate information regarding the event and information pertaining to mitigation and recovery efforts. Protect-In-Place Protection-in-place involves deciding to allow the affected population to remain within the confines of the shelter th ey occupy. The decision to do so, like evacuation, is based upon the hazard and risk analysis of the even t. In principle, if the presenting and anticipated dangers to the pub lic are determined to be le ss by having them remain in- place, rather than evacuate, then do so. In certain situations (like airborne chem ical hazards or line-of-sight exposure to explosives) when the best decision is to al low the public to remain in-place, remember that as long as there remains a danger, hazard s and risk must be continuously evaluated. Estimate the degree of potential harm due to the duration of exposure and severity of the harm being exposed to. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-11 Danger of evacuation vs. protect-in-place The decision must be made on which is the lesser degree of danger to the public, the tim e it takes to evacuate to a safe refuge (coupled with exposure concerns while en route), and the potential risks of remaining in the shelter currently occupied. Availability of resources Are there sufficient resources on-hand to carry out an evacuation in a reasonable length of time? Can you do so while avoiding unacceptable exposure to the dangers? If not, protect-in-place may be the more viable option. Level of public education and/or training Is the public properly traine d to effectively implement protect-in-place? Do they understand what materials may be used to create a 'safe room' in their homes? You may wish to consider comm unity training as an option. Combining evacuation with protect-in-place There may be circumstances when using both evacuation and protection-in-place would be appropriate. For example, when respons e resources cannot im mediately support the evacuation needs of large populations. Responde rs may consider providing instructions to people more distant to the dangers, a dvising them to remain indoors until further directives are given. People in the path of greater danger coul d be systematically evacuated in concert with available resources. Your jurisdiction may already have guidelines or procedures relating to public protection scenarios, if so, follow them, if not consider establishing methods to address these issues that will support your operation. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-12 SCENE SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS Once the incident commander has assumed site control responsibilities, all entry and exit routes from hazardous areas must be effec tively managed regardless of who has been tasked with the responsibilit y. Conventional methods of isolating unstable conditions, designating access points, establishing contam ination reduction corridors and organized evacuations, should all be considered essentia l functions under site control and security responsibilities. Site Security / Agency Responsibility The agency assigned or designate d with site security respon sibilities will likely vary according to available resources (early in th e incident a combination of police and fire personnel may jointly perform scene control a nd hazard isolation duties). Any time there is ongoing or unstable criminal activity presen t, law enforcement officials should dictate security measures for scene control. As the incident becomes more defined and more stable (intermediate phase), the shift from a combination of police and fire personnel in control of the perimeter, should begin to transition to all law enforcement. If the incident is of such magnitude that response activities may continue for days, the use of military units should be considered for perimeter security and control. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS When you approach any type of suspicious incident, you should do so in a cautious manner with all senses alert for warning signs and detection clues. Always approach the scene utilizing protective clothing and equipment supplied by your agency. As with all incidents, self- protection is your first priority. If you're not properly protected, you will be unable to effectively function. Be alert for outward warning signs that may indicate the type of danger present. Just because an explosion was reported, do not discount the possibility of chemical, biological, or radiological hazards. Pay attention to casualties without apparent physical tr auma as well as signs and symptoms indicating chemical exposure. In the next module, we will explore specific symptoms of various agents, but a major hint of chemical exposure can be derived from the conjunction of multiple casualt ies and little physical injury. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-13 Obvious signs of criminal activity , such as weapons on the scene, may indicate a perpetrator among the victims or lurking nearby. Coordina te your efforts with law enforcement agencies. Pre-incident verbal or written warnings should always be taken seriously. Properly Stage Vehicles During emergency conditions (esp ecially if the incident has created large scale public chaos and panic) responders must realize when approaching the event, presenting conditions may not provide the most ideal locations to stage vehicles and apparatus. When practical, position first-in vehicles and responders upwind and uphill . Direct supporting responders to approach upwind and uphill. Avoid 'stacking' vehicles where they interfere with each other's evacuation route. Also avoid line-of-sight staging with suspected explosive device s. Strictly enforce staging instructions. Avoid Vapor Clouds, Mist and Unknown Liquids If it's unknown, it's unsafe. Protect yourself. Assign an Observer Initially, assign at least one res ponder to observe on-going activities surrounding your operating position. This person should be alert for criminal activities and the pot ential for secondary events. The individual assigned to observati on duty should closely observe the entire scene for potential armed a ssault (snipers), containers which could hold secondary devices (bags, boxes, briefcases, etc.), vehicles out-of-place, hazardous materials co ntainers, or other anomalies. Suspicious areas should be identified and isolated until cleared by appropriate authorities. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-14 Plan Tentative Escape Routes and Refuge Assembly Points. Coordinate with law enforcement and other local agencies to identify safe escape routes and where possible refugees can go. It's far be tter to not need your plan than to not have it when you do. Prepare for Emergency Decontamination on Arrival and During All Phases of the Incident. Your agency should have pre-defined plans for emergency decon of large (mass decon) and small groups of contaminated personnel. These plans should be developed and maintained with the assistance of local medical and legal authorities in order to provide technically correct decon without incurring potential liability for privacy violations. Performing emergency decontamination Secondary contamination of responders and other members of the public is always a concern. Remember to treat all members of th e public with proper regard for privacy as well as safety when performing decontam ination operations. Responders who do not have been subject to lawsu its and adverse judgments. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-15 Activity 3.2 Explosive Feature Purpose The purpose of this activity is for you to r ecognize which scene cont rol measures should be implemented at the early stage of a terr orist event. This activity will include identifying challenges which are unique to re sponders attempting to control the scene and what resources will be needed to support and ma intain that effort. You will also be asked to list various types of ha zards and risks that may influence public protection considerations. Directions to Students 1. Listen to the case as presented by the instructor. 2. In your small groups, use the map printed on the next page of your manual to determine where you will place various elements of the response including the command post, triage area, and safe refuge location. Also identify where you would stage incoming units. 3. List three to five scene cont rol considerations appropriate to this scenario and indicate which of the control measures are unique to possible terrorist events. 4. Record your decisions on a flip chart. 5. Have one member of your group present your findings. Case: You are responding to a reported explosion at the multiplex cinema located near a large shopping mall. The cinema building is detached from the mall but located in the same parking lot. The dispatch center has advised you of numerous reports of injuries in the lobby and occupants evacu ating the building. SCENE CONTROL SM 3-16 Activity 3.2 Explosive Feature Theater StreetWind Direction Shopping Center ExplosionDead End SCENE CONTROL SM 3-17 Summary Terrorist incidents will likely present unique challenges to public safety responders when attempting to implement scene control measures. Responders must realize the importance of initiating appropriate scene co ntrol early in the event. Although the magnitude of the incident may seem beyond th e capabilities of the first arriving units, efforts to gain control must start immedi ately, regardless of the resources on hand. Equally important is the need for responde rs to recognize outward warning signs on arrival. Responders who perform scene control tasks must incorporate full use of protective clothing and equipment until such time as the incident is well defined (by work zones) or determined to be safe. MODULE 4: Tactical Considerations TERMINAL OBJECTIVE The students will be able to recognize, define, describe, and recommend tactical objectives for Biological, Nuclear, Incendi ary, Chemical, and Ex plosives (B-NICE) incidents. ENABLING OBJECTIVES The students will: 1. Identify outward warning si gns of B-NICE incidents. 2. Define and explain tactical cons iderations associated with acts of terrorism involving biological, nuclear, incendiary, chemical, and explosive materials. 3. Identify and list specialized e quipment needed to support ta ctical operations involving B-NICE incidents. 4. Given a case study, identify tactical c onsiderations for each incident category. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-2 BIOLOGICAL AGENTS Introduction to biological agents Biological agents can be either disease-causing organism s (bacteria, rickettsia or viruses) or toxins produced by living organisms. Biological agents are genera lly split into three groups. Bacteria and Rickettsia \u2014 Single-celled organisms which cause a variety of diseases in animals, plants, and humans. They may also produce extremely potent toxins inside the human body. Although true cells, rick ettsia are smaller than bacteria and live inside individual host cells. The Anthrax bacillus is one of the best- known weaponized bacteria Viruses \u2014 Much smaller than bacteria, and us e host cells' reproductive mechanism to make additional viruses. Toxins \u2014 Potent poisons produced by a variet y of living organisms including bacteria, plants, and animals. How are biological agents disseminated There are a wide variety of means to dissemi nate biological agents. We'll look at some, but not all, methods here. One of the most common and effective methods of disseminating biol ogical agents is through aerosol dispersion to produce an airborne hazard. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-3 Crop sprayer attached to helicopter Spray attachment for hose, tank or compressor An agricultural sprayer can be used to spra y just about anything. A typical commercial unit has dozens of nozzles which produce a pa rticle size between 2 and 6 microns. This is an ideal size for spreading biological agents such as anthrax spores. There are no restrictions on sale or purchase of these uni ts and they are sold all over the world for agricultural use. Another means of disseminating biological ag ents is by contaminating food, water or medicine affecting those who ingest the material. Terrorists sprayed salmonella on salad bars in the No rthwest which caused over 700 people to become ill. These same terrorists could have used ricin or some other deadly agent that could have killed those whom the salmonella merely made ill. Another means of exposing a target to a biological agent is through dermal exposure by direct contact or injection. On e recent incident illustrates an example of this technique. Georgi Markov was a Bulgarian journalist who wr ote in 1968 about corruption in high government offices in Bulgaria. He was forced to flee Bulgaria for Italy and eventually England. While living in London he continued his reports on Bulgaria and its problems as a reporter for Radio Free Europe. One mo rning while waiting for a bus, he was jabbed in the thigh with an umbrella. His health quickl y deteriorated and he died four days later. An autopsy revealed a small metal pellet near the wound. After anal ysis, it was found to have contained less than .01 grams of ricin. This tiny amount was more than enough to kill him. As discussed in Module 2, focused response and public health emergencies are two types of incidents which may indicate a biological agent. A focused response incident involves a single, know n point-source of contamination. One example of this would be an individual who stands up in a restaurant or theater, announces that the glass vial in his/her hand contains anthrax, and then breaks the vial. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-4 The results of spraying salmonella on salad ba rs in the Northwest is an example of a public health emergency . Hospital emergency rooms and clinics began reporting excessive numbers of patients with symptoms of food poisoning. It took skilled medical detective work to finally trace the illnesses b ack to contaminated salad bars and then to trace the contamination to a religious group which had been having a dispute with the local town. Potential bacteria or rickettsia Anthrax Plague Tularemia Q Fever Anthrax Anthrax is an acute bacteriological disease which can manifest itself as either a skin infection contagious by direct skin contact only, or in it's much more deadly inhalational form. The skin infection starts with a gradual itching and then gradually turns into a depressed lesion whic h becomes black. This form is pictured at the right. This fo rm may turn septic and spread throughout the body via the bloodstream and lymph node. Untreated cutaneous anthrax has a fatality rate of 5-20%. Anthrax Infection Inhalational anthrax has two phases. After an incubation period of one to six days, the initial symptoms include malaise, feve r, fatigue, non-productive cough, and chest discomfort. The second phase develops s uddenly with the development of severe shortness of breath and cyanosis . Shortly after this phase, the terminal phase develops and typically lasts less than 24 hours us ually ending in death despite therapy. Plague Pneumonic plague is the airborne form of the so-called 'black plague'. Symptoms include a cough with bloody sputum, fever, and pathogenic (dead) tissue in the lymph nodes. It is rapidly fa tal and highly contagious. Initial infections of pl ague are usually due to a bite from a flea carrying the disease. This leads to bubonic plague , which is recognized by swollen and tender lymph glands. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-5 Bubonic plague may prog ress to either the septicemic form where the blood carries the infection throughout the body and/or the pneumonic form in which the lungs become involved. Untreated septicemic and pneumonic pl ague are invariably fatal. The greatest public danger is from pneumonic plague because the victim produces an infectious aerosol which is highly contagious. This is the form that causes epidemics among the human population. For more information, you should access texts such as Control of Communicable Diseases Manual , published by the American Public Health Association. Tularemia Three to five days after exposure to aerosol Tu laremia, there is an abrupt onset of fever, chills, headaches, muscular pain (myalgia ), etc., with non-produc tive cough. It can be fatal, but is not c onsidered contagious. Q fever Q fever is caused by a rickettsia-type organism and is rarely cont agious. Symptoms include those commonly associated with the flu, acute hepatitis a nd pneumonia. Other symptoms are inflammation of the brai n and the three membranes or meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord (men ingoencephalitis), inflammation of the membranes surrounding the heart (pericarditis), and inflammation of the myocardium or muscular middle layer of the heart (m yocarditis). Normally not fatal. Ebola Virus Potential viral agents Viruses are different from bacteria in that they grow and reproduce by hijacking the mechanism of indivi dual cells and forcing those cells to produce additional viruses. This re sults in an infection that may be more difficult to treat than one caused by bacteria. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-6 Smallpox Smallpox is infectious as an aerosol. It is highly contagious and has a high mortality rate. After a seven to seventeen day incuba tion, the pox-like rash starts and patients may present fever, muscle rigidity and shivering, malaise, headaches, vomiting, and other symptoms. Scabs start forming eight to fourte en days after the onset of the disease and leave depressed pigmented scars. Smallpox is officially extinct outside of the laboratory. There are two stocks of smallpox virus known to exist; one in Ru ssia and the other in the labor atories of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) VEE is a mildly contagious disease with an incubation period of one to four days. Symptoms usually include fever, headaches , myalgia and vomiting. They may also include drowsiness, chills, sore thro at and diarrhea. Can be fatal. Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHF) Hemorrhagic viruses include Ebola, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, the Hantaviruses and se veral others. Symptoms include fever, muscular pain (myalgia), headaches, pr ostration, hemorrhage, capillary leaks, hypotension, and shock. They are considered moderately contagious but often fatal. Potential toxins Toxic substances are produced by almost every major category of living organism known. Many of the most deadly are produced by fungi, flowering plants and bacteria. Botulinum toxins consist of seven related neurotoxins produced by the Clostridium Botulinum bacteria. They are some of the most potent toxins known and cause life-t hreatening paralysis leading to progressive weakness of extremities and respiratory muscles leading to respiratory failure. Symptoms can occur as quickly as 24 hours after ingestion. Growing Botulinus Bacterial Staphylococcal Enterotoxins commonly cause food pois oning after the toxin is produced in and ingested from improperly hand led foods. Inhalation of aerosolized toxin can lead to septic shock and death TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-7 Ricin is a water-soluble constituent of castor beans. The wash from preparing castor oil contains up to five percent ricin. As little as a milligram (1/1000 of a gram) can kill an individual. Symptoms from inhalation of ricin include necrotizing (tissue-killing) lesions (injury or abnormality) of upper and lower airway, necrotizing pneumonia and pulmonary edema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs). Symptoms from ingestion or intramuscular injection include gastric bleeding, liver necrosis (death), lymphoid necrosis, spleenitis (infla mmation of the spleen), and pulmonary congestion. Note: Ricin was patented by the United States Army in the 1960s. Castorbean Plant (Ricinus communis) Mycotoxins (Trichothecene Mycotoxins) include more than 40 toxins produced by various fungi. Some of these toxins are extremely stable and easy to produce and spread as aerosols. Symptoms can include weight loss, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, diffuse hemorrhage, and skin inflammation. Some may cause death. Outward warning signs and de tection clues for the pres ence of a biological agent There are a number of outward warning signs and detection clues which can alert the responder to the possible presence of biological agents both prior to an incident and at the incident scene. Verbal or written threats should always be taken seri ously. They may provide invaluable clues to the agent and its hazards. Suspicious bombing incidents that do not cause much blas t or fire damage may have been detonated for the purpose of disseminating a biological agent. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-8 Watch for abandoned spray devices out of place for the environment. They may be key evidence in the eventual investigation, as well as a clue to the type of hazards you face. Containers from laborator y or biological supply houses, biohazard, culture or culture media labels are all indicators of a possible biological agent hazard. Clandestine Laboratory Detection methods for biological agents On-site detection of biological agents is curren tly not practical for most first responders. Typically, samples are collected using va rious techniques incl uding bioassay, mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, and culture of living organisms. Bioassay may be used for living organisms a nd some toxins. Bioassay techniques involve taking an unknown sample and comparing its effect on an organism against that of a known substance. Field-de ployable, rapid assays are need ed for on-site diagnosis of BW agent exposure. Researchers within the U.S. Army and Navy laboratories are developing assays for botulinum toxin, ricin, plague, brucellosis, Q fever, anthrax, and several viruses. Rapid diagnostic assays we re made available to Theater Area Medical Laboratories during Operations Desert Shield and Storm, al ong with drugs, vaccines, and laboratory equipment. Mass Spectrometers ionize a sample and then apply electric and magnetic fields to the charged particles (ions). Analysis is derived from measuring the behavior of the ions when exposed to the fields. There are several types of mass analyzers, but any more technical discussion would be far beyond the scope of this course. Some mass spectrometers and gas chromatographs are designed for field use . TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-9 Chromatographic analysis of residue for toxins i nvolves placing an unknown residue in either a single solvent or solvent blend and then comparing the behavior of the dissolved material when subjected to certain pressures and tests against that of known substances. There are several types of chromatogra phy used, involving both liquid and gaseous materials, but all follow the same basic principles. Mass spectrometry and gas chomatography are often combined into a technique often referred to as \"mass spec./G.C.\" Proper self-protection techniques Proper self-protection technique s should include respiratory protection, splash protection (boots and gloves) and Emergency Medical Se rvice (EMS) universal precautions coupled with body substance isolati on. Additional material may be found in Appendix H. Treatment procedures Treatment procedures for casualties should generally follow this sequence according to local protocols: Decontamination Patient Management Transport to Medical Facility Definitive Care Decontamination covers a broad scope of activities. Victim decon is performed to prepare contaminated victims for transport to medical care facilities. The overall procedure is to flush with water, remove contaminated clothing, flush again, cover the victim, and transport to medical care. A second form of emergency decon is Mass decon which is designed for addressing large numbers of contaminate victims. In this case contaminated clothing is removed and the vi ctim is flushed with water before being covered and sent to medical facilities. Responder decon is the standard decon of responders who have been prot ected by appropriate ppe. Foll ow your local protocols for this tasks.

TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-12 Activity 4.1 Powder in the Court (cont'd) Case: At 9:00 a.m. on Monday the town emerge ncy communications center received an emergency call from a bailiff at the local co urthouse. The bailiff reported that powdery material was coming out of the ventilation sy stem in the courthouse building. When he went to investigate he found two individuals pouring a white powder from a pint jar into the air ducts. He placed the s ubjects under arrest. While the bailiff questioned the subjects they stated that everyone in the courthouse was going to die. They further stated they made the material themselves using b eans and directions in a book. The bailiff immediately evacuated all 150 people fr om the courthouse and called the town emergency number for help. The town dispatcher sent two law enforcemen t officers, a fire truc k and ambulance to the scene. Enroute the report from the bailiff was provided to the responders. Questions 1.

TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-14 NUCLEAR TERRORISM Introduction There are three potential forms of nuclear terrorism. they include: Detonation of a fission de vice (\"atomic bomb\"); Release and dispersal of nuclear material s by packing the nuclear material around a conventional explosive device; and Large-scale conventional explosive device detonated in proximity to a target containing large amounts of nuclear materi als (power plant or similar facility). Detonation of a fission device An unlikely scenario The potential for encountering a nuclear bomb is minimal. Terrorists would find it extremely difficult to build or acquire and use such a device for several reasons. In order to build a device, substantial quant ities of weapons-grade fissionable materials are needed. There are three potential sour ces of fissionable materials - shipments of spent nuclear fuel, acquisition through black ma rkets and theft from secured facilities. Materials acquired from shipments of spent nuclear fuel or on the black market are unlikely to be pure weapons grade material and will need further refining, which requires specialized knowledge, skill, money, and equipm ent. Theft from s ecured facilities is extremely difficult and often suicidal. The la rgest seizure of weapons-grade Uranium as of 1995 was 2.72 kilograms (about 6 pounds), which should not be enough to build a fission bomb. Once materials are obtained, they are very difficult to transport. A given volume of uranium weighs about 18.7 times as much as water. Therefore, a gallon jug filled with powdered uranium would wei gh about 156 lb., not counting the shielding required for safe transport! TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-15 Building a nuclear device is much more th an assembling the requi site quantity of fissionable material. The purified material mu st be machined into precise shapes and exact quantities of explosives packed around th e fissionable material in a geometry that ensures the proper creation of a critical mass for the short time necessary for the reaction to occur. If this is not done, the device wi ll simply scatter the fissionable material over the area instead of detonating. Theft of an operational nuclear device would be even more difficult than acquiring the materials to build one. Strict national and in ternational security measures make it very unlikely that an entire bomb could be acqui red. Even if such a device was stolen, all Western and former Soviet nuclear devices incorporate the Permissible Action Links (PAL) security system which will render the weapon safe unless the correct multi-digit code is entered. The Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD) Using conventional explosives to spread radio active contamination is far more likely than an actual nuclear detonation. In this scenario, radioactiv e materials are packed around conventional explosives. When the expl osive device detonates, it disperses the radioactive material over a wide area. De pending upon the material, both long-term and short-term hazards can be generated with such a device. Immediate dangers include radiation burns and acute poisoning. Long-te rm hazards include various forms of cancer and contamination of ground water. This can lead to forced abandonment of large areas or even entire towns. The New York Times reported that on November 23, 1995, the Russian Independent Television Network was contacte d by a Chechan separatist or ganization and told of the location of a package in Ismailovsky Park in Moscow. The 30 pound package contained radioactive Cesium (a gamma ray source) and explosives. The device was rendered harmless before it could detonate. One reason that radiological dispersion is a far more likely scenario than nuclear detonation is that weapons grade fissionables are not required for th is type of device. Significant amounts of radioactive materials ar e used in a variety of industrial products, such as radiographic units used to test bridges, buildings, and other structures. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-16 A constant source of anxiety in today's world is the amount of radioactive material which may not be under proper control. This includes the remains of nuclear power plant incidents such as the Chernobyl disaster. The materials still present in the vicinity of that inci dent could provide a virtually unlimited source of radioactive materials for dispersion devices. Part of the Chernobyl complex Nuclear power plant Targeting Nuclear Facilities A third possible form of nuclear terrorism is to target a facility containing nuclear mate rials. This could be done by attacking a facility co ntaining large amounts of radiological material with c onventional explosives in the expectation that the resu lt would be widespread contamination. Outward warning signs and detection clues Outward warning indicators in clude placards, labels and specialized packaging. Re sponders should be well- acquainted with the standard radiation warning symbols and hazardous materials containers. For additional information, check the North American Emergency Response Guidebook . TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-17 Radiation detector with two probes Detection methods for nuclear contamination Electronic equipment will likely be the only means of testing an area for radiation. Properly trained responders should survey any incident scene with radiation detectors following a suspicious e xplosion or terrorist threat. There are many types of radiation detectors, including some which provide an audible warning if dangerous levels are detected. Even if a threat does not exp licitly mention radiation, a radi ological survey should still be done at any suspicious bombing incident. The terrorists may want to disguise the lasting threat of radioactive contamination by allo wing authorities to assume a conventional explosives incident. Self protection As discussed in Module 2, implement pers onal protection through time, distance and shielding. The primary protection against ha rmful radiation is to keep as much mass between yourself and the source as possible. Since Alpha radiation does not penetrate the skin, positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) will provide complete protection against this form of radiation. Treatment procedures for casualties Follow the same process of decontamination, patient management, transport to medical facilities (hospital), and definitive care fr om medical field as discussed earlier.

TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-18 Notifications Make appropriate notifications as indi cated in your local emergency plan. INCENDIARY DEVICES Introduction Incendiary devices have been used by terrorists for centuries. Fire is a flexible tool that is capable of causing property damage, loss of life, and sparking panic among the public. It will also continue to spread and do damage until all available fuel is consumed, or the fire is extinguished. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) has used incendiary devices throughout Europe for many years resulting in deaths, injuri es, and tremendous monetary losses. In the United States the use of incendiary de vices is on the rise. According to data from the FBI Bomb Data Center: Incendiary devices were used in approximate ly 20-25% of all bombing incidents in the United States. When used, incendiary devices ignited approximately 75% of the time; and Less than 5% of actual or attempted bombi ngs (including those i nvolving incendiaries) were preceded by a threat. The FBI Bomb Data Center is available on-lin e and is referenced in the bibliography for this manual. Classification of Incendiary Devices Incendiary devices can be classified in a num ber of ways. Two co mmon classifications are by triggering and delivery methods. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-19 Incendiary Devices Triggering Method Delivery Method Chemical ReactionElectronic IgnitionMechanical IgnitionHand- thrownStationary Self- Propelled Under triggering methodology there are several different means of initiating the incendiary reaction. Chemical reactions, includi ng burning fuses are a staple of the trade. Electronic ignition through a vari ety of relays, switches, and other devices is another means. Finally, mechanical ignition ma y be used to initiate the event. The types of delivery can include hand-thrown devices like molotov cocktails, stationary or planted devices, and self-p ropelled incendiaries like rocket s or flare gun projectiles. Components of incendiary devices Incendiary devices are composed of three components. An ignition source is needed to initiate the incendiary reaction. Combustible filler material provides the bulk of the material that actually ignites, while a housing or container is required to hold the filler. Results of a Molotov Cocktail Materials used to construct incendiary devices Incendiary devices may be constructed from a wide variety of materials. Some of the products which have been used to construct incendiary devices include: Roadway flares; Gasoline and motor oil; Light bulbs; TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM Common electrical components devices; Matches; Household chemicals; Fireworks; Propane and butane cylinders; and Plastic pipes, bottles and cans. Outward warning signs and indicators of incendiary use For those of you familiar with arson inves tigations, many of the detection clues for incendiary use will be very familiar. They include: Prior warning (phone calls); Multiple fire locations; Signs of accelerants; Containers from flammable liquids; Splatter patterns indicating a thrown device; Fusing residue; Signs of forced entry to the structure; and Common appliances out of place for the environment. These clues should simply be a signal fo r you, the responder, to take appropriate precautions to safeguard yourself and the public, and to start considering the incident as a potential crime scene. If you wish to become more i nvolved with incendiary devices and their use in criminal activities, you may wish to consider the Arson Curriculum offered by the National Fire Academy. Detection methods Various methods of detecting chemical residue indicating incendiary use are available including colormetric tubes, combustible gas meters, flame ionization detectors, trained dogs , and photoionization detectors. Photoionization detector TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-21 Self protection You should always approach the scene of a susp icious fire utilizing appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment. Do not handle any suspicious device. The devi ce may have failed to ignite or may be a secondary device timed to target responders. Avoid vapor clouds, mists, and liquids. If you don't know what it is, you can't be sure of being properly protected. Call for technical assistance. Treatment of casualties Except that decontamination may not be necessary, follow the same process of decontamination, patient management, transp ort to medical facili ties (hospital), and definitive care from medical field as discussed earlier. Additional Resources Local and state resources as indicated by your plan. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF). Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). All tactical considerations will be influen ced by local standard operating procedures. Local emergency responders at suspected in cendiary incidents shoul d be aware of basic crime scene considerations, such as re stricting access and preserving evidence. CHEMICAL AGENTS Introduction to Chemical Agents Chemical agents are substances wh ich can injure or kill through a variety of means. Some of those we will address in this section are also identified by military classification codes which give field personnel a quick reference to thei r characteristics and hazards. Chemical storage TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-22 Nerve agents are some of the most toxic known chem icals. They are hazardous in their liquid and vapor states and can cause death within minutes of exposure. Nerve agents, like their close relatives the organophosphorus pe sticides, inhibit acet ylcholinesterase in tissue, and their effects are caused by the resulting excess acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is the chemical that carries nerve im pulses from one neuron (nerve cell) to another. Acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme that remove s the acetylcholine after the impulse has been transmitted to prepare the junction (synapse) to transmit another impulse. Inhibiting acetylcholinesterase will prevent this junction from being cleaned, causes continual nerve impulses resulting in convulsions and other uncontrolled muscle reactions. Vesicants (blister agents) cause red skin (erythem a), blisters, irritation, damage to the eyes, respiratory damage and gastrointestinal effects. Their effect on exposed tissue is somewhat similar to that of a corrosi ve chemical like lye or a strong acid. Cyanides or blood agents include common industrial chemicals such as potassium cyanide, which can cause rapid respiratory arrest and death. Pulmonary or choking agents include common industria l chemicals such as chlorine, which can cause eye and airway irritati on, dyspnea, chest tightness, and delayed pulmonary edema. Irritants or riot control chemicals such as pepper spray cause burning and pain on exposed mucous membranes and skin, eye pa in and tearing, burning in the nostrils, respiratory discomfort, and ti ngling of the exposed skin. Dissemination methods An aerosol is defined as a suspension or dispersi on of small particles (solids or liquids) in a gaseous medium. Aerosol dissemina tion methods range from hand-held spray bottles and backpack pesticid e spray equipment to powered generators carried by trucks, ships and aircraft. Area contamination , such as spraying an area with a persistent liquid chemical can cause thousands of casualties thr ough inhalation or skin absorption. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-23 Nerve Agents Note: In the military classification of these nerv e agents, 'G' refers to German origination and the letter following the 'G' is derived from the name of the scientist primarily responsible for developing that chemical. Th e letter 'V' stands for 'venom' and the 'X' following the 'V' refers to a chemical series. Examples of and effects Exposure to these agents typica lly occurs through exposure to airborne vapors or direct skin contact with the liquid. Inhalation of vapor: A small exposure to vapor can cause pinpoint pupils (miosis), runny nose (rhinorrhea) and m ild difficulty breathing. Large exposure can, in addition, cause sudden loss of consciousness, convulsions, temporary breathing stoppage (apnea), flaccid paralysis, c opious secretions, and death. Liquids on skin. Depending on the degree of exposure, symptoms can range from localized sweating; nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of weakness to sudden loss of consciousness, seizures, breathing stoppage, copious secretions, paralysis, and death. VX is more persistent and harder to decontaminate from the skin than the other agents listed. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-24 Outward warning signs Outward warning signs include observation of symptoms such as miosis, runny noses, difficulty breathing, and uncontrolled muscle s and bodily functions. Victims may possibly report a fruity odor. Detection Detection is by means of: Detection papers such as M8 or M9; Colormetric tubes; Military detection kits; Pesticide tickets; and Electronic meters. Electronic detector Multiple colormetric tubes in a special sampling holder Using a detection kit Self protection Follow your department procedures for operati ng at the scene of a hazardous materials incident. If the material has not been positiv ely identified but is suspected to be nerve agent follow Guide 153 found in the North American Emergency Response Guidebook . Do not make entry into confining envir onments unless you have been appropriately trained and have the necessary equipment. Use time, distance and shielding to your maximum advantage. Pages 14-15 of the NAERG , include a table of placards and initial response guides for circumstances when an overall class of hazard has been identified, but not the particular substance. Guide 153 is indicated for class 6 poisons and toxins, which include the nerve agents. Antidotes to nerve agents incl ude Atropine and 2-PAM Chlori de. See your local medical services for further information. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-25 Vesicants (blister agents) Note: In the classification system devised for the mustard agents, the letter 'H' is derived from the German word for 'hot stuff'. The re st of the letters shoul d be self-evident. Examples of vesicants include: and Lewisite (L); Exposure and effects Exposure to vesicants can be th rough contact with either the liquid or vapor. The warmer the climate, the more easily the vapors are produced. As discussed earlier, both nerve agents and vessicants are liquid and must be properly weaponized by aerosolizing and/ or heating in order to pr oduce significant vapors. The primary effects of Mustard, Dis tilled Mustard and Nitrogen Mustards occur in the eye, airways, and skin. Absorbed mustard may produce effects in other bodily systems. Effects on the skin Reddening (Erythema) is the mildest and earliest form of skin injury appearing af ter exposure to mustard. It resembles sunburn, and is associated with itching or a burning, stinging pain. Erythema begins to appear in 2 to 24 hours after vapor exposure. Blistering appears later and can be quite severe. While the nerve agents act in a manner similar to that of pesticides, vesicants act more like strong acids or caustics in their effect on the victim. Blister agent victim from the Iran / Iraq war TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-26 Effects on the pulmonary system The primary airway lesion from mustard is necrosis (death) of the mucosa with later damage to the musculature of the airways if the inhalation expos ure is large. The common cause of death in mustard poisoning is respiratory failure. Effect on the eyes The eyes are the organs most sensitive to mustard vapor injury. The time between exposure and visible injury (laten t period) is shorter for eye inju ry than for skin injury. Effect on the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract The mucosa of the GI tract is very suscepti ble to mustard damage, either from systemic absorption or ingestion of the agent. However, reports of severe GI effects from mustard poisoning are relatively infrequent. Central nervous system (CNS) effects The CNS effects of mustard remain poorly de fined. Animal studies demonstrated that mustards (particularly the ni trogen mustards) are convulsants. There are several human case reports describing peopl e who were heavily exposed experiencing neurological effects within several hours of exposure just prior to death. Reports from WWI and Iran described people exposed to small amounts of mustard, as appearing sluggish, apathetic, and lethargic. Lewisite The effects of Lewisite are similar to that of the mustards, but far more immediate. Lewisite causes immediate pain or irritation of skin and mucous membranes. Delayed symptoms, including. erythema and blisters on the skin and eye, as well as airway damage, develop later in a manner similar to that caused by the mustards. Lewisite has not been known to have been used on humans. There is an antidote for Lewisite called The British Anti-Lewisite Cream . This is a military product, but may be available to responder organizations. Outward warning signs Outward warning signs include observation of blistering and other external symptoms. Victims may report an odor of garlic. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-27 Detection methods Detection of vesicants is similar to that of nerve agents in that you can use detection papers such as M8 and M9, military detection kits, colormetric tubes, and electronic meters. Responder checking for chemical agents Self protection Follow your department procedures for operati ng at the scene of a hazardous materials incident. If the material has not been pos itively identified but vesicants are suspected, follow Guide 153 found in the North American Emergency Response Guidebook as discussed earlier. Do not make entry into confined spaces unless you have been properly trained and have the necessary equipment. Use time, distance and shielding to your maximum advantage. Cyanides (Blood Agents) Examples of these agents include Hydrogen Cyanide (AC) and Cyanogen Chloride (CK) Exposure and effects Exposure can be through contact with either liquids or vapors. Due to the high degree of volatility of these compounds, the liquid rapidly vaporizes and disperses. Hemoglobin is the iron-based compound in the bl ood that carries oxygen to the cells and carbon dioxide back to the lungs for dispos al. Cyanides reac t with the iron in hemoglobin and prevent it from properly taking up and dispensing oxygen and carbon dioxide. The effect is the same as asphyxiat ion, but more sudden. Symptoms are few. Exposure to high concentration, can lead to seizures, resp iratory and cardiac arrest. Outward warning signs Outward warning signs include victims showing great difficulty in breathing and onset of cardiac symptoms. Some victims may repor t an odor of bitter or burnt almonds. Detection methods are similar to those discussed earlier, including detection kits, colormetric tubes, and electronic meters TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-28 Self protection Follow your department procedures for operati ng at the scene of a hazardous materials incident. If you have positively identified the substa nce as Cyanogen Choride, use Guide 125. If the material is posit ively identified as Hydrogen Cyanide, use Guide 117. If a blood agent is suspected, but not positively identified, use Guide 123. There is an antidote kit for blood agents called the Pasadena Cyanide Antidote Kit. Pulmonary (Choking) Agents Examples of these agents include Chlorine (CL) and Phosgene (CG). Exposure and effects Chlorine was the first battlef ield poison gas used. Germ any started utilizing it during World War I. Exposure to pulmonary agen ts is through inhalation of vapors. The primary effect is pulmonary edema . The victim's lungs fill w ith fluid and they develop severe pneumonia. Symptoms include eye a nd airway irritation, dys pnea, chest tightness, and delayed pulmonary edema. Outward warning signs Outward warning signs include observation of pulmonary distress among victims. They may also report odors such as chlorine, bleach or swimming pool odors (chlorine) and the odor of newly-mown hay or grass (phosgene). Detection methods In a manner similar to nerve agents and other chemicals, there are military detection kits, colormetric tubes, and electronic mete rs which will detect these agents. Self protection Follow your department procedures for operati ng at the scene of a hazardous materials incident. If the material has been identifie d as Chlorine, use Guide 124. If the material has been identified as Phosgene, use Guide 125. If you suspect a choking agent, but do not have positive identification, use Guide 123. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-29 Irritants Examples of gas); CN (mace); and OC (pepper spray). Exposure and effects Riot control agents, also called irritants, lacrimators, and tear gas, produce transient discomfort and eye closure to render the reci pient temporarily incapable of fighting or resisting. Exposure is thr ough inhalation and absorption of small smoke-like particles suspended in the air. Despite the common names, these are not gasses. Their major activity is to cause pain, burning, or disc omfort on exposed mucous membranes and skin; these eff ects occur within seconds of exposure, but seldom persist more than a few minutes after exposure has ended. Outward warning signs Outward warning signs include observation of cl assic 'tear gas' symptoms among victims. They may report multiple odors including hair spray and pepper due the variety of propellants used to dispense these agents. Detection In enclosed atmospheres colorimetric tube s can be used if implemented quickly to determine the presence of mace or pepper spray. Mace is the easiest of the two agents to detect. By using a colorimetric tube fo r chloroformates, mace can be detected. Colorimetric tubes for acetaldehydes can also be used. Pepper spray is more difficult but a colorimetric tube for olefin has been used successfully to determ ine the presence of pepper spray. The only means of positive identification is by collecting residue for laboratory analysis. Even though many public assembly points have been evacuated due to the presumed presence of irritants, id entification of the specific agent is rare. Self protection Follow your department procedures for operati ng at the scene of a hazardous materials incident. If the material has not been identified or if it has been identified as either tear gas or a pepper spray, follow Guide 159 found in the North American Emergency TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-30 Response Guidebook . If mace has been positively identified, use Guide 153. Do not make entry into confined spaces unless you have been appropriately trained and have the necessary equipment. Use time, distance a nd shielding to your maximum advantage. In general, self-protection from all chemical hazards follows the same principles: Time - Keep exposure time and product contact to a minimum. Distance - Keep an appropriate distance from the hazardous environment. Stay up wind, uphill and away from contaminated areas. Shielding - Implement appropriate shielding in the form of respiratory protection and protective clothing. Treatment of casualties follows the standard sequence of decontamination, patient management, transport to medical facilities (hospital), and definitive care from medical field.

Case Scenario At 11:00 a.m. on Friday the town emer gency communications center receives an emergency call from the principal at the lo cal high school. The pr incipal reports that there is a fire in the boys bathroom on th e second floor of the two story school. All 900 students and teachers have been evacuated from the building. The town dispatcher sends two law enforcem ent officers, 2 fire trucks, a ladder truck, chief officer and ambulance to the scene. Upon arrival the firefighters notice gray smoke coming from a side door/stairwell. The firefighters enter the building with a hoseline, wearing se lf-contained breathing apparatus and structural fire fighting gear. When the ambulance arrives on the scene they notice multiple students are coughing, vom iting, squinting their eyes and tearing. The two firefighters found no evidence of a fire in the boys building and immediately exit the building complaining of intense sk in irritation. When they remove their SCBA, they also start co mplaining of burning eyes. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-32 Activity 4.2 School Vandalism Directions to Students 1.

TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-34 EXPLOSIVES Introduction Bombs appear to be the wea pon of choice for terrorists. Approximately 70% of all terrorist incidents involve the use of explosives. Improvised explosives can be designed by terrorists to deliver an assortment of harm a nd destruction, and can also provide a vehicle for dispersal of chem ical, biological, incendiary, and nuclear agents. Improvised Bomb Grenades Antipersonnel mine Terminology Explosives are defined as materials capable of violent decomposition. This decomposition often takes the form of extremel y rapid oxidation (burning). Explosions are the result of sudden and violent release of gas during the decomposition of explosive substances. This release is followed by hi gh temperature, strong shock and loud noise. A common method of classifying explosives is by dividing them according to the speed of their decomposition. While the terms high and low explosive are understood by most people, the correct terminology is hi gh and low order filler materials. When high order fillers are initiated, the reaction is propagated though the filler material at a speed at or above 3,300 feet per second (fps). These explosives are designed to detonate and destroy a target by a shattering effect. When low order fillers are initiated, the reaction is propagated though the filler material at a speed below 3,300 feet per second (fps). Th ese explosives are designed to deflagrate, or burn rapidly, and destroy a targ et by a pushing a nd pulling effect. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-35 Explosive effects Explosives, when detonated, produce three primary effects - blast Pressure, fragmentation, and thermal effects. There are two different phases of blast pressure . Positive blast pressure (overpressure) moves rapidly away from the explosion center (ground zero) due to the expansion caused by the release of energy. Automobiles damaged at the Oklahoma City Bombing site After the positive pressure phase, a vacuum is created at the explosion site. This creates a negative pressure which moved toward the or iginal center of the detonation at hurricane speed. It is less sudden, but lasts approxi mately three times as long as the positive pressure wave. Fragmentation occurs when the explosive device propels fragments at high speed for long distances. This often accounts for many of the injuries or casualties. Thermal Effects are sometimes referred to as the in cendiary effects. Heat produced by the detonation of either high or low explos ives varies according to the ingredient materials. High explosives generate greate r temperatures than low explosives, however the thermal effects from low explosives have a longer duration then those of high explosives. The thermal effect is visible in the bright fl ash or fire ball tem porarily produced by an explosion. Thermal effects vary as to type of explosive, container, addition of fuels / accelerants, shielding, and proximity. Fire a nd thermal effects are usually localized and short-lived with c onventional devices those not enhanced fo r collateral incendiary effects. Improvised explosive devices (IED s) commonly used by terrorists Vehicle bombs are usually large, powerful devices which consist of a quantity of explosives fitted with a timed or remotely-tri ggered detonator packed into a car or truck. The two most famous vehicle bombings on United States soil were the World Trade Center bombing in New York and the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing in Oklahoma City. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-36 Pipe bombs are one of the most common explosive devices. They are at the opposite end of the scale from vehicle bombs in terms of size and dest ructive potential. Pipe bombs usually consist of a quantity of explosives sealed into a length of metal or plastic pipe. Det onation is usually controlled by a timing fuse. Other possible methods include electronic timers, remote triggers, and motion sensors. Satchel device is an old military term for an explosive device consisting of a canvas overpack containing explosives. It was far more powerful than a grenade, but could still be thrown. The container may also be packed with antipersonnel materials such as nails and glass to inflict more casualties. The Centennial Park ex plosives incident in Atlanta is a clear exam ple of this type of device. Drawing of a reconstruction of the satchel believed to have been used in the Centennial Park bombing. Downloaded from the FBI Internet Site. Other improvised explosives devices may be utilized, including homemade grenades, mines, and/or projectiles. Explosive projectiles like rocket-propelled grenad es (RPGs) have been used in the past, but have not been a common occurrence. In Fairfax County, VA, Virginia police confiscated home-made projectiles capable of exploding on contact al ong with tube-type launchers from a private home. This occurr ed after the individua l who had apparently manufactured the devices was found dead in the home. The obvious danger associated with such weapons is the ability of the terrorist to take th e threat from a static to a dynamic environment. The possibility of dr ive-by bombings will certainly increase the operational risk to responders if they are included in the target scenario. Size-up issues There are ten size-up issues related to res ponder safety during operations which we will cover here. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-37 Disposition of the threat on arrival Bombs that are still intact and explosive ma terials that have not been consumed pose extremely dangerous circumstances. The dis position of a bomb threat to the initial responder is a matter of recognizing the pres enting hazards; has the bomb detonated, if so, is there a concern for dangerous remnants, are there secondary devices, etc. Pre-blast or post-blast conditions Pre-blast conditions refer to the aff ected incident environment a nd/or activities prior to a bomb detonating. This may include a host of activities such as , building searches, evacuations and render safe procedures. Post-blast conditions refer to the incident enviro nment after a bomb has exploded. This will involve issues dealing with casualties, fire s and structural instability to name a few. Size of the explosive device The amount and type of ingredient materials will significantly contribute to the power or strength of the potential blast. Responde rs should consider size as an element in determining threat levels. Proximity of exposures The distance of exposures from the explos ive device will likely influence operational objectives such as evacuations, staging locations, medical treatment areas, and perimeter control points. Physical protection variables Responders should consider using hardened structures such as, masonry walls and buildings (not glass), or even fire apparatus to keep res ponders away from potential line- of-site blast pathways (remember, stand-off distance significantly factors into selecting physical protection mediums) Condition, location, and number and status of casualties When responders arrive at the incident, ope rational prioritie s will be influenced by the number and severity of casualties on site. Large numbers of vi ctims may overwhelm initial resources. Also, many types of injuri es will require special medical attention. If victims are still trapped beneath rubble, sp ecialized rescue personnel and equipment will be required. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-38 Capabilities of resources on-hand The degree or level of operati onal involvement of the respon ders may be predicated upon their training, equipment and in some cas es experience. For example, emergency medical technicians may be lim ited to basic life su pport care with advanced care being available only from those trained to the pa ramedic level. Responders not trained to conduct render safe procedures with explosive devices woul d be foolish to make any attempt to do so. Reflex / response time for technical assistance Operational decisions will be influenced by the reaction and response time it takes to get specialized resources on the scene. For those responders working a bomb incident located in a rural area, waiting two hours for a bomb disposal team to arrive may not have the same operational impact as it would on responders in the dow ntown section of a major city. Commitment level of on-scene resources Prepare for, and anticipate difficult decisions early in the response pe rtaining to the level of operational engagement. For example, th e incident commander may elect to commit responders to rescue operations inside an uns table structure, or de dicate responders to assisting evacuees in proximity to an im provised explosive device. Decisions that commit responders to dangerous areas must in clude the use a hazard and risk assessment and prescribed (agency) operational procedures. Other hazards (TRACEM) Responders should always be aware of the potential for multiple hazards when on the scene of a bombing incident. Explosives devices may have been used to disperse chemical or radiological agen ts throughout the incident site, resulting in hazardous contamination of a broad area. Improvised device designed to disperse chemical agents TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-39 Outward warning signs Responders must remain alert at all times for warning indicators when involved with suspected bombings. Warning signs include: Any abandoned container out of place for the surroundings; Obvious devices containing blasting ca ps, timers, booster charges, etc.; Abandoned vehicles not clearly belo nging in the immediate environment; Strong chemical odors with no apparent reason; Unusual or foreign devices attached to pre ssurized containers, bul k storage containers or supply pipes; Trip wires or other booby traps, su spicious mailing containers; and An incident preceded by a wr itten or verbal threat. Dogs have been trained to detect a wide variety of substances including drugs, incendiaries, and explosives. Detection methods Detection methods for explosive materials include the use of fluoroscopes (x-ray machines such as those used in airports), explosive-sniffing dogs and photoionization detectors. Self protection Follow your department procedures for operati ng at the scene of a hazardous materials incident. follow Guide 112 in the NAERG. Use time, distance and shielding to your maximum advantage. Time - Work time in the effected area should be kept at a minimum until the area has been evaluated by specialized teams. Teams w ill search the area for mechanical hazards, unexploded material, radiological hazards, chemical hazards, biological hazards, secondary devices and booby traps. TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-40 Distance - Guide 112 in the NAERG provides some guidance when dealing with possible unexploded materials. It also suggests not permitting radio transmitters (which include cellular phones) within 100 meters (330 feet) of any suspected device. Shielding - If practical, keep out of line-of-sight of any suspect ed devices. Buildings and vehicles may provide some protection. Treatment of casualties Treatment of casualties follows the standard sequence of decontamination, patient management, transport to medical facilities (hospital), and definitive care from medical field. Crime Scene Considerations Responders should remain aware that they are also at a potential crime scene, and should be alert for secondary events and/or devices designed to target responders. Responders should not handle, disturb, or move suspicious devices, packages, or objects. Mark the location and report to the incident commander. Evidence preservation is an important part of crime scene operations. Do not disturb or damage potential evidence. When you remove clothing from victims, remember that they may contain evidence which may be recovered. Identify and bag all such materials for laboratory analysis. Seek technical assistance to manage all devices! Additional Resources Local and state resources as identified in your plan. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF). Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Department of Defense (DOD). TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS SM 4-41 SUMMARY Emergency responders must be alert for and recognize outward warning signs associated with B-NICE events to maximize scene safety during tactical operations. The initial incident evaluation (size-up) should include as much relevant information as possible to support development of tactic al considerations. Relevant information may include pre-event written and verbal threats, dispatch information, target hazard pre-plans and most importantly, the presenting conditions on arrival to the scene. When responders arrive on-scene the size and complexity of the event will greatly limit the number of tactical options to consider. The training level of responders and equipment capabilities will also factor into making operational decisions. As more resources arrive, additional options will likely become available. Technical resources must be requested early in the in cident to reduce response reflex times . Deciding which tactical operation to employ after appropriate resource s are available will be influenced by the ability of responders to pr otect themselves through time, distance and shielding. One final consideration that must be taken into ac count prior to initiating tactical operations is ensuring that preparations are in-place fo r emergency decontamination and continuous patient management (up to hospital delivery) . As with any emergency selecting and implementing the best tactical options will usually dictate the success or failure of the response effort. MODULE 5: INCIDENT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW TERMINAL OBJECTIVES The students upon completion of this modul e will be able to describe command and control issues associated with resp onder operations at a crime scene. ENABLING OBJECTIVES The students will: 1. Describe and define the authorities and responsibilitie s in Presidential Decision Directive 39. 2. Identify crime scene issues which must be addressed when managing an incident involving potential criminal activities. 3. Define applicable resources referenced in the Federal Response Plan (FRP) and the FRP Terrorism Annex. 4. Identify the preliminary indicators for transition from emergency phase to recovery and termination. 5. Define unique debriefing and security issues. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW SM 5-2 THE CHALLENGE FOR INCIDENT COMMAND Terrorism, whether it involves biological, nuclear, incendiary, chemical, explosives, or combinations of these elements, is more ch allenging to manage than most emergency events. Coordination of multiple response agencies The Incident Commander (IC) must ensure that all participating agencies are effectively communicating within the designated command structure. Regular planning sessions should be conducted to review the progre ss of assigned tasks and to incorporate new resources as they engage or disengage from the incident. When multiple agencies are operating on-site, the IC must request or appoint a representative or liaison for each. Unique scene control / security issues On-going criminal activities will likely impact scene control initiatives. Police may limit or restrict access to the scen e due to security concerns. Due to the dynamic nature of criminal activit y, anticipate that the incident perimeter will be larger than would be expected simply due to the incident scope. Special awareness, that responders may be the intended target Consider that terrorists may still be on the scene, waiting for responders to arrive. The intent could be to add responders to the victim list. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW SM 5-3 Specialized resources Terrorist events will gene rate responses from many agencies. Some of the response teams will provide personnel who are specially trained and equipped to support operational objectives. Examples include the FBI Hazardous Materials Response Unit and law enforcement bomb disposal teams. Police bomb squad Crime scene considerations (evidential preservation) Responders working in the confines of a cr ime scene must respect the mission of law enforcement investigators. Assist that mission by identifying and preserving potential evidence whenever you encounter it. THE ROLE OF THE INCIDENT COMMANDER AT TERRORIST EVENTS The Incident Commander must safely, effectively and efficiently manage response resources to achieve the most favorable incident outcomes possible. Follow the SEE Principle Safe - No one gets hurt. Effective - Everyone works toward stated objectives. Efficient - All resources are utili zed to maximum benefit. Management of the incident is based on three components 1. Establishing and updating priorities is a broad topic that covers a variety of factors. These include life safety, incident stabilization, proper ty and environmental conservation and the investigation of cause and origin. 2. Continually size-up both the present situation and the predicted behavior of the incident. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW SM 5-4 3. Establishing and updating incident priorities is different in that it is narrowly focused on the strategic goals, tactical objec tive, and task operat ions. Another way of putting it would be to say that es tablishing and updating incident priorities focuses on what needs to be done, how it will be done, and who and when will do it. Incident Command responsibilities Incident command covers a broad scope. Some responsibilities may include, but are not limited to: INCIDENT COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES Command and control issues Command and control issues at terrorist inci dents will likely involve a unified command system in order to properly coordinate the various agencies and au thorities involved in responding to the incident. Some key agen cies may include local fire/EMS, law INCIDENT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW SM 5-5 enforcement and emergency management. St ate or territorial law enforcement and emergency management may also become involved. If federal involvement is required, the two lead agencies are the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). RESPONSIBILITIES AS OUTLINED IN PRESIDENTIAL DECISION DIRECTIVE -39 (PDD-39) PDD-39 identifies the Federal Bureau of Investigation as the lead agency for crisis management during terrorist incidents i nvolving nuclear, biol ogical and chemical materials. It also identifies the Federal Emergency Management Agency as the lead agency for recovery and consequence management duri ng terrorist incidents involving nuclear, biological and chemical materials. PDD-39 supports either type of management activity, as well as unified command operations when more than one agency shares the lead. Technical support and response assistance PDD-39 outlines technical support and response assistance insofar as it supplements both crisis and consequence activiti es. It also complements pr oduct identificat ion, detection, monitoring and assessment of the agent or material, as well as management and disposal of same. Relationship between PDD-39 and the Federal Response Plan The Federal Response Plan (FRP) is used as the vehicle to coordinate consequence management efforts under PDD-39. The plan directs other Federal agencies to support the FBI and FEMA as needed. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW SM 5-6 THE FOCUS OF LOCAL GOVE RNMENT RESPONSE PLANS The focus of local governmental respons e should fall into five specific areas. 1. Public protection is obviously the pr imary priority for a ll response plans. 2. Emergency services need to be addressed as well. Specific areas of emergency services needing attention by a local response plan include: Search and/or rescue; Basic and advanced life support medical care; and Hazard isolation / incident scene control. 3. Once the emergency services are assured, restoration of critical public systems , including electric / gas utility service, wate r supply, wastewater treatment, and usable transportation corridors. 4. The fourth area which a local plan should address is field assessment capabilities to determine additional resource needs. 5. Finally, the plan should address how and when to declare a local disaster / emergency. STATE AND TERRITORIAL GO VERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES The state or territorial government has responsibilities that fall into six categories. 1. Provide support personnel, equipment and supplies; 2. Provide specialized resources; 3. Provide National Guard support; 4. Provide field assessment capabilities to determine additional resource needs; 5. Issue state declaration of emergency; and 6. Request Federal assistance. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW SM 5-7 THE FEDERAL RESPONSE The Federal Response Plan (FRP) is a written agreem ent among various departments and agencies that coordinates government res ources and federal activities for response to disasters, as part of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emerge ncy Assistance Act. It also augments state and local government response efforts during declared emergencies and disasters, which includes response, mitigation and recovery assistance. Activating the Plan There are three different way in which the FRP may be activated. 1. The Governor of the affected State request Federal assistance. 2. A significant emergency or disaster overwhelms local and State response resources and the President init iates a declaration under the Stafford Act. 3. A major event has been forecasted (e.g., hurricane) and Federal assistance will likely be needed.

U.S. Army Medical Research Inst itute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) . d. USMC Chemical Biological In cident Response Force (CBIRF). e. US Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI). TRANSITIONING FROM THE EMER GENCY PHASE TO RECOVERY AND TERMINATION Transitioning is determined by the stability of the incident or threat level. Factors which assist in this determination include: Resolution of criminal activity; Control of chemical agents, materials, devices and conditions that may harm responders, civilians and further impact the community; and Restoration of critical (com munity) systems to an acceptable operational level. Recovery Operations Returning the affected commun ity back to normalcy (pre-inc ident conditions) remains the primary focus for recovery operations. What may be unique regardi ng terrorist incidents and recovery is who becomes responsible for directing this phase of operation. Identification of the individual or agency responsible for dire cting recovery is based upon many factors. The Terrorism Annex to the FRP provides guidance in this area. On-going crime scene investigations will likely place law enforcement as the responsible command lead. Regardless of the command lead, resources invo lved in the recovery phase must establish regular planning sessions to address overs ight of the affected operational area and restoring response resources to a state of r eadiness. Significant terrorist incidents will likely increase the duration of recovery operations. This is primarily due to the complex nature, and/or unfamiliarity of responders in dealing with the consequences, agents and/or devices (weapons) of mass destruction. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW SM 5-10 Any act of terrorism that has caused death a nd destruction, or driven people from their homes will likely require a well conceive d community recovery plan. You should consider the following as components of that plan: A focused source of information that will instruct evacuees on how and when to return home; Status reports of incident recove ry operations and planned events; Information about areas that are still cordoned-off or restricted and why; Any other incident related details that will provide a sense of security, or enhance a return to \"normalcy\", provide points of c ontact for the community to ask questions; and Establishment of a counseling center(s) for community use. Termination of the Incident Termination procedures include debriefing all response resources, formal and informal critiques of response activities and after- action adjustments to enhance future operations for a similar type of incident. For terrorist incidents, debriefing sessions are especially important to responders that are unfamiliar with weapons of mass destruction. Authorities should recognize the potential for psychological impacts for several reasons. One is that most re sponders are not used to dealing with chemical and biological warfare agents. Dealing with the unknown is always more stressful than handling known hazards. Responders may have been the intended target, which will make the incident far more personal than otherwise. Also, concerns about continued or secondary e xposure may facilitate pos t-incident stress. Remember that Occupational Safety and H ealth regulations require the incident commander to provide each responder with information relating to hazardous exposure concerns e.g., agent identif ication, decontamination actio ns and potential symptoms. When conducting the debriefing se ssion include incident features that were unique to the response. Discuss the effec tiveness of operational activitie s and provide an overview of how the response influenced the emergency, a nd whether strategic go als were achieved. Also, discuss what response resources were i nvolved with the incident, and the associated responsibilities dur ing the emergency. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW SM 5-11 Accurate documentation is a critical factor to determining the eventual resolution of a terrorist incident. This documentation shoul d also be utilized to modify and enhance future response procedures. Incident Critique Evaluating the response and performance of re sources after a terrori st event should be consistent with standard incident critique procedures. However, there are special considerations that may require attention. You may wish to consider the appointment of more than one lead agency to conduct the critique, and coordinate sharing joint res ponsibility with all pa rticipating agencies regarding collection of po st-incident information. Establish a system with law enforcement officials for scrutinizing information that may be sensitive to inve stigative proceedings. Emphasize the importance of carefully recording accurate information for post-incident reporting, remember that all documenta tion, including photographs, videotapes, audiotapes and computer files is subjected to evidentiary summons. SUMMARY Command personnel who are responsible for ma naging response resources at a terrorist event must implement and strictly adhere to the principles of an incident management system. Initiate actions early to gain c ontrol of the emergency. Remember, not unlike other significant incidents, strong command a nd control techniques will foster scene safety. Recognize the need fo r, and effectively utilize sp ecialized resources. Good planning will incorporate crime scene consider ations as well as effective communications among all response organizations. Be prepared in advance of the event by becoming familiar with local, state and fede ral response plans and agencies. The balance of this course will consist of a comprehensive activity and a written exam.

Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-1 APPENDIX A ARTICLES FROM THE SECURITY AWARENESS BULLETIN The articles in this appendix first ap peared in the Security Awareness Bulletin , Number 3-96, December, 1996. The Security Awareness Bulletin is produced by the Department of Defense Security Institute in Richmond, Virginia. Their Internet site is: http://www.dtic.mil/dodsi Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-2 Antiterrorism Awareness: Changing the Mindset A renewed challenge for the security educator by Lynn Fischer, DoD Security Institute The major focus on this issue of the Security Awareness Bulletin is antiterrorism and specifically what the security educator in defense components and industry should be conveying on this subject to the employee or service-member population. The articles included here may be useful as reading ma terial, particularly for personnel who are relatively more vulnerable to a terrorist attemp t. And these texts could serve, in content and structure, as the basis for special-focus s ecurity briefings for all personnel. With the rash of domestic terrorist incidents, we ar e moving away from the idea that it's just people who go overseas to high risk areas who need a thorough exposure to personal protection measures and anti terrorism (AT) awareness information. Both policy and common sense dictate that general AT awaren ess be a standard element in security indoctrination for Department of Defense personnel. Timely guidance In the wake of two devastating terr orist bombings in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh in November 1995 and Khobar Towers in June 1996), Secretary of Defense William J. Perry has reissued DoD Directive 2000.12, \"' DoD Combating Terrorism Program\" dated September 15, 1996. This directive has a lot to say about security education in support of antiterrorism programs. As does the earlier directive by the same title, it tasks military department and other defense components to institute antiterrorism awareness programs. It states that attention must be given to: \"elevating the awareness of DoD personnel and their families to (a) the general terrorist thre at, (b) the terrorist threat in their areas (including temporary duty a nd/or temporary active duty and leave areas), and (c) personnel protection measures that can reduce personal vulnerability.\" What is specifically new about the direc tive, as described by Dr. Perry, is that the approaches previously set fort h as suggestions in DoD Handbook 0-2000.12-H, Protection of DoD Personnel And Activities A gainst Acts of Terrorism and Political Turbulence, are now to be implemented as the DoD standard that shall apply to all antiterrorism (AT) fo rce protection efforts. i Although currently in revision, the handbook offers a wealth of information that can be incorporated into briefings and awareness publications including personal prot ection tips for travelers that can reduce personal vulnerability. Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-3 A response to the bombings In Saudi Arabia We can find additional guidance for stre ngthening the AT element in our security awareness program in both (1) the language of the final report of the Antiterrorism Task Force following the bombing at Riyadh and (2) in the Downing Report which assessed the Khobar Towers tragedy.ii The earlier report dated May, 1996, states \"The entire training program requires new reinforcemen t, command emphasis, and innovated media methodologies to aid in fulfilling the basic AT training programs. The major challenge noted has been combating complacency\u2014thus making 'changing the mindset' a fundamentally important objective.\" The report goes on to say that while sustai ning AT focus is difficu lt despite the training and briefings now being accomplished, \"Secu rity consciousness is not adequately emphasized and resource expenditures do not fully support programs. Without continued command emphasis, other problems such as training and program awareness, limited resources, competing priorities, and perc eived absence of thre at--will endure.\" The task force report concludes with se veral recommendations related to security education that will lead to a DoD AT program of excellence. It endorses the Annual Worldwide AT Conference to consolidate, evaluate, and cross-fertilize AT enhancements; stresses the importance of command support and leadership emphasis required to energize AT training as part of force protection; and identifies the need for specific training actions and e ducational products for AT awar eness. This includes the distribution of a video, now under devel opment by the Joint Staff, a commander's antiterrorism handbook, a personal protecti on pamphlet for use throughout the Department of Defense, and an AT-Force Pr otection Card to be used as a personal reminder. Plans are underway by the Joint St aff for the printing and distribution of the following three publications through ma jor military command headquarters. iii These publications are author ized for local reproduction within the Department of Defense: Coping with Violence , a Personal Protection Pamphlet JS Guide 5260, Service Member's Personal Protection Guide: A Self-Help Handbook to Combating Terrorism Security While Traveling, a tri-fold card with tips about individual protection measures The need for theater-specific training The recently-released Downing Report (September 1996) reinforces the conclusions of the previous assessment and calls for greater \"theater-specific tr aining guidance\" for personnel deployed in the command's area of responsibility. Consequently four recommendations were made by the Downi ng, task force which were immediately accepted by the Secretary of De fense for implementation: Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-4 a. Establishment of AT training qualifications and certification -procedures for all units and individuals prior to deployment and afte r arrival in an area of responsibility b. Mandatory force protection and risk manage ment training for all officers and senior noncommissioned officers deployed to high areas c. Development of antiterrorism training and educational supporting materials, using innovative media methodologies d. Refresher training for installation/unit AT officers immediately prior to assignment to a theater While items a, b, and d concern resident or fo rmal training for higher risk personnel, item c is a direct follow-up to the earlier Antiterrorism Task Force recommendation for AT awareness that calls for a vari ety of innovative educational pr oducts. In his comments to the President which accompanies the Down ing Report on the Khobar Towers bombing, Secretary Perry states in addi tion that local commanders wi ll have operational and full responsibility with regard to force protection matters, and th at the Chiefs of Staff has become the principal advisor and focal poi nt for all Department of Defense force protection activities. Add AT awareness to the educational agenda The new emphasis on antiterror ism training and awareness de monstrates again that the skills and energies of security educators are indispensable in confronting a international threat to U.S. lives and properties. In the words of the Task Force Report, awareness programs should be mobilized to battle compl acency and to change the mindset that: to me\" or \"It can't happen here.\" This is admittedly a weighty task for the security educator already charged with the indoctrina tion of personnel concerning information security, personnel security, forei gn threat awareness, and other educational objectives. However, as with awareness programs to confront the threat to national defense information, AT awareness can and ought to be a community effort in which we draw upon the products, ideas and methodologies of security educators who have the resources to generate effective training materials. We at the DoD Security Institute, the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others who are involved in the production of awareness publications, videos, posters and other training aids will do our utmost to advertise and disseminate timely threat information and pr oducts to support your educational programs. Keep tuned to the Security Awareness Bulletin and to our Web Page for up-to-date information and training produc ts: http://www.dtic.mil/dodsi/. Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-5 Keeping current on the terrorist threat The intensity of the terrorist threat not only differs from place to place but changes across time. Part of the job of the security e ducator is to remain current about new and intensified threat areas by keeping up to date on Travel Security Advisories (TSA) issued by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, a nd other sources of current information on the terrorist threat such as the Department of State and the Defense Intelligence Agency. On the next page are sources of information, in pr inted form and via the Internet to keep your awareness communications to employ ee populations timely and accurate. Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-6 Terrorist Intelligence Operations Introduction This article assesses the threat posed by terrorism to the United States and examines the role that OPSEC plays in protecting U.S. inte rests against terrorist attack. In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee in April 1995, Admiral John O. Studeman, the Acting Director of Central In telligence, summarizes the terrorist threat to the United States in the following manner: International terrorism remains one of th e deadliest and most persistent threats to U.S. security. The motives, perpetrators , and methods of the terrorist groups are evolving in ways that complicate analysis , collection, and count eraction and require the ability to ship resources flexibly a nd quickly. The rise of the new breed of terrorist who is interested in inflicting mass death and destruction does not bode well for the future security of U.S. interest s. These groups can strike at any time, anywhere, spurred by seemingly unrelated events for which they judge the United States to be blameworthy. They have a widening global reach and a high degree of proficiency with more sophist icated weapons and tactics. iv Terrorism is defined as the unlawful us e of force or violence against persons or property for the purposes of intimidating or coercing a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, intoleranc e of political and social objectives. There are two categories of terrorism: domestic and international. Domestic terrorism involves groups or individuals whose activities, conduc ted in the United States without foreign influence, are directed at elements of the United States Government or population. International terrorism involves activity committed by foreign based groups or individuals who are either dir ected by countries or groups ou tside the United States or whose activities trans cend national boundaries. v Terrorist group categories Terrorist groups generally are either non-state supported (either indigenous or transnational), state-supported, or state directed. Non-stat e supported terrorist groups are autonomous and receive no significant s upport from a government. State supported groups generally operate independently but receive support from one or more governments. Such support may include weapon s, training, money, intelligence, or safe havens. State-directed terrorist organizations act as agents of a government. Such groups receive intelligence, logistic s, and operational support fr om the sponsoring government, frequently through diplomatic missions. State- directed terrorism is potentially a deniable and/or relatively inexpensive method of carryin g out attacks against an enemy state or its interests.vi Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-7 The greatest terrorist threat to the United States today comes from fundamentalist Islamic extremist groups. Some of these groups , such as the Party of God (Hizballah), the Palestinian group Islamic Resistance Move ment (HAMAS), and the Algerian Armed Islamic Group fit the traditional terrorist mold. These groups have hierarchical structures and receive support from state sponsors. A new Is lamic threat is on the rise as a result of the activities of ad hoc terrorist groups. Th ese groups are even mo re dangerous in many ways than the traditional gr oups because they lack a we ll-established organizational identity, and they tend to decentralize and co mpartment their activities. They are capable of producing sophisticated conventional wea pons, as well as chemical and biological agents. They are also less constrained by st ate sponsors or other benefactors than more traditional terrorist organizations. These new groups seek to punish the United States and other Western nations by inflicting heavy ci vilian casualties. The World Trade Center bombers are prime examples of this new breed of radical, transnational Islamic terrorists.vii Both the traditional groups and the newer, ad hoc groups have increased their capability to attack U.S. interests. The groups are well funded, and some have developed sophisticated international support networks that provide them great freedom of movement and increase their opportunities to a ttack the interests of the United States on a global basis. These groups are also attr acting more qualified cadres with greater technical skills. Several gr oups have established supporting infrastructures within the United States that provide financial, logi stics, operational, and intelligence support.viii Although, there is no evidence that these groups are centrally coordina ted, it does appear that they collaborate in terrori st actions. Evidence gathered by Federal investigators in the World Trade Center bombing case, for exam ple, shows that leaders or representatives of five different groups - th e Palestinian Islamic Jihad, HAMAS, the Sudanese National Islamic Front, the Pakistan-based al-Fuqra h, and groups funded by Persian Gulf donors - were involved in the plot. The conspirators were aided by Sudanese diplomats affiliated with the National Islamic Front, which provide d them with information and credentials. Evidence seized later from the apartment of one of the conspirators revealed detailed intelligence on potential targets and plans for other attacks in the New York area. ix Terrorist tactics There are six basic type s of tactics that terrorist groups have used: hijackings, kidnappings, bombings, assassinations, armed a ssaults, and barricade-hostage incidents. A group's objectives and organizational capab ilities dictate whic h tactics it uses. Terrorist organizations typi cally use hijackings, ki dnapping, and barricade-hostage incidents when the group wishes to force the targeted company or government into negotiations. The terrorist group frequently is able to obtain the release of prisoners or extort money. Such incidents increase the le vel of risk to the te rrorist organization and require a mature planning, operations, l ogistics, and intelligence capability to successfully conduct the operation. Bombings , assassinations, and armed assaults are less risky and generally require less organizatio nal capabilities. These tactics tend to be used to accomplish the following goals: Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-8 Create a climate of fear in a targeted group or nation through a sustained campaign of violence; Retaliate for previous incide nts or situations affecting the terrorist organization or its causes; Negatively affect processes that the terrorist organization sees as against its interests; and Eliminate specific individuals or groups.x Attaining the terrorist organization's goa ls depends on receiving adequate information for planning and executing an operation. O PSEC denies terroris t organizations the information they require for planning. The following portions of this section discuss the terrorist threat to the United States and the role of s ponsoring nations and terrorist organizations in executing attacks. Terrorist objectives Organizations intend their terrorist activities to have an emotional impact on the target audience, causing it to act in a manner that furthers the group's objectives. Terrorist operations generally are categorized in term s of their associated goals. These goals traditionally are divided into five cate gories: recognition, coercion, intimidation, provocation, and insurgency support. Early in their life span, terrorist groups often carry out attacks designed to gain recognition. The objective of these attack s is national and/or international attention for th e group and its stated objectives . Groups often mount such attacks, which may involve protracted hostage seizures, against highl y-visible symbols of state control (e.g., national airl ines). Groups intend coercion a ttacks to force individuals, organizations, or governments to act in a desi red manner. Using this strategy, terrorists selectively target facilities with the intent of bringing increasing pr essure to bear on the targeted activity. Terrorist attacks designe d primarily to intimidate are a means of preventing organizations or governments from acting in a defined manner. Provocation attacks aim to force government security forc es to take repressive action against the general populace. These attacks generally are against critical infras tructures, popular or high-profile individuals, or important facilities. The goal of these attacks is to demonstrate the weakness of the legitimate government, thus causi ng an uncoordinated backlash. xi Terrorist threats to the United States Until recently, many people believed that the United States was largely immune to terrorist attack. This belief was based on th e low number of terrori st attacks that took place in the United States during the 1980s a nd early 1990s. The bombing of the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993, demonstrated the nation's vulnerability to terrorist attack. In retrospect, however, there was no reason to discount U.S. vulnerability to terrorist attacks. Historically, the United Stat es has been the target of over 32 percent of all terrorist attacks worldwide, second only to Israel. Domestically, the United States Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-9 averaged 100 terrorist attack s per year in the 1970s, with 112 occurring in 1977 alone. Between 1980 and 1982, 122 terrorist attacks occu rred in the United States with 51 of these attacks occurring in 1982. Betw een 1982 and 1993, a total of 177 confirmed terrorist incidents and 46 suspected terrori st incidents took place. Additionally, law enforcement intervention prevented 81 terrori st incidents, many of which could have resulted in extensive damage to property or si gnificant loss of life. Superior intelligence collection and the infiltration of terrorist groups with in formers enabled the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in concert with the Intelligence Community, to prevent these attacks. However, if terrorist groups conti nue to evolve into mo re informal, ad hoc structures, gathering information necessary to prevent terrorist inci dents may become far more difficult.xii It is likely that the number of terrorist at tacks taking place inside the United States will increase within the next several years. According to current projections, worldwide terrorism will increase at a rate of roughly 15 percent per year - a figure in line with historical patterns. Most te rrorist attacks against American interests will still occur overseas, but more violent attacks aimed at sy mbolic targets and vital infrastructure are likely to occur inside the United States. Both domestic and international terrorism are likely to increase. Moreover, as terrorists ga in technical skills and attempt to stay one move ahead of counterterrorist and antite rrorist forces, the weapons and operational techniques used by terrorists are likely to grow more complex and more sophisticated. xiii Terrorist sponsors The Department of State curr ently considers seven countries to be terrorist sponsors: Libya, Syria, Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Iraq, and North Korea. xiv Libya Although it has made some cosmetic changes to its terrorism appa ratus, Libya retains the capability to commit terrorist acts. De spite its public renunciation of terrorism, terrorism remains an important instrument of Libyan foreign policy, which is managed at the highest levels of government. The Unite d States has successf ully sought sanctions against Libya in the United Nations aimed at forcing the execution of the two Libyan intelligence officers implicated in the bombing of Pan American flight 103. However, Libya has still failed to comply with the demands of the U.N. S ecurity Council for the execution of these individuals as well as thos e suspected to be involved in the bombing of UTA flight 772. In December 1993, the Secu rity Council increased sanctions against Libya to compel compliance. While it has cl osed some terrorist facilities, Libya still provides safe havens and financial support for the Abu Nidal Organization (ANO) and other terrorist groups. In Oc tober 1993, Qaddafi vowed to strike the United States and nations supporting U.N. sanctions against Li bya. It is believed that Libya possesses chemical weapons and is actively pursu ing other weapons of mass destruction.xv Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-10 The primary Libyan intelligence organizati on, the Jamahariya Security Organization (JSO), has been directly im plicated in the bombing of Pan American flight 103 and UTA flight 772. The bomb used to destroy Pan Am erican 103 was traced to a station manager for Libyan Arab Airways in Malta. The st ation manager, a JSO Intelligence officer, checked the bag at Luqa Airport in Malta on to a KLM aircraft flying to London with instructions for transfer to a flight for John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Because of his position, the Libyan st ation manager was able to bypass airport security and forward the suitcase with the bom b without any examination. Authorities in London placed the bag on the next flight to New York, Pan American 103, assuming that it has been checked and determined to be safe in Malta. A defector from the JSO to the United States provided critical information on the role of Libyan intelligence in the bombing of the aircraft. xvi The JSO was also responsible for planni ng and executing the LaBelle Discotheque bombing in Berlin, Germany which killed U. S. Army personnel in 1986. On December 4, 1992, the Federal Republic of Germany indi cted two Libyan inte lligence officers for their role in the bombing. The Libyan Embassy in East Germany provided the explosives used in the bombing and collected intelligen ce needed to target the nightclub. The JSO has also been directly implicated in th e attacks by the ANO on the Rome and Vienna Airports in 1985. Libya provi ded forged passports and intelligence support, and used diplomatic pouches to move weapons into the vicinity of the attacks. The JSO was also involved in the attempted assassination of a U.S. ambassador in 1977. Libyan People's Bureaus throughout the world have been used to provide monetary support, weapons, training, and intelligence to disparate terrori st groups sponsored by Libya. The Libyans have also used front companies, the offices of Libyan Arab Airlines, and the Islamic Call Society as covers for intelligence and terrorist operations. The Libyans have also used these activities to obtain embargoed technologi es and information for their program to produce weapons of mass destruction.xvii Syria To advance its interests in the Middle East, Syria has used te rrorism as an integral part of its foreign policy. Syrian intelligence officers and diplomats have been associated with attacks on Jordanian offi cials and Syrian dissidents li ving abroad. In January 1986, the Syrian intelligence service was behind a plot to smuggle a bomb through the United Kingdom's Heathrow Airport ont o an El Al aircraft. Since the end of 1986, Syrian sponsorship of terrorist activiti es appears to have been rest ricted to the Middle East. Syrian intelligence is also involved in th e diversion of technologies required for the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, and for advanced conventional munitions. It is believed that Syria possesses chemical weapons and is developing the capability to produce biological weapons. Syria continues to provide safe have n, training, financial support and perhaps intelligence support fo r a number of Middle East terrorist organizations. These organiza tions include the Palestine Is lamic Jihad (PU), the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine Ge neral Command, Hizballah, the Japanese Red Army, and HAMAS. xviii Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-11 Iran Iran is the most active sponsor of terrori sm in the world. Since the inception of the Islamic state in 1979, the country has used terror ism as an integral part of its foreign and military policies. Iranian leaders view terrorism as a valid tool to accomplish their political objectives. Terrorist operations are reviewed and approved at the highest levels of the Iranian government, and the President of Iran is involved in th e approval process of all major terrorist operations. Iran-spons ored terrorism has had two major goals: punishing opponents of the Islamic regime and expanding the Islamic movement throughout the Persian Gulf region. Iran sees terrorism as a means of attacking its enemies that is less likely to result in direct retribution against the Islamic Republic. This view has been reinforced by the United States ' decisive victory in the Persian Gulf War. xix Despite the overall decline in state-sponsored terrorist attacks, Iranian-sponsored attacks have actually increased. The number of terrorist att acks and the centralization of oversight of terrorist operations has increased since the elec tion of President Rafsanjani, despite the supposed moderation of his regime. Tehran and its surr ogates carried out 35 terrorist attacks between 1989, wh en Rafsanjani was elected, and 1992. Twenty of these attacks were conducted in 1992 alone, and the trend for these attacks has been toward increased levels of lethality. xx The Iranian government plays a significant role in internationa l terrorism by providing money, training, weapons, intelligence, documenta tion, and cover for terr orist activities. Three government agencies play primary roles. The Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) is responsible for intelligence co llection to support terro rist operations. The ministry is also responsible for liaison activities with supported terrorist groups and Islamic fundamentalist movements. MOIS ha s also conducted terrorist operations in support of Iranian objectives. Most of these activities have focused on attacks on Iranian dissidents. The Qods Force of the Iran ian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is responsible for extraterritori al operations, including terrorist operations. A primary focus for the Qods Force is training Islamic funda mentalist terrorist groups. Currently, the Qods Force conducts training activities in Iran and in Sudan. The Qods Force is also responsible for gathering information require d for targeting and attack planning. The final operational element of the Iranian governme nt's terrorist support infrastructure is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (WA). The WA provides diplomatic cover for terrorist operations, diplomatic pouch service for im portation of weapons and explosives, and a safe haven at Iranian diplomatic faciliti es for execution of terrorist operations.xxi Iran maintains active liaison with Hizballah, HAMAS, the PU, and other terrorist groups. One of these groups - the Islamic Group, an Egyptian funda mentalist terrorist group - was involved in the bombing of th e World Trade Center. Subsequent investigations revealed that members of the group who participated in the bombing received bank transfers in Germany from Iran and from Iranian organizations prior to the bombing. While this does not constitute definitive proof of Iranian involvement in the Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-12 bombing, these facts suggest th at the Iranian government suppor ted the activities of the ad hoc terrorist organization that carried out the bombing.xxii The Iranians have also embarked on a long-term program to develop weapons of mass destruction.xxiii The Intelligence Community believes that Iran is likely to c ontinue its support for terrorist operations for the foreseeable future. Iran has never paid a significant price for any of the terrorist activitie s it has sponsored and has obtai ned tangible political benefits in the Persian Gulf region. Iran will continue to focus the majority of its attacks on Israel in hopes of derailing the Middle East peace proce ss. The United States will also continue to be a primary target for Iranian sponsored te rrorist attacks. Iran and the terrorist groups it sponsors are continuing to develop operational plans to attack the United States and its allies. Iran has an extensive intelligence co llection and terrorist in frastructure throughout the world. This infrastructure is particularly well developed in the United States, Europe, and South America. Iran has also formed a lliances with Islamic fundamentalists in the Philippines, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. xxiv Sudan In August 1993, the State Department adde d Sudan to its list of terrorist states. Authorities now consider Sudan to be second to Iran in its support of Muslim terrorist groups. The government of Sudan has links to radical Arab terrorist organizations, including HAMAS, ANO, and the PU. Suda n also provides safe haven for PLO operatives and for Egyptian fundamentalis ts fleeing crackdowns by the Mubarak government. The governments of Tunisia, Algeri a, and Egypt have asserted that Sudan is providing weapons, funds, training, passports, and safe haven for Islamic terrorist organizations that are attempti ng to overthrow their governments. To date, no conclusive evidence links Sudan with any terrorist act; however, Sudanese citizens comprised five of the fifteen suspects arrested in June 1993 for plotting to bomb the United Nations Building, the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, th e New York Federal Building, and other facilities in New York City. Senior member s of the National Islamic Front (NIF), which dominates the Sudanese government, have al so called for attacks against the United States. The United States also suspects th at Sudan provided wea pons and materiel to Somali groups responsible for at tacks on U.S. and U.N. forces deployed in Somalia. Iran has maintained an extremely close relations hip with Sudan, and the two nations have entered into agreements for joint military and intelligence activities.xxv Iraq Since the mass expulsion of its intelligen ce officers and diplomats from numerous countries during the Gulf War, Iraq has not fully recovered its capability to conduct terrorist operations. Nevert heless, Iraq sponsored 39 te rrorist operations in 1992 - activity which was in direct violation of its cease-fire agreement with the United Nations. One notable incident was the planned assassin ation of former Pres ident George Bush on his visit to Kuwait in 1993. The Iraqi government was also implicated in several dozen terrorist incidents in Northern Iraq in 1993. These attacks primarily targeted U.N. food Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-13 distribution activities an d humanitarian relief agency opera tions. Indications are that the Iraqi intelligence service has resumed terrorist targeting ope rations throughout the world. Iraq has a well-developed chemical weapons program and possesses biological agents. U.N. disarmament operations, however, have significantly damaged Iraq's nuclear weapons program.xxvi Cuba In the past, Cuba was a strong supporter of terrorist activities providing training, funds, weapons, and intelligence support. The Castro regime, which has become preoccupied with its own existence, is no longer able to support armed struggle actively in Latin America or other parts of the world. Cu rrently, the regime's focus is on economic survival, and the government is attempting to upgrade diplomatic and trade relations in Latin America. However, Cuba still provide s safe haven for a number of Latin American and European terrorist organiza tions. It still remains likely that the Castro regime would use terrorist attacks as a means to adversely affect U.S. interests and prevent the collapse of the Cuban regime; or if U. S. military action was anticipate d. Cuba has a sophisticated intelligence collection capability that could be used for targeting U.S. facilities by terrorist groups. The Cuban in telligence service, the DGI, has the ability to unilaterally carry out such attacks against United States. xxvii North Korea North Korea has a worldwide capability to condu ct terrorist activities against the United States or its allies. If Nort h Korea wishes, it can mount atta cks on U.S. facilities at any time. North Korea has not sponsored any terrorist activity since 1987, when it conducted a mid-flight bombing of a Korean Air Line s aircraft. The North Korean Research Department for External Intelligence (RDEI) was responsible for this attack, and an earlier attack in Rangoon, Burma that target ed an official South Korean delegation headed by South Korea's president. North Ko rea still provides sanctuary for terrorist groups, and military instructors at terrorist training camps in Lebanon and Sudan. The North Koreans appear to be backing away fr om terrorism as a means to gain economic aid and advanced technology from the United St ates and Japan. North Korea is believed to have chemical and biological weapons and is currently believed to be engaged in developing nuclear weapons. A significant concern has been that North Korea may be willing to sell these technologies to state supporters of te rrorism or terrorist groups.xxviii Islamic fundamentalist groups A variety of Islamic fundamentalist and/or radical Arab groups have the ability to conduct attacks inside the United States. Such groups - HAMAS, Hizballah, PU, ANO, and the Islamic Group - are char acterized by their in creasingly strident assertions of religious justification for terrorist activities against the oppressive regimes of the developed world. In particular, groups have iden tified the United States as anti-Islamic. For this reason, Iran and its followe rs characterize the United States as the Great Satan. It Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-14 is notable that from 1975 to 1987, the numbe r of religious terr orist groups, many of which were Islamic fundamentalist, increased six-fold. In contrast, the number of Marxist-Leninist groups has remained fairly steady, while the numbe r of ethnic terrorist groups has declined. Not only have religious terrorist groups incr eased in number, but they have also become increasingly more violent as a way of fulfilling their mandate from God. xxix Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) Formed in 1987 as an outgrowth of the Muslim Brotherhood, HAMAS is a loosely structured organization. It is the principal political ri val of Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization in the occupied territories. HAM AS has engaged in terrorist operations in the Gaza Strip and West Bank and has strident ly opposed any settleme nt with the Israeli government. During 1994, HAMAS worked to undermine the legitimacy of the Provisional Palestinian government in the Gaza Strip and conducted several major acts of terrorism against Israel. The most prominent of these incidents was a suicide attack on an Israeli bus on the main street in Tel Aviv. This incident killed 23 people. HAMAS has links to Iran and has cons istently opposed U.S. polic y in the Middle East. The organization has been openly involved in pr opaganda and fund raisi ng operations in the United States. xxx Of all of the Islamic militant groups, HAMAS has developed the most sophisticated U.S. infrastructure, including charitable, political, social, and m ilitary activities. HAMAS has conducted training in the United St ates on military tactics and the building of explosive devices. Musa Abu Marzuk, the international political director of HAMAS, was recently arrested by immigration authorities in the United States, and his extradition to Israel for terrorist activiti es is currently pending. Marz uk was a resident alien in the United States until 1993 and is credited with creating much of the HAMAS infrastructure in the United States. HAMAS has threatened to conduct terrorist at tacks in the United States if Marzuk is extradited to Israel. xxxi Party of God (Hizballah) Hizballah, a radical Shia group, was formed in Lebanon in 1982-1983 as a result of the merger of Hussein Musawi's Islamic Amal a nd the Lebanese branch of the Da'wa Party. Hizballah, which is closely allied with Iran, wishes to create an Islamic republic in Lebanon. It is believed that Hizballah was responsible for the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Lebanon and the Marine barracks in Beirut, and the kidnapping and murder of Western hostages in Lebanon. Hizballah has demonstrated the ability to conduct terrorist operations outside the Middle East and has claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in March 1992. Hizballah receives substantial amounts of financia l, training, weapons, explosives , political, diplomatic, and organizational aid from Iran. It is believ ed that Hizballah has a significant support infrastructure in the United States capable of carrying out terrorist operations. However, at this time, there is no evidence that Hizb allah is contemplating any type of attack against the United States. Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-15 Hizballah likely would coordinate any ope ration with elements of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps who are believed to have entered the United States in the late 1980s on student visas.xxxii Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) The PIJ originated in the Gaza Strip during th e 1970s. Rather than a cohesive entity, the group appears to be a loose coalition of f actions. The PIJ is dedicated to creating an Islamic state in Palestine and destroying Isr ael. In 1994, the PIJ carried out a number of attacks against Israel with the aim of destro ying the peace accord with the Palestinians. In January 1995, the PIJ claime d responsibility for the bombing of an Israeli bus stop at which Israeli soldiers were aw aiting transportation to their base. The attack killed 21 soldiers. The PIJ publicly has threatened to attack U.S. interests as well as Arab governments that the group believes have b een tainted by Western secularism. Iran, Sudan, and Syria provide aid to some PIJ factions.xxxiii The PIJ also has a sizable presence in the United States with support activities in Tampa, FL; Chicago, IL; and Brooklyn, NY.xxxiv Abu Nidal Organization (ANO) Since 1974, the ANO has carried out over 90 terror ist attacks in 20 c ountries, killing or injuring more than 900 people. The ANO has an overseas support structure which includes an intelligence collection activity that is active in the United States. ANO has targeted the United States, United Kingdom, Fr ance, Israel, moderate Palestinians, the PLO, and various Arab countries. The ANO ha s demonstrated the cap ability to conduct operations worldwide. xxxv Islamic Group (Al-Gama'a al-islamiyya) The Islamic Group is an Egyptian Islamic extr emist group whose spiritu al leader is Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. The group's goal is to overthrow the government of Hosni Mubarak and replace it with an Islamic state. Members of this gr oup's predecessor were involved in the assassination of Anwar Sadat and have conducted terrorist attacks inside Egypt. Having strongly condemned the United St ates for its participation in Middle East politics and its support of the Mubarak gove rnment, leaders of the Islamic Group have urged their followers to punish the United Stat es., The groups financial, logistics, and training support seems to come mainly from Iran and Sudan. Sheik Rahman and a number of his followers were tried in Federal district court in New York for conspiring to conduct a series of te rrorist attacks in Ne w York City during 1993. xxxvi Terrorism Trends As they are becoming more violent, te rrorist groups also have expanded the range of targets that they consider legitimate. Bria n Jenkins, formerly the director of the Rand Corporation's Program on Subnational Conflict, has postulated three reasons for this Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-16 trend. First, as generational replacement has occurred in terrorist organizations, new leaders have become less concerned with ideological constraints and adverse public opinion. As a result, they are more willing to use excessively violent or shocking tactics. Second, leaders desire to maintain media attent ion. Limited acts of terrorism repeated over time have failed to gain desired media atte ntion. To receive attention, terrorists have escalated the level of violence and have used bolder, more shocking tactics designed to force the media and the public to pay atten tion to the terrorist group and its demands. Finally, the internal dynamics of terrorist groups require that th e organization move inexorably toward its goals. Increasi ngly violent tactics allow group members to perceive that they are increasingly powerful and are likely to achieve their objectives.xxxvii Data gathered from 1968 to 1990 substa ntiates the trend that the number of terrorist groups is increasing and that groups are also more violent. In 1990, there were 70 active terrorist groups throughout the world, comp ared to 11 identifiable groups in 1968. Although the number of terrorist incidents identified in th e 1980s increased by only one- third over those identified in the 1970s, the le vel of violence increased dramatically. In the 1980s, the number of deaths worldwide attr ibuted to terrorism doubled. There was a 75 percent increase in the numbe r of terrorist inci dents resulting in fatalities, a 115 percent increase in incidents re sulting in 5 or more deaths , and a 135 percent increase in incidents resulting in 10 or more deaths. Pinkerton Risk Assessment Services, an organization that tracks terrorist incident s, recorded an unprecedented 5,404 terrorist incidents in 1992, resulting in over 10,000 d eaths. These incidents represent an 11 percent increase over 1991 figures. Part of this pattern is at tributable to the growth of religious terrorism. Religious terrorists differ from traditional ideological terrorists in that the former are willing to sacrifice to obt ain their objective. Consequently, religious terrorists are more likely to use indiscriminate violence. They see themselves as involved in a total war in which there are no innocent parties. In determining operational matters, religious terrorists also are larg ely unconcerned with public opinion. As discussed earlier, some terrorist groups are evolving into new organizational structures that are harder to detect and in filtrate. These terrori st groups are often a collection of factions with common interests. Accordingly, the groups form, change, and regroup in response to specific agendas or planned actions. The groups tend to be religious or ethnic orga nizations that often have major gr ievances with the United States. The extremist factions of Islamic fundamen talist groups that are currently emerging fit this pattern. While many are funded by Ira n or supported by Sudan, the emerging groups are not controlled or directed by either state. Instead, they tend to be autonomous in their planning and decision-making functions. Accord ing to William Webster, former Director of Central Intelligence, there may be dozens of such groups in the United States waiting for the opportunity to strike. The large number of these groups as well as their lack of central direction and changing organizational structures, make them very difficult to crack. Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-17 Finally, a trend may be developing rega rding a sponsoring state's use of terrorists to conduct a proxy war against the United States. Terrorist groups offer the sponsoring state a deniable method to attack primary U.S. in terests. In turn, sponsoring states would provide terrorist groups with funding, access to weapons technologies, intelligence, target planning support, logistics support, and secure communications. In times of crisis or conflict, the use of terrorists as proxies is the aspect of terr orism that appears to be the most dangerous to U.S. interests because attacks could be directed at f acilities critical to force mobilization or crisis management. Conclusion To succeed, terrorist operations requi re detailed information for planning and executing an attack. Many of these organizatio ns have access to intelligence produced by sponsor states or have the ab ility to produce intelligence re quired for an attack. OPSEC can be used to deny adversaries informati on on the movements of key personnel, or the identity and vulnerabilities of critical facilities. The O PSEC process can assist program managers in determining the best security program to protect agai nst terrorist attack based upon assessed risk levels and the cost of implementing security countermeasures. OPSEC procedures can be used to deny terrorists the critical information that they require to plan an attack, and security counter measures can be implemented that are commensurate with the a ssessed level of risk. Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-18 The Threat of Domestic Terrorism by Lynn Fischer DoD Security Institute While the international terrorist threat to U.S. persons and property is the continuing concern of U.S. defense and law enforcement organizations, there is another dimension to contemporary terrorism that must receive at le ast as much attention in security awareness programs: domestic terrorism. This brand of programmed vi olence which also has the objective of influencing governmental policy or public opinion, however, is homegrown. The recent increase in domestic violence is sa id to be associated with the rise of antigovernment sentiment and the prolifera tion of self-styled militia and paramilitary groups some of which take extremist positions on race, religion, federal authority, gun control, or taxation. Not all bombings in this country fall under th e category of domestic terrorism, but most of the violence associated with anti-government al attacks takes this form. According to a recent Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Fir earms (ATF) report, bombings or attempted bombings increased from 2,098 in 1990 to 3,199 in 1994 (the latest year available), a 52% increase. xxxviii Property damage from bombi ngs rose to $7.5 million, with 308 people injured and 31 killed. Not included in the report was the tragic Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. What's going on here? How can this be explained? Some ATF experts call attention to the ready availability of materials and easy access to instructions and explosives information on the Internet. Others point to the copy-cat effect follow ing Oklahoma City, ange r or revenge against specific persons or agencies, or more omi nous cultural or sociological trends. The purpose of this article is not to explain the mindset, values, or motivations of those who would commit acts of domestic terrorism, but to document the fact that there is a growing threat to government fa cilities and federal emplo yees throughout the nation. What we as security educators or entruste d federal employees or service members need to be aware of is that terrorism has become not just a special concern for personnel who travel or live overseas. In very recent years it has become a s ubject of special interest for all of us, no matter how far from the border or re motely located we are. In fact several of the more-terrorist-related events have occurred in places where we would have least expected it. Although not proven in court to be domestic terrorism, the destruction of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Okla homa, America's heartland, in April of 1995, was a terrorist act which few of us would ev er have thought possible. Over 100 Federal employees and members of their famili es died in that tragic event. Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-19 What follows is a review of some of the lesser known events al so involving federal facilities or personnel, most of which fo llowed the Oklahoma City bombing. These successful or attempted acts of terrorism whic h were reported in the public media clearly have domestic (as opposed to foreign) instigators: March 1995, Central Minnesota. Two members of an anti-tax Minnesota militia, the Patriots Council, were convicted of making an illegal batch of ricin, a toxic derivative of the castor bean, that they pla nned to use against law-enforcement officers who had served legal papers on members of the group. Dougl as Baker and Leroy Wheeler are the first offenders to be convicted under the Biological Weapons and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989. In August, indictments were returned agai nst two additional alleged conspirators. According to trial testimony, members of th e group planned to poison U.S. agents by placing ricin on doorknobs and to blow up a federal building. October 11, 1995, The Arizona Desert. Unknown terrorists dera il a passenger train 60 miles southwest of Phoenix. One person was killed and 80 injured when the Amtrak train jumped the track and plunged over a br idge. Saboteurs had removed a section of track and bridged the gap with wire to di sable the electronic warning system. Notes found at the scene referred to the federal sieg e at Waco and to Ruby Ridge. At least one note was signed \"Sons of Gestapo,\" a group unknown to terrorism experts. November 13,1995, Muskogee, Oklahoma. A self-proclaimed \"antigovernment prophet,\" Ray Willie Lampley and three others are charged with plotting a series of bombings against abortion clinics, homose xual gathering places, welfare offices and offices of the Anti-Defamation League and th e Southern Poverty Law Center. The four members of the Oklahoma Constitutional Militia were arrested before any of their plans were carried out and charged with conspiracy to manufacture and po ssess bombs to blow up federal offices in several cities. Lamp ley and two others were found guilty of the bomb charges in April 1996. December 18, 1995, Reno, Nevada. Two unemployed and heavily indebted construction workers, Ellis Hurt and Joseph Bailie attempted to bomb the Reno, Nevada, office of the Internal Revenue Service. The pair placed a bomb made of about 100 pounds of fertilizer and kerosene with a lit fuse in a parking lot next to the IRS building. However, the triggering mechanism failed and bomb did not ignite. Authorities on the scene believe that many deaths and injuries would have occurred had it gone off. Bailie was described by an assistant U.S. Attorney as a man obsessed with the IRS who boasted that he had not paid taxes since 1985. Hurst testified against Bailie and was sentenced to 10 years. Both were convicted of conspi racy, attempted destruction of a government building, and the use of an explosive device while committing a violent crime. Bailie received a 36-year sentence. January 6, 1996, Espanola, New Mexico: A bomb exploded outside of a U.S. Forest Service headquarters. The blast caused $25,000 damage to the offices but no injuries as it occurred on a Saturday night. A Forest Serv ice employee in Nevada has been targeted Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-20 twice. His unoccupied office was hit by a pipe bomb in March 1995 and another blew up a van parked outside his house in August. Hi s wife and daughter we re at home, but not injured. The Forest Service has been involve d in local controvers ies over Federal land management, grazing, and logging. To date no significant leads have been reported. April 15,1996, Vacaville, California. The Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health office in Vacaville received a threat from a caller who said \"You guys are all dead. Timothy McVeigh lives on.\" Several hour s later a bomb exploded in the truck of a federal employee injuring him and his wife. The employee, an inspector at the mine office, and his wife were driving home when they heard an explosion and lost control of the vehicle. They escaped the truck before it burned, but were hospitalized. May 20, 1996, Laredo, Texas. An explosion blew out th e windows of a five-story office building which was the location of an FBI field office staffed by 12 agents. There were no injuries or structural damage. It is not known whether th e FBI was the intended target; the building housed a bank and several other offices . An anonymous caller claiming responsibility for the blast said he belonged to \"Organization 544.\" August 10, 1996, Austin, Texas. Charles Ray Polk was sentenced to more than 20 years for plotting to bomb the office of the U. S. Internal Revenue Service in Austin. Polk, a car salesman, had been convicted on six counts of explosives and firearms violations. Evidence presented at the trial showed that he ha d planned to plant more than a thousand pounds of explosives in the IRS service center. October 11, 1996, Clarksburg, West Virginia. Seven men having connections with a local antigovernment paramilitary group were ar rested on charges of plotting to blow up the Criminal Justice Information Services Di vision complex near Clar ksburg. The arrests were made as members of the West Virginia Mountaineer Militia were assembling large quantities of explosives and blasting caps. Militia leader Floyd Raymond Looker is alleged to have obtained blueprints of the FBI facility from a Clarksburg firefighter. Plastic explosives were confiscated by law enfo rcement officials at five locations in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. As in the Clarksburg case, effective prev entative law enforcement action surely saved many lives. In several instances, domestic te rrorists were apprehended before they could implement their deadly plans. And the a bove examples are not the complete story. Reports of other arrests related to terrorist conspiracies or to th e illegal possession of explosives are appearing frequently in the pr ess and news wires. Here is a sample of news items over the same time frame: In Las Vegas, New Mexico, a district attorn ey's office is hit with molotov cocktails. A Romanian immigrant is stopped as he attempts to board a flight at Tampa and is arrested for carrying five hand-made explosive devi ces, weapons, and 180 r ounds of ammunition. A man identified as a member of an antigovernment Freeman group is apprehended in Topeka, Kansas, after authorities find a bomb-trigge ring device in his car. In April of this Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-21 year, two members of the Georgia Republic Mi litia are arrested after plotting to make dozens of pipe bombs. The accused claim they were arming themselves for war against the United Nations and the New World Order. In June, 12 members of the so-called Vipe r Militia in Phoenix are arrested for a conspiracy to make bombs and other weapons . On November 17, three of the members are convicted for conspiring to use deadly w eapons. In July 1996, the FBI arrests eight people including four members of an anti government militia in Bellingham, Washington, for possession of guns and explosives . The ei ght are accused of arming themselves for a clash with the government. In the same month, four memb ers of the Washington State Militia and four members of a Seattle-ba sed Freeman group are arrested on Federal conspiracy charges. The eight are accused of arming themselves for war against the U.S. Government or the United Nations. In Se ptember, a Staten Island, New York, man who was stockpiling weapons for \"an up-coming battle with a secret organization\" is arrested by ATF agents. The bottom line for federal personnel What does all of this mean in terms of eff ective action on our part to counter the threat of domestic or even foreign-sponsored terrori sm? For the security educator, as always, after having established the credibility of the thre at, the next step is to tell us what to do about it. Part of the answer is found in remarks of Senator Mike DeWine quoted in the Cleveland Plain Dealer following the Oklahoma City bombing. Commenting on recent acts of domestic terrori sm, Senator DeWine stated that strong undercover work has no substitute and that these events reinforce the need for human intelligence penetration into these terrorist groups. He went on to say, \"Human intelligence is the only way you find information that will prevent actions such as this.\" The corollary to this is that good human inte lligence depends on the free flow of relevant and timely communications to law enforcement officials who then can take action. The best source of this information is an alert, aware, and committed workforce who are in a position to see things and hear things which might signal a life-threatening situation or conspiracy to destroy U.S. government facilities. Preventative action A related article in this issue of the Bulletin , focuses on the issue of employee involvement in the process of counterintellig ence investigations. In \"Looking for the Unexpected\" we discuss the recent White House security guidance on anomalies-the recognition and reporting of unexp ected behavior, patterns, or events which are clues that an adversarial interest ha s penetrated our security. The reporting of anomalies to stop espionage is essentially the same idea as keeping law enforcement and security authorities info rmed about indicators that might signal an intensified or immediate terrorist threat. In both situations U.S. government assets and Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-22 even lives are at risk, and aware and motivat ed employees and service members have an important role to play. This raises the question: What should be recognized as important, reportable indicators and events that security and law-enforcem ent professionals need to know about? The following list has been compiled from sugges tions made by counterterrorism experts for use in security education to combat dome stic terrorism. (For personal protection measures please consult anti-terrorism publi cations listed in this issue as available through the Office of the Jo int Chiefs of Staff.) Any of the following events might mean danger and should be a reason for an immediate report or for seeking advice from security or law enforcement officials: Anonymous tips, phone calls, or notes of a threatening nature which may identify groups or carry extremist messages. Surveillance by suspicious persons of federal offices or federal employees performing official duties. Unidentified or unattended packages, cans, or other containers left in or near government offices. Unattended and unoccupied vehicles parked in unauthorized or inappropriate locations, particularly those in close proxi mity to buildings or other structures. Requests for plans, blueprints, or engineer ing specification for federal buildings or commercially-owned buildings that house government offices, by those who have no official reason to have them. Unauthorized access even to unsecured areas by unknown or unidentified persons who have no apparent reason for being there. Packages or heavy envelopes which arri ve in the mail from unknown senders or which have a peculiar odor or appearance -- often without a clea r return address. Confrontation with angry, aggressively bell igerent, or threatening persons by federal officials in the performance of their official duties. Extremely threatening or violent behavior by co-workers who indi cate that they may resort to revenge against a group, company, or government agency. Articles From the Security Awareness Bulletin A-23 Living with the Threat We live with many dangers in our lives, ra nging from everyday household accidents to natural disasters. We do so without relentle ss fear. Just as we face the possibility of having our home burglarized or vandalized, we might also face similar crimes at our place of work. Terrorism is a fact of contemporar y life. It is important to be aware of the threat of violence and to take intelligent and reasonable steps to protect ourselves and government facilities. But it is also impor tant to know that we can do something to prevent it. Recent events have demonstrated that those who would use violent acts to achieve political objectives can be stopped in th eir tracks, before they kill or destroy, by vigilance and timely communications to those en trusted with the job of counterterrorism.

This abstract has been reviewed and approved by the Natio nal Security Council (NSC) for di stribution to Federal, State, and local emergency response a nd consequence management personnel to assist them in responding to terrorist emergencies. * The full text of PDD-39 is a CLASSIFIED document. State and local officials, however, should understand that PDD-39 essentia lly gives the responsib ility of response to terrorist attacks to the FBI for \"cri sis management\" and FEMA for \"consequence management.\" State and local ag encies and assets will be expected to support the Federal efforts. Presidential Decision Dir ective 39 (Unclassified) B-2 U.S. POLICY ON COUNTERTERRORISM Presidential Decision Directive (PDD-39) 1. General. Terrorism is both a threat to our na tional security as well as a criminal act. The Administration has stated that it is the policy of the United States to use all appropriate means to deter, defeat, and respond to all terrorist attack s on our territory and resources, both people and facilities, wherever they occur. In support of these efforts, the United States will: Employ efforts to deter, preempt, a pprehend, and prosecute terrorists. Work closely with other governments to car ry out our counterterrorism policy and combat terrorist threats against them. Identify sponsors of terrorists, isolate th em, and ensure they pay for their actions. Make no concessions to terrorists. 2. Measures to Combat Terrorism. To ensure that the United States is prepared to combat terrorism in all its forms, a number of measures have been directed. These include reducing vulnera bilities to terrorism, deterring and responding to terrorist acts, and having capabilities to prevent and mana ge the consequences of terrorist use of nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) weapons, including t hose of mass destruction. a. Reducing Vulnerabilities. In order to reduce our vulnerabilities to terrorism, both at home and abroad, all department/agency heads have been directed to ensure that their personnel and facilities are fully protected ag ainst terrorism. Specific efforts that will be conducted to ensure our security against terrorist acts include the following: Review the vulnerability of government facilities and cri tical national infrastructure. Expand the program of counterterrorism. Reduce the vulnerabilities affecting civilia n personnel/facilities abroad and military personnel facilities. Exclude/deport persons who pose a terrorist threat. Prevent unlawful traffic in firearms and e xplosives, and protect the President and other officials against terrorist attack. Reduce U.S. vulnerabilities to intern ational terrorism through intelligence collection/analysis, counterintelligence, and covert action. Presidential Decision Dir ective 39 (Unclassified) B-3 b. Deter. To deter terrorism, it is necessary to provide a clear public position that our policies will not be affected by terrorist ac ts and we will vigorously deal with terrorist sponsors to reduce terrorist capab ilities and support. In this regard, we must make it clear that we will not allow terrorism to succeed and that the pursuit, arrest, and prosecution of terrorists is of the highest pr iority. Our goals in clude the disruption of terrorist-sponsored activity including termination of financial support, arrest an d punishment of terrorists as criminals, application of U.S. laws and new legislation to prevent terrorist groups from operating in the United States, and application of extraterritorial stat utes to counter acts of terrorism and apprehend terrorists outside of the United States. Return of terrorists overseas, who are wanted for violation of U.S. la w, is of the highest priority and a central issue in bilateral relations with any state that harbors or assists them. c. Respond. To respond to terrorism, we must ha ve a rapid and decisive capability to protect Americans, defeat or arrest terro rists, respond against terrorist sponsors, and provide relief to the victims of terrorists. The goal during the im mediate response phase of an incident is to terminate terrorist atta cks so that the terrorists do not accomplish their objectives or maintain their freedom, while s eeking to minimize damage and loss of life and provide emergency assistance. After an incident has occurre d, a rapidly deployable interagency Emergency Support Team (EST) w ill provide required capabilities on scene: a Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST) for foreign incident s and a Domestic Emergency Support Team (DEST) for domestic incidents. DEST membership will be limited to those agencies required to respond to the specific incident. Both teams will include elements for specific ty pes of incidents such as nucl ear, biological, or chemical threats. The Director, FEMA, will ensure that the Federal Response Plan is adequate for consequence management activities in respons e to terrorist attack s against large U.S. populations, including those where weapons of mass destruction are involved. FEMA will also ensure that State response plans a nd capabilities are adequate and tested. FEMA, supported by all Federal Response Plan signatories, will assume Lead Agency role for consequence management in Washi ngton, DC and on scene. If large scale casualties and infrastructure damage occu r, the President ma y appoint a Personal Representative for consequence management as the on scene Fede ral authority during recovery. A roster of senior and former government officials willing to perform these functions will be created and the rostered individuals will be provided training and information necessary to allow th em to be called on short notice. Agencies will bear the costs of their participation in terrorist incidents and counterterrorist operations, unless otherwise directed. Presidential Decision Dir ective 39 (Unclassified) B-4 d. NBC Consequence Management. The development of effective capabilities for preventing and managing the consequences of terrorist use of nuc lear, biological, or chemical (NBC) materials or weapons is of th e highest priority. Te rrorist acquisition of weapons of mass destruction is not acceptabl e and there is no higher priority than preventing the acquisition of such materials/ weapons or removing this capability from terrorist groups. FEMA will review the Fede ral Response Plan on an urgent basis, in conjunction with supporting agencies, to dete rmine its adequacy in responding to an NBC-related terrorist incident; identify and remedy and shortfalls in stockpiles, capabilities, or training; and report on the status of these efforts in 180 days. The Federal Response Plan C-1 APPENDIX C THE FEDERAL RESPONSE PLAN TEXT OF SECTIONS I - VI The Federal Response Plan C-2 Federal Response Plan Text only, Sections I - VI (For Public Law 93-288, As Amended) BASIC PLAN I. INTRODUCTION In 1988, Public Law 93-288 was amended by P ublic Law 100-707 and retitled as the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Public Law 93-288, as amended). The Stafford Act provides the au thority for the Federal Government to respond to disasters and emergencies in orde r to provide assistance to save lives and protect public health, safety, and property. The Federal Response Plan (for Public Law 93- 288, as amended), hereafter referred to as the Plan, is designed to address the consequenc es of any disaster of emergency situation in which there is a need for Federal res ponse assistance under the authorities of the Stafford Act. It is applicable to natura l disasters such as earth quakes, hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, and volcanic erupti ons; technological emergencies involving radiological or hazardous ma terial releases; and other incidents requiring Federal assistance under the Act. The Plan describes the basic mechanisms and structures by which the Federal government will mobilize resources and conduc t activities to augment State and local response efforts. To facilitate the provision of Federal assistance which a State is most likely to need under twelve Emergency Support Functions (ESFs). Each ESF is headed by a primary agency, which has been selected based on its authorities, resources and capabilities in the particular functional area . Other agencies have been designated as support agencies for one or more ESF based on their resources and capabilities to support the functional area. The twelve ESFs serv e as the primary mechanism through which Federal response assistance will be provide d to the affected State under the overall coordination of the Federal Coordinating Offi cer (FCO) appointed by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on behalf of the President. The Plan serves as the foundation for the fu rther development of detailed headquarters and regional plans and procedures to impl ement Federal response activities in a timely and efficient manner to support State response activities. A. Purpose The Plan establishes an architecture for a systematic, coordinated, and effective Federal response. The purpose of the Plan is to: The Federal Response Plan C-3 Establish fundamental assumptions and policies; Establish a concept of operations that provides an interagency coordination mechanism to facilitate the immedi ate delivery of the Federal response assistance; Incorporate the coordination mechan isms and structures of other appropriate Federal plans and responsi bilities into the overall response Assign specific functional responsib ilities to appropriate Federal departments and agencies Identify actions that participating Federal departments and agencies will take in the overall Federal response , in coordination with the affected State. B. Scope The Plan applies to all Federal govern ment departments and agencies which are tasked to provide response assistance in a disaster or emergency situation. It describes Federal actions to be taken in providing immediate response assistance to one or more affected States. Under the Plan, a State means any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Microne sia, or the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Response assistance includes those acti ons and activities which support State and local government efforts to save lives, protect public health and safety, and protect property. The identified actio ns and activities in the Plan, carried out under the ESFs, are based on the existing Federal agency statutory authorities or on specific functiona l mission assignments made under the provisions of P.L.93-288, as amended, and identified in the ESF Annexes to the Plan. The Plan does not specifically addr ess recovery assistance, including the provision of temporary housing, loans, and grants to individuals; business loans; and grants to lo cal and State government entities provided under the disaster assistance programs of FEMA a nd other agencies. However, in most instances, recovery activiti es will be conducted conc urrently with response activities. In some instances, a disaster or emer gency may result in a situation which affects the national security of the United States. For those instances, appropriate national security authorities and procedures will be utilized to address the national security re quirements of the situation. The Federal Response Plan C-4 C. Organization As shown in figure 1, the plan consists of the following: The Basic Plan, describing the purpose, scope, situation, policies and concept of operations of Federal response activity in a disaster. Appendices to the Basic Plan, includi ng a list of acronyms/abbreviations, terms and definitions, and au thorities and directives. Functional Annexes to the Basic Plan describing the pol icies, situation, planning, assumptions, concept of opera tions and responsibilities for each ESF. Support Annexes to the Basic Plan describing the areas of Financial Management, Public Informati on, and Congressional Relations. II Policies A. Authorities 1. In providing response assistance und er the Plan, Federal departments and agencies are covered under the authorities of P.L. 93-288, the President may direct any Federal agen cy to utilize its authorities and resources in support of State and loca l assistance efforts. This authority has been further delegated to th e Director, FEMA, the Associate Director, State and Local Program s and Support (SLPS), and to the FEMA Regional Directors in carrying out the provis ions of the Stafford Act. 2 Response by departments and agencies to lifesaving and life protecting requirements under the Plan has precedence over other Federal response activities, except where national security implications are determined to be of a higher priority. Support from departments and agencies will be provided to the extent that it does not conflict with other emergency missions which a department or agen cy is required to carry out. 3 The Plan does not supplant existing plans or authorities, such as the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) or the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (FRERP), which have been developed for resp onse to incidents under department and agency statutory authorities othe r than the Stafford Act. However, the Plan may be used to supplement these plans and authorities, as required, to provide and effective response. The Federal Response Plan C-5 B. Assignment of Responsibilities The Plan provides standing mission assignments to the designated departments and agencies with primar y and support respons ibilities to carry out ESF activities. Federal departments and agencies designated as primary agencies serve as Federal executive agents under the FCO in accomplishing the ESF response missions. Upon activation of an ESF, a primary agency is authorized, in coordination with the FCO and the State, to initiate and continue the actions to carry out th e ESF missions described in the ESF Annexes to the Plan, including tasking of designated support agencies to carry out assigned ESF missions. C. Response Requirements Federal assistance provided under P. L.93-288, as amended, to supplement State and local government response effo rts. ESFs will coordinate with the FCO and the affected State to identify specific response requirements and will provide Federal response a ssistance based on State-id entified priorities. D. Response Coordination 1. Each ESF will provide resources using its primary and support authorities and capabilities, in coor dination with other ESFs, to support its missions. ESFs will allocate available resources to each declared State based on priorities identified in conjunction with the State and in coordination with the FCO. If resources are not available within the declared State, the ESF will seek to provide them from a primary or support agency area or region. If the re source is unavailable from an area or region, the requirement will be forwarded to the appropriate ESF headquarters office fo r further action. 2. In the case where a conflict of prioriti es develops as a result of more than one ESF needing the same resource, the affected ESFs will work directly with the FCO to resolve the situation. If the FCO cannot resolve the conflict, the matter will be referred to the national Emergency Support Team (EST), and then to the Ca tastrophic Disast er Response Group (CDRG), if necessary, for final reso lution. The national EST also serves as a central source for information on the availability of resources nationally for use in response operations. E. Recovery Operations Although this Plan addresses response act ivities of departments and agencies, under P.L.93-288, the FCO is also responsible for coordinating recovery The Federal Response Plan C-6 activities to provide assistance to the affected State, as required. Recovery operations will be initiated commensura te with State priorities and based on the availability of resources which do not conflict with response operations. F. Operating Facilities In support of response activities under the Plan, several kinds of operating facilities have been identified to faci litate the movement and utilization of personnel and resources in the affected area. Operating faci lities are grouped under two categories : 1. Single support facilitie s, such as a casualty collection point, used primarily to support the operati ons of a single ESF; and 2. Multiple support facilities used to support the operations of several ESFs. Multiple support facilities, alo ng with their letter designations, include the following: Regional Operations Center - A Regi onal Operations Center (ROC) is the facility established at the FEMA Regional Office (or a Federal Regional Center) in response to (or in anticipation of) an event that may require Federal assistance under the Plan. The ROC is staffed by FEMA regional personnel and representatives from the ESF primary agencies as required. It serves as an initial poi nt-of-contact in the region for the affected State(s), the national EST and Federal agencies. Point of Departure - A Point of De parture (POD) is the designated location (typically an ai rport) outside of the di saster-affected area from which response personnel and resources will deploy to the disaster area. Point of Arrival - A Point of Arri val (POA) is the designated location (typically an airport) within or ne ar the disaster-affected area where newly-arriving staff, supplies and eq uipment are initially directed. Upon arrival, personnel and other resource s are dispatched to either the Disaster Field Office (DFO), a M obilization Center, Staging Area or directly to a disaster site. Assembly Point - An Assembly Point (AP) is the designated location near the disaster-affect ed area where newly-arri ving personnel register, receive an orientation regarding the di saster situation a nd are assigned to a specific duty station. The AP could be located at the POA or at the DFO, once they are established. The Federal Response Plan C-7 Marshaling Area - A marshaling area (M) is an area used for the complete mobilization and assemblage of personnel and resources prior to their being sent to the disaster -affected area. Marshaling Areas are utilized particularly for disasters outside of the continental United States. Mobilization Center - A Mobilizatio n Center (MC) is the designated location at which response personnel and resources are received from the POA and pre-positioned for deploym ent to a local Staging Area or directly to an incident site, as re quired. An MC also provides temporary support services, such as food and billeting, for response personnel prior to their deployment. Staging Area - A staging Area (S) is th e facility at the local jurisdictional level near the disaster site where personnel and equipment are assembled for the immediate deployment to an operational site within the disaster area Base Camp - A Base Camp (C) is th e designated location under local or State control within the disaster ar ea which is equipped and staffed to provide sleeping facilities, food, water, and sanitary services to response personnel. Disaster Field Office - A Disaster Field Office (DFO) is the primary field location in each affected State for the coordination of response and recovery operations. It houses the FCO and staff comprising the Emergency Response Team (ERT). It will operate 24-hours a day, as needed, or with a schedule suffici ent to sustain the Federal response operations. Except where facilities do not permit, the FCO will be co-located with the State Coordinati ng Officer (SCO) at the DFO. G. Multi-State Response One or more disasters may affect a numb er of States and regions concurrently. In those instances, the Federal govern ment will conduct multi-State response operations; for each declared State, an FCO will be appointed to coordinate the specific requirements for Federal re sponse and recovery within the State. Under multiple State declarations, ESF departments and agencies will be required to coordinate th e provision of resources to support the operations of all of the declared States. H. Donations 1. The Federal government encourages the giving of cash to private non- profit voluntary organizati ons involved in disaster relief, rather than The Federal Response Plan C-8 specific donation of clothing, food, and other goods. Should goods or services be offered, the Federal government will coordinate the transportation and distribution of only those donations it accepts for use. To facilitate this policy, the Federa l government will issue appropriate press releases in conjunction with States and voluntary organizations, establish a central phone number for handling donations inquiries and set up a database for recording offers of goods and volunteer services. 2. Donations coordinators will be designated at FEMA Headquarters, at each DFO and at State locations, as needed, to work with the ESFs in managing donations. FEMA will ensure that a database is made available to the ESFs to identify n eeded goods and servic es or to respond to offers of goods and services. Should an ESF wish to take advantage of the offer of a donated good or servic e, that ESF is responsible for contacting the potential donor and ar ranging for the receipt, transport and distribution, or acquisition of the donated good or service. I. Law Enforcement 1. Each State has the general responsibility for law enforcement, utilizing local resources, and State resources, including the Nati onal Guard (to the extent that the National Guard remain s State authority and has not been called into Federal service or ordered into active duty). In some cases, a State government may experience a law enforcement emergency (including one in connection with a disa ster or emergency) in which it is unable to provide an adequate respon se to an uncommon situation which requires law enforcement assistance, wh ich is or threatens to become of serious or epidemic (large-scale) pr oportions, and with respect to which State and local resources are inadequa te to protect lives and property of citizens, or to enforce the criminal. 2. In the event that such a law enfo rcement emergency exists throughout a State or part of a State (on behalf of itself or a local unit of government) may submit an application in writin g from the Chief Executive Officer of the State to the Attorney Genera l of the United States to request emergency Federal law enforcement assistance under the Justice Assistance Act of 1984, (42 U.S.C., Section 10501-10513) as prescribed in 28 C.F.R., Part 65. The Attorney General will approve or disapprove the application no later than 10 days after receipt. If the application is approved, Federal law enforcement assistance may be provided to include equipment, training, intelligence or personnel. 3. In the event that a serious law enforcement emergency or civil disturbance constitutes an insurrect ion against a State government under The Federal Response Plan C-9 10 U.S.C. 331, the State le gislature or the Gover nor (if the legislature cannot be convened) may request, thr ough the Attorney General, that the President call into Federal Service the militia (National Guard) of any State, and use the Armed Forces, to end the emergency or suppress the disturbance. 4. In the event that a serious law enforcement emergency or civil disturbance makes impractical or ot herwise hinders the enforcement of the laws of the United States and/or deprives any part of a State's population of Constitutional rights and privilege s under 10 U.S.C. 332-333, the President may call into Fede ral service the militia (National Guard) of any State, and use the Ar med Forces, to end the emergency or suppress the disturbance. 5. Procedures for coordinating De partment of Defense (DOD) and Department of Justice (DOJ) responses to law enforcement emergencies arising under 10 U.S.C. 331-333 are set forth in the Interdepartmental Action Plan for Civil Distur bances, dated April 1, 1969. J. Nonliability Under Section 305 of the Stafford Act, a Federal agency or designated employee of a Federal agency, including the American Red Cross (ARC) and its employees and volunteers, performi ng a function under the authority of P.L.93-288, as amended, are not liable fo r any claim based upon the exercise or performance of or the failure the ex ercise or performance of that function. K. Financial Management FEMA funding for response activities w ill be made available to participating agencies performing tasks under the Plan in a manner consistent with provisions of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C.5121 et seq., and applicable regulations. Reimbursement will be provided in accordance with policies and procedures outlined in the Financial Management Annex and in regulations contained in 44 CFR Part 206. L. Public Information 1. Public information activities wi ll be undertaken to ensure the coordinated, timely, and accurate releas e of a wide range of information to the news media and to the public about disaster-related activities. These activities will be ca rried out in a Joint In formation Center (JIC) established in the disaster area and st affed with Federal, State, and local public affairs representatives. Inform ation intended for the news media The Federal Response Plan C-10 and the public will be coordinated pr ior to release with the FCO, other Federal departments and agencies, and with State and local officials. 2. A JIC also will be set up at FEMA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., based upon the need to provide support to the field activities for either a single-State disaster or multi-State disasters. 3. Procedures regarding public inform ation are described in the Public Information Annex to the Plan. M. Congressional Relations 1. Congressional liaison will be estab lished to provide information to the Washington, D.C., and district offi ces of Members of Congress and to respond to questions, concerns, and problems raised by their constituents. The activities will be managed by the Congressional Liaison Officer (CLO), who will be managed by the Congressional liaison personnel from all Federal de partments and agencies involved in the response, and by a congression al liaison element at FEMA Headquarters on Washington. 2. On-scene congressional relations staff will be located at the JIC established in the disaster area. At this JIC, a deputy CLO will maintain continuing liaison with the public af fairs personnel at the headquarters JIC and with the congres sional liaison element at FEMA Headquarters. The on-scene congressional relations staff also will provide information pertaining to requests for hearings and special legislation to the headquarters congression al liaison element. 3. Information to be released to congr essional offices and constituents will be coordinated among participating Federal departments and agencies and with State and local officials, as appropriate, prior to release. 4. Both the congressional relations st aff on-scene and at the national level will conduct briefings for Members of Congress and their staffs. Timing, format, and content of these briefing will be determined by the CLO in coordination with the FCO and the SCO, as appropriate. 5. Procedures regarding congressional relations and liaison are described in the Congressional Relations Annex to the Plan The Federal Response Plan C-11 N. After-Action Reports Following Federal response to a di saster under the Plan, FEMA will coordinate the preparation of an afte r-action report documenting the Federal response effort. Each Federal department and agency involved in the response effort will keep records of its activity to assist in preparing the after-action report. III. Situation A. Disaster Condition 1. A disaster or emergency may overwhelm the capabilities of a State and its local governments in providing a timely and effective response to meet the needs of the situation. For ex ample, the occurrence of a large or catastrophic earthquake in a high- risk, high-population area will cause casualties, property loss, disruption of normal life support systems, and will impact the regional economic, physic al, and social infrastructures. 2. A disaster or emergency has the pote ntial to cause substantial health and medical problems, with hundreds or t housands of deaths and injuries, depending on factors such as times of occurrence, severity of impact, existing weather conditions, area de mographics, and the nature of building construction. Deaths and injuri es will occur principally from the collapse of manmade structures and co llateral events, such as fires and mudslides. 3. A disaster or emergency may cause significant damage particularly to the economic and physical infrastruc ture. An earthquake may trigger fires, floods, or other events that wi ll multiply property losses and hinder the immediate emergency response effort. An earthquake or hurricane may significantly damage or destroy highway, airport, railway, marine, communications, water, waste disposal , electrical power, natural gas and petroleum transmission systems. B. Planning Assumptions 1. The Plan assumes that a disaster or emergency, such as an earthquake, may occur with little or no warning at a time of day that produces maximum casualties. The Plan also deals with other types of disasters, such as a hurricane, which could resu lt in a large number of casualties and cause widespread damage, or with the consequences of any event in which Federal response assistance unde r the authorities of the Stafford The Federal Response Plan C-12 act is required. In all cases, the Plan assumes that the response capability of an affected State will be quickly overwhelmed. 2. The large number of casualties and/ or the heavy damage to buildings, structures and the basic infrastructure will necessitate direct Federal government assistance to support St ate and local authorities in conducting lifesaving and lif e-supporting efforts. 3. As a result of persons being injured and others being trapped in damaged or destroyed structures, the likelihoo d of a significant number of deaths within 72 hours will require the imme diate response of Federal search and rescue personnel, and medical pe rsonnel, supplies and equipment to minimize preventable deaths and disabilities. 4. Federal departments and agencies ma y need to respond on short notice to provide effective and timely assistance to the State. Therefore, the Plan provides pre-assigned missions for Fe deral agencies to expedite the provision of response assistance to suppor t State and local efforts to save lives, alleviate suffering and protect property. 5. The declaration process under the Plan will be carried out under P.L. 93- 288, as amended. Under Title V, and as prescribed in 44 C.F.R., Part 205. Based on the severity and magnitude of the situati on, the Governor will request the President to declare a major disaster or an emergency for the State, and the President will i ssue a declaration, as warranted. The President will also appoint an FCO to coordinate th e overall activities under the declaration. 6. For certain situations, the Presiden t may declare an emergency with or without a Governor's request, as spec ified in Title V of P.L. 93-288, as amended. Under Title V, the President may direct the provision of emergency assistance either at th e request of a Governor (Section 501.(a)), or upon determination by the President that an \"emergency exists for which the primary responsibil ity rests with the United States...\" (Section501.(b)). 7. The ARC is deemed to be a Federa l agency for the purpose of the Plan. Though created by the United States Congress in 1905, the ARC is a private, charitable corporation w hose primary functions include the alleviation of human suffering caus ed by disaster or other natural catastrophe. The Federal Response Plan C-13 IV. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS A. General 1. During the period immediately followi ng a major disaster or emergency requiring Federal Response, primary agencies, when directed by FEMA, will take actions to identify requirements, and mobilize and deploy resources to the affected area to as sist the State in lifesaving and life- protecting response efforts. 2. Agencies have been grouped toge ther under the functional ESFs to facilitate the provision of response assistance to the State. These functions are transportation, communications, public works and engineering, firefighting, informati on and planning, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, urban search and rescue, hazardous materials, food and energy. If Federa l response assistance is required under the Plan, it will be provided using some or all of the ESFs, as necessary. 3. Each ESF has been assigned a numbe r of missions to provide response assistance to the State, the designated primary agency, acting as the Federal Executive Agent, and with th e assistance of one or more support agencies, is responsible for mana ging the activities of the ESF and ensuring that the missions are accomp lished. ESFs have the authority to execute response operations to direct ly support state needs. The primary and support agency assignments by e ach ESF are shown in Figure 2. 4. Specific ESF functional missions, or ganizational structures, response actions and primary and support agency responsibilities are described in the Functional Annexes to the Plan. 5. ESFs will coordinate directly with their functional counterpart State agencies to provide the assistance required by the State. Requests for assistance will be channeled from local jurisdictions through the designated State agencies for action. Based on State-identified response requirements, appropriate Federal re sponse assistance will be provided by an ESF to the State, or at the Stat e's request, directly to an affected local jurisdiction. 6. An FCO will be appointed by the Pr esident to coordinate the Federal activities in each declared State. The FCO will work with the SCO to identify overall requirements, including unmet needs and evolving support requirements, and coordinate these requirements with the ESFs. The Federal Response Plan C-14 The FCO will also coordinate public information, Congressional liaison, community liaison, outreach and donations activities, and will facilitate the provision of information and reports to appropriate users. 7. The FCO will head a regional inte ragency ERT, composed of ESF representatives and other support staff. The ERT provides initial response coordination with the affect ed State at the State Emergency Operations Center (EOC) or other de signated State facility and supports the FCO and ESF operations in the field. The FCO will coordinate response activities with the ESF representatives on the ERT to ensure that Federal resources are made available to meet the requirements identified by the State. 8. A national interagency EST, composed of ESF representative and other support staff, will operate at FEMA headquarters to provide support for the FCO and the ERT. 9. The CDRG, composed of represen tatives from all departments and agencies under the Plan, will operate at the national level to provide guidance and policy direction on re sponse coordination and operational issues arising from FCO and ESF re sponse activities. The CDRG is also supported by the EST and will operate from FEMA headquarters. 10. Activities under the Plan will be organized at various levels to provide partial response and recovery (utilizi ng selected ESFs) or to provide full response and recovery (u tilizing all ESFs). B. Organization The organization to implement the proce dures under the Plan is composed of standard elements at the national an d regional levels. The overall response structure is shown in Figure 3. It is designed to be flexible in order to accommodate the response and recovery requirements specific to the disaster. The response structure shows the com positions of the elements providing response coordination and response opera tions activities at the headquarters and regional levels, but does not necessa rily represent lines of authority or reporting relationships. In general, nati onal-level elements provide support to the regional-level elements which impl ement the on-scene response operations in the field. 1. National-level Response Structure The national-level response stru cture is composed of national interagency coordination and operati ons support elements from the The Federal Response Plan C-15 participating departments and agenci es. Overall interagency coordination activities are supported by the CDRG and EST at FEMA Headquarters. These elements will be augmented by department and agency operations support elements at other locations. As shown in Figure 4,The national-level response structure is composed of the following specific elements: a. Catastrophic Disaster Response Group (1) The CDRG is the headquarter s-level coordinating group which addresses policy issues and s upport requirements from the FCO and ESF response elements in the field. It is chaired by the FEMA Associate Director, SLPS, and incl udes representatives from the Federal departments and agencies which have responsibilities under the Plan. The CDRG addresses response issues and problems which require national-level deci sions of policy direction. The CDRG may be augmented by offici als from other organizations, not listed in the Plan, which ha ve resources, capabilities, or expertise needed for the response effort. (2) The CDRG will meet on an as-n eeded basis at the request of the CDRG Chairperson. Meetings , unless otherwise indicated, will be held at the Emergency Information and Coordination Center (EICC), located in FEMA Headquarters, Washington, DC. b. Emergency Support Team The EST is an interagency group comprised of representatives from each of the primary agenci es, select support agencies and FEMA Headquarters staff. It operates from the FEMA EICC. Detailed procedures regarding th e EST organization and operations are found in the \"EST Organizati on and Operational Procedures\" document published by FEMA. (1) The EST: (a) Supports the CDRG and assi sts in assuring interagency headquarters information and c oordination support for response activities; (b) Serves as the central source of information at the national level regarding the status of Federa l response activities and helps disseminate information (through a JIC) to the media, Congress and the general public; and The Federal Response Plan C-16 (c) Provides interagency resource coordination support to the FCO and regional response operati ons. In this capacity, the EST provides coordination support for FC O, ERT and ESF activities, as necessary. ESF representatives from the primary agencies provide liaison between field operations , their respective emergency operations centers (if applicable ) and headquarter s activities. The EST also coordinates offers of donations, including unsolicited resources offered by various indi viduals and groups, with field elements for use in response operations. (2) To accomplish the resources co ordination function, the EST: (a) Coordinates the acquisition of additional resources, which an ESF is unable to obtain under its own authorities, to support operations; (b) Advises the CDRG regarding th e need to resolve a resource conflict between two or more ESFs which cannot be resolved in the affected region(s); and (c) Supports coordination of resources for multi-State and multi-regional disaster response and recovery activities. c. Agency Operational Centers In addition to supporting EST activities at the FEMA EICC, headquarters departments and agen cies will conduct national-level response activities at their own EOCs. 2. Regional-level Response Structure The regional-level response struct ure is composed of interagency elements operating from various locati ons. Initially, representatives from the ESFs and FEMA will assemble at the ROC located at the FEMA Regional Office (or Federal Regional Center) . As needed, an Advance Element of the Emergency Respons e Office ( or Federal Regional Center). As needed, an Advance Element of the Emergency Response Team (ERT-A) will deploy to the field to assess or begin response operational as required. When fully operational, the regional-level response structure will include th e FCO and ERT in a DFO, with regional ESFs conducting response opera tions to provide assistance to each affected State. The regional st ructure is depicted in Figure 5. The Federal Response Plan C-17 a. Regional Operations Center The ROC is activated by the Re gional Director at a FEMA Regional Office. It is staffed by FEMA and representatives from the primary agencies and other agencies, as needed, to initiate and support Federal response activity. The ROC: (1) Gathers damage information regarding the affected area; (2) Serves as a point-of-contact for the affected State(s), national EST and Federal agencies; (3) Establishes communications links with the affected State(s), national EST and Federal agencies; (4) Supports deployment of the ERT(s) to field locations; (5) Implements information and planning activities (under ESF #5); and (6) Serves as a initial coordination office Federal activity until the ERT is established in the DFO in the field. (7) Supports coordination of resources for multi-State and multi-regional disaster response and reco very activities, as needed. The organization of the ROC is shown in Figure 6. b. Emergency response Team The ERT is the interagency group that provides administrative, logistical, and operational suppor t to the regional response activities in the field. The ERT includes staff from FEMA and other agencies who support the FC O in carrying out interagency activities. The ERT also provide s support for the dissemination of information to the media, Congress and the general public. Each FEMA Regional Office is responsible for rostering an ERT and developing appropriate procedur es for its notification and deployment. (1) Advance Element of the Emergency Response Team The ERT-A is the initial group to respond in the field to an incident. It is the nucleus of th e full ERT which operates from the DFO. As shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8, the Advance Element is The Federal Response Plan C-18 headed by a team leader from FE MA and is composed of FEMA program and support staff and repr esentatives from selected ESF primary agencies. It is orga nized with Administration and Logistics, Information and Pla nning, and Operations groups and includes staff for public informa tion, congressional liaison, and community liaison activities, as required. (a) A part of the ERT-A will deploy to the State EOC or the other locations to work directly with the State to obtain information on the impact of the event and to begin identifying specific State requirements for Federal response assistance. (b) Other members of the Advance Element, including leasing, communications and procurement re presentatives, and logistical and other support staff from FEMA, the General Services Administration (GSA), the Fede ral Emergency Communications Coordinator (FECC) or a representa tive, and the Forest Service, as required, will deploy directly to th e disaster site to identify or verify the location for a DFO; es tablish communications; and set up operations, including the es tablishment of one or more Mobilization Centers, as required. (2) Structure of the ERT As shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10, the ERT is composed of the following elements: (a) Federal Coordinating Officer The FCO is appointed on behalf of the President by the Director, FEMA. The FCO heads the ERT and is supported in the field by staff carrying out public inform ation, congressional liaison, community relations, outreach ( to disaster victims) and donations coordination activities. The FCO: (1) Coordinates overall response an d recovery activities with the State; (2) Works with the SCO to determ ine State support requirements and to coordinate these re quirements with the ESFs; (3) Tasks ESFs or any Federal agency to perform missions in the Plan and to perform additional missions not specifically addressed in the Plan; and The Federal Response Plan C-19 (4) Coordinates response issues and problems with the CDRG which require national-level de cisions or policy direction. (b) Administration and Logistics This element includes activities which provide facilities and services in support of response operations, as well as for recovery activities, Includes the DFO suppor t functions of administrative services, fiscal services, comput er support and a message center. (c) Information and Planning This element includes information and planning activities to support operations. It includes func tions to collect and process information; develop information into briefings, reports, and other materials; display pertinent inform ation on maps , charts and status boards; consolidate information for action planning; and provide technical services in the form of advice on specialized areas in support of operations. (d) Response Operations This element includes the ESFs which are activated to provide direct response assistance in s upport of State requirements. The functions include ESF #1 - Transportation, ESF #2 - Communications, ESF #3 Works and Engineering, ESF #4 ESF #6 - #7 - Medical Serv ices, ESF #9 - Urban Search and Rescue, ESF - Hazardous Materials, ESF#11 - Food, and ESF #12 - Energy. Each ESF is responsible for assessing State-identified Federal assistance re quirements and resource requests and to organize and direct appropriate ESF response operations. The ESF primary agency will identify the functional support requirements to be provided by its elf, support agencies and other ESFs. (e) Recovery Operations This Element includes the program activities of FEMA and other Federal agencies (OFAs) whic h provide disaster recovery assistance. This consists of Individual Assistance (including temporary housing, grants and loans to individuals, families and businesses); Public Assistance (inc luding debris cl earance, the The Federal Response Plan C-20 repair or replacement of roads, stre ets and bridges and the repair or replacement of water control facili ties, public buildings and related equipment, public utilities and the repair or restoration of recreational facilities and parks); and Hazard Mitigation Assistance (including measures to lessen or avert the threat of future disasters). (d) Defense Coordinating Officer The Defense Coordinating Officer (DCO) function is supported by the DOD. The DCO is provided by the DOD to serve in the field as the point of contact to the FCO a nd the ESFs regarding requests for military assistance. The DCO and staff coordinate support and provide liaison to the ESFs. C. Notification 1. FEMA may receive initial notificatio n or warning of a disaster from multiple sources, including the National Earthquake Information Service (NEIS) of the United States Geolog ical Survey (USGS); the National Weather Service (NWS) (including th e National Hurricane Center, the Severe Storms Forecast Center a nd the River Forecast Center); the Office of Territorial Affairs of th e Department of the Interior; The Nuclear Regulatory Commission Oper ations Center; the FEMA National Warning Center; a FEMA Regiona l Office; a State Emergency Operations Center; or the news media. 2. Upon the determination of the occurr ence of a disaster or emergency, the FEMA National Emergency Coordination Center (NECC) will notify key FEMA headquarters and regional o fficials. If there is a need for activation of response structures of the Plan, the NECC will notify CDRG and EST members at the nati onal level, as required. The NECC will also notify the National Respons e Center, as appropriate. At the regional level, the appropriate Regional Director will notify members of the regional ERT. 3. Upon notification by FEMA, each agen cy is responsible for conducting its own internal national a nd regional notifications. 4. CDRG members may be called to assemble at the FEMA EICC for an initial meeting. CDRG members or alte rnates must be available at the call of the CDRG Chairperson to m eet at any time during the initial response period, as necessary. The Federal Response Plan C-21 5. Detailed Federal headquarters a nd regional response notification action as are described in regional and headquarters procedures. D. Activation 1. The Plan will be utilized to addres s particular requirements of a given disaster or emergency situation. Sele cted ESFs will be activated based on the nature and scope of the event and the level of Federal resources required to support State and local response efforts. 2. Once a response requirement is identif ied, some or all of the structures of the Plan will be activated. This includes the establishment of the EST at headquarters level, the activation of some or all of the ESFs and the deployment of an ERT from the regional office. The sequence of actions that will be taken at the national level and at the regional level upon activation of the Plan is shown is Figure 11. 3. At the national level, the FE MA Associate Director, SLPS, in consultation with the FEMA Director, has the authority to activate part or all of the response structures at the headquarters leve l to address the specific situation. 4. At the regional level, a FEMA Re gional Director, in consultation with the Associate Director, SLPS and the FEMA Director, also may activate part or all of the response structures of the Plan within the Region for the purpose of providing response suppo rt to an affected State. 5.

INTRODUCTION In June 1995, the White House i ssued Presidential Decision Directive 39 (PDD-39), \" United States Policy on Counterterrorism. \" PDD-39 directed a number of measures to reduce the Nation's vulnerability to terrorism, to deter and respond to terrorist acts, and to strengthen capabilities to prevent and manage the consequences of terrorist use of nuclear, biologica l, and chemical (NBC) weapons including weapons of mass destructi on (WMD). PDD-39 discusses crisis management and consequence management. Crisis management includes measures to identify, acquire, and plan the use of resources needed to anticipate, prevent, and/or resolve a threat or act of terrorism. The laws of the United States assign primary authority to the Federal Government to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism; State and local governments provide assi stance as required. Crisis management predominantly a law enforcement response. Based on a the situation, a Federal crisis management response may be supported by technical operations, and by Federa l consequence management, which may operate concurrently (see Figure 1 ). Consequence management includes meas ures to protect public health and safety, restore essential government services, and provide emergency relief to governments, businesses and individuals affected by the consequences of terrorism. The laws of the United States assign primary authority to the States to respond to the consequences of terrorism; the Federal Government provides assistance as required.

Purpose The purpose of this Terrorism Incident Annex, hereafter referred to as the Annex, is to describe the Federal con cept of operations to implement PDD-39, when necessary, to respond to terrorist incidents within the United States. The Annex: 1. Describes crisis management. Gu idance is provided in other Federal plans. 2. Defines the policies and structures to coordinate crisis management with consequence management. Terrorism Annex D-5 3. Defines consequence management, which uses Federal Response Plan (FRP) structures, supplemented as necessary by structures that are normally activated through other Federal plans. B. Scope 1. The Annex applies to all threats or acts of terrorism within the United States that the White House determ ines require a Federal response. 2. The Annex applies to all Federal de partments and agencies that may be directed to respond to a threat or act of terrorism within the United States. 3. The Annex builds upon FRP concepts and procedures by addressing unique policies, assumptions, structures , responsibilities, and actions that will be applied for consequence management as necessary. II. POLICIES A. Lead Agency Responsibilities . PDD-39 validates a nd reaffirms existing Federal Lead Agency responsibilities for counterterrorism, which are assigned to the Department of Justice, as delegated to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for threats or acts of terrorism within the United States. It is FBI policy that crisis manage ment will involve only those Federal agencies requested by the FBI to provide expert guidance and/ or assistance, as described in the PDD-39 Domestic Guidelines (classified) and FBI Incident Contingency Plans (classified). B. Consequence Management . PDD-39 states that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shall ensure that the FRP is adequate to respond to the consequences of terror ism. FEMA, with the support of all agencies in the FRP, shall act in s upport of the FBI in Washington, DC, and on the scene of the crisis, unt il such time as the Attorn ey General shall transfer the Lead Agency role to FEMA (see Figure 2 ). FEMA retains responsibility for consequence management throughout the Federal response, and acts in support response of the FBI as appropria te, until the Attorney General, in consultation with the FBI Director and the FEMA Director, determines that such support is no longer re quired. It is FEMA policy to use FRP structures to coordinate all Federal assistance to State and local governments for consequence management. Terrorism Annex D-6 FBI FEMA Federal Agencies supporting law enforcementFederal Agencies supporting technical operationsFormulate ConsequenceManagement as required Figure 2 - Relationship Among Federal Agencies Under PDD -39 C. Costs . PDD-39 states that Federal agencies directed to participate in the resolution of terrorist incidents or c onduct of counterterrorist operations shall bear the costs of their own participation, unless ot herwise directed by the President. III. SITUATION A. Conditions 1. A general concern or actual threat of an act of terrorism occurring at or during a special event within the United States may cause the President to direct Federal agen cies to implement precautionary measures which may include some of the consequence management actions described in this Annex. When directed, FEMA w ill coordinate with the FBI and the affected State to identify pote ntial consequence management requirements and with Federal cons equence management agencies to implement increased readiness operations. 2. A significant threat or act of terrorism may cause the FBI to respond and to implement a crisis manageme nt response as described in this Annex. FBI requests for assistance from other Federal agencies will be coordinated through the Attorney General and the President with coordination of NSC groups as warrante d. During the course of a crisis management response, consequences may become imminent or occur that cause the President to direct FEMA to implement a consequence management response as described in this Annex. Terrorism Annex D-7 3. The occurrence of an incident wi thout warning that produces major consequences involving NBC/WMD may cause the President to direct FEMA to implement consequence mana gement response as described in this Annex. B. Planning Assumptions 1. No single agency at the local, Stat e, Federal or private level possesses the authority and the expertise to act unilaterally on many difficult issues that may arise in response to threats or acts of terrorism, particularly if NBC/WMD are involved.1 2. An act of terrorism, particularly an act directed against a large population center within the United States involving NBC/WMD, may produce major consequences that w ould overwhelm the capabilities of may local and State governments almost immediately. Major consequences involving NBC/WMD may overwhelm existing Federal capabilities as well. 3. Local, State, and Federal responders may define working perimeters -- that may overlap to some degree. Perimeters may be used to control access to the area, target public information messages, assign operational sectors among responding organizations , and assess potential effects on the population and the environment. C ontrol of these perimeters may be enforced by different authorities, which may impede the overall response if adequate coordination is not established. 4. If protective capabilities are not ava ilable, responders cannot be required to put their own lives at risk in or der to enter a perimeter contaminated with NBC material. It is possible th at the perimeter will be closed until the effects of the NBC material have de graded to levels that are safe for first responders. 5. This Annex may be implemented in situations involving major consequences in a single State or mu ltiple States. The FBI will establish coordination relationships among FBI Field Offices and with Federal agencies supporting crisis manage ment, including FEMA based on the locations involved. 2 6. This Annex may be implemented in situations that also involve consequences in neighboring nations. Terrorism Annex D-8 IV. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS A. Crisis Management (FBI, National Security Division, Domestic Terrorism/Counterterrorism Planning Section) PDD-39 reaffirms the FBI's Federal lead responsibility for crisis management response to threats or acts of terroris m that take place within United States territory or in in ternational waters and do not involve the flag vessel of a foreign country. The FBI provides a gra duated flexible response to a range of incidents, including: A credible threat, which may be presented in verbal, written, intelligence- based or other form. An act of terrorism which exceeds the local FBI field division capability to resolve. The confirmed presence of an explosive device or WMD capable of causing a significant destructive event, prior to actual inju ry or property loss (e.g., a \"significant threat \"). The detonation of an explosive device, utilization of a WMD, or other destructive event, with or without warn ing, that results in limited injury or death (e.g., \"limited consequences / State and local consequence management response \"). The detonation of an explosive device, utilization of a or other destructive event, with or without warning, that re sults in substantial injury or death (e.g., \"major consequences / Federal consequence management response \"). In response to a credible threat invo lving -- NBC/WMD, the FBI initiates a threat assessment process that invol ves close coordination with Federal agencies with technical expertise, in order to determine the viability of the threat from a technical, as well as tactical and behavioral standpoint. The FBI provides the initial notification to law enforcement authorities within the affected State of a threat or occurre nce that the FBI confirms as an act of terrorism. If warranted, the FBI implements an FBI response and simultaneously, advises the Attorney Ge neral, who notifies the President and NSC groups as warranted, that a Fede ral crisis manage ment response is required. If a Federal crisis manage ment response is authorized, the FBI activates multi-agency crisis management structures at FBI Headquarters, the responsible FBI Field Office, a nd at the incident site (see Figure 3 ). (The FBI provides guidance on the crisis manage ment response in the FBI Nuclear Terrorism Annex D-9 Incident Contingency Plan (classifie d) and the FBI Chemical/Biological Incident Contingency Plan (classified)). The President NSC Groups Attorney General FBI Director FBI HQ Strategic Information Operations Center DEST (may activate) FBI Field Office Joint Operations Center incident sitedeploy Figure 3 - Multi-Agency Crisis Management Structures If the threat involves NBC/WMD, th e FBI Director may recommend to the Attorney General, who notifies the President and NSC groups as warranted, to deploy a Domestic Emergency Support Team (DEST). The mission of the DEST is to provide expert advice and assistance to the FBI On-Scene Commander (OSC) related to the capabilities of the DEST agencies and to coordinate follow-on response assets. When deployed, the DEST merges into the existing Joint Operations Center (JOC) structure. (Authorization and coordination procedures and the interagency organizational structure for the DEST are outlined in the PDD- 39 Domestic Guidelines (classified)). During crisis management, the FBI c oordinates closely with local law enforcement authorities to provide a su ccessful law enforcement resolution to the incident. The FBI also coordina tes with other Federal authorities, including FEMA. The FBI Field Office responsible for the Incident site modifies its Command Post to function as a JOC. The JOC structure includes the following standard groups: Co mmand, Operations, Support, and Terrorism Annex D-10 Consequence Management. Representa tion within the JOC includes some Federal, State, and local agencies w ith roles in consequence management. FEMA notifies Federal, State and local consequence management agencies selected by the FBI OSC to request that they deploy representatives to the JOC. Selected Federal, State and lo cal consequence management agencies may be requested to serve in the JOC Command Group, the JOC Support Group/Media component, and the JOC C onsequence Management Group (see Figure 4 , Gov't LiaisonsConsequence Management GroupConsequence Management Group Figure 4 - FBI Joint Operations Center Structure A FEMA representative coordinates the actions of the JOC Consequence Management Group, expedites activa tion of a Federal consequence management response should it become necessary, and works with an FBI representative who serves as th e liaison between the Consequence Management Group and the FBI OSC. The JOC Consequence Management Group monitors the crisis management response in order to advise on decisions that may have implications for consequence management, and to Terrorism Annex D-11 provide continuity should a Federa l consequence management response become necessary. B. Consequence Management 1. Pre-Incident The FBI may notify Federal agen cies, including FEMA, of a significant threat of an act of terrorism. Fede ral agencies requested by the FBI, including FEMA, will deploy a representative(s) to the FBI Headquarters Strategic Information Op erations Center (SIOC). Based on the circumstances, FEMA Headquarters and the responsible FEMA Region(s) may implement a standard procedure to alert involved FEMA officials and Federal agencies su pporting consequence management. FEMA and other Federal agencies requested by the FBI OSC will deploy representatives to the JOC(s) being established by the responsible FBI Field Office(s). 3 Representatives may include a senior official to serve in the JOC Command Group, in order to assist the FBI OSC and to provide continuity in leadership should a Federal consequence management response be required. Issues arising from the response that affect multiple agency authorities and areas of expertise will be discussed by the FBI OSC and the other members of the JOC Command Group, who are all working in consultation with other local, State a nd Federal representatives. While the FBI OSC retains authority to make Federal crisis management decisions at all times, operational d ecisions are made cooperatively to the greatest extent possible. The FB I OSC and the senior FEMA official will provide, or obtain from higher au thority, an immediate resolution of conflicts in priorities for allocation of critical Federal resources (such as airlift or technical oper ations assets) between the crisis management and the consequence management response. The JOC Command Group plays an impor tant role ensuring coordination of Federal crisis management and consequence management actions. Coordination will also be achieved through the exchange of operational reports on the incident. Because re ports prepared by the FBI are \"law enforcement sensitive,\" FEMA represen tatives with access to the reports will review them, according to standard procedure, order to identify and forward information to Emergency Support Function (ESF) #5 that may affect operational priorities an d action plans for consequence management.

FEMA will consult immediately with the White House and the Governor's office in order to determine if FEMA is directed to use authorities of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance (Stafford) Act to mission-assign Federal conseq uence management agencies to pre- deploy assets, in order to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe. These actions will involve appropriat e notification and coordination with the FBI, as the overall Federal Lead Agency for counterterrorism. Terrorism Annex D-13 FEMA Headquarters may activate an Emergency Support Team (EST), may convene an executive-level mee ting, of the catastrophe Disaster Response Group (CDRG), and may place an Emergency Response Team - National (ERT-N) on alert. 4 When FEMA activates the EST, FEMA will notify FBI Headquarters to request a liaison. The responsible FEMA Region(s) may activate a Regi onal Operations Center (ROC) and deploy a representative(s) to the affected State(s) (see Figure 5 ). When the responsible FEMA Region(s) ac tivate a ROC, the Region(s) will notify the responsible FBI Field Office(s) to request a liaison. 2. Trans-Incident (Situations involving a transition from a threat to an act of terrorism ). If consequences become imminent or occur that cause the President to direct FEMA to implement a Federal consequence management response, then FEMA will initiate procedures to activate additional FRP structures (the EST, the CDRG, th e ROC, and a Disa ster Field Office (DFO) if necessary). Federal, Stat e and local consequence management of agencies will begin to disengage from the JOC (see Figure 6 ). The senior FEMA official and liaisons will remain at the JOC until the FBI and FEMA agree that a liaison pres ence is no longer required. FEMA will establish Joint Information Ce nters (JICs) in the field and Washington, DC, to serve as the pr imary Federal information centers on the consequence management response for the media, members of Congress, and foreign governments. FEMA JICs will establish coordination with the FBI Media co mponent in the field and the FBI Headquarters National Press Office, wh ich serve as the primary Federal information centers on the crisis management response.

Post-Incident (Situations without warning). If an incident occurs without warn ing that produces major consequences and appears to be caused by an act of terrorism, then FEMA and the FBI will initiate consequence management and crisis management actions concurrently. FEMA will consult immediately with the White House and the Governor's office to determine if a Federal consequence management response is required. If the President directs FEMA to implement a Federal consequence ma nagement response, then FEMA will implement portions of this Annex and other FRP annexes as required. FEMA will support the FB I as required and will lead a concurrent Federal consequence management response. During the consequence management response, the FBI provides a liaison to either the ROC Director or the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) in the field, and a liaison to the EST Director at FEMA Headquarters (see Figure 7 ). Issues arising from th e response that affect Terrorism Annex D-15 multiple agency authorities and areas of expertise will be discussed by the ROC Director or FCO, in cons ultation with the FBI liaison, the on- scene decision makers of the Federa l agencies supporting the technical operation, and the ESF Leaders, who ar e all working in consultation with local, State and other Federal representatives. While the ROC Director or FCO retains authority to make Federal consequence management decisions at all times, operational d ecisions are made cooperatively to the greatest extent possible. Meeti ngs will continue to be scheduled until the FBI and FEMA agree that coordination is no longer required. Operational reports will continue to be exchanged, as described in the pre-incident phase. The FBI liaisons will remain at the EST and the ROC or DFO until FEMA and the FBI agree that a liaison presence is no longer required.

Disengagement If an act of terrorism does not o ccur, then the consequence management response disengages when the FEMA Di rector, in consultation with the FBI Director, directs FEMA Headquart ers and the responsible Region(s) to issue a cancellation notification by standard procedure to appropriate FEMA officials and FRP agencies. FRP agencies disengage according to standard procedure. Terrorism Annex D-17 If an act of terrorism occurs that results in major consequences, then each FRP structure (the EST, the CDRG, the ROC. and the DFO if necessary) disengages at the appropr iate time according to standard procedures. Following FRP disenga gement, operations by individual Federal agencies or by multiple Federal agencies under other Federal plans may continue, in order to support the affected State and local government with long-term hazard monitoring, environmental decontamination, and site restoration (clean-up). V. RESPONSIBILITIES A. FBI PDD-39 clarifies and expands upon the responsibilities of the FBI as the Federal Lead Agency for crisis management. The FBI will: Appoint an FBI OSC to provide leader ship and direction to the Federal crisis management response. The FBI OSC will convene meetings with decision makers representing FEMA, the Federal agencies involved in technical operations, and the State (as appropriate). These meetings will be held in order to formulate incident action plans, define priorities, review status, resolve conflicts, identify issues that require decisions from higher authorities, and evaluate the need for additional resources. Issue and track the status of crisis ma nagement actions assigned to Federal agencies. A common system should be used by the FBI and FEMA, in order to provide a capability to control, prioritize, and deconflict taskings to Federal agencies, several of wh ich support crisis management and consequence management. Establish the primary Fede ral operations centers for crisis management in the field and Washington, DC. Establish the primary Federal centers for information management response for the media, members of C ongress, and foreign governments in the field and Washington, DC. Designate appropriate liaison and ad visory personnel to support FEMA. Determine when a threat of an act of terrorism warrants consultation with the White House. Advise the White House, through the Attorney Ge neral, when the FBI requires assistance for a Federal cr isis management response, in accordance with the PDD-39 Domestic Guidelines. Terrorism Annex D-18 Coordinate the Federal crisis manageme nt response with the lead State and local crisis management agencies. B. FEMA PDD-39 clarifies and expands upon the re sponsibilities of FEMA as the Federal Lead Agency for consequence management. FEMA will: Appoint a ROC Director or FCO to provi de leadership and direction to the Federal consequence management response. The ROC Director or FCO will convene meetings with decision makers representing the FBI, the Federal agencies involved in technical operations, and the State (as appropriate). These meetings will be held in order to formulate incident action plans, define priorities, review status, resolve conflicts, identify issues that require decisi ons from higher authorities, and evaluate the need for additional resources. Issue and track the status of consequence management actions assigned to Federal agencies. A common system should be used by the FBI and FEMA, in order to provide a capability to control, prioritize, deconflict, and (as appropriate) audit and reimbur se taskings to Federal agencies, several of which support crisis management and consequence management. Establish the primary Federal ope rations centers for consequence management in the field and Washington, DC. Establish the primary Federal cente rs for information on consequence management response for the media, members of Congress, and foreign governments in the field and Washington, DC. Designate appropriate liai son and advisory personne l to support the FBI. Determine when consequences are im minent that warrant consultation with the White House and the Governor's office. Consult with the White House and the Governor's office to determine if a Federal consequence management res ponse is required and if FEMA is directed to use Stafford Act authorities. This process will involve appropriate notification and coordination with the FBI. Coordinate the Federal consequence management response with the lead State and local consequence management agencies. Terrorism Annex D-19 C. Federal Agencies Suppor ting Technical Operations 1. Department of Defense As directed in PDD-39, the Departme nt of Defense (DOD) will activate technical operations capabilities to support the Federal response to threats or acts of NBC/WMD te rrorism. As required under the Constitution and laws of the United States, DOD will coordinate military operations within the United States w ith the appropriate civilian lead agency(ies) for the technical operations. 2. Department of Energy As directed in PDD-39, the Depart ment of Energy (DOE) will activate nuclear response capabilities to suppor t the Federal response to threats or acts of nuclear/WMD terrorism. DOE may coordinate with individual agencies identified in the FRERP to use the structures, relationships, and capabilities described in the FRERP to support response operations. The FRERP does not require formal implementation. Under the FRERP: The Federal OSC under the FRER P will coordinate the FRERP response with the FEMA official (eit her the senior FEMA official at the JOC, the ROC Director or the FCO). Who is responsible under PDD-39 for on-scene coordination of all Federal support to State and local governments (see Figure 8 ). The FRERP response may, include onsite management, radiological monitoring and assessmen t, development of Federal protective action recommendations, and provision of information on the radiological response to the public, the White House and Members of Congress, and foreign governments. The Lead Federal Agency (LFA) of the FRERP will serve as the primary Federal source of information regarding onsite radiological c onditions and offsite radiological effects. The LFA/FRERP will issue taskings that draw upon funding from the responding FRERP agencies. 3. Department of Health and Human Services As directed in PDD-39, the Departme nt of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will activate health and medical response capabilities to support the Federal response to threats or acts of NBC/WMD terrorism. DHHS may coordinate with individua l agencies identified in the DHHS Health Terrorism Annex D-20 and Medical Services Support Plan for the Federal Response to Acts of Chemical/Biological Terrorism , to use the structur es, relationships, and capabilities described in the DHHS plan to support response operations. If the DHHS plan is formally implemented: The DHHS on-scene representative w ill coordinate, through the ESF #8 Leader, the DHHS plan response w ith the FEMA official (either the senior FEMA official at the JO C, the ROC Director or the FCO), who is responsible under PDD-39 for on-scene coordination of all Federal support to State and local governments (see Figure 8 ). The DHHS plan response may include threat assessment. consultation, agent identification, epidemiological investigations, hazard detection and reduction, d econtamination, public health support, medical support, and pharmaceutical support operations. DHHS will issue taskings th at draw upon funding from the responding DHHS plan agencies. 4. Environmental Protection Agency As directed in PDD-39, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will activate environmental response cap abilities to support the Federal response to acts of NBC/WMD terrori sm. EPA may coordinate with individual agencies identified in the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Pl an (NCP) to use the structures, relationships, and capabilities of the National Response System as described in the NCP to support response operations. If the NCP is formally implemented: The On-Scene Coordinator under th e NCP will coordinate, through the ESF #10 Leader, the NCP res ponse with the FEMA official (either the senior FEMA official at the JOC, the ROC Director or the FCO), who is responsible under PDD-39 for on-scene coordination of all Federal support State and lo cal governments (see Figure 8).

Following a Staffo rd Act declaration, Federal consequence management operations will transition from the JOC Consequence Management Group, supported by the ROC, to a DFO. Terrorism Annex D-23 4 FEMA will incorporate language into the FRP Basic Pl an concerning the Emergency Response Team - National. 5 FEMA will renew and update language concerning Stafford Act declaration assignments in the FRP Basic Plan as follows: FEMA can use limited pre-deployment aut horities in advance of a Stafford Act declaration to \"lessen or avert the th reat of a catastrophe\" , only if the President expresses intent to go forward with a declara tion (Section 201). This authority is further interpreted by Congressional intent, to the effe ct that the President must determine that assistance under existing Fede ral programs is inadequate to meet the crisis before FEMA may directly intervene under the Stafford Act. The Stafford Act authorizes the President to issue \"emergency\" and \"major disaster\" declarations (Section 501). Emergency decl arations may be issued in response to a Governor's request, or in response to thos e rare emergencies, including some acts of terrorism, for which the Federal Government is assigned in the laws of the United States the exclusive or preeminent re sponsibility and authority to respond. Ma jor disaster declarations may be issued in response to a Governor's request for any natural catastrophe or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood or explosion which has caused damage of sufficient severity and magnitude, as determ ined by the President, to warrant major disaster assistance under the Act. If a Stafford Act declaration is provide d, funding for consequence management may continue to be allocated from responding department and agency operating budgets, the Disaster Relief Fund, and supplemental appropriations. Mission assignments are reimbursable work orde rs issued by FEMA to Federal agencies directing completion of a specific task. While the Stafford Act states that \"Federal agencies may (emphasis added) be reim bursed for expenditures under the Act\" from the Disaster Relief Fund (Section 304), it is FEMA policy to reimburse Federal agencies for work performed under mission assignments. Mission assignments issued to support consequence management will follow FEMA's \"Standard Operating Procedures for the Management of Mission Assignments (May 1994)\" or applicable superseding documentation. 6 FEMA will update FRP Appendix A.

(I8 U.S.C., Section 2332a) FBI Chemical/Biological In cident Contingency Plan E-1 APPENDIX E FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION CHEMICAL / BIOLOGICAL INCIDENT CONTINGENCY PLAN UNCLASSIFIED FBI Chemical/Biological In cident Contingency Plan E-2 FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION CHEMICAL/BIOLOGICAL (C/B) INCIDENT CONTINGENCY PLAN (UNCLASSIFIED) INTRODUCTION: The first priority of the pl an is public safety and the preservation of life. In a terrorist or other criminal-related C/B incident, the FBI will assume a central investigation and/or crisis ma nagement role, in association with local law enforcement authorities, to successfully resolve the incident . Concurrently, in a major incident, other specialized Federal entities from a variety of agencies and departments, will provide consequence management resources in suppor t of state and local agencies. These resources are primarily designed to address he alth and safety issues, and include a wide variety of emergency support, includ ing housing, food, a nd medical support. The plan is designed to marshal the a ppropriate Federal ta ctical, technical, scientific, and medical support to bolster the FBI's investigative a nd crisis management abilities and to augment state and local resources in addressing the threat inherent in a C/B incident. The contingency plan emphasi zes coordination between all participants and is particularly concerned with the bri dge between law enforcement activities and the management of the medical c onsequences of the crisis. If a terrorist or other cr iminal-related C/B incident should occur, the FBI will assume the lead Federal role to successfu lly resolve the incident and will closely coordinate efforts with appr opriate local law enforcement agencies and other emergency authorities. Based on the specific details of an incide nt, at some time during the crisis, the responsibility for consequence management and public safety will be transferred from the FBI to FEMA when the Attorney General (AG) determines that the priority law enforcement goals and objectives have been set or are outweighed by the consequence management concerns. The FBI's C/B Incident Contingency Plan attempts to clarify and address this issue and provides guidance re garding the Federal management transition from the FBI to another Federal agency in this context. The probability of a major chemical/biol ogical (C/B) incident occurring in the United States is difficult to quantify. However, the inevitability of a significant C/B incident is heightened by a number of fact ors including: FBI Chemical/Biological In cident Contingency Plan E-3 1) Chemical/Biological agents are relatively inexpensive to produce. 2 Basic chemical precursors and biological production processes ar e relatively easy to acquire. 3) The basic knowledge required to manufact ure such substances is readily available. 4) The impact to the public is intensified by the inability to qu ickly identify and/or contain the affects of such substanc es (particularly biological agents). 5) Media coverage has increased the visibi lity and public knowle dge of the use of chemical/biological weapons, thus creating a more likely scenario for their use. 6) The portability of small amounts of C/B ag ents,(especially biological agents), make them especially useful for clandestine purposes. 7) The proliferation of C/B agent technol ogy and development efforts worldwide have increased the stockpile of such weapons , thus elevating the potential for the acquisition or theft of the C/B weapons by terrorist groups. The public safety community must be prep ared to address a chemical/biological event with regard to the evacuation, contai nment, neutralization, removal, cleanup and disposal. Some possible scenarios may include: 1) The sabotage of a hazardous chemi cal production or storage facility. 2) The hijacking or premeditated destruction of a tractor-trailer or railroad tanker containing hazardous materials. 3) Discovering an individual or a group of individuals i nvolved in the manufacturing or possession of a chemical/biological weapon. 4) The dispersal of a chemical/biological agent among the civilian population, livestock or agricultural industry. 5) The contamination of a municipa l water or public food supply with a chemical/biological agent. 6) The credible threat to accomplish one of the above. FBI Chemical/Biological In cident Contingency Plan E-4 GRADUATED RESPONSE: In order to be effective, and for law enforcement to react safely to a chemical/biological agent incident, a graduate d response is appropria te. Since the first priority is public safety and the preser vation of life, this graduated response by knowledgeable public safety personnel would consist of the following: 1) Assessment of the incident by traine d responders in specialized clothing and breathing apparatus. 2) Emergency deployment of technical pe rsonnel and resources to the incident site. 3) Response and establishment of known management resources to a command post area near the incident site. JURISDICTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES: As each Chemical/Biological incident w ill have its own specific identity, the precedence of law enforcement responsibilitie s may be displaced by significant health and safety issues. At such a time, the lead ro le will be transferred to another agency with consequence management responsibility for the incident. Within the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been assigned the lead law enforcement role in responding to acts of Chemical/Biological (C/B) terrorism or other criminal-related C/B incidents in which the FBI maintains jurisdiction. The FBI derives its fundamental legal jurisdic tion to deter, investigate, direct, organize and prepare for a C/B incident from an assortment of Federal statutes and executive branch directives. Some of these include the following: 1) Title 18, USC, Section 1365 - Tampering with Consumer Products; 2) Title 18, USC, Sections 871-879 - Extortion and Threats; 3) Title 18, USC, Sections 371-373 - Conspiracy; 4) Title 18, USC, Sections 175-178 - Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act (BWAT); 5) Title 18, USC, Section 2332a - Weapons of Mass Destruction. Pursuant to this jurisdictional responsibil ity, the FBI will respond to all C/B incidents by marshaling specialized FBI and other Federal resources to support th e Special Agent-in- Charge (SAC) when faced with a potential C/ B incident. Recent legislation has made the use, attempt to use or conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction a Federal offense. FBI Chemical/Biological In cident Contingency Plan E-5 In addition, in 1990, the BWAT Act of 1989, was signed into law. This statute makes it illegal to manufacture or possess biological agents for use as a weapon or to assist a foreign country in the developmen t of such a weapon. It also contains extraterritorial provisions, as well as the abil ity to seize and destr oy biological weapons. C/B RESPONSE PROTOCOL In a major release of a C/B agent with or without warning, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will assume the lead role in crisis management in the interest of public safety. The FBI will continue to fulf ill its law enforcement role as the situation dictates. However, these efforts will be s econdary to, and in support of, the consequence management agency designated to coordinate Federal efforts in support of state and local public entities. Activation of a C/B Threat Assessment Pl an, should begin by taking the following steps: 1) Make contact with the FBI FIELD OFFICE C/B Coordinator who will immediately contact FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC 2) The FBI C/B Coordinator in Washi ngton, DC will contact the appropriate FBIHQ Units having responsibility in a number of areas to include tactical, hostage negotiation, criminal investigat ive analysis, aviation support, Bomb Technicians, FBI Laboratory and other sp ecialized resources within the FBI. 3) The FBI C/B Coordinator in Wash ington, DC will contact other Federal agencies having C/B support capabilities and include some of the following: A) Department of Defense, C/B Defense Agency; B) Department of Defense, U.S. Army Technical Escort; C) Health and Human Services, U.S. Public Health service; D) Environmental Protection Agency; E) Department of Agriculture, Emergency Programs; F) Federal Emergency Management Agency; G) Secretary of Defense; H) Health and Human Services , Center for Disease Control; I) Health and Human Services , Food and Drug Administration. FBI Chemical/Biological In cident Contingency Plan E-6 POSSIBLE INCIDENT SCENARIOS 1) A verbal or written threat only; 2) The confirmed presence of a C/B weapon, (without dissemination of the agent); 3) The release of a C/B agent, result ing in limited death or injury, requiring limited consequence management; 4) The release of a C/B agent (with or without prior warn ing), resulting in substantial injury or death, and requiri ng significant consequence management efforts. FBI Chemical/Biological In cident Contingency Plan E-7 FBI COMMAND POST STRUCTURE (The Joint Operations Center Concept) The SAC in charge of the FBI's response to a C/B incident will establish an on scene FBI command post designed to effectiv ely coordinate and di rect FBI actions and the actions of other agencies in response to th e crisis. As the lead Federal agency, it is the FBI's responsibility to recognize, understa nd and coordinate othe r federal agencies that have a duty to respond to a C/B incide nt. The standard FBI command post will be modified and function as a Joint Operations Center (JOC) under the direction of the SAC. The JOC will be structured to include both Federal and state agencies and to enhance interagency cooperation. This co mmand post concept has been designed to reflect the FBI's responsibility and authority as the lead Federal agency during a terrorist or criminal-related C/B incident and to facilitate the FBI ma nagement of such a complex interagency operation. The JOC will be composed of four main groups: Command, Operations, Consequence Management and Support. Some of these groups will contain other components to assist that group in fulf illing its responsibilities. The group and components are described as follows: COMMAND GROUP: This group will be comprised of senior officials of the FBI, DOD, USPHS, FEMA and other Fe deral, state and local agenci es as selected by the FBI, to provide the SAC with a means to qui ckly coordinate a nd reach-decisions on interagency matters that affect the resolution of the incident. Representation of agencies at Command Group briefings and meetings will be determined by the FBI SAC. In addition, the SAC will designate a single i ndividual to act as the point of contact (POC) between the Command Group (CG) and the FBIHQ Strategic Intelligence Operations Center (SIOC). All incoming a nd outgoing requests for information must go through the POC. The POC is responsible for keeping the CG and the FBIHQ/SIOC apprised of the status of the incident. Any communication occurring outside this channel should be immediately reported to the POC in order for them to keep FBIHQ/SIOC and the CG advised. OPERATIONS GROUP: Depending on the crisis, some or all of these Command Group components within the FBI or appropriate Federal, state or local public safety entity may be staffed and used to resolve the C/B crisis: 1) Intelligence Component: Collects, processes analyzes and disseminates current and valid intelligence data. Provides situational briefings to the individuals/groups design ated by the Command Group. FBI Chemical/Biological In cident Contingency Plan E-8 2) Investigative Component: Initiates and perpetuates the investigative activity. Documents crisis response and devel ops, assigns and ensures completion of investigative leads. 3) Tactical Component: Directs and coordinates all t actical personnel at the crisis site. Makes recommendations and provide s situational briefs to the Command Group. 4) Technical Component: Directs and coordinates a ll technical personnel at the crisis site. Makes reco mmendations and provides situational briefs to the Command Group. 5) Surveillance Component: Directs and coordinates both ground and air surveillance units. Determines feasib le options, makes recommendations, and provides situational briefs to the Command Group. 6) Negotiations Component: Directs and coordinates all negotiations personnel at the crisis site. Develops appr opriate negotiation options and makes recommendations to the Command Group. CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT GROUP: Established by, and under the direction of the FBI to manage the additional Federal, state, and local assets that will respond to any incident that has the potential for generating mass casualt ies or destruction. SUPPORT GROUP: This group will be established by and under the direction of the FBI. This group will contain representatives of organizations whose primary task is to support crisis organizations represented in the operations Group and will be asked for personnel to staff various support components. Some of these support components include: Logistics, Legal, Medi a, Administrative and Liaison. FBI Chemical/Biological In cident Contingency Plan E-9 DEFINITIONS One of the fundamental obstacles associat ed with the control and regulation of C/B weapons and agents is the difficulty in defining what constitutes such a weapon or agent. Due to the extensive civil uses of raw materials employed in the production of these weapons, a practical definition of what constitute s a weapon is crucial to enforcement efforts. The central factor in such a definition is the issue of intent. Additionally, to be utilized effectively as a weapon, C/B agents must be delivered to the target. This requires some type of delivery system, usually designed to minimize contact and exposure to the perpetrator(s). Such a delivery system may include a vector, which is a living organism capable of transferri ng a biological agent to a victim (such as mosquitoes, rats, etc.); an aerosol dispersal device; or an explosiv e charge designed to vaporize the substance. The following definitions have been adopted to describe the basic nature of C/B agents: CHEMICAL WEAPONS Chemical weapons are defined as co mpounds which through their chemical properties produce lethal or damaging effects in man, animal, plants or materials. They exist as solids, liquids or gas and are classified by their e ffects: nerve, blood, choking or blister agents. Chemical agents are also generally divided in to three broad classifications, sometimes referred to as lethal agents, incapacitating agents and harassing agents. Lethal agents are designed to kill or severely inju re. Incapacitating agents are designed to disable the victim for at leas t several hours. These substanc es include thos e previously mentioned: nerve, blood, choking and blister agents. Harassing agents, which include police riot agents, are designed to for ce people to retreat. Depending on the circumstances and conditions, even harassi ng agents can result in serious medical complications. Nerve agents, according to the World Health Organization, such as Tabun, Sarin or VX, may be absorbed through the skin or respiratory tract. Expos ure to nerve agents causes a disruption of nerve impulse transmi ssions and in sufficient quantities may cause almost instant death. Therefore, full prot ective clothing and a protective breathing mask are required to ensure safety. The substan ces are stored as liquids and are usually disseminated as aerosols by means of an explos ive charge. They also may be circulated by aerosol dispensers. FBI Chemical/Biological In cident Contingency Plan E-10 Blood agents , such as hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen chloride, are generally colorless liquids widely used in commercial chemical manufacturing. Their danger lies in the fact that they interfere with cell respiration. These agents attack the body through the respiratory system and if inhaled in su fficient quantities act almost immediately. Cardiac arrest can occur almost instantly. Even though blood agents are fast acting, th ey dissipate quickly, and therefore are not as effective as nerve agen ts, particularly in a battlefi eld environment. A protective mask will provide short term protection. Howeve r, these agents tend to saturate charcoal filters faster than most chemical warfare agents. They are disseminated by aerosol sprayer or vaporized by explosive charge. Choking agents cause damage to the tissues of the respiratory system and the eyes. In sufficient amounts, secondary infections can take place and in higher concentrations death occurs. A protective mask is sufficient to provide protection, provided that the atmosphere contai ns sufficient oxygen to support life. Blister agents are tissue irritants. The most co mmon blister agent is mustard gas. This substance is a liquid with the consistency of motor oil. Significant exposure will result in death between the second day and th e fourth week. In lesser amounts, exposure to blister agents causes symptoms similar to severe burns and may result in secondary infections. Although generally not lethal unless exposure is significant, inhalation or contact with the eyes results in immediate searing pain. Therefore, full protective clothing and a protective breathing mask are required to ensure safety. The lethality of chemical warfare agents is dependent on the concentration of the agent and on the method of induction into the body. BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS Biological agents are generally divided into either replicating (infectious) agents, or non-replicating (noninfec ting or intoxicating) agents. Replicating agents are pathogenic bacteria, viruses or fungus. N on-replicating agents are produced from replicating agents, other living organism s and plants and are called \"toxins\". Biological Weapons are regarded as infectious agents or toxins which are pathogenic to man. These may include numerous naturally occurring vi ruses, bacteria or fungi previously known to science as well as genetically engineered organisms previously unknown to man. These substances possess the common ability to kill or incapacitate large numbers of people. Bi ological weapons are defined as any micro-organism, virus, infectious substance or to xin, capable of causing death, disease or other biological malfunction in a human, animal, plant or othe r living organism. Toxins are a poisonous substance produced by a living organism, but in some cases can also be man-made. FBI Chemical/Biological In cident Contingency Plan E-11 The danger of biological weapons is amp lified by the fact th at exposure to the agents would probably not be diagnosed until symptoms appeared. Comprehensive quick field detection and identification methods do not currently exist for these agents. Not only may an accurate diagnosis be difficu lt to quickly accomplish, but the value of medical treatment for some agents may be di minished once symptoms have developed. Personal protection generally consists of imm unization or the application of some other post-incident medical treatment, such as the use of antibiotics. A chemical protective mask also protects personnel from biological agents. Viruses primarily cause diseases in man. Transmission of these viruses in a weapon system would most lik ely be accomplished by aerosol dissemination, or the use of a vector (a living organism capable of de livering a biological w eapon to a victim, such as fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, fo llowing an incubation period of a matter of days) . These illnesses can be fatal if untreated. Bacterial agents can be produced in the laboratory or purchased from a number of medical research firms. Dissemination would probably be accomplished by aerosol or natural dispersal such as food contamination. Infecti ons are introduced through the respiratory tract. An incuba tion period may last from one day to several weeks and the fatality rate for untreated cases may exceed 80 percent. Water supplies are particularly susceptible to contamination by strains of cer tain bacteria. It is important to note, however, that it is extremely difficult to contaminate most municipal waste systems. The number of purification and filtering procedures and treatments built into municipal water systems would rid the water of any contamin ation. Private water supplies or water supplies that are not subjected to a ri gorous purification process are at risk. Fungal infections usually are induced through the respiratory system by breathing infected spores. Fungal infections can be spread through the civi lian or agricultural population, and would be extremely difficult to de tect prior to the firs t casualty. At this time, there are no known applications of funga l infections which would lend themselves to being used as a biol ogical agent for a weapon. Toxins are defined as poisonous substances made by living organisms, and can cause incapacitation or deat h quickly. Toxins can now be reproduced through new advances in biotechnology a nd pose a new problem for new generations of C/B weapons.

Avoid us ing extinguishing methods that will cause splashing or spreading of the GA. SPECIAL FIRE FIGHTING PROCEDURES : All persons not engaged in extinguishing the fire should be i mmediately evacuated from the area. Fires involving GA should be contai ned to prevent contamination to uncontrolled areas. When responding to a fire alarm in buildings or areas containing agents, firefighting pers onnel should wear full firefighter protective clothing (with out TAP clothing) during chemical agent firefighting and fire rescue operations. Re spiratory protection is required. Positive pressure, full face piece, NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) will be worn where there is danger of oxygen deficiency and when directed by the fire chief or chemical accident/incident (CAI) operations officer. In cases where firefighters are responding to a chemical accident/incident for rescue/ reconnaissance purposes, they will wear appropriate levels of pr otective clothing (See Section VIII). Do not breathe fumes. Skin contact with ne rve agents must be avoided at all times. Although the fire may destroy most of the agen t, care must still be taken to assure the agent or contaminated liquids do not further contaminate other areas or sewers. Contact with the agent liquid or vapor can be fatal. UNUSUAL FIRE & EXPLOSION HAZARDS: Fire s involving this chemical may result in the formation of hydrogen cyanide, HCN. SECTION V - HEALTH HAZARD DATA AIRBORNE EXPOSURE LIMITS (AEL): Th e permissible airborne exposure concentration for GA for an 8-hour workday or a 40-hour work week is an 8-hour time weighted average (TWA) of 0.0001 mg/m3. This value is listed in \"AR 40-8, Occupational Health Guidelines for the Evalua tion and Control of Occupational Exposure to Nerve Agents GA, GB, GD, and VX.\" To date, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not promulgated a permissible exposure concentration for GA. GA is not listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH ), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), or National Toxicology Program (NTP) as a carcinogen. EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE: GA is a lethal cholinesterase inhibitor similar in action to GB. Although only about half as toxic as GB by inhalation, GA in low concentrations is more irritating to the ey es than GB. The numb er and severity of symptoms that appear are dependent on the quantity and rate of entry of the nerve agent introduced into the body. (Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors with few other effects.) Individua ls poisoned by GA display approximately the same sequence of symptoms' despite the ro ute by which the poison enters the body Material Safety Data Sheets F-5 (whether by inhalation, absorption, or ingest ion). These symptoms, in normal order of appearance, are: a runny nose; tightness of the chest; dimne ss of vision and pin pointing of the eye pupils; difficulty in breathing; drooling and excessive sweating; nausea; vomiting, cramps, and involuntary defecati on and urination; twitching, jerking, and staggering; and headache, confusion, drowsi ness, coma, and convulsion. These symptoms are followed by cessation of breathing and death. Onset Time of Symptoms: Symptoms appear mu ch more slowly from a skin dosage than from a respiratory dosage. Although skin absorption great enough to cause death may occur in 1 to 2 minutes, death may be delayed for 1 to 2 hours. Respiratory lethal dosages kill in 1 to 10 minutes, and liquid in the eye kills almost as rapidly. Median Lethal Dosage, Animals: LD50 (monkey, percutaneous) = 9.3 mg/kg (shaved skin) LCt50 (monkey, inhalation) = 187 mg-min/m3 (t = 10) Median Lethal Dosage, Man: LCt50 (man, inhalation) = 135 mg-min/m3 (t = 0.5-2 at RMV of 15 l/min; 200 mg-min/m3 at RMV of 10 l/min *Respiratory Minute Volume EMERGENCY AND FIRST AID PROCEDURES: INHALATION: Hold breath until respiratory pr otective mask is donned. If severe signs of agent exposure appear (chest tightens, pupil constriction, loss of coordination, etc.), immediately administer, in rapid succession, all three Nerve Agent Antidote Kit(s), Mark I injectors (or atropine if di rected by physician). Injections using the Mark I kit injectors may be repeated at 5 to 20 minute intervals if signs and symptoms are progressing until three series of injections have been administ ered. No more injections will be given unless directed by medical personnel. In addition, a re cord will be maintained of all injections given. If breathing has stopped, give artificial respirati on. Mouth-to-mout h resuscitation should be used when approved mask-bag or oxygen delivery systems are not available. Do not use mouth-to-mouth resuscitation when f acial contamination exis ts. If breathing is difficult, administer oxygen. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. EYE CONTACT: IMMEDIATELY fl ush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes then don respiratory protective mask. Although miosis (pinpointing of the pupils) may be an early sign of agent exposure, an injection will not be administered when miosis is the only sign present. Instead, the individual wi ll be taken IMMEDIATELY to a medical treatment facility for observation. Material Safety Data Sheets F-6 SKIN CONTACT: Don respiratory protective mask and remove contaminated clothing. Immediately wash contaminated skin with copious amounts of soap and water, 10% sodium carbonate solution, or 5% liquid hous ehold bleach. Rinse well with water to remove decontaminate. Administer an intr amuscular injection w ith the MARK I kit injectors only if local sweating and musc ular twitching symptoms are observed. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. INGESTION: Do not induce vomiting. First symp toms are likely to be gastrointestinal. IMMEDIATELY administer Nerve Agent Antid ote Kit(s), MARK I injectors. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY.

APPEARANCE AND ODOR: Yellow liquid with a garlic-like odor, similar to Mustard Agent. SECTION IV - FIRE AND EXPLOSION DATA Material Safety Data Sheets F-13 FLASHPOINT (Method Used): Unknown FLAMMABILITY LIMITS: Unknown EXTINGUISHING MEDIA: Water, fog, foam, CO2. Avoid use of extinguishing methods that will cause splashing or spreading of T. SPECIAL FIRE FIGHTING PROCEDURES : All persons not engaged in extinguishing the fire should be evac uated immediately. Fires involving T should be contained to prevent contamination of uncontrolled areas. When responding to a fire alarm in buildings or areas containing ag ents, firefighting personnel should wear full firefighters protective clothi ng (Not TAP Clothing) during chemical agent firefighting and fire rescue operations. Respiratory protection is required. Positive pressure, full face piece, NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) will be worn where there is danger of oxygen deficiency and when directed by the fire chief or chemical accident/incident (CAI)operations officer. In cases where firefighters are responding to a chemical accident/incident for rescue /reconnaissance purposes, they will wear appropriate levels of protectiv e clothing (See Section VIII). Do not breathe fumes. Skin contact with agents must be avoided always. Although the fire may destroy most of the agent, care mu st still be taken to assure the agent or contaminated liquids do not further contaminat e other areas or sewers. Contact with the agent liquid or vapor can be fatal. SECTION V - HEALTH HAZARD DATA AIRBORNE EXPOSURE LIMITS (AEL): No de tailed health hazard data on T is available. The following information is base d upon the limited available information and the chemical similarity to Mustard (HD) Agent. Under no circumstances should any individual be intentiona lly exposed to any direct skin or eye contact. T presently is not listed by the Interna tional Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), National Toxicology Program (NTP), Occupati onal Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), or American Conference of Governme ntal Hygienist as a carcinogen. However, agent T should be treated as a suspect carci nogen due to its similarity to Mustard Agent (HD). EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE: T is a vesicant (blister agent) and alkylating agent producing cytotoxic action on the hematopoie tic (blood forming) tissues, which are especially sensitive, much the same as for HD. The median lethal and incapacitating doses of T in man have not been establishe d. The median lethal dosage (LCt50) of T in mice is 1650-2250 mg-min/m3, based upon a ten minute exposure time. Material Safety Data Sheets F-14 ACUTE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF T IS CLASSIFIED AS LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC. ACUTE EFFECTS: T affects both the eyes and skin. Skin damage occurs after percutaneous absorption. Being lipid soluble, T can be absorbed into all organs. Skin penetration is rapid without skin irritati on. Swelling (blisters) a nd reddening (erythema) of the skin occurs after a latency period of 4-24 hours following the exposure, depending on the degree of the exposure and individual sensitivity. The skin healing process is very slow. Tender skin, mucous membranes, and pers piration-covered skin is more sensitive to the effects of T. T's effect on the skin, however , is less than on the eyes. Severe exposure to the eyes produces severe necrotic damage and loss of eyesight. E xposure of the eyes to T vapors or aerosol produces lacrimation, photophobia, and inflammation of the cornea. SYSTEMIC EFFECTS: Occurs primarily thr ough inhalation and i ngestion. The T vapor or aerosol is less toxic to the skin or eyes than the liquid form. When inhaled, the upper respiratory tract (nose, thro at, tracheae) is inflamed af ter a few hours latency period, accompanied by sneezing, coughing and bronchitis, loss of appetite, diarrhea, fever, and apathy. Exposure to nearly lethal doses of T can produce injury to bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen as indicated by a drop in white blood cell (WBC) c ount and, therefore, results in increased susceptibility to local and systemic infections. Ingestion of T will produce severe stomach pains, vomiting, and bloody stools after a 15-20 minute latency period. CHRONIC EXPOSURE: T can cause sensit ization, chronic lung impairment (cough, shortness of breath, chest pain) and possibly ca ncer of the mouth, thro at, respiratory tract and skin, and leukemia. Exposure to T may also cause birth defects. EMERGENCY AND FIRST AID PROCEDURES: INHALATION: Hold breath until re spiratory protective mask is donned. Remove from the source IMMEDIATELY. If breathing is difficult, administer oxygen. If breat hing has stopped, give artificial respiration. Mouth-to-mouth resusc itation should be used when approved mask-bag or oxygen delivery systems are not available. Do not use mouth-to- mouth resuscitation when facial contamin ation exists. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. EYE CONTACT: Speed in decontaminating the eyes is essential. Remove the person from the liquid source, flush the eyes immedi ately with water for at least 15 minutes by tilting the head to the side, pulling eyelids apart with finge rs and pouring water slowly into the eyes. Do not cover eyes with banda ges but, if necessary, protect eyes by means of dark or opaque goggles. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. SKIN CONTACT: Remove the victim from the source and immediately decon skin and clothes by flushing with 5% sodium hypochlor ite solution or liquid household bleach Material Safety Data Sheets F-15 within one minute. Cut and remove contaminat ed clothing, flush affected areas again with decon. Wash skin area with soap and wate r. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. INGESTION: Do not induce vomiting. Give victim milk to drink. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. SECTION VI - REACTIVITY DATA STABILITY: Stable at ambient temper atures. Decomposition temperature is approximately 180 C. T is a persistent agent depending on pH and moisture. INCOMPATIBILITY: Unknown HAZARDOUS DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS: T w ill hydrolyze ethyl thio) ethyl HAZARDOUS POLYMERIZATION: Unknown SECTION VII - SPILL, LEAK , AND DISPOSAL PROCEDURES STEPS TO BE TAKEN IN CASE MATERIAL IS RELEASED OR SPILLED: If spills or leaks of T occur only personnel in full pr otective clothing (See Section VIII) will be allowed in the area. See Section V for emergency and first aid procedures. RECOMMENDED FIELD PROCEDUR ES: T should be contained using vermiculite, diatomaceous earth, clay, or fi ne sand and neutralized as soon as possible using copious amounts of alcoholic caustic , carbonate, or Decontamin ating Solution, DS2. Caution must be exercised when using these decontam inates since acetylene will be given off. Household bleach can also be used if accompanied by stirring to allow contact. Scoop up all contaminated material and place in appr oved DOT containers. Cover the contents with additional decontaminant. All leaking contai ners will be over packed with vermiculite placed between the interior and exterior co ntainers. Decontaminat e the outside of the container and label according to DOT and EP A requirements. Dispose of according to waste procedures below. Dispose of decontam inate according to Federal, state, and local laws. Conduct general area monitoring with an approved monitor to confirm that the atmospheric concentrations do not exceed the airborne exposure limit (See Sections II and VIII). WARNING: Never use dry High Test Hypochl orite (HTH) or Super Tropical Bleach (STB) since they will react violently with T and may burst into flames. RECOMMENDED LABORATORY PROCEDURES: A minimum of 65 grams of decon solution per gram of T is allowed to agitate for a minimum of one hour. Agitation is not necessary following the first hour if a single phase is obtained. At the end of 24 hours, the resu lting solution will be adjusted to a pH between 10 and 11. Test for presence of active chlorine by use of acidic potassium iodide Material Safety Data Sheets F-16 solution to give free iodine color. Place 3 ml of the decontaminate in a test tube. Add several crystals of potassium iodine and swir l to dissolve. Add 3 ml of 50 wt.% sulfuric acid: water and swirl. IMMEDIATE iodine co lor shows the presence of active chlorine. If negative, add additional 5.25 % sodium hypochlorite solution to the decontamination solution, wait two hours, then te st again for active chlorine . Continue procedure until positive chlorine is given by solution. Scoop up all material and place in approved DOT containers. Cover the contents with additiona l decontaminate as above. The exterior of the container will be decontaminated and la beled according to EPA and DOT regulations. All leaking containers will be over packed w ith vermiculite placed between the interior and exterior containers. Decontaminate and label according to EPA and DOT regulations. Dispose of the material according to waste di sposal methods provided below. Dispose of decontaminate according to Federal, state a nd local regulations. Conduct general area monitoring with an approved monitor to conf irm that the atmospheric concentrations do not exceed the airborne exposure limits (See Sections II and VIII). A 10 wt.% calcium hypochlorite mixture may be substituted for sodium hypochlorite. Use 65 grams of decon per gram of T and c ontinue the test as described for sodium hypochlorite. NOTE: Surfaces contaminated with T, then rinse-decontaminated may evolve sufficient T vapor to produce a physiological response. T on laboratory glassw are may be oxidized by it vigorous reac tion with concentrated nitric acid. WASTE DISPOSAL METHOD: All neutralized material shoul d be collected, contained and thermally decomposed in EPA approved inci nerators that will filter or scrub toxic by- products from effluent air before discha rge to the atmosphere. Any contaminated materials or protective clothing should be decontaminated using HTH or bleach and analyzed to assure it is free of detectable contamination (3 X) level.

GB is not listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH ), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), or National Toxicology Program (NTP) as a carcinogen. EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE: GB is a lethal cholinesterase inhibitor. Doses that are potentially life threatening may be only slightly larger than those producing least effects. GB Route Dosage ocular inhalation inhalation (15 1/min) inhalation percutaneous 1700 mg/70 kg man Effective dosages for vapor are estimated for exposure durations of 2-10 minutes. Symptoms of overexposure may occur within minutes or hours, depending upon dose. They include: miosis (constriction of pupils) and visual effects, headaches and pressure sensation, runny nose and nasal congestion, sa livation, tightness in the chest, nausea, vomiting, giddiness, anxiety, difficulty in th inking and sleeping, nightmares, muscle twitches, tremors, weakness, abdominal cr amps, diarrhea, involuntary urination and defecation. With severe exposure symptoms progress to convulsi ons and respiratory failure. EMERGENCY AND FIRST AID PROCEDURES: INHALATION: Hold breath until re spiratory protective mask is donned. If severe signs of agent expo sure appear (chest tightens, pupil constriction, incoordination, etc.), immediately administer, in rapid Material Safety Data Sheets F-24 succession, all three Nerve Agent An tidote Kit(s), Mark I injector s (or atropine if directed by physician). Injections using the Mark I kit in jectors may be repeated at 5 to 20 minute intervals if signs and symptoms are progressing until three series of injections have been administered. No more injections will be gi ven unless directed by medical personnel. In addition, a record will be maintained of a ll injections given. If breathing has stopped, give artificial respiration. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation shou ld be used when approved mask-bag or oxygen delivery systems are not available. Do not use mouth-to-mouth resuscitation when facial cont amination exists. If breathi ng is difficult, administer oxygen. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. EYE CONTACT: Immediately fl ush eyes with water for at least 15 minutes, then don respiratory protective mask. Although miosis (pinpointing of the pupils) may be an early sign of agent exposure, an inje ction will not be administered when miosis is the only sign present. Instead, the individual will be ta ken IMMEDIATELY to a medical treatment facility for observation. SKIN CONTACT: Don respiratory protective mask and remove contaminated clothing. Immediately wash contaminated skin with copious amounts of soap and water, 10% sodium carbonate solution, or 5% liquid hous ehold bleach. Rinse well with water to remove decontaminant.

SECTION IV - FIRE AND EXPLOSION DATA FLASHPOINT : 105 C (Can be ignited by large explosive charges) FLAMMABILITY LIMITS (% by volume): Unknown EXTINGUISHING MEDIA: Wa ter, fog, foam, CO2. Avoi d use of extinguishing methods that will cause splashing or spreading of HD. SPECIAL FIRE FIGHTING PROCEDURES : All persons not engaged in extinguishing the fire should be immedi ately evacuated from the area. Fires involving HD should be contained to pr event contamination to uncontrolled areas. When responding to a fire alar m in buildings or areas containing agents, firefighting personnel should w ear full firefighter protective clothing (without TAP clothing) during chemical agent firefigh ting and fire rescue operations. Respiratory protection is required. Positive pressure, fu ll face piece, NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) will be worn where there is danger of oxygen deficiency and when directed by the fire chief or chemical accident/incident (CAI) operations officer. In cases where firefighters are responding to a chemical accident/incident for rescue/reconnaissance purposes they will wear appropriate levels of protective clothing (See Section VIII). Do not breathe fumes. Skin contact with ag ents must be avoided at all times. Although the fire may destroy most of the agent, care must still be taken to assure the agent or contaminated liquids do not further contaminat e other areas or sewers. Contact with the agent liquid or vapor can be fatal. Material Safety Data Sheets F-42 SECTION V - HEALTH HAZARD DATA AIRBORNE EXPOSURE LIMIT (AEL): The AEL for HD is 0.003 mg/m3 as found in \"AR 40-173, Occupational Health Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Occupational Exposure to Mustard Agents H, HD, HT.\" To date, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not promulgated a permissible exposure concentration for HD. EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE: HD is a vesi cant (causing bliste rs) and alkylating agent producing cytotoxic acti on on the hematopoietic (blood -forming) tissues which are especially sensitive. The rate of detoxifi cation of HD in the body is very slow and repeated exposures produce a cumulative effect. HD has been found to be a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Median doses of HD in man are: LD50 (skin) = 100 mg/kg ICt50 (skin) = 2000 mg-min/m3 at 70 - 80 F (humid environment) = 1000 mg-min/m3 at 90 F (dry environment) ICt50 (eyes) = 200 mg-min/m3 ICt50 (inhalation) = 1500 mg-m (Ct unchanged LD50 (oral) = 0.7 mg/kg Maximum safe Ct for skin and eyes are 5 and 2 mg-min/m3, respectively. ACUTE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF HD IS CLASSIFIED AS LOCAL AND SYSTEMIC. LOCAL ACTIONS: HD effects both the eyes an d the skin. SKIN damage occurs after percutaneous absorption. Being lipid soluble, HD can be absorbed into all organs. Skin penetration is rapid without skin irritati on. Swelling (blisters) a nd reddening (erythema) of the skin occurs after a latency period of 4-24 hours following the exposure, depending on degree of exposure and individual sensitivit y. The skin healing process is very slow. Tender skin, mucous membrane and perspiration-covered skin are more sensitive to the effects of HD. HD's effect on the skin, howev er, is less than on the eyes. Local action on the eyes produces severe necrotic damage and loss of eyesight Exposure of eyes to HD vapor or aerosol produces lacrimation, photophobi a, and inflammation of the conjunctiva and cornea. SYSTEMIC ACTIONS: Occurs primarily through inhalation a nd ingestion. The HD vapor or aerosol is less toxic to the skin or eyes than the liquid form. When inhaled, the upper respiratory tract (nose, throat, trach eae) is inflamed after a few hours latency period, accompanied by sneezing, coughing, and br onchitis, loss of appetite, diarrhea, Material Safety Data Sheets F-43 fever, and apathy. Exposure to nearly leth al doses of HD can produce injury to bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen as showed by a drop in white blood cell count, thus resulting in increased susceptib ility to local and systemic infections. Ingestion of HD will produce severe stomach pains, vomiting, and bloody stools after a 15-20 minute latency period. CHRONIC EXPOSURE : HD can cause sensi tization, chronic lung impairment, (cough, shortness of breath, chest pain), cancer of the mouth, throat, respir atory tract and skin, and leukemia. It may also cause birth defects. EMERGENCY AND FIRST AID PROCEDURES: INHALATION: Hold breath until re spiratory protective mask is donned. Remove from the source IMMEDIATELY. If breathing is difficult, administer oxygen. If breat hing has stopped, give artificial respiration. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation shou ld be used when approved mask-bag or oxygen delivery systems are not available. Do not use mouth-to-mouth resuscitation when facial contamination exits. S eek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. EYE CONTACT: Speed in decontaminating the eyes is absolutely essential. Remove the person from the liquid source, flush the eyes immediately with water for at least 15 minutes by tilting the head to the side, pulli ng the eyelids apart with the fingers and pouring water slowly into the eyes. Do not c over eyes with bandage s but, if necessary, protect eyes by means of dark or opaque goggles. Transfer the patient to a medical facility IMMEDIATELY. SKIN CONTACT: Don respiratory protectiv e mask. Remove the victim from agent sources immediately. Immediately wash skin and clothes with 5% solution of sodium hypochlorite or liquid household bleach within one minute. Cut and remove contaminated clothing, flush contaminated skin area agai n with 5% sodium hypoc hlorite solution, then wash contaminated skin area with soap and water. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. INGESTION: Do not induce vomiting. Give victim milk to drink. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. SECTION VI - REACTIVITY DATA STABILITY: Stable at ambi ent temperatures. Decomposition temperature is 149 C to 177 C. Mustard is a persistent agent dependi ng on pH and moisture, and has been known to remain active for up to three years in soil. INCOMPATIBILITY: Rapidly corrosive to bras s @ 65 C. Will corrode steel at a rate of .0001 in. of steel per month @ 65 C. Material Safety Data Sheets F-44 HAZARDOUS DECOMPOSITION: Mustard will hydrolyze to form HCl and thiodiglycol. HAZARDOUS POLYMERIZATION: Does not occur. SECTION VII - SPILL, LEAK , AND DISPOSAL PROCEDURES STEPS TO BE TAKEN IN CASE MATERIAL IS RELEASED OR SPILLED: If spills or leaks occur, only personnel in full pr otective clothing will remain in the area (See Section VIII) . In case of pers onnel contamination See Section V for emergency and first aid instructions. RECOMMENDED FIELD PROCEDURES: Th e HD should be contained using vermiculite, diatomaceous earth, clay or fine sand and neutralized as soon as possible using copious amounts of 5.25% sodium hypochl orite solution. Scoop up all material and clothing and place in a approved DOT container. Cover the contents of the container with decontaminating solution as above. The exterior of the container will be decontaminated and labeled according with EPA and DOT regula tions. All leaking cont ainers will be over packed with vermiculite placed between the interior and exterior containers. Decontaminate and label in accordance with EPA and DOT regulations. Dispose of the material in accordance with waste dispos al methods provided below. Dispose of the decontaminate according to Federal, state a nd local regulations. Conduct general area monitoring with an approved monitor to conf irm that the atmospheric concentrations do not exceed the airborne exposure limits (See Sections II and VIII). If 5.25 % sodium hypochlorite solution is not available then the following decontaminants may be used instead and are listed in the order of preference: Calcium Hypochlorite, contamination Solution No. 2 (DS2), and Super Tropical Bleach Slurry (STB). WARNING: Pure, undiluted calcium hypochlorite will burn on contact with liquid HD. RECOMMENDED LABORATORY PROCEDURES: A minimum of 65 grams of decon solution per gram of HD is al lowed to agitate for a minimum of one hour. Agitation is not necessary following the first hour if a single ph ase is obtained. At the end of 24 hours, the resulting solution will be adjusted to a pH between 10 and 11. Test for presence of active chlorine by use of acidic potassium iodide solu tion to give free iodine color. Place 3 ml of the decontaminate in a test tube. Add severa l crystals of potassium iodine and swirl to dissolve. Add 3 ml of 50 wt.% sulfuric ac id:water and swirl. IMMEDIATE iodine color shows the presence of active chlorine. If negative, a dd additional 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution to the decontamination so lution, wait two hours, then test again for active chlorine. Continue procedure until pos itive chlorine is given by solution. A 10 wt.% calcium hypochlorite (HTH ) mixture may be substitu ted for sodium hypochlorite. Use 65 grams of decon per gram of HD and c ontinue the test as described for sodium hypochlorite. Scoop up all material and clothing and place in a approved DOT container.

A characteristic odor is us ually geranium-like; very little odor when pure. SECTION IV - FIRE AND EXPLOSION DATA FLASHPOINT (Method Used): Does not flash FLAMMABILITY LIMITS: N/A. EXTINGUISHING MEDIA: fog, foam, CO2. Avoi d use of extinguishing methods that will cause splashing or spreading of L. SPECIAL FIRE FIGHTING PROCEDURES : All persons not engaged in extinguishing the fire should be evac uated immediately. Fires involving L should be contained to prevent cont amination of uncontrolled areas. When responding to a fire alarm in buildings or areas containing agents, firefighting personnel should wear full firefighte r protective clothing (Without Tap Clothing) during chemical agent firefighting and fire rescue operations. Respiratory protection is required. Positive pressure, fu ll face piece, NIOSH approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) will be worn where there is danger of oxygen deficiency and when directed by the fire chief or chemical accident/incident (CAI)operations officer. In cases where firefighters are responding to a chemical accident/incident for rescue/reconnaissance purposes, they will wear appropriate levels of protective clothing (See Section VIII). Do not breathe fumes. Skin contact with agents must be avoided always. Although the fire may destroy most of the agent, care mu st still be taken to assure the agent or contaminated liquids do not further contaminat e other areas or sewers. Contact with the agent liquid or vapor can be fatal. SECTION V - HEALTH HAZARD DATA AIRBORNE EXPOSURE LIMITS (AEL): Th e permissible airborne exposure concentration of L for an 8-hour workday or a 40-hour work week is an 8-hour time weighted average (TWA) of 0.003 mg/m3 as a ceiling value. A ceiling value may not be exceeded anytime. The ceiling value for Lewisite is based upon the present technologically feasib le detection limits of 0.003 mg/m3. This value can be found in \"DA Pam 40-173, Occupational Health Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Occupational Exposure to Mustard H, HD, HT, and L.\" To date, however, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not promulgated permissible exposure concentration for L. Material Safety Data Sheets F-53 EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE: L is a vesicant (blister agent), also, it acts as a systemic poison, causing pulmonary edema, diarrhea, restlessness, weakness, subnormal temperature, and low blood pressure. In orde r of severity and app earance of symptoms, it is: a blister agent, a toxic l ung irritant, absorbed in tissues, and a systemic poison. When inhaled in high concentrations, may be fatal in as short a time as 10 minutes. L is not detoxified by the body. Comm on routes of entry into the body and inhalation. TOXICOLOGICAL DATA: - 1500 mg min/m3 LCt50 (skin vapor exposure, man) = 100,000 mg min/m3 LDLO (skin, human) = mg/min3. L ir ritates eyes and skin and gives warning of its presence. Minimum ef fective dose (ED min) = 200 mg/m3 (30 min). ICt50 (eyes, man): < 300 mg LD50 (oral, 10m mg/kg mg/kg (ERDEC chemical agent (skin, rabbit) LD50 (subcutaneous, rabbit) LD50 (subcutaneous, guinea pig) = 1 mg/kg LD50 (skin, domestic farm animals) = 15 mg/kg LCt50 (inhalation, rat) = 1500 mg min/m3 (9 min) LCt50 (vapor skin, rat) = 20,000 mg min m 25 min) LCD50 (skin, rat) = 15 - 24 mg/kg LD50 (ip, dog) = 2 mg/kg EDmin (skin, dog) = 50 mg/m3 (30 min) EDmin (eye, dog) = 20 mg/m3 (30 min) EDmin (skin, rabbit) = 25 mg/m3 (30 min) EDmin (eye, rabbit) = 1 mg/m3 (30 min) ACUTE EXPOSURE: EYES: Severe damage. Instant pain, conjuncti vitis and blepharospasm leading to closure of eyelids, followed by corneal scarring and irit is. Mild exposure produc es reversible eye Material Safety Data Sheets F-54 damage if decontaminated instantly. More permanent injury or blindness is possible within one minute of exposure. SKIN: Immediate stinging pain increasing in severity with time. Erythema (skin reddening) appears within 30 minutes after exposure accompanied by pain with itching and irritation for 24 hours. Blisters appear w ithin 12 hours after expos ure with more pain that diminished after 2-3 days. Skin burns are much deeper than with HD. Tender skin, mucous membrane, and perspiration covered sk in are more sensitive to the effects of lewisite. This, however, is counteracted by L's hydrolysis by moisture, producing less vesicant, higher vapor pressure product. RESPIRATORY TRACT: Irritati ng to nasal passages and pr oduces a burning sensation followed by profuse nasal secretion and violent sneezing. Prolonged exposure causes coughing and production of large quantities of froth mucus. In experimental animals, injury to respiratory tracts, due to vapor e xposure is similar to mustard's; however, edema of the lung is more marked and freq uently accompanied by pleural fluid. SYSTEMIC EFFECTS: L on the skin, and i nhaled vapor may cause systemic poisoning. A manifestation of this is a change in capillary permeability, which permit's loss of sufficient fluid from the bloodstream to cau se hemoconcentration, shock and death. In nonfatal cases, hemolysis of erythrocytes has occurred with a resultant hemolytic anemia. The excretion of oxidized products into the b ile by the liver produces focal necrosis of that organ, necrosis of the mucosa of the biliary passages with pe riobiliary hemorrhages, and some injury to the intestinal mucosa. Acute systematic poisoning from large skin burns cause's pulmonary edema, diarrhea, restlessness, weakness, subnormal temperature, and low blood pressure in animals. CHRONIC EXPOSURE: Lewisite can cause sensitization a nd chronic lung impairment. Also, by comparison to agent mustard and arse nical compounds, it can be considered as a suspected human carcinogen. EMERGENCY AND FIRST AID PROCEDURES: INHALATION: Hold breath until respiratory protective mask is donned. Remove from the source IMMEDIATELY. If breathing has st opped give artificial respiration. Mouth- to-mouth resuscitation should be used when approved maskbag or oxygen system are not available. Do not use mouth-to-mouth resusc itation when facial contamination exists. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. EYE CONTACT: Speed in decontaminating the eyes is essential. Remove the person from the liquid source, flush the eyes imme diately with water for at least 15 minutes tilting the head to the side, pulling eyelids apart with finge rs and pouring water slowly into the eyes. Do not cover eyes with bandage s, if necessary, protect eyes by means of dark or opaque goggles. Seek me dical attention IMMEDIATELY. Material Safety Data Sheets F-55 SKIN CONTACT: Remove the victim from the source immediately and remove contaminated clothing. Immedi ately decon affected areas by flushing with 10% sodium carbonate solution or liquid household bleach within one minute. After 3-4 minutes, wash off with soap and water to protect ag ainst erythema. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. INGESTION: Do not induce vomiting. Give victim milk to drink. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. SECTION VI - REACTIVITY DATA STABILITY: Stable in stee l or glass containers. INCOMPATIBILITY: Corrosive to steel at a rate of 1 x 10 -5 to 5 x 10-5 in/month at 65 C. HAZARDOUS DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS: Reasonably stable; however, in presence of moisture, it hydrolyses rapidly, lo sing its vesicant property. It also hydrolyses in acidic medium to form HC1 and non-volatil e (solid) chlorovinylar senious oxide, which is less vesicant than Lewisite. Hydrolysis in alkaline medium, as in decontamination with alcoholic caustic or carbonate solution or Decontaminati ng Agent, DS(DS2), produces acetylene and trisodium arsenate (Na3AS04). Therefore, decontaminated solution would contain toxic arsenic. SECTION VII - SPILL, LEAK , AND DISPOSAL PROCEDURES STEPS TO BE TAKEN IN CASE MATERIA L IS RELEASED OR SPILLED: Only personnel in full protective clothing (See Secti on VIII) will be allowed in area where L is spilled. See Section V for emerge ncy and first aid procedures. RECOMMENDED FIELD PROCEDURES: Th e L should be contained using vermiculite, diatomaceous earth, clay, or fine sand and neutralized as soon as possible using copious amounts of alcoholic caustic , carbonate, or DS2. Caution must be exercised when using these decontaminates since acetylene will be given off. Household bleach can also be used if accompanied by stirring to allow contact. Scoop up all contaminated material and clothing and pl ace in approved DOT containers. Cover with additional decontaminant. Decontaminate the outside of the contai ner and label according to DOT and EPA requirements. All leaki ng containers will be over packed with vermiculite placed between interior and exte rior containers. Decontaminate and lable according to EPA and DOT regulations. Dispose of as specified below. Dispose of decontaminate according to Federal, State, and local regulations. Conduct general area monitoring with an approved monitor to conf irm that the atmospheric concentrations do not exceed the airborne exposure lim it (See Sections II and VIII). Material Safety Data Sheets F-56 RECOMMENDED LABORATORY PROCEDURES : A 10 wt. % alcoholic sodium hydroxide solution is prepared by adding 100 gr ams of denatured ethanol to 900 grams of 10 wt.% NaOH in water. A minimum of 200 grams of decon is required for each gram of L. The decon/agent solution is agitated fo r a minimum of one hour. At the end of one hour the resulting pH should be checked a nd adjusted to above 11.5 using additional NaOH, if required. It is permitted to substitu te 10 wt.% alcoholic sodium carbonate made and used in the same ratio as the NaOH lis ted above. Reaction time should be increased to 3-hours with agitation for the first hour. Fina l pH should be adjusted to above 10. It is permitted to substitute 5.25% sodium hypoc hlorite for the 10% alcoholic sodium hydroxide solution above. Allow one hour with agitation for the reaction. Adjustment of the pH is not required. Scoop up all contamin ated material and pl ace in an approved DOT container. Cover with additional decontaminant. Decontaminate the outside of the container and label according to DOT and EPA requirements. All leaking containers will be over packed with vermiculite placed betw een the interior and exterior containers. Decontaminate and label according to EPA and DOT regulations. Dispose of as specified below. Dispose of the decontaminate according to Federal, state, and local regulations. Conduct general area monitoring to confirm th at the atmospheric concentrations do not exceed the airborne exposure limit (See Section VIII). WASTE DISPOSAL METHOD: All neutralized material should be collected and contained for disposal according to land ba n RCRA regulations or thermally decomposed in an EPA permitted incinerator equipped with a scrubber that will scrub out the chlorides and equipped with an electrosta tic precipitator or other filte r device to remove arsenic. Collect all the arsenic dust from the electros tatic precipitator or ot her filter device and containerize and label according to DOT and EPA regulations. The arsenic will be disposed of according to land ban RCRA regulations. Any contaminated materials or protective clothing should be decontaminated using alcoholic caustic, carbonates, or bleach analyzed to assure it is free of detect able contamination (3X) level. The clothing should then be sealed in plas tic bags inside properly labele d drums and held for shipment back to the DA issue point.

Avoid using extinguishing methods that will cause splashing or spreading of the VX. SPECIAL FIRE FIGHTING PROCEDURES : All persons not engaged in extinguishing the fire should be immedi ately evacuated from the area. Fires involving VX should be contained to pr event contamination to uncontrolled areas. When responding to a fire alarm in buildings or areas containing VX , fire fighting personnel should wear full fi refighter protective clothing (without TAP clothing) during chemical agent fire fighting and fire rescue operations. Respiratory protection is required. Positive pressure, full face piece, NIOSH-approved self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) w ill be worn where there is danger of oxygen deficiency and when directed by the fire chief of chemical accident/incident (CAI) operations officer. In cases where fire fighters are responding to a chemical accident/incident for rescue/reconnaissance purpose s they will wear appropriate levels of protective clothing (See Section VIII). Do not breathe fumes. Skin contact with ne rve agents must be avoided at all times. Although the fire may destroy most of the agen t, care must still be taken to assure the agent or contaminated liquids do not further contaminate other areas or sewers. Contact with liquid VX or vapors can be fatal. UNUSUAL FIRE AND EXPLOS ION HAZARDS: None known. SECTION V - HEALTH HAZARD DATA AIRBORNE EXPOSURE LIMITS (AEL): Th e permissible airborne exposure concentration for VX for an 8-hour workday of a 40-hour work week is an 8-hour time weighted average (TWA) of 0.00001 mg/m3. This value can be found in \"AR 40-8, Occupational Health Guidelines for the Evalua tion and Control of Occupational Exposure to Nerve Agents GA, GB, GD, and VX.\" To date, however, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not promulgated a permissible exposure concentration for VX. Material Safety Data Sheets F-63 VX is not listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH ), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), or National Toxicology Program (NTP) as a carcinogen. EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE: VX is a lethal cholinesterase inhibitor. Doses which are potentially life-thre atening may be only slightly larg er than those producing least effects. Death usually occurs within 15 minutes after ab sorption of a fatal dosage. VX 1/min) inhalation (15 Form vapor vapor vapor vapor liquid Effect miosis runny nose severe incapacitation death death 30 mg-min/m3 10 mg/70 kg man Effective dosages for vapor are estimated for exposure durations of 2-10 minutes. Symptoms of overexposure may occur within minutes or hours, depending upon the dose. They include: miosis (constriction of pupils) and visual effects, headaches and pressure sensation, runny nose and nasal congestion, sa livation, tightness in the chest, nausea, vomiting, giddiness, anxiety, difficulty in thinking, difficulty sleeping, nightmares, muscle twitches, tremors, weakness, abdomin al cramps, diarrhea, involuntary urination and defecation. With severe exposure sympto ms progress to convulsions and respiratory failure. EMERGENCY AND FIRST AID PROCEDURES: INHALATION: Hold breath until re spiratory protective mask is donned. If severe signs of agent expo sure appear (chest tightens, pupil constriction, incoordination, etc.), immediately administer, in rapid succession, all three Nerve Agent An tidote Kit(s), Mark I injector s (or atropine if directed by physician). Injections using the Mark I kit in jectors may be repeated at 5 to 20 minute intervals if signs and symptoms are progressing until three series of injections have been administered. No more injections will be gi ven unless directed by medical personnel. In addition, a record will be maintained of a ll injections given. If breathing has stopped, give artificial respiration. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation shou ld be used when approved mask-bag or oxygen delivery systems are not available. Do not use mouth-to-mouth resuscitation when facial cont amination exists. If breathi ng is difficult, administer oxygen. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. Material Safety Data Sheets F-64 EYE CONTACT: IMMEDIATELY flush eyes with water for 10-15 minutes, then don respiratory protective mask. Although miosis (pinpointing of the pupils) may be an early sign of agent exposure, an inje ction will not be administered when miosis is the only sign present. Instead, the individual will be taken IMMEDIATELY to a medical treatment facility for observation. SKIN CONTACT: Don respiratory protective mask and remove contaminated clothing. Immediately wash contaminated skin with copious amounts of soap and water, 10% sodium carbonate solution, or 5% liquid hous ehold bleach. Rinse well with water to remove excess decontaminant. Administer nerv e agent antidote kit, Mark I, only if local sweating and muscular twitching symptoms are observed. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY . INGESTION: Do not induce vomiting. First symp toms are likely to be gastrointestinal. IMMEDIATELY administer Nerve Agent Antidote Kit, Mark I. Seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY . SECTION VI - REACTIVITY DATA STABILITY: Relatively stable at room te mperature. Unstabilized VX of 95% purity decomposes at a rate of 5% a month at 71 C. INCOMPATIBILITY: Negligible on brass, steel, aluminum. HAZARDOUS DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS: Du ring a basic hydrolysis of VX up to 10% of the agent is conver ted to diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonothioic acid (EA2192). Based on the concentration of EA2192 expected to be formed during hydrolysis and its toxicity (1.4 mg/kg derm al in rabbit at 24 hours in a 10/90 wt.% ethanol/water solution), a Cla ss B poison would result. The large scale decon procedure, which uses both HTH and NaOH, destroys VX by oxidation and hydr olysis. Typically the large scale product contains 0.2 - 0.4 wt.% EA2192 at 24 hours. At pH 12, the EA2192 in the large scale product has a half -life of about 14 days. Thus, the 90-day holding period at pH 12 results in about a 64- fold reduction of EA2192 (six half-lives). This holding period is suffici ent to reduce the toxicity of the product below that of a Class B poison. Other less toxic prod ucts are ethyl methylphosphonic acid, methylphosphinic acid, diisopropyaminoet methylphosphonate, and ethanol. The small scale decontaminati on procedure uses sufficient HTH to oxidize all VX thus no EA2192 is formed. HAZARDOUS POLYMERIZATION: Does not occur. SECTION VII - SPILL, LEAK , AND DISPOSAL PROCEDURES STEPS TO BE TAKEN IN CASE MATERIAL IS RELEASED OR SPILLED: If leaks or spills occur, only personne l in full protective clothing (See Section VIII ) will remain Material Safety Data Sheets F-65 in area. In case of personnel contamination see (Section V) for emergency and first aid instructions. RECOMMENDED FIELD PROCEDURES (For Quantities greater than 50 grams): (NOTE: These procedures can only be used with the approval of the Risk Manager or qualified safety personnel). Spills must be contained by covering with vermiculite, diatomaceous earth, clay or fi ne sand. An alcoholic HTH mi xture is prepared by adding 100 milliliters of denatured ethanol to a 900-m illiliter slurry of 10% HTH in water. This mixture should be made just before use since the HTH can react with the ethanol. Fourteen grams of alcoholic HTH solution ar e used for each gram of VX. Agitate the decontamination mixture as the VX is adde d. Continue the agitation for a minimum of one hour. This reaction is reasonablely exot hermic and evolves substantial off gassing. The evolved reaction gases should be rout ed through a decontaminate filled scrubber before release through filtration systems. After completion of the one hour minimum agitation, 10% sodium hydroxide is added in a quantity equal to that necessary to assure that a pH of 12.5 is maintained for a period no t less than 24 hours. Hold the material at a pH between 10 and 12 for a period not less th an 90 days to ensure that a hazardous intermediate material is not formed (See Section VI) . Scoop up all material and clothing and place in a DOT approved container. C over the contents with decontaminating solution as above. After sealing, the exterior of the container will be decontaminated and labeled according to EPA and DOT regulati ons. All leaking containers will be over packed with vermiculite placed between the interior and exterior containers. Decontaminate and label according to EPA and DOT regulations. Dispose of the material according to waste disposal methods provi ded below. Dispose of decontaminate according to Federal, State, and local re gulations. Conduct general area monitoring to confirm that the atmospheric concentrations do not exceed the airborne exposure limits (See Sections II and VIII). If the alcoholic HTH mixture is not availabl e then the following decontaminants may be used instead and are listed in the order of preference: Decontaminating Agent D2 (DS2), Supertropical Bleach Slurry (S TB), and Sodium Hypochlorite. RECOMMENDED LABORATORY PROCEDURES (For Quantities less than 50 grams): If the active chlorine of the Calcium Hypochlorite (HTH) is at least 55%, then 80 grams of a 10% slurry are required for each gram of VX. Proportionally more HTH is required if the chlorine activity of the HTH is lower than 55%. The mixture is agitated as the VX is added and the agitation is maintained for a minimum of one hour. If phasing of the VX/decon solution continues after 5 minutes , an amount of denatured ethanol equal to a 10 wt.% of the total agent/decon will be added to help miscibility. Scoop up all material and clothing and place in a DOT approved container. Cover the contents with decontaminating solution as above. After seali ng, the exterior of th e container will be decontaminated and labeled according to EPA and DOT regulations. All leaking containers will be over packed with vermiculite placed between the interior and exteriorcontainers. Decontaminate and la bel according to EPA and DOT regulations. Dispose of the material according to waste di sposal methods provided below. Dispose of Material Safety Data Sheets F-66 decontaminate according to Federal, State, and local regulations. Conduct general area monitoring to confirm that the atmospheric concentrations do not exceed the airborne exposure limits (See Sections II and VIII). NOTE: ETHANOL SHOULD BE REDUCED TO PREVENT THE FORMATION OF A HAZARDOUS WASTE. Upon completion of th e one hour agitation the decon mixture will be adjusted to a pH between 10 and 11. Conduct general area monitoring to confirm that the atmospheric concentrations do not exceed the airborne exposure limits (See Sections II and VIII) . WASTE DISPOSAL METHOD: Open pit burn ing or burying of VX or items containing or contaminated with VX in any quantity is prohibited. The detoxified VX (using procedures abov e) can be thermally destroyed by in a EPA approved incinerator in accordan ce with appropriate provisions of Federal, State and local Resource Conserva tion and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. NOTE: Some states define decontaminated surety material as a RCRA Hazardous Waste. SECTION VIII - SPECIAL PR OTECTION INFORMATION RESPIRATORY PROTECTION: CONCENTRATION RESPIRATORY PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT < 0.00001 mg/m3 A full face piece, chemical canister, air-purifying protective mask will be on hand for escape.

Other masks certified as equivalent may be used). >0.00001 or = 0.02 mg/m3 A NIOSH/MSHA a pproved pressure demand full face piece SCBA or supplied air re spirators with escape air cylinder may be used. Alte rnatively, a full face piece, chemical canister air-purifying protective mask is acceptable for this purpose (See DA PAM 385-61for determination of appropriate level) >0.02 mg/m3 or unknown NIOSH/MSHA a pproved pressure demand full f ace piece SCBA suitable for use in high agent concentrations with protective ensemble (See DA PAM 385-61 for examples). VENTILATION: Local exhaust: Mandatory. Must be filtered or scrubbed to limit exit concentration to < 0.00001 mg/m3. Air emissions will meet lo cal, state and federal regulations. Material Safety Data Sheets F-67 Special: Chemical laboratory hoods will have an average inward face velocity of 100 linear feet per minute (lfpm) +/- 10% with the velocity at any point not deviating from the average face velocity by more than 20%. Ex isting laboratory hoods will have an inward face velocity of 150 lfpm +/- 20%. Laborator y hoods will be located such that cross- drafts do not exceed 20% of the inward face velocity. A visual performance test using smoke-producing devices will be performed in assessing the ability of the hood to contain agent VX. Other: Recirculation or exha ust air from chemical areas is prohibited. No connection between chemical areas and other areas through ventilation system is permitted. Emergency backup power is necessary. Hoods s hould be tested at least semiannually or after modification or maintenance operati ons. Operations should be performed 20 centimeters inside hood face. PROTECTIVE GLOVES: Butyl Rubber Glove M3 and M4 Norton, Chemical Protective Glove Set EYE PROTECTION: At a minimum chemical goggl es will be worn. For splash hazards use goggles and face shield. OTHER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT: For laborato ry operations, wear lab coats, gloves and have mask readily accessible.

Supplemental Information on Biological Agents G-1 APPENDIX G SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON BIOLOGICAL AGENTS Supplemental Information on Biological Agents G-2 ANTHRAX In April and May of 1979 an Anthrax epidemic broke out in humans in the city of Sverdlovsk in the former Soviet Union. While S oviet officials attribut ed this outbreak to contaminated meat, the US Government mainta ins its position that the outbreak was due to a leakage from a biologi cal weapons facility. The epidemic ran intensely from 4 April to 19 April, the day the epidemic reached its peak with ten new cases. According to offici al Soviet reports, ther e were 96 victims in all. Seventeen had skin infections and surviv ed. Seventy-nine had intestinal infections; of these, 64 died. The source of the outbreak was traced to a singl e 29-ton lot of bone meal (cattle feed) sold in March from a fact ory in Aramil, 15 kilometers to the southeast of Sverdlovsk. While \"many scientists\" at the time said the new eviden ce supported the Soviet view, Science Magazine released a study in 1994, that appears to corroborate the US Government view. \"...Most people who contracted anthrax worked, lived, or attended daytime military reserve classes during the first week of April 1979 in a narrow zone, with its northern end in a military microbiology facility in the city and its other end near the city limit 4 km to the south; livestock died of anthrax in vill ages located along the extended axis of this same zone, out to a distance of 50 km...\" \"...We conclude that the outbr eak resulted from the windborne spread of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen, that the source was at the military microbiology f acility, and that the escape of pathogen occurred during the day on M onday, 2 April. ... Most or all infections resulted from the escape of an thrax pathogen on that day.\" \"...A single date of inhalatory infection is also consistent w ith the steady d ecline of onset of fatal cases in successive weeks of the epidemic. \" \"Accepting 2 April as the only date of inhala tory exposure, the longest incubation period for fatal cases was 43 days and the modal incubation period was 9 to 10 days...Experiments with nonhuman primates ha ve shown, however, that anthrax spores can remain viable in the lungs for many w eeks and that the aver age incubation period depends inversely on dose, with individua l incubation periods ranging between 2 and approximately 90 days.*\" * Meselson, Matthew, Jeanne Guillemin, Martin Hugh-Jones, Alexander Langmuir, Ilona Popova, Alexi Shelokov, Olga Yampolskaya. Th e Sverdlovsk Anthrax Outbreak of 1979. Science: 266, 18 Nov., 1994; 1202-1208. Supplemental Information on Biological Agents G-3 TULAREMIA The following material is from the U.S. Army Field Manual Handbook on the Medical Aspects of NBC Defensive Operations (FM 8-9) (a) A variety of clinical forms of tu laremia are seen, depending upon the route of inoculation and virulence of the strain. In humans, as few as 10-50 organisms will cause disease if inhaled or injected intradermally, whereas 108 orga nisms are required with oral challenge. Under natural conditions, ulcerogland ular tularemia genera lly occurs about 3 days after intradermal inoc ulation (range 2-10 days), and manifests as regional lymphadenopathy, fever, chills, headache, and malaise, with or wit hout a cutaneous ulcer. In those 5-10% of cases with no visible ulce r, the syndrome may be known as glandular tularemia. Primary ulceroglandular disease c onfined to the throat is referred to as pharyngeal tularemia. Oculoglandular tula remia occurs after inoculation with a hand or fingers contam inated by tissue fluids from an infected animal. Gastrointestinal tularemia occurs after drinking contaminated ground water, and is characterized by abdominal pai n, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. (b) Bacteremia probably is common afte r primary intradermal, respiratory, or gastrointestinal infection with F. tularensis and may result in septicemic or \"typhoidal\" tularemia. The typhoidal form also may o ccur as a primary condition in 5-15% of naturally-occurring cases; clinical features include fever, prostration, and weight loss, but without adenopathy. Diagnosis of primary typhoi dal tularemia is difficult, as signs and symptoms are non-specific and there fre quently is no suggestive exposure history. Pneumonic tularemia is a severe atypical pne umonia that may be fulminant, and can be primary or secondary. Primary pneumonia may follow direct inhalation of infectious aerosols, or may result from aspiration of organisms in cases of pharyngeal tularemia. Pneumonic tularemia causes fever, headache, malaise, substernal discomfort, and a non- productive cough; radiologic evidence of pneumonia or mediastinal lymphadenopathy may or may not be present. (c) A biological warfare atta ck with F. tularensis would most likely be delivered by aerosol, causing primarily typhoidal tularemia. Many exposed individuals would develop pneumonic tularemia (primary or secondary), but clinical pneumonia may be absent or non-evident. Case fatality rates may be highe r than the 5-10% seen when the disease is acquired naturally. Supplemental Information on Biological Agents G-4 Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) The following material is from the U.S. Army Field Manual Handbook on the Medical Aspects of NBC Defensive Operations (FM 8-9) (1) Characteristics. Eight serologically dis tinct viruses belonging to the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex have been associated with human disease; the most important of these pathogens are designated s ubtype 1, variants A, B and C. These agents also cause severe disease in horses, mules, and donkeys (Equidae). Na tural infections are acquired by the bites of a wide variety of mo squitoes; Equidae serve as the viremic hosts and source of mosquito infection. In natura l human epidemics, severe and often fatal encephalitis in Equidae always precedes th at in humans. A BW attack with virus disseminated as an aerosol would cause human disease as a primary event. If Equidae were present, disease in these animals woul d occur simultaneously with human disease. Secondary spread by person-to-person \\ contact occurs at a negligible rate. However, a BW attack in a region populated by Equid ae and appropriate mosquito vectors could initiate an epizootic/epidemic. (2) Clinical Features. Nearly 100% of those infected suffer an overt illness. After an incubation period of 1-5 days, onset of illn ess is extremely sudden, with generalized malaise, spiking fever, rigors, severe h eadache, photophobia, myalgia in the legs and lumbosacral area. Nausea, vomiting, cough, sore throat, and diarrhea may follow. This acute phase lasts 24-72 hours. A prolonged period of aesthenia and lethargy may follow, with full health and activity regained only af ter l-2 weeks. Approximately 4% of patients during natural epidemics develop signs of central nervous system infection, with meningismus, convulsions, coma, and paralysis. These neurologic case s are seen almost exclusively in children. The overall case-fata lity rate is < 1%, but in children with encephalitis, it may reach 20%. Permanent neurological sequelae are reported in survivors. Aerosol infection does not appear to increase the likeli hood of CNS disease. A VEE infection during pregnancy may cause ence phalitis in the fetus, placental damage, abortion, or severe congenital neuroanatomical anomalies. Supplemental Information on Biological Agents G-5 Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHF) Here is additional information on one of those agents from FM 8-9 B.07. Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever. a. Clinical Syndrome. (1) Characteristics. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease caused by CCHF virus. The virus is transmitted by tic ks, principally of the genus Hyalomma, with intermediate vertebrate hosts varying with the tick species. The disease was first recognized in the Crimea, but occurs over most of Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans, the former USSR, and eastern China. Little is known about variations in the virus properties over the huge geographic area invol ved. Humans become infected through tick bites, crushing an infected tick, or at th e slaughter of viremic livestock. (Domestic animals become infected but do not have si gnificant disease.) The spread of disease within hospitals has been documented with th is virus and poses a potentially significant problem. Even in epidemics, cases do not show narrow clustering and person-to-person spread is rare. CCHF would pr obably be delivered by aerosol if used as a BW agent. (2) Clinical Features. (a) Typical cases present with sudden onset of fever and chills 3-12 days after tick exposure. Flushing, conjunctival injection, a nd mild hypotension may be present. After 2- 3 days, perhaps with a tem porary remission of fever, th e patient develops bleeding manifestations such as petechiae, ecchym oses, oozing from cause quite severe ecchymoses and extensiv e GI bleeding. There is severe headache, lumbar pain, nausea and vomiting, delirium, a nd prostration. Fatal ca ses are associated with extensive hemorrhage, coma, and shock. Other common physical findings are epigastric tenderness, modest hepatome galy, and less frequently icterus. (b) Mortality among cases recognized as hemo rrhagic fever is 15-30%. Convalescence in survivors is prolonged with asthenia, dizzine ss, and often hair lo ss. Milder clinical disease occurs in an unknown proportion of infections. There may be geographic variations, possibly related to viral strain differences. Supplemental Information on Self Protection H-1 APPENDIX H SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON SELF PROTECTION Supplemental Information on Self Protection H-2 The following material was extracted fr om the Centers for Disease Control World-Wide-Web site referencing un iversal precautions. The full site may be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hip/universa.htm UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS FOR PREVENTION OF TRANSMISSION OF HIV AND OTHER BLOODBORNE INFECTIONS \"Universal precautions,\" as defined by CDC, are a set of precautions designed to prevent transmission of human immunodeficiency vi rus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and other bloodborne pathogens when providing fi rst aid or health care. Under universal precautions, blood and certain body fluids of all patients are considered potentially infectious for HIV, HBV and other bloodborne pathogens. Universal precautions took the place of and elim inated the need for the isolation category \"Blood and Body Fluid Precautions\" in th e 1983 CDC Guidelines for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals. However, impl ementing universal precautions does not eliminate the need for other isolation precautions, such as droplet precautions for influenza, airborne isolation for pulmonary tuberculosis, or co ntact isolation for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus . In 1996, CDC published new guidelines (standard precautions) for isolation precautions in hospitals. Standard precautions synthesi ze the major features of BSI and universal precautions to prevent transmission of a variet y of organisms. Standard precautions were developed for use in hospitals and may not n ecessarily be indicated in other settings where universal precautions are used, such as child care settings and schools. Universal precautions apply to blood, othe r body fluids containi ng visible blood, semen, and vaginal secretions. Universal precautions al so apply to tissues and to the following fluids: cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural, pe ritoneal, pericardial, and amniotic fluids. do not apply to feces, nasa l secretions, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and vomitus unless they contain visible bl ood. Universal precautions do not apply to saliva except when visibly contaminated with blood or in the dental setting where blood contamination of saliv a is predictable. Universal precautions involve the use of protective barriers such as gloves, gowns, aprons, masks, or protective eyewear, which can reduce the risk of e xposure of the health care worker's skin or mucous membranes to potentially infective materials. In addition, under universal precautions, it is recommende d that all health care workers take Supplemental Information on Self Protection H-3 precautions to prevent injuries caused by needle s, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or devices. GLOVING, GOWNING, MASKING, AND OTHER PROTECTIVE BARRIERS AS PART OF UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS All health care workers shoul d routinely use appropriate ba rrier precautions to prevent skin and mucous membrane exposure duri ng contact with any patient's blood or body fluids that require universal precautions. Gloves should be worn: for touching blood and body fluids re quiring universal precautions, mucous membranes, or nonintact skin of all patients, and for handling items or surfaces soiled with blood or body fluids to which universal precautions apply. Gloves should be changed after contact with each patient. Hands and other skin surfaces should be washed immediately or as soon as pa tient safety permits if contaminated with blood or body fluids requiring universal precautions. Hands should be washed immediately after gloves are removed. Gl oves should reduce the incidence of blood contamination of hands during phlebotomy, but they cannot prevent penetrating injuries caused by needles or other sharp instruments. Institutions that judge routine gloving for all phlebotomies is not necessary should pe riodically reevaluate their policy. Gloves should always be available to health care wo rkers who wish to use them for phlebotomy. In addition, the following ge neral guidelines apply: I. Use gloves for performing phlebotomy wh en the health care worker has cuts, scratches, or other breaks in his/her skin. II. Use gloves in situations where the health care worker judges that hand contamination with blood may occur, e.g., when performing phlebotomy on an uncooperative patient. III. Use gloves for performing finger and/or heel sticks on infants and children. IV. Use gloves when persons are r eceiving training in phlebotomy. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food a nd Drug Administration (FDA), has responsibility for regulating the medical glove industry. For more information about selection of gloves, call FDA at 301-443-8913. Masks and protective eyewear or face shields should be worn by health care workers to prevent exposure of mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes during procedures that are likely to generate droplets of blood or body fluids requiring universal precautions. Gowns or aprons should be worn during procedures that are likely to generate splashes of blood or body fluids requiring universal precautions. Supplemental Information on Self Protection H-4 All health care workers shoul d take precautions to prevent injuries caused by needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or de vices during procedures; when cleaning used instruments; during disposal of used needle s; and when handling sharp instruments after procedures. To prevent need lestick injuries, needles should not be recapped by hand, purposely bent or broken by hand, removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand. After they are used, di sposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items should be pl aced in puncture-resist ant containers for disposal. The puncture-resistant containers should be located as close as practical to the use area. All reusable needles should be placed in a puncture-resistant container for transport to the reprocessing area. General infection control pract ices should further minimize the already minute risk for salivary transmission of HIV. These infection control practic es include the use of gloves for digital examination of mucous membra nes and endotracheal suctioning, handwashing after exposure to saliva, and minimizing the need for emergency mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by making mouthpieces and other ve ntilation devices available for use in areas where the need for re suscitation is predictable. National Center for Infectious Diseases Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Atlanta, GA Supplemental Information on Self Protection H-5 PROTECTIVE CLOTHING (From the North American Emergency Response Guidebook ) Street Clothing and Work Uniforms. These garments, such as uniforms worn by police and emergency medical services personne l, provide almost no protection from the harmful effects of dangerous goods. Structural Fire Fighters' Protective Clothing (SFPC). This category of clothing, often called turnout or bunker gear, means the pr otective clothing normally worn by fire fighters during structural fire fighting operations. It includes a helmet, coat, pants, boots, gloves, and a hood to cover parts of the head not protected by the helmet and facepiece. This clothing must be used with full-facep iece positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). This protective clothi ng should, at a minimum, meet the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Fire Brigade Standard (29 CFR 1910.156). Struct ural fire fighters' protective clothing provides limited protection from heat, but may not provide adequate protection from the harmful vapors or liquids that are encounter ed during dangerous goods incidents. Each guide includes a statement about the use of SFPC in incidents i nvolving those materials referenced by that guide. Some guides st ate that SFPC provides limited protection. In those cases, the responder wearing SFPC and SCBA may be able to perform an expedient, that is quick \"in-and-out\", opera tion. However, this type of operation can place the responder at risk of exposure, injury or death. The incident commander makes the decision to perform this operation only if an overriding be nefit can be gained (i.e., perform an immediate rescue, turn off a valve to control a leak, etc. ). The coverall-type protective clothing customarily worn to fi ght fires in forests or wildlands is not SFPC and is not recommended nor referred to elsewhere in this guidebook. Positive Pressure Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA). This apparatus provides a constant, positive pre ssure flow of air within the facepiece, even if one inhales deeply while doing heavy work. Use apparatu s certified by NIOSH and the Mine Safety and Health Administration in accordance with 30 CFR Part 11. Use it in accordance with the requirements for respiratory protection specified in the OSHA Hazardous Waste Site Operations and Emergency Response Sta ndards (29 CFR 1910.120) and/or the Fire Brigade Standard (29 CFR 1910.156). Chemical -cartridge respirator s or other filtering masks are not acceptable substitutes for positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus. Demand-type SCBA does not meet the OSHA Fire Brigade Standard. Chemical Protective Clothing and Equipment. Safe use of this type of protective clothing requires specific skills developed through training and e xperience. It is generally not available to, or us ed by, first responders. This type of special clothing may protect against one chemical, yet be readily permeated by chemicals for which it was not designed. Therefore, protective clothing should not be used unless it is compatible with the released material. This type of special clothing offers little or no protection against heat. Examples of this type of equipment have been describes as (1) Vapor Protective Supplemental Information on Self Protection H-6 Suits, also known as Totally-Encapsulating Ch emical Protective (TECP) Suits or Level A protection and (2) Liquid-splash Protective Su its, also known as Le vel B protection. No single protective clothing will protect you from all dangerous goods. Do not assume any protective clothing is resistant to heat or flame exposure unl ess it is so certified by the manufacturer.
