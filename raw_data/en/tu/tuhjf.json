Naturopathy is one of seven natural therapies being reviewed in the first tranche of the work and one of the 16 therapies excluded from the private health insurance rebate as of 1st April 2019. HealthConsult were engaged by the NHMRC on 4th March 2020 to review the clinical effectiveness of whole system, multi -modal , or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice. The purpose of the 2015 Review was to ensure that natural therapies are underpinned by a credible evidence base that demonstrates their clinical efficacy, cost -effectiveness and safety and quality. Further details regarding similarities and differences between this Review and the 2015 Review are described in Section 1.5. This document presents the draft Research Protocol for a systematic review (the Review) into the effectiveness of w hole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice . It presents t he objectives, methods to locate, select and cri tically appraise studies and the method to collect and analyse data from the included studies. 1.2 DESCRIPTION OF THE CONDITIONS The Review will include populations who are undertaking naturopathic treatment to either : prevent health condition/s (in at risk populations ); or to treat, manage or delay progression of existing health condition s. The Review is expected to include, but will not be limited to, the conditions identified by the Practitioner Research and Collabor ation Initiative (PRACI). PRACI, which is the largest national practice -based research network (PBRN) for complementary healthcare ( including naturopathy) in Australia1 and has collected data on the most commonly self -reported c onditions treated by naturopathic practitioners in Australia. The conditions which form >50% of those often seen by naturopaths include :1 Fatigue (95% of respondents ) Digestive Disorders (8 4%) Mental illness (77%) Irritable bow el syndrome (6 7%) Menstrual disorders (61%) , and Insomnia/sleeping disorders (61%) Conditions that were reported as sometimes seen , by >50% of naturopaths, ) Eczema/Psoriasis (57%) HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 3 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol Headache/ migraine (5 7%) Recurrent infections (54%) , and Arthritis (5 1%). 1.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION For the purposes of this Review, the interventions of interest are whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice: 'Whole system' in the context of naturopathy 'refers to the practice of naturopathic practice as a complex health care intervention that addresses simultaneously the multiple dimensions (physical, mental, spiritual, family, community, and environment) of an individual patient as pragmatically practi sed by naturopathic clinicians'.2 'Multi -modality ' refers to 'a minimum of two modalities as part of a single clinical approach to treatment of an individual'.2 'Single modal ity' refers to the individual modalities used by a naturopath . Naturopathy can be defined as a system of healthcare with a deep history of traditional philosophies and principles , utilising a number of natural therap y modalities to treat patients .3 A naturo path typically sees patients via consultation in private clinical practice. An initial consultation is usually between 60 - 120 minutes duration4 with follow -up consultations about 30 - 60 minutes.5 In a typical consultation a naturopath takes a detailed case history and performs physical examinations such as pulse and tongue diagnosis, irid ology and blood pressure.4 A naturopath may also send a patient for laboratory testing (e.g. stool testing or pathology) to assist in determining a naturopathic diagnosis. Once a n aturopathic diagnosis is confirmed, n aturopaths usually develop a treatment plan using one or more modalities such as diet and lifestyle advice4 or recommend other treatments like yo ga and exercise.5, 6 Naturopaths also provide maintenance for long term health7, with some clients requiring follow -up appointments to refine treatment plans or maintenance appointments for a few months for chronic or ongoing conditions.8 The core naturopathic philosophies, principles and treatment modalities which form naturopathic practice and diagnosis are explained in more detail below.9 In Australia, 'Naturopath y' is not a regulated or registered profession . However , while not regulated, in order for naturopaths to obtain professional indemnity insurance, the y need to be affiliated with a professional association. In recent years, naturopaths have developed a n independent register for qualified naturopaths through the Australian Register of Naturopaths and Herbalists (ARONAH) , which requires practitioners to meet 'competency standards' and have a minimum qualification.10 Typical naturopathic training involves a diploma or degree level qualification4 and some naturopathic organi sations have minimum requirements in naturopathy such as an advanced diploma, a bachelor's degree , or another qualification in naturopathy or Western herbal medicine providing th e practitioner can show evidence that they have been in regular practice in the last two to ten years .11 1.3.1 Core philosophies Two core naturopathic philosophies are holism and vitalism . Holism (or holistic) refers to the 'whole' being greater than the sum of its 'parts '. In naturopathic practice this translates to treating both a health condition / disease and an individual as a 'whole ' not in isolation, and consider s both internal (disease process) and external (environmental, social, cultural) factors that may contribute to the health of an individual. Vitalism refers to the theory that every living organi sm has an innate 'vital force' or natural wisdom . To treat a condition using a 'vitalistic' approach is to encourage the body's natural ability to heal itself, rather than supressing or masking symptoms (e.g. encouraging a fever, rather than suppressing it) .9, 12 HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 4 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol 1.3.2 Principles Traditional principles form the basis of naturopathic practice.12, 13 These principles include : first, do no harm (primum non nocere ), (suppo rting the) healing power of nature (vis medicatrixnaturae) , treat the cause (not just the symptoms) (tollecausam) , treat the whole person (rather than individual disease) (tolletotum) , doctor as teacher (to educate the patient) (docere) , disease prevention and health promotion, and wellness or wellbeing.9, 13 1.3.3 Theories The theories are concepts which have been incorporate d in the principles of naturopathic practice (e.g. treat the whole person) or which are used to guide naturopathic practice (e.g. value of a fever).9 According to the World Naturopathic Federation, key theories that underlie naturopathic practice include:9 (1) Vital Force and Theory of Vitality - synonymous with the naturopathic philosophy of vitalism . (2) Integration of the Indi vidual - aligns with the naturopathic principle of treating the whole person . (3) Naturopathic Cures - refers to the therapeutic concept of detoxification (e.g. fasting), revitalisation (e.g. in the form of mental therapy such as yoga), stabilisation (of an i ndividual's health (e.g. through lymphatic drainage), and regeneration (e.g. in the form of mental therapy such as counselling) . (4) Value of a Fever - based on the understanding that fever helps the body fight an infection, and therefore, helping the body to heal itself . (5) Therapeutic Order - refers to recommendation that naturopathic treatment is best applied in a certain order to resolve a patient's symptoms and address with the least potential for damage . (6) Naturopathic Triad of Health - represented in the pri nciple of 'treating the whole person' by addressing mind, body and spirit . (7) Unity of Disease - all disorders can be traced back to three primary manifestations, namely: lowered vitality, abnormal composition of blood and lymph, and accumulation of waste materials, morbid matter and poisons . (8) Hering's Law of Cure - stipulates the direction in which symptoms are cured : from the inside out, from the head down, from most important to least important organs, in reverse order of how they first appeared . (9) Theory of Toxaemia - the main cause of disease is the accumulation of toxins (harmful materials or chemicals) from (e.g. too much stress or eating too much of the wrong foods ). (10) Emunctory Theory - elimination of toxins from the body is vital to achieve optimal hea lth. (11) Humoral Theory - spans all aspects of the naturopathic therapeutic encounter, including assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. These philosophies, principles and theories focus on treatment and prevention of conditions, and promotion of health throug h naturopathic treatment modalities. 1.3.4 Modalities In Australia, the most commonly prescribed modalities in naturopathic clinical practice include: nutritional medicine (e.g. nutraceuticals and supplements) , diet ary and lifestyle counselling and herbal medicine prescription .12, 13 Some naturopaths also use homeopathy and manual therapies HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 5 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol (e.g. massage) as part of their practice . Naturopaths also report prescribing other interventions; such as meditation, yoga and exercise to support their patients .1,9 In a recent survey1, Australian naturopathic practitioners report ed that the most c ommon modalitie s they use in their interventions are : lifestyle modifications (98% of practitioners) dietary modifications (90%) herbal medicine (90%) meditation (88%) exercise prescription (83%) yoga (75%) nutritional supplementation (65%) and homeopathy (36%). 1.4 HOW THE INTERVENTION MIGHT WOR K Naturopathic treatment often uses multi -modal interventions such as herbal medicine, nutritional supplementation, diet, and lifestyle modifications in combination with other supporting modalities, for examp le, homeopathy and manual therapies .14 Some r esearch suggests that the aforementioned whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice can improve health outcomes and improve quality of life in patients with chronic conditions or who are at risk of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, type 2 diabetes a nd/or anxiety.2, 15 Some interventions delivered or prescribed by naturopaths aim to improve pa tient's diet or lifestyle (e.g. exercise prescription, reducing intake of sugary or processed foods), with the health benefits of physical activity and a healthy diet well - documented in the scientific literature.16 According to the Australian Burden o f Disease Study in 2015, 7.3% of the total burden of disease was due to poor diet while physical inactivity contributed to 2.5% of the total burden.17 Using cardiovascular disease as an example, dietary risks contribute 40.2% of the total burden of disease, while alcohol use contributed 3.6%, tobacco use 11.5% and physical inactivity 8.0%.17 However, the risk factors contributing to the burden of dis ease are not additive and have been described as having a 'joint effect', in view of the complex interactions between them.17 Australian naturopaths may apply dietary advice and help develop a healthier diet based on the evidence - based Australian Dietary Guidelines16 to improve a patient's risk of cardiovascular disease or other chronic conditions ,16-18 among counselling for other lifestyle modalities. Given the synergistic effect of smoking, poor d iet and physical inactivity on chronic conditions,19 adhering to lifestyle advice for these modalitie s may therefore have a synergistic effect on improving health . The way naturopathy is practi sed may also enhance the effects of the naturopathic modalities administered or prescribed by the practitioner . The benefits of naturopathic practice may also arise from the practitioner -patient relationship.14 For example, compared to family physicians, naturopaths practise with relatively longer consultation times with their clients.20 This may enh ance communication which in turn enhances adherence to therapeutic advice, including advice on lifestyle factors, although additional consultation time alone does not directly result in improved care.21 However , longer consultation times may allow a naturopath to assess more of a patient's issues than a family physician is able to in a shorter consultation, which would influence patient - practitioner interactions.20 Although Zolnierek (2009) did not investiga te naturopathic practitioners, their meta -analysis reported good physician communication is associated with greater patient adherence to treatment.22 The rationale is that open communication and shared belie fs elicit clinical and psychosocial information from clients. Good communication also enables client involvement in decision -making and the discussion of benefits, risks, and barriers to treatment adherence, and develops rapport, trust and encouragement with clients.14, 22 To further illustrate the relatio nship HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 6 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol between communication and treatment adherence, clients of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners (which also encompass naturopathic practitioners) in Australia reported elements that helped change their health behaviour included t he practitioner teaching them what to do, monitoring their progress, providing encouragement and directing them to information and resources they could use independently23 All of these are components of good clinician communication.22 The most frequently reported health behaviour changes made by clients of CAM practitioners in Australia were the lifestyle changes of improved diet and increased exercise.23 As stated in Section 1.3, dietary advice was also the most common treatment provided by naturopathic practitioners, followed by Western herbal medicine, lifestyle advice and exercise advice.24 Thus, w here there is adherence to behavioural change advice (dietary, lifestyle and exercise advice), th ere may be result ing health benefits. 1.5 WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO DO THIS REVIEW ? Australia has one of the highest rates of C AM practitioner use among developed countri es and naturopathy is one of the most popular forms of C AM.12, 25 The number of naturopathic consultations exceeds 4.9 million annually.12 However, naturopathic practice is often accused of lacking an evidence base .12, 26 Also, naturopathy is not regulated (i.e. it is self-regulated) which means any individual can currently practice naturopathy with or without appropriate training.13, 27 Further research into effects of naturopathic practice and regulations, as practised in Australia, is required.13 Hence, this Review will identify and evaluate the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturop athic practice. The Review will inform the Australian Government's decisions about subsidies for natural therapies through private health insurance rebates. The Australasian Cochrane Centre, Monash University was commissioned by the NHMRC to conduct an ov erview of systematic reviews to synthesise the effectiveness of naturopathy as a health service.28 The overview, which was finalised in 2015, was part of the ' Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Private Health Insurance for Natural Therapies'. It considered systematic reviews published between 2008 and May 2013 . It identified one unpublished systematic review of whole system naturopathic medicine in chronic conditions. Of the 13 studies included in the unpublished systematic review, six were randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ), which were further assessed . These studies evaluated the effectiveness of naturopathic practice in cardiovascular disease, m ultiple sclerosis, anxiety and musculoskeletal pain . The primary outcomes includ ed measures of pain, quality of life, anxiety and cardiovascular risk. The quality of the evidence was assessed as very low and the authors noted among the limitations that all of the studies were conducted in North America. Further, the authors concluded that while there was some evidence to suggest naturopathy as a health service improved patient health for a number of chronic health conditions, they urged caution in view of the differences in naturopathic practice, training and accreditation between Nort h America and Australia.28 The 2015 overview did not include individual modal therapies used in naturopathic practice.28 The Chair of the Department of Health's Natural Therapies Review Advisory Committee29 noted that the authors may have missed systematic reviews that were published as grey literature , as sea rching was restricted to bibliographic databases . While the 2015 overview did not apply language restrictions in its search, its inclusion criteria limited studies to the English language only . The unpublished systematic review it identified had itself r estricted languages to English, Spanish and French, in view of its North American focus. This Review aims to evaluate and synthesise the evidence for the effectiveness of whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice . In contrast with the 2015 overview, this Review will evaluate RCTs and non -randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), and will include the most common (single) modalities of a therapy administered in the context of naturopathic pr actice. HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 7 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol 1.6 OBJECTIVES The main objective of the Review is to assess the effectiveness of whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice for preventing , managing , treating and/ or delaying progression of health conditions in people with a clinical condition, pre -clinical condition or at risk of illness or injury. HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 8 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol 2 Methods This Chapter presents the methodology for conducting the Review. It describes the criteria for considering which studies are eligible, the search methods for identifying studies and the methods for collecting and analysing the data. 2.1 CRITERIA FOR CONSIDERI NG STUDIES IN THIS REVIEW This section defines the types of studies that are considered eligible for inclusion in this Review. It describes inclusion and exclusion criteria of participants ' characteristics , the study design s, interventions, comparators an d outcome measures. 2.1.1 Types of studies To be eligible, studies must be RCTs or NRSIs that examine the effectiveness of w hole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice (the intervention). The intervent ion group must be able to be compared to a contemporaneous control or another intervention group. There is no minimum sample size for studies. RCTs, as the main study type of interest, will include:30 Parallel RCTs of individuals: where individual participants are randomly assigned to either an intervention group or to a control group Cluster randomised trials: where clusters of individuals, rather than individuals themselves, are randomised to dif ferent arms of the trial Cross -over trials: where the participants, upon completion of the course of one treatment are switched to another treatment, and Pseudorandomised controlled trials (quasi -randomised controlled trials): where participants are alloca ted to either the intervention or control groups by investigators using an allocation process that attempts randomisation, but where the method of randomisation is inadequate or not truly random (e .g. alternate allocation) . This includes where the method of randomisation is not specifically stated or not strictly random. The methods of randomisation will be considered in the risk of bias assessment. For cross -over trials, the concern as to whether wash -out periods are sufficient is acknowledged. Cross -over trials will be included where it is appropriate to do so in the context of the trial PICO, in line with Cochrane handbook Chapter 23.2 .2: for example, where naturopathy interventions have a temporary effect and therefore are not likely to have carry over effects after the 'wash -out' period, which are used in the treatment of stable, chronic conditions. If cross -over trials are incorporated into a meta -analysis, they will be analysed separately to other RCTs (see section 2.3.9 ). Where a cross -over trial is deemed to be an inappropriate design, only data from the first trial period will be included in the review. Unsuitable cross -over trials include:31 where the medical condition evolves over time, such as a degenerative disorder, a temporary condition that will resolve within the time frame of the trial, or a cyclic disorder; when an intervention (or its cessation) can lead to permanent or long -term modification; if the elimination half -life of a drug is very long so that a 'carry -over' effect is likely; and if wash -out itself induces a withdrawal or rebound effect i n the second period. HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 9 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol Specific NRSI study designs are eligible to ensure evidence can be evaluated for a broad range of populations and outcomes. For example, where RCTs are not available for a particular population, or where available RCTs only provide fin dings of low certainty. NRSIs are also eligible where they include the following features: Data are collected from an 'intervention' group and a comparison group (e.g. control / placebo / other intervention) contemporaneously. Allocation (to 'intervention' , control/placebo or another intervention) occurs by methods that are not random, including choice, availability, or non -random chance. Consequently, the following types of NRSIs will be eligible (assuming they have the two features listed above) are: Non-randomised controlled studies: Experimental studies in which people are allocated to whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice or a control/placebo group and the outcomes compared. Prospectiv e cohort studies with contemporaneous comparator group: Studies in which outcomes from a defined group of people (the cohort) are followed over time, with participants recruited before any intervention occurs. Outcomes are collected for both participants who are and are not exposed to whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice. The association between exposure and non -exposure with outcomes is examined. Retrospective cohort studies with contem poraneous comparator group: Studies in which outcomes from a defined group of people (the cohort) are examined after the intervention and outcomes occur. Outcomes are collected for both participants who are and are not exposed to whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice. The association between exposure and non -exposure with outcomes is examined. Interrupted time series studies: Studies that measure outcomes at multiple time points before and after an intervention (the 'interruption') is introduced. Outcomes from the intervention group are compared to those from the control group at the same time points. The design attempts to detect whether the intervention has had an effect signi ficantly greater than any underlying trend over time. Controlled before -and-after studies: Studies that measure outcomes in an intervention group and control group before and after the implementation of an intervention. Outcomes for the intervention and c ontrol groups at the same time point are compared. Case -control studies: Studies that compare people with a specific outcome of interest ('cases') with people from the same source population but without that outcome ('controls'). The association between e xposure and non -exposure to whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice with outcomes is examined. The following types of studies are excluded: Case series studies: an uncontrolled observationa l study involving an intervention and outcome for more than one person.30 Case reports: an uncontrolled observational study involving an intervention and outcome for a single person (or other unit).30 Cross -sectional studies: studies that examine the relationship between diseases (or other health related characteristics) and other variables of interest as they exist in a defined population at o ne particular time. The temporal sequence of cause and effect cannot necessarily be determined in a cross -sectional study.30 Qualitative studies: a research study that uses a qualitative method of d ata collection and analysis ,32 and Single arm studies: a sample of individuals is given the intervention and then followed over time to observe their response.33 HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 10 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol Case reports, case series and single arm studies do not include contemporaneous comparator groups and do not provide evidence of effectiveness of the intervention. Cross -sectional studies allow for assessment of an association between intervention and outcome but do n ot provide evidence of cause and effect. Qualitative studies do not quantify effectiveness of the intervention which is required to conduct meta -analyses. The study type of a publication will be confirmed by full text review by assessing study design features (Section 24.1 of the Cochrane Handbook34). It is acknowledged that the study design/type stated by the authors may not accurately reflect the actual study features: for studies of effectiveness, caution is required when assessing NRSIs according to existing evidence hierarchies, as the study labels from such hierarchies were originally derived from aetiological research questions and may not be applicable to the broad range of effectiveness studies (Section 24.2.1 of the Cochrane Handbook34). Publication date There will be no limitation to the publication date when the electronic searches for the systematic review are conducted. Studies provided to HealthConsult and Office of the National Health and Medical Research Council (ONHMRC) by Natural Therapies Review Expert Advisory Panel (NTREAP), NTWC or other stakeholders will only be excluded based on publicat ion date where they are published after the search date of the electronic searches for each systematic review literature search. If they are published after the search date but are otherwise eligible, they will be included in the 'Characteristics of studi es awaiting classification' table (see Appendix C , Table 8). Trials that are ongoing, pending publication, or are completed but do not have results available, but otherwise meet inclusion criteria, will be listed as 'ongoing studies' and be documented in a 'Studies awaiting classification' table (see draft template at Table 8, Appendix C ). Such trials may be published as conference abstracts. Studies published in languages other than English Databases in languages other than English w ill not be searched. However, studies published in languages other than English are not excluded from the Review. Refer to Section 2.3.1 for further details on how studies published in languages other than English will be screened. 2.1.2 Types of participants Study populations may have any injury, disease, medical condition, or pre -clinical condition and can be any age. Studies with healthy but at risk populations are also eligible: this includes populations at risk of becoming ill or injured based on social risk factors (e.g. unemployment), biomedical risk factors (e.g. blood pressure), and behavioural risk factors (e.g. high alcohol consumption). There are no restrictions for study setting. Studies that only i nclude healthy populations seeking health improvement are excluded. However, where a study includes both healthy populations (ineligible) and eligible populations and separate data is available for eligible populations , the study will be included . Searche s will be limited to human studies, thus excluding animal and in vitro studies. 2.1.3 Types of interventions Studies which meet the definition of whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice are eligible . Both single and multi -modal interventions are eligible as long as they are described as naturopathy. To be eligible, the HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 11 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol naturopathy intervention must include at least one of the following modal ities that are central to naturopathic care in Australia : herbal medicine, complementary medicine prescription, dietary advice or lifestyle advice. There are no restrictions on the setting in which the naturopathy intervention is delivered, for example in person, by telehealth or by another medium. However, t he intervention must be delivered in the context of naturopathic care , meaning at least one of the following criteria must be met: (1) the study states the interve ntion was delivered by a naturopath (2) the study states the intervention was delivered in the context of naturopathic care (3) the intervention is described by the study as being a naturopathic intervention or by a naturopath. Both single and multi -modal interventions that meet the definition of 'naturopathy' will be synthesised together, with subgroup analys es conducted if there is sufficient evidence within a population to do so. Naturopathic interventions delivered as an adjunct to conventional care ar e eligible only if the comparator group also receive s conventional care . Whole system , multi -modal naturopathy interventions Included are naturopathic intervention s in which multiple modal interventions are delivered, including at least one modality cons idered central to naturopathic care in Australia (as above). Additional modalities may include (but are not limited to) yoga, meditation, exercise prescription, homeopathy and manual therapies such as ma ssage, shiatsu and kinesiology. Whole system, s ingle modal naturopathy interventions Included are naturopathic intervention s in which one of the four modalities considered central to naturopathic care in Australia is delivered (dietary advice, lifestyle advice, herbal medicine, or complementary medicine). Exclusions Studies will be excluded where the 'naturopathic practice' intervention is combined with one or more other co -interventions, unless the effect of the naturopathic pra ctice alone can be determined. Studies are excluded if the intervention is a wh ole system, multi -modal therapy that does not meet the definition of naturopathic practice (for example, other traditional medical systems such as Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda). However, naturopathy interventions that include modalities deriv ed from these systems (for example, yoga, acupuncture) will be eligible for inclusion if the intervention meets the definition of whole system , multi -modal 'naturopathy' as outlined above (i.e. includes at least one of the modalities central to n aturopathi c care in Australia). Modalities that are not central to naturopathic practice in Australia (for example, yoga, meditation, exercise prescription, homeopathy and manual therapies such as massage, shiatsu and kinesiology ), are excluded as single modal natur opathy interventions. However, these interventions are included when incorporated within a whole system , multi -modal naturopathy intervention that includes one or more interventions central to naturopathic care in Australia (see section 2.1.3 'Whole system , multi -modal naturopathy interventions '). HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 12 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol 2.1.4 Types of comparators The types of comparators used in studies will not be restricted. Placebo/ sham (if relevant), inactive control (i.e. inclusive of no intervention, wait list or usual care ) and active comparators ( i.e. inclusive of usual care or control if considered activ e) are eligible for inclusion. Analysis will be stratified by type of comparator: (1) Placebo/sham (if relevant) (2) Inactive Control (i.e. inclusive of no intervention, wait list or usual care) (3) Active comparators , inclusive of usual care or control if considered active . Synthesis of evidence derived from studies with active comparators will be on the advice of the NTWC. Where naturopathy is administered as an adjunct (for example, naturopathy plus standard care vs standard care alone) this will be classified as an inactive comparator and included in comparison (2) above . The Review aims is to assess the effectiveness of naturopathic practice and not different types of naturopathic practice. Thus, s tudies that compare groups receiving one form of whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice with groups receiving a nother type of naturopathic practice (analogous to a head -to-head trial) are not eligible for inclusion. This include s studies comparing multi -modal naturopathic care to single modal naturopathic care, two or more groups each being treated by different types of single modal naturopathic care, or studies that compare two or more groups each treated with diff erent combinations of modalities in their multi -modal care. Comparisons Studies will be compared if they compare naturopathic care (the intervention) with , (1) placebo/sham (if relevant), an (2) inactive control as described above, with similar population groups and outcomes (see section 2.3.11 ). Subgroup analyses will be conducted for studies with multi -modal interventions and single -modal interventions. Studies wit h active comparators will be compared on the advice of the NTWC (see above (3)). 2.1.5 Types of outcome measures Role of outcomes Study eligibility will not be restricted by the type of outcomes measured and outcomes will not be used as an eligibility criterion . All included studies (regardless of their outcome measures or the time points of those outcome measures) will be included in the 'Characteristics of included studies table' (see Appendix C , Table 9). However, only certain outcomes will be extracted and examined in the anal ysis, as indicated by the NTWC prioritisation process . Outcome domains Due to the broad nature of the review, it is not possible to pre -specify outcomes for prioritisation in the review. To prioritise outcomes for data extraction and synthesis, NTWC will undertake a blinded prioritisation exercise. Following the completion of screening, the NTWC will be provided with a list of conditions, outcome domains and outcome measures to prioritise. The list will be based on outcomes reported in the included studi es as well as outcomes included within a relevant core outcome set s (if available), identified using Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET )35 and in other relevant or related Cochrane reviews. No additional information will be provided that could enable NTWC to identify the included studies (e.g . names of authors, the study the country was conducted in), the results of the studies, or the number of studies examining each condition, outcome domain or outcome measure. HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 13 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol Throughout the outcome prioritisation exercise, the NTWC will apply Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)36 principles to identify up to seven critical and/or important (but not critical) outcomes for each population condition, for HealthConsult reviewers to extract and report on . Outcome measures and timepoints of interest The NTWC will focus on the relevance and validity of outcome measures. As the Review is focused on assessing the clinical effectiveness of therapies, the prioritised outcomes will relate to the potential benefits of w hole system, multi -modal or single modal interventi ons delivered in the context of naturopathic practice rather than potential harms. As stated under 'Outcome domains', the NTWC's approach to outcome prioritisation will be blinded. Outcome measures based on personal health care preferences, patient satis faction, safety, quality, and economic outcomes (e.g. cost-effectiveness) are out of scope , as are adverse effects of treatment . However, effectiveness outcomes that show a harm through worsening of symptoms are eligible for inclusion. Timepoints will be pre specified during the outcome prioritisation exercise conducted by the NTWC. I deally , the chosen timepoint will be a clinically important time point (see also Section 2.3.9 , Repeated observations). 2.2 SEARCH METHODS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF STUDIES 2.2.1 Electronic searches The proposed search strategies have been adapted from Myers (2019)2 and Cooley (2012) .37 Search strategies based on whole system naturopathy (including single and multi -modality interventions) were developed for each database and include search terms for the study types RCTs and NRSIs with contemporaneous control groups. The search es have been designed so that they are restricted to humans but are not restricted by population, ou tcome, date, language or geography. Search strategies have been designed for the following databases: Medline via OVID Embase Cochrane CENTRAL Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED ) Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINA HL) Databases in languages other than English will not be searched. The proposed search strategies for each database are included in Appendix B . Database -specific terms for Medline, Embase, AMED, CINAHL and Cochrane CENTRAL are included . This include d the use of a controlled vocabulary ( refer to S ection 4.4.4 of the Cochrane Handboo k38) to map search terms to the individual database's subject headings , as MeSH (Medline and Cochrane) terms . The subject headings used in other databases such as Embase are not identical. This w as undertaken by entering (for example) a MeSH term into a database and then selecting the appropriate sub ject headings the database maps the term to. Changes to search terms f or text words or all field codes w ere not req uired . 2.2.2 Other searches The reference lists of included articles will be checked to find additional eligible studies (backwards citation search). HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 14 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol Studies provided by the public and key stakeholders (via the Department of Health), the NTREAP and the NTWC will also be screened for eligibility. Where these groups recommend particular systematic reviews, they will be examined for eligible RCTs and NRSIs. The ONHMRC will also provide the 2015 evidence evaluation for w hole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the context of naturopathic practice to HealthConsult reviewers to identify eligible primary studies within included systematic reviews. Systematic reviews not published in English will not be translated, but will be examined t o identify eligible RCTs and NRSIs. The following c linical trials registries will be searched: International Trials Registry; Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies and publications that have been identified for inclusion by full text review will be checked for retraction or errata within the databases. For example, in Medline using the search strategy 'retracted publication.pt. or retraction of publication.pt. ' (refer to S ection 3.9 of 4.S1 Technical Supplement to Chapter 4 of the Cochrane Handbook39) together with the citations for the eligible studies. Appropriate terms for Embase, the Cochrane library, CINAHL and AMED will be included .39 2.3 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS 2.3.1 Selection of studies Results from electronic database searches Screening of citations will be conducted using Endnote software. Following the database searches, duplicate citations will be removed . The studies will then be screened for eligibility by title and abstract and then by full text. At the title and abstract stage, s tudies will be screened for eligibility by a primary reviewer, with a secondary reviewer independently assessing a n initial 20% of citations .40 The duplicate screening aims to achieve 80% inter annotator agreement between reviewers and will progress until this is achieved. Where there are discrepancies that the two reviewers cannot agree on, a third reviewer 's opinion will be sought . At the full text stage, t wo independent reviewers will screen the reports for eligibility: a ny disagreements will be discussed between the primary and secondary reviewer, with a third reviewer consulted should the former be unable to reach an agreement . Eligibility criteria If multiple reports of the same study are identified, they will be collated so that the study rather than each report is the unit of interest in the Review.38 It is anticipated that multiple reports of a unique study will be identified by their having the same trial identification number, similar author names (reflecting the same research team of a stud y), locations and settings, intervention details, the numbers of participants and their baseline data and the date and duration of the study.38 This will ensure t hat data from a study is included only once in the analyses and syntheses of evidence. For citations of studies published in languages other than English that may be eligible for inclusion according to screening at the title and abstract stage (see below), full text publications will not be translated but will be documented in a 'Studies awaiting classification' table (see draft template at Table 8, Appendix C ). Where it is unclear whether a study meets the meet the definition of whole system, multi -modal or single modal interventions delivered in the contex t of naturopathic practice , HealthConsult will seek further guidance from the NTWC (via NHMRC). NTWC will be presented with the minimum HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 15 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol information required to enable them to determine whether the intervention meets the definition. NTWC will be blinded to identifying details of studies (e.g. study type, sample size, findings). A PRISMA flowchart will be generated to document the results of the searching and screening process. Studies excluded at the full text stage will be tabulated with a corresponding r ationale for exclusion. Citations provided by NTWC, NTREAP and stakeholders The number of primary RCTs and NRSIs and the number of systematic reviews (and the number of primary studies they include) received from NTWC, NTREAP and other stakeholders will be reported in the Review. The number of unique eligible primary studies (that is, studies not identified in the electronic database searches) will be reported. If systematic reviews are provided by NTWC, NTREAP or other stakeholders, the primary RCTs and NRSIs they include will be cross -checked against the citations retrieved in the electronic searches. Any RCTs or NRSIs , including those provided by NTWC, NTREAP or other stakeholders, that were not identified in the electronic searches will be screened by title and abstract and then by full text as described above under Results from electronic database searches . Citations for primary RCTs or NRSIs and 'grey literature' provided by NTWC, NTREAP or other stakeholders will be screened for eligibility as full text citations. As above, two independent reviewers will screen the full text reports for eligibility. Any disagreements will be discussed between the primary and secondary reviewer, with a third revi ewer consulted should the former be unable to reach an agreement . Studies published in languages other than English Studies published in languages other than English that are retrieved will be managed using the following protocol: (1) Database searches will n ot be restricted by language. (2) If the title and abstract are not available in English, they will be translated using Google translator or an equivalent method (then proceed to step 4). (3) If online translation does not facilitate an understanding of the title and abstract, the citations for these studies will be listed as 'studies unable to be translated or interpreted at the title/abstract stage'. (4) Translated titles and abstracts will be screened and citations that are not eligible excluded. The number o f these excluded citations published in languages other than English will be reported in the results of the search and in the PRISMA chart . (5) If the translated citation indicates the study is likely to meet the criteria for considering studies for inclusion in the review (based on title and abstract screen), or if there is any uncertainty: The translated citation and available information will be recorded in the 'Studies awaiting classification' table to inform readers of the Review of the availability of oth er possibly relevant reports . The information will also be reflected in the PRISMA flow diagram . A copy of the finalised 'Studies awaiting classification' table s (see Table 8, Appendix C ) will be provided to ONHMRC, noting that the review is not expected to inc lude any of these articles. The potential risk of language bias and the implications in the Evidence Evaluation Report will be appraised. Appropriate qualifying statements will be presented throughout the Evidence Evaluation Report that acknowledge only the evidence published in English was reviewed. Potential limitations due to language bias and the potential impact on certainty of evidence will be presented in the Evidence Evaluation Report, noting that they may influence the conclusions of the Review. HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 16 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol 2.3.2 Data collection process Information, including results d ata will be extracted into tables (Word software ) by two reviewers independently ( see data extraction template s in Appendix C , Table 9 and Table 10). Disagreements will be resolved by discussion between the two reviewers, with a third reviewer consulted if agreement cannot be reached between the former . The table templates will first be pilot tested by the two reviewers responsible for data extraction (Table 9 and Table 10). Each reviewer will independently extract a sample of three representative primary studies which will represent the range of study types and PICO eligible for inclusion within the review . The completed tables will be checked by the lead reviewer a nd any necessary changes to the templates or the instructions for using them will be made. This will allow for consistency in the data extraction process across reviewers. 2.3.3 Requests for data Where feasible (i.e. authors contact details are included in the publication) and if relevant , any missing information from the included studies will be sought from the original authors. Two contact attempts by email will be made to the author prior to stating the data as missing in the evidence evaluation and/or technical report. 2.3.4 Data items The data to be extracted from eligible studies are:41 Study citation Year of publication Study type: RCTs or NRSI w ith contemporaneous comparator (e.g. cohort or case -control studies) Study duration Country Population group , number of participants, setting, and demographic data (including gender, age, condition and/or diagnosi s), inclusion and exclusion criteria Interv ention :41, 42 1.

Outcomes: The outcome results may be continuous or dichotomous (categorical) and will include 'critical ' and 'important but not critical ' outcomes (up to seven) and the timepoints at which they were measured . Outcomes: 1. Primary outcomes: Description, including measurement metho d 2. Secondary outcomes: Description, including measurement method 3. Whether there is evidence that the outcome domain was assessed (especially important if the outcome was assessed but the results not presented) 4. Measurement tool or instrument (including defini tion of clinical outcomes or endpoints); for a scale, name of the scale, upper and lower limits, and whether a high or low score is favourable, definitions of any thresholds if appropriate 5.

For each group, and for each outcome at each time point: number of participants randomly assigned and included in the an alysis; and number of participants who withdrew, were lost to follow -up or were excluded (with reasons for each)If subgroup analysis is planned, the same information would need to be extracted for each participant subgroup Results data: 1. Intervention resul ts: participant number, mean/proportion estimate): participant number, mean/proportion 3. Point estimate: risk estimates and direction of effect . This will included estimates that are adjusted for confounders, if reported by the study. 4. Meas ures of variation: such as standard deviation, standard error and 95% confidence intervals. Other: funding source s, notable conflicts of interest of trial authors . Refer to Table 9 and Table 10 in Appendix C for information and data extraction templates. Data required to assess studies' risk of bias will also be extracted (see sections 2.3.6 and 2.3.7 and Table 11 to Table 13 in Appendix C ). 2.3.5 Missing data Data will be analysed on an intention to treat (ITT) basis where possible, including when conducting meta -analyses. Missing data such as standard deviations will be imputed if the study reports sufficient results to permit confidence in such calculations , for example using the calculation methods in sections 6.5.2.2 and 6.5.2.3 of the Cochrane Handbook43. Where possible and relevant , the study authors will be contacted to obtain missing data , as described in Section 2.3.3 . If assumptions are made regarding any of the methods used to address missing data (for example, that the data are assumed missing at random), they will be stated clearly. Sensitivity analyses ( refer to S ection 2.3.14 ) will be performed to assess how sensitive the results are to reasonable changes in the assumptions made. Risk of bias due to missing outcome data will be HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 18 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol assessed as per Sections 2.3.6 , 2.3.7 and 2.3.13 . The potential impact of missing data on the findings of this Review will also be addressed in the Discussion section (section 10.12, Cochrane Handbook44). 2.3.6 Tools to address risk of bias in individual studies Randomised controlled trials and pseudorandomised controlled trials The risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2 (ROB2) for RCTs.45, 46 This tool is comprised of five domains and if a study assesses more than one outcome, the tool is applied to each relevant outcome separately : (1) Risk of bias arising from the randomisation process . (2) Risk of bias due to deviat ions from the intended interventions (effect of assignment to intervention or effect of adhering to intervention) . (3) Risk of bias due to missing outcome data . (4) Risk of bias in measurement of the outcome . (5) Risk of bias in selection of the reported result. The R OB2 provides an assessment template for the five domains with signalling questions in each domain .47 For each domain, the tool provides an algorithm to rate whether the risk of bias is low, of some concern or high and an algorithm is also pr ovided to rate the overall risk of bias as low, of some concern or high.45 For each outcome, the risk of bias assessment will be reported in the template shown at Table 11 (see Appendix C). The judgement of the risk of bias for each of the five domains (high risk, some concerns, low risk) and a rationale for the judgement will be reported, in addition to the overall risk of bias for the outcome . The overall risk of bias for the outcome will also be reported in the outcomes data extraction template (see Table 10 in Appendix C). The effect of interest will be assignment to the interventions at baseline (i.e. intention to treat) . Non-randomised studies of interventions The risk of bias for NRSIs will be assessed using : the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Intervention (ROBINS -I) tool48 for all NRSIs except for case -control studies the SIGN checklist for case -control studies version 2.049, for case -control studies . The ROBINS -I tool assesses risk of bias for a particular outcome of a study in the following seven domains: (1) Bias due to confounding (2) Bias in the selection of participants into the study (3) Bias in classification of interventions (4) Bias due to deviations from intended interventions (5) Bias due to missing data (6) Bias in measurement of outcomes (7) Bias in selection of the reported result. The ROBINS -I provides a template for assessing all seven domains with signalling questions for each domain .50 For each domain, an algorithm determines whether the risk of bias is low, moderate, serious, critical or that there is no information on which to base a judgement for that domain and a nother algor ithm determines the overall risk of bias for the study's outcome, as low, moderate, serious, critical, or that there is no information on which to base a judgement about risk of bias.48 For each outcome in an NRSI (with the exception of case -control studies) , the risk of bias assessment will be reported in the template shown at Table 12 (see Appendix C). The judgement of the risk of bias for each of the seven domains (low risk, moderate risk, serious risk, HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 19 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol critical risk or no information) and a rationale for the judgement will be reported, in addition to the overall risk of bias. The effect of interest will be assignment to the interventions at baseline. The ROBINS -I tool requires that potential confounding domains and co -interventions be pre- specified . Potential confounding domains and co -interventions will be identified for each population/conditi on; where studies examine very different outcomes for the same population/condition, relevant confounding domains and co -interventions to these outcomes will also be identified. NTWC advice will be sought to identify relevant and typical confounding domains and co -interventions as required. In addition, the ROBINS -I tool requires that potential confounding domains and co -interventions specific to the study bein g assessed or which were identified as important by the study authors be reported. If an NRSI is assessed as being at critical risk of bias in any one domain, its details will be recorded in characteristics of included studies table and the reason for critical risk of bias rating documented , but it will not be further assessed and will not contribute to data synthesis . It is acknowledged that the ROBINS -I tool was developed to alig n more closely with NRSIs of cohort -like study designs.48 While signalling questions are yet to be published for before -after studies (e.g. time -interrupted series studies), the Cochrane handbook provides guidance on applying the tool to these designs ( Table 1, see T able 25.6a of the Cochrane Handbook51). Table 1: Controlled before -after studies (including time -interrupted series) - considerations in ROBINS -I risk of bias assessments51 ROBINS -I risk of bias doma in Consideration s in assessing bias domain Confounding Whether: measurements of outcomes were made at sufficiently many time points, in both the intervention and comparator groups, to permit characterization of pre - intervention trends and patterns; any ex traneous events or changes in context around the time of the intervention that could have influenced the outcome were experienced equally by both intervention groups; and pre-intervention trends and patterns in outcomes were analysed appropriately and foun d to be similar across the intervention and comparator groups. Selection of participants into the study The issues are similar to those for follow -up studies. For repeated cross -sectional surveys of a population, there is the potential for selection bias if changes in the types of participants/units included in repeated surveys differ between intervention and comparator groups. Deviations from intended interventions [If assessing on the basis of assignment to intervention] The issues are th e same as for follow -up (cohort) studies. Missing data Whether outcome data were missing for whole clusters as well as for individual participants. Measurement of the outcome Whether: methods of outcome assessment were comparable across intervention grou ps and before and after the intervention; and there were changes in systematic errors in measurement of the outcome coincident with implementation of the intervention. Selection of the reported result The issues are the same as for follow -up studies. Reproduced with permission, Cochrane Handbook version 6.1, 2020 There is at present little guidance on how to adapt the ROBINS -I tool for case -control studies , although i t is recognised that recall bias contributes to the misclassification of intervention status.51 It is thus proposed to assess the risk of bias in case -control studies using the SIGN checklist for case -control studies version 2.0.49 The SIGN checklist assesses internal validity of case -control studies through 11 questions (see Table 13, Appendix C ) that cover the domains of subject selection, assessment measurement, confounding and statistical analysis. The checklist then provides an overall assessment of how well the study minimised the risk of bias or confounding. Judgements for each of the items in the checklist will be reported for each outcome, as well as the HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 20 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol overall assessment. A case -control study will be recorded in the characteristics of included studies table but it will not be furth er assessed and will not contribute to data synthesis if: the overall assessment of how well the study minimised risk of bias or confounding is judged as unacceptable the study does not include clear definitions of the source population the study does no t comment on how cases or controls were selected the outcome measures are not stated or t he study bases its main conclusions on secondary outcomes; or the study does not address the possibility of confounding . The reason for exclusion from data synthesis will be included in the 'Characteristics of included studies ' table. 2.3.7 Risk of bias assessment process The risk of bias will be assessed by two revi ewers independently. Any disagreements will be discussed between the two reviewers, with a third reviewer consulted should the former be unable to reach an agreement. The risk of bias assessment tools will be piloted for a sample of three RCTs (Cochrane Risk of Bias tool), three NRSIs including cohort, before -after and time -interrupted series studies (ROBINS - I tool) and three case -control studies (SIGN) to include the range of study types and PICO eligible for inclusion within the review . The two r eview ers responsible for data extraction will complete the risk of bias assessments and the lead reviewer will check the completed assessments and discuss how differences can be resolved. This will allow for consistency in the risk of bias assessment process, including the management of differences in identifying potential confounders according to the ROBINS -I tool. If there are sufficient studies, risk of bias will also be addressed by sensitivity analyses (refer to Section 2.3.14 ). 2.3.8 Measures of effect Measurement of treatment effect will be by mean differences (MD) (preferred) or standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (continuous outcomes) and ri sk ratios (preferred) or odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (dichotomous data) (refer to Sections 6.4 and 6.5 of the Cochrane Handbook 201943). Hazard ratios will be extracted for studies that assess time to event (refer to Section 6.8, Cochrane Handbook 201943). To reduce effects of confounding, summary statistics from NRSIs will be reported as adjusted effect estimates where available. The minimally clinically important difference (MCID) will be sourced from published reports where possible, or will be guided by advice from the NTWC ; alternatively, a 25% relative risk increase of 25% or more will be used as a default threshold for appreciable h arm or benefit (GRADE Handbook section 5.2.4.2) . For continuous outcomes , standardised mean difference (SMD) will be calculated, if not already reported by studies, prior to analysis and synthesis by meta -analysis (section 6.5.1.2 of the Cochrane Handbook43). This is appropriate where an outcome has been measured using different scales in different studies. 2.3.9 Unit of analysis issues For eligible RCTs or NRSIs, the unit of analysis is the individual participant. Attention will be given to cross -over RCTs and cluster RCTs to avoid under - or -overestimating precision (refer to Section 6.2, Cochrane Handbook 201943). Cluster randomised controlled trials HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 21 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol If the study is a cluster RCT, the unit of analysis will be the cluster reported by the RCT. If they are included in a meta -analysis, then the cluster will be treated as though it is a single individual, using summary measurements from each cluster (Cochrane Handbook section 23.1.331). It is acknowledged that if clusters vary in their size, the precision of the effect estimate may be reduced. Thus, i f a meta -analysis includes cluster RCTs, sensitivity analyses will be performed by excluding the cluster RCTs (refer to Section 2.3.14 ). For cluster RCTs where the report has inappropriately analysed its results as though it is the individual that is randomised (i.e. unit -of-analysis error), they will only be included in meta -analyses if they present sufficient information that allow for approximate correct analyses (Cochrane Handbook section 23.1.431): (1) the number of clusters (or groups) randomized to each intervention group and the total number of participants in the study; or the average (mean) size of each cluster; (2) the outcome data ignoring the cluster design for the total number of individuals (e.g. the number or proportion of individuals with events, or means and standard deviations for continuous data); and (3) an estimate of the intracluster (or intraclass) correlation coefficient (ICC). An effective sample size can then be calculated to reduce the size of the cluster trial for meta - analysis : 1 + (average cluster size - 1) x ICC. Cross -over trials Cross -over trials will be included where it is appropriate to do so in the context of PICO criteria and in line with section 23.2.2 of the Cochrane Handboo k31 (see section 2.1.1 ). There are three to incorpora ting cross -over trials in meta -analyses, each also with potential unit of analysis issues (Cochrane Handbook section 23.2.6):31 (1) treat all intervention measu rements and all comparator measurements as though the trial were a parallel RCT. The Cochrane Handbook recommends avoiding this approach as unit of analysis errors may arise from the confidence intervals being too wide resulting in the trial receiving too little weight and clinically important heterogeneity may be disguised. (2) include only the data from the first period prior to the cross -over (equivalent to a parallel RCT) . This subset of data may be biased if its reporting by researchers depends on their h aving found statistically significant carry -over. However, it may be appropriate if carry -over is thought to be a problem or if the cross -over design is considered inappropriate (see section 2.1.1 ). (3) impute missing standard deviations for inappropriately reported cross -over trials to approximate a paired analysis. However, th e suitability of this method depends on the confidence in the imputed standard deviations and how robust the meta -analysis results are to plausible imputed results (section 23.2.7 of the Cochrane Handbook31 and section 2.3.5 Missing data ). It is proposed to utilise approach (2): i t is acknowledge d there are potential difficulties and concerns with assessing cross -over RCTs and that even only including the first study period prior to the cross -over (the equivalent of a parallel RCT) may still pose an unacceptable risk of bias (Section 23.2.3, Cochrane Handbook 201931). Thus, if there are a sufficient number of cross -over RCTs that meet the inclusion criteria, a meta -analysis will be conducted separate to ( Section 23.2.8, Cochrane Handbook 201931). Repeated observations For studies that assess the same outcome several times over a long duration, it is acknowledge d that r esults from more than one timepoint for each study cannot be combined in a standard meta - analysis without a unit -of-analysis error (Section 6.2.4 of the Cochrane Handbook43). Timepoints will be pre -specified during outcome prioritisation exercise conducted by the NTWC. Ideally , the chosen timepoint will be a clinically important timepoint .43 It is acknowledge d that choosing a timepoint that maximises the data available may lead to reporting biases.43 HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 22 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol Naturopath practitioners treating multiple trial participants A unit -of-analysis error could arise in an individually randomised trial where naturopath practitioners each treat multiple participants. Outcomes of participants of the same naturopat h practitioner will be correlated, and if this correlation is not accounted for in the study analysis, the study's standard error may be incorrect which has implications for the meta -analysis. If such intervention -related clustering is identified, it will be described narratively with consideration given to any impacts of clustering in the Review findings. No imputation or statistical methods will be used to adjust for this clustering. 2.3.10 Studies with more than two intervention groups For eligible studies wit h more than two groups, results from treatment arms that do not meet the criteria for the intervention or comparator will be excluded from the analyses (section 23.3.2, Cochrane Handbook 201931). If all groups are eligible or more than two groups are eligible , they will be included in the analyses. Care will be taken where a study with more than two groups is included in a meta -analysis, so that the partici pants from the one treatment arm are only included once (section 23.3.4, Cochrane Handbook 201931). Where appropriate and possible, groups will be combined to allow for pair -wise comparisons in -modal interventions that meet the definition of 'naturopathy' will be synthesised together, with subgroup analyses conducted if there is sufficient evidence within a population to do so. See section 2.1.3 for definitio ns of whole system, multi -modal and whole system, single modal interventions. The primary comparison of interest will be naturopathic car e vs placebo/sham (if relevant). synthesis will be undertaken for studies that compare naturopathic care with either Placebo/ sham (if relevant) or (in the absence of studies measuring placebo/sham ); inactive control ( including no intervention/treatment, wait list or usual care. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to investigate the robustness of the treatm ent effect by performing analysis that includes all trials combined, i.e. trials with placebo /sham or inactive control to see if inclusion of trials that did not blind participants changed the overall treatment effect. Results data from studies comparing naturopath ic care with 'other' interventions will be extracted and presented in data tables, but will not be synthesised further, except where requested by the NTWC. These data will be presented as an 'evidence inventory' to provide a snapshot of the available evid ence comparing naturopathic care with 'other' interventions. The NTWC may request that data comparing naturopathic care with an 'other' intervention be synthesised, where: at least two studies compare the effect of naturopathic care with the same active c omparator, and the comparator is sufficiently homogenous across studies to support synthesis, and at least two of these studies are at low or moderate risk of bias, and the comparator represents an accepted, evidence -based 'gold standard' of care for the population in question. Such cases will be identified by the NTWC through blinded discussions with HealthConsult reviewers at the data synthesis stage, or prior to provision of the draft evaluation report. When reviewing full text articles, studies (including conference abstracts) with no useable results data will not be included in any syntheses: this may occur when data is not presented in a useable HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 23 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol form, for example, when study authors state there is no difference in an outcome but do not provide point estimates that can be assessed. Studies that state they collected data on an outcome but do not report on it will be consi dered under reporting bias (section 2.3.13 ). A hand search will be undertaken to locate eligible additional publications based on the same study that have not alrea dy been identified. Assessing the evidence for h eterogeneity Where there are at least two RCTs or two NRSIs that are sufficiently similar in population and outcome that can be included in a meta -analysis and that meet the criteria for quantitative synthesi s as described in Section 2.3.11 heterogeneity will be quantified and assessed using a chi - squared test with a significance level of p=0.1 and by I2 statistics (Coch rane Handbook section 10.10.244, calculated by RevMan version 5.3).52 Forest plots will also be generated and a visual inspection of the overlap of the confidence intervals will be taken into consideration when assessing heterogeneity . As per Section 10.1 0.2 of the Cochrane Handbook,44, 53 the I2 value will be interpreted as follows: 0% to 40%: might not be important 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity 50% to 90%: represen t substantial heterogeneity 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity. A low p value in the chi -squared test indicates evidence of heterogeneity of intervention effects.53 Heterogeneity will be reported descriptively for other studies that are not included in a meta - analysis and therefore do not have an I2 statistic calculated . Synthesis of RCTs Meta -analyses using RevMan52 will be performed if there are at least two RCTs with similar outcome measures and population and which me et the criteria for quantitative synthesis as described in Section 2.3.11 The analyses will be conducted for studies with control (inactive) comparators. Studies wi th 'active' comparators will from NTWC (see Section 2.1.4 ). See Section 2.3.8 regarding the treatment measurements to be extracted for analysis. Random effec ts (DerSimonian and Laird method , inverse variance )52 models will be used to calculate confidence intervals a nd to incorporate the heterogeneity among studies ( refer to u sing RevMan 5.352 will be performed if there are at least two NRSIs of similar outcome measures and population and which meet the criteria for quantitative synthesis as described in Section 2.3.11 . Studies assessed as having critical risk of bias according to ROBINS -I or for case -control studies assessed as rejected/unacceptable according to the SIGN checklist will be excluded from synthesis (see section 2.3.6 ). The analyses will be conducted for studies with control (inactive) comparators. Studies with 'active' comparators will be from NTWC (see Section 2.1.4 ). NRSIs will be included in a single meta -analysis for a particular comparison and outcome, with subgroup analyses by different NRSI types (e.g. cohort studies, case -control studi es) and by overall risk of bias judgement . See Section 2.3.8 regarding the treatment measurements to be extracted for analysis. Random effects (DerSimonian and Laird method52) models will be used to incorporate heterogeneity among studies ( refer to Coch rane and 10.10.444). Methods for calculating heterogeneity variance are detailed above under ' Assessing the evidence for heterogeneity '. HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 24 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol 2.3.12 Summary and synthesis when meta -analysis is not possible Evidence from RCTs and NRSIs where a meta -analysis is not appropriate and/or possible (refer to 12.1 Cochrane handbook54) will be synthesised as described below . Sufficiently -powered studies with low risk of bias will not be excluded from the synthesis but the synthesised result will comprise two parameters: (1) Where there are studies that are sufficiently powered (i.e. have a proportionate sample size to the research question e.g. measuring the difference between groups) , with a low risk of bias , which cannot be included in meta -analyses, their results will be emphasised in the narrative description and presented in the comments section of the Summary of Findings table . For example, the results may be reported as, ' Results from one study (N=550) at low risk of bias: RR 0.71 (0.27, 1.88), p -value (e.g. 0.05), favours intervention .' (2) The results of the remaining studies (i.e. those not sufficiently powered) will be summarised using vote -counting (based on direction of effect, not statistical significance , refer to section 12.2.1.3, Cochrane Handbook54). For example, the results may be reported as, ' 3/5 of the remaining studies reported an effect in favour of the intervention '. Evidence of an effect will be assessed using the Sign Test. If there are no sufficiently powered studies with low risk of bias, then vote -counting will be conducted for all studies (based on direction of effect). Vote -counting results will also be presented narratively in the comments section of the Summary of Fin dings table for the relevant outcome . Results will also be displayed as a forest plot without the summary diamond, to provide a visual display of each individual studies' summary statistics. 2.3.13 Risk of reporting bias across studies The selective reporting or under -reporting of outcomes will be assessed for individual RCTs and NRSIs as part of the risk of bias assessment ( refer to S ections 2.3.6 and 2.3.7 ). The non -reporting of evidence refers to when evidence is not available. This includes s tudies which state in their methodology or trial protocol that they will assess certain outcomes, but then do not report the results of those outcomes or do not report the outcomes in a useable form for data synthesis (e .g., may only state there was no dif ference or that there was a significant difference but without presenting means or point estimates). Studies that may exhibit non -reporting of evidence will be identified when published reports are screened at the full -text stage (section 2.3.1 ), where studies report no useable results for the outcomes prioritised by the NTWC , and also when trial registries are searched (section 2.2.2 , Chapter 13.2 of the Cochrane Handbook55). This will assist in reducing bi as due to non -reporting of evidence. Such studies will be documented in the data extraction table (see template Table 10, Appendix C ) and that their outcome results are missing; if significance or direction of effect are reported, they will be included here. In line with signalling questions 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 of the preliminary Risk of Bias due to Missin g Evidence tool (ROB -ME)56 and with section 13.3 of the Cochrane Handbook55, the impact of risk of bias attributed to non -reporting of results on data syntheses will be appraised by comparing studies that did not report results with studies that were included in a meta -analysis for a particular compa rison and outcome according to: The number of studies; The sample sizes of the studies; Direction of effect and/or p value if reported. From these comparisons, the Review will formulate a conclusion as to whether the non -reporting of results for a particul ar comparison and outcome contributes a substantial risk of bias. For example, if studies that do not report results for outcomes of interest have large sample sizes or HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 25 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol there are more of them than there are studies that can be incorporated into a meta -analysis, there is likely to be risk of bias in the data synthesis. Non-reporting bias as publication bias will also be assessed via regular funnel plots (section 5.2.5, GRADE Handbook 201336), where there are at least 10 (sections 13.3.5.2 and 13.3.5.5 of the Cochrane Handbook 201955) with similar populations, interventions and outcome measures with which to conduct a meta -analysis. However, it is acknowledge d that there are limitations with funnel plots as an index of publication bias and undue weight will not be placed on their findings (sections 13.3.5.2 and 13.3.5.5 of the Cochrane Handbook55). It is acknowledged that small studies may be awarded relatively more weight in a random effects analysis (section 10.10.4 of the Cochrane Handbook44). The impact of such studies, if there are sufficient studies overall to conduct a meta -analysis, will be tested in sensitivity analyses (see section 2.3.14 ). 2.3.14 Addressing risk of bias If there are sufficient eligible RCTs to conduct meta -analyses, risk of bias will be addressed by sensitivity analyses ( refer to section 7.6.1 of the Cochrane Handbook57 and di scussed below ). Where there are outcome measures and populations with less than two RCTs and/or NRSIs, the studies will be presented with a narrative discussion of the risk of bias across the studies.57 The GRADE system (refer to Section 2.3.16 ) will be used as an explicit measure of the certainty of evidence across the studies to help ensure that judgements about the risk of bias are considered appropriately when i nterpreting the results of the review .57 This will also help ensure other factors affecting the quality of evidence, such as imprecision, heterogeneity (see Section 2.3.11 ) and publication bias (refer to Section 2.3.13 ) are also taken into consideration. Sensitivity analyses Providing there are sufficient included RCTs or NRSIs , sensitivity analyses (refer to Section 10.1444 and Section 13.3.5.6 of the Cochrane Handbook55) will be pe rformed where meta -analyses have been conducted to explore the influence of the following on treatment effect: exclusion of high risk of bias studies (refer to Section 12.4.4.2, Cochrane Handbook 201954) exclusion of studies with notably long follow -up times or large study populations, to establish how much influence they have on results exclusion of cluster RCTs (refer to Section 23.1.6, Cochrane Handbook 201931); exclusion of small studies (n<20) . 2.3.15 Subgroup analyses Subgroup analyses (refer to Sections 10.11.2 and 10.11.3 of the Cochrane Handbook 201944) will be undertaken if applicable, if there are sufficient numbers of RCTs or NSRIs and on the basis of: relevant sub-populations, such as by disease severity (eg, stage of kidney disease, stage of cancer) and by recognised disease subgroups (e .g. different forms of arthritis, type 1 versus type 2 diabetes) . Justification for the use of subgroups is based on the variation of treatment effect as it relates to the biolog ical disease severity or classification. intervention -specific groups: multi -modal versus specific single modal interventions. It is acknowledged that the subgroups will be context -dependent on the populations and modal interventions included in the Review. HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 26 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol 2.3.16 Certainty of the evidence The certainty of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach , which involves considering a range of factors that may decrease or increase certainty in the evidence to arrive at an overall 'certainty of the evidence' rating .36 The certainty will be categorised as: High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate: We are moderately confiden t in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different . Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially differ ent from the estimate of the effect. Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect . Certainty of the evidence will be assessed for key outcomes (critical outcomes and important (but not 'not critical ') outcomes) . RCTs and NRSIs will be assessed separately. Assessment will be by two independent reviewers : disagreements will be resolved by discussion between the two reviewers, with a third reviewer consult ed if the former cannot reach agreement. The GRADE approach commences by first asses sing the following five factors and considering whether their certain ty should be downgraded :36 Risk of bias : as assessed by the risk of bias too ls (Section 2.3.6 ). The overall risk of bias across all studies contributing to each result and the extent to which high risk of bias studies influen ce the result (i .e. the weight these studies have in the meta -analysis) will be considered. Imprecision : there is greater imprecision indicated by wide confidence intervals and small sample sizes . Further, imprecision is indicated when the confidence inter val crosses the minimal clinically important threshold w here the decision between recommending and not recommending a treatment is made and therefore encompasses both benefit and harm . The minimally clinically important difference (MCID) will be sourced from published reports where possible, or will be guided by advice from the NTWC (see section 2.3.8 ); alternatively, a 25% relative risk increase of 25% or more will used as a default threshold for appreciable harm or benefit (GRADE Handbook section 5.2.4.2) . If the MCID is not crossed by the confidence interval , imprecision may also be indicated by optimal information size (OIS) . The OIS is calculated as the total number of participants included in the Review for a key outcome that is less than the number required for a sufficiently powered trial.58 In dichotomous outcomes, imprecision is indicated if the OIS is not met or when the OIS is met and the 95% confidence interval overlaps 'no effect'. An exception to rating down imprecision when the OIS is not met would be where the event rate w as very low and the sample size was very large, with at least 2,000 participants (GRADE Handbook section 5.2.4. 1). Similar criteria for rating down for imprecision appl y to continuous outcomes , including when sample sizes are less than 400 (GRADE Handbook section 5.2.4.2). Inconsistency: reflected by the heterogeneity of the results . This will involve visual inspection of the overlap in confidence intervals, in combination with cautious interpretation of heterogeneity statistics, and whether any observed inconsistency can be explained . Indirectness : reflected by how well the studies match all elements of the PICO criteria (see Sections 2.1.1 , 2.1.3 , 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 ). This includes how applicable a study's population, intervention and outcomes are to that of the PICO criteria's and whether the outcome results are measured directly (a patient -important outcome) or by a surrogate endpoint (GRADE Handbook section 5.2.3). Publication bias: as described in Section 2.3.13 . Following the assessment of the first five factors, the certainty of evidence may then be upgraded (i.e. certainty in the evidence may be increased ) in the presence of : very large effect size a dose -response relationship HealthConsult National Health and Medical Research Council Page 27 Naturopathy Review A Draft Research Protocol increased effect despite having plausible confounders that should have reduced effect , or results show no effect despite plausible c onfounders that should have led to increased effect . Incorporating recent advice from the GRADE Working Group regarding the use of ROBINS -I in evaluating risk of bias for NRSIs,59, 60 the GRADE assessment process will commence at high certainty of evidence for both RCTs and NRSIs. For each of the GRADE domains (risk of bias, prec ision, consistency, directness/indirectness and publication and reporting bias ), an assessment will be made as to whether there are low or no concerns (no subtractions to the certainty of evidence rank), serious concerns (subtract 1) or very serious concer ns (subtract 2) . Following an assessment of the factors for downgrading certainty , consideration will be given to whether there are any circumstances that warrant 'rating up' certainty in the evidence , based on the three factors outlined above and in acco rdance with GRADE guidance.36 The rationale for dow ngrading (or upgrading) the certainty in the evidence will be provided as footnotes (see 'Summary of findings' tables). 2.3.17 'Summary of findings' table s The findings from RCTs and NRSIs will be presented separately within the Summary of Findings table . Findin gs will be presented as point estimates (mean differences and risk ratios) with 95% confidence intervals, for the key outcomes that were assessed by meta -analysis (see Table 2 for the Summary of Findings table template ). For studies that were assessed by vote-counting , the vote-count and non -parametric test results will also be presented in the Summary of Findings table (see section 2.3.12 ). See Outcome 4 in Table 2 (below) for example of how these would be presented. Where there is sufficient data, a Summary of Findings table will be produced for each population/condition group. The certainty of the evidence (GRADE) along with any reasons for downgrading will also be presented. The tables will be generated using GRADEPro software.

MeSH search terms for naturopathy and therapies were mapped to specific CINAHL subject headings and wit h appropriate field codes , where possible , for inclusion in the search. It should be noted that some MeSH terms, when translated to CINAHL subject headings, could not be exploded. MeSH terms for which there were no CINAHL subject headings were included a s keywords.

Date of search: 8 April 2021 B.5 AMED VIA OVID For the AMED proposed search strategy , no sensitive search filter for RCTs and NRSIs were identified. The search filters for Medline were adapted using AMED synonyms. MeSH search terms for naturopathy and therapies were mapped to specific AMED synonyms where possible for inclusion in the search. Floating subject heading and text word field codes are not available in AMED and were substituted with subject heading and title/a bstract respectively instead. AMED does not have an additional limiter for 'humans'. However, a restriction to human studies is part of the RCT and NRSI search filters .
