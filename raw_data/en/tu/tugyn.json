Criteria for ICD placement in individuals with cardiac ion channelopathies derive from results of clinical input, a 2013 consensus statement from the HRS, European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), and the Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society on the diagnosis and mana gement of individuals with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes (Priori et al [2013]), 2017 guidelines from ACC, AHA, and HRS on the management of heart failure (Al -Khatib et al [2017]), and a report from the HRS and EHRA's Second Consensus Conference on Brugada syndrome. Indications for consideration for ICD placement for each cardiac ion channelopathy are as follows: Long QT syndrome (LQTS): o Individuals with a diagnosis of LQTS who are survivors of cardiac arrest o Individuals with a diagnosis of LQTS wh o experience recurrent syncopal events while on - blocker therapy. Brugada syndrome (BrS): o Individuals with a diagnosis of BrS who are survivors of cardiac arrest o Individuals with a diagnosis of BrS who have documented spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) with or without syncope o Individuals with a spontaneous diagnostic type 1 electrocardiogram (ECG) who have a history of syncope, seizure, or nocturnal agonal respiration judged to be likely caused by ventricular arrhythmias (after noncardiac c auses have been ruled out) o Individuals with a diagnosis of BrS who develop ventricular fibrillation during programmed electrical stimulation. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT): o Individuals with a diagnosis of CPVT who are survivo rs of cardiac arrest o Individuals with a diagnosis of CPVT who experience recurrent syncope or polymorphic/bidirectional VT despite optimal medical management, and/or left cardiac sympathetic denervation. Short QT syndrome (SQTS): o Individuals with a diagnosis of SQTS who are survivors of cardiac arrest o Individuals with a diagnosis of SQTS who are symptomatic and have documented spontaneous VT with or without syncope o Individuals with a diagnosis of SQTS or are asymptomatic or symptomatic and ha ve a family history of sudden cardiac death. **Criteria for Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Implantation in Individuals with Cardiac Sarcoid Criteria for ICD placement in individuals with cardiac sarcoid derive from a 2014 consensus statement from the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and 2017 joint guidelines from the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and HRS. Indications for consideration of ICD placement in individuals diagnosed with cardiac sarcoid are as follows: 4 Spontaneous sustained ventricular arrhythmias, including prior cardiac arrest, if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected; LVEF 35% or less, despite optimal medical therapy and a period of immunosuppression (if there is active inflammation), if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected; LVEF greater than 35%, if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected; AND o syncope or near -syncope, felt to be arrhythmic in etiolo gy OR o evidence of myocardial scar by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) or positron emission tomographic (PET) scan OR o sustained ventricular arrhythmias (>30 seconds of monomorphic VT orpolymorphic VT) or clinically relevant ventricular fibrillation An indication for permanent pacemaker implantation.

Treatment Implantable defibrillators (ICDs) a patient's heart rate, recognize ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia (VT), and deliver an electric shock to terminate these arrhythmias to reduce the risk of SCD. Indications for ICD placement can be broadly subdivided into (1) secondary prevention, ie, use 6 in patients who have experienced a potentially life -threatening episode of VT (near SCD); and (2) primary prevention , ie, use in patients who are considered at high risk for SCD but who have not yet experienced life-threatening VT or ventricular fibrillation. The standard ICD placement surgery involves placement of a generator in the subcutaneous tissue of the chest wa ll. Transvenous leads are attached to the generator and threaded intravenously into the endocardium. The leads sense and transmit information on cardiac rhythm to the generator, which analyzes the rhythm information and produces an electrical ventricular f ibrillation shock when a malignant arrhythmia is recognized. A subcutaneous ICD (S -ICD) has been developed. It does not use transvenous leads and thus avoids the need for venous access and complications associated with the insertion of venous leads. Rathe r, the S - ICD uses a subcutaneous electrode implanted adjacent to the left sternum. The electrodes sense the cardiac rhythm and deliver countershocks through the subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall. Several automatic ICDs have been approved by the U.S. F ood and Drug Administration (FDA) through the premarket approval (PMA) process. The FDA labeled indications generally include patients who have experienced life -threatening VT associated with cardiac arrest or VT associated with hemodynamic compromise and resistance to pharmacologic treatment. Also, devices typically have approval in the secondary prevention setting for patients with previous MI and reduced ejection fraction. Summary Description An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a device d esigned to monitor a patient's heart rate, recognize ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, and deliver an electric shock to terminate these arrhythmias to reduce the risk of sudden death. A subcutaneous ICD (S -ICD), which lacks transvenous leads, is intended to reduce lead -related complications. Summary of Evidence Transvenous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators For individuals who have a high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy in transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (T - ICD) placement for primary prevention, the evidence includes multiple well -designed and well - conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as systematic reviews of these tr ials. Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), morbid events, quality of life, and treatment -related mortality and morbidity. Multiple well -done RCTs have shown a benefit in overall mortality for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and reduced ejecti on fraction. Randomized controlled trials implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) use following recent myocardial infarction (MI) did not support a benefit for immediate versus delayed implantation for at least 40 days. For nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM), there are less clinical trial data, but pooled estimates of available evidence from RCTs enrolling patients with NICM and from subgroup analyses of RCTs with mixed populations have supported a survival benefit for this group. The ev idence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. For individuals who have a high risk of SCD due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in adulthood who receive T -ICD placement for primary prevention , the evidence includes several large registry studies. Relevant outcomes are OS, morbid events, quality of life, and treatment -related mortality and morbidity. In these studies, the annual rate of appropriate ICD discharge ranged from 3.6% to 5.3%. Given the long -term high risk of SCD in patients with HCM, with the assumption that appropriate shocks are life -saving, these studies are considered adequate evidence to support the use of T -ICDs in patients with HCM. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. For individuals who have a high risk of SCD due to an inherited cardiac ion channelopathy who receive T - ICD placement for primary prevention, the evidence includes small cohort studies o f patients with these 7 conditions treated with ICDs. Relevant outcomes are OS, morbid events, quality of life, and treatment - related mortality and morbidity. The limited evidence for patients with long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and Brugada syndrome has reported high rates of appropriate shocks. No studies were identified on the use of ICDs for patients with short QT syndrome. Studies comparing outcomes between patients treated and untreated with ICDs are not availabl e. However, given the relatively small patient populations with these channelopathies and the high risk of cardiac arrhythmias, clinical trials are unlikely. Given the long -term high risk of SCD in patients with inherited cardiac ion channelopathy, with the assumption that appropriate shocks are life -saving, these studies are considered adequate evidence to support the use of T -ICDs in patients with inherited cardiac ion channelopathy. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a n improvement in the net health outcome. For individuals who have a high risk of SCD due to cardiac sarcoid who receive T -ICD placement for primary prevention, the evidence includes small cohort studies of patients with cardiac sarcoid treated with ICDs who received appropriate shocks. Studies comparing outcomes between patients treated and untreated with ICDs are not available. However, given the relatively small number of patients with cardiac sarcoid (5% of those with systemic sarcoidosis), clinical tri als are unlikely. Given the long -term high risk of SCD in patients with cardiac sarcoid, with the assumption that appropriate shocks are life -saving, these studies are considered adequate evidence to support the use of T -ICDs in patients with cardiac sarco id who have not responded to optimal medical therapy. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. For individuals who have had symptomatic life -threatening sustained ventricular tachycar dia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) or who have been resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest (secondary prevention) who receive T -ICD placement, the evidence includes multiple well -designed and well - conducted RCTs as well as systematic reviews of the se trials. Relevant outcomes are OS, morbid events, quality of life, and treatment -related mortality and morbidity. Systematic reviews of RCTs have demonstrated a 25% reduction in mortality for ICD compared with medical therapy. Analysis of data from a large administrative database has confirmed that this mortality benefit is generalizable to the clinical setting. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Subcutaneous Implantable Cardio verter Defibrillators For individuals who need an ICD and have a contraindication to a T -ICD but no indications for antibradycardia pacing and no antitachycardia pacing -responsive arrhythmias who receive subcutaneous ICD the evidence inc ludes an RCT, nonrandomized studies, and case series. Relevant outcomes are OS, morbid events, quality of life, and treatment -related mortality and morbidity. An RCT found that S -ICD significantly decreases the risk of lead -related perioperative complicati ons compared to T -ICD. However, this study was not powered to detect differences in the rates of failed shocks or inappropriate shocks and an extension study is ongoing. Nonrandomized controlled studies have reported success rates in terminating laboratory -induced VF that are similar to T -ICD. Case series have reported high rates of detection and successful conversion of VF, and inappropriate shock rates in the range reported for T -ICD. Given the need for ICD placement in this population at risk for SCD, with the assumption that appropriate shocks are life -saving, these studies are considered adequate evidence to support the use of S -ICDs in patients with contraindication to T -ICD. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an imp rovement in the net health outcome. For individuals who need an ICD and have no indications for antibradycardia pacing or antitachycardia pacing -responsive arrhythmias with no contraindication to a T -ICD, who receive S -ICD placement, the evidence includes 1 RCT, nonrandomized studies, and case series. Relevant outcomes are OS, morbid events, quality of life, and treatment -related mortality and morbidity. The Prospective, Randomized Comparison of Subcutaneous and Transvenous Implantable Cardioverter Defibri llator Therapy (PRAETORIAN) trial is the only RCT on the effect of an S -ICD with health outcomes. PRAETORIAN found that S -ICD was noninferior to T -ICD on a composite outcome of complications and inappropriate shock at 48 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; 95 % confidence interval 1.45; p=.01 for noninferiority; p=.95 for superiority). There were more device related 8 complications in the T -ICD group and more inappropriate shocks in the S -ICD group, but the trial was not powered for these endpoints. There is uncertainty over the applicability and interpretation of PRAETORIAN based on the choice of a composite outcome with discordant results, unclear rationale for choice of the noninferiority margin, inadequate length of f ollow -up to determine rates of complications, and lack of reporting of quality of life data. Comparative observational studies are insufficient to draw conclusions on whether there are small differences in efficacy between the 2 types of devices, and repor ted variable adverse event rates. Ongoing studies could provide additional evidence on complications and device safety over the longer term. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome. Policy History Date Action 7/2023 Annual policy review.
