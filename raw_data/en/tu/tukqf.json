The massive worldwide Covid vaccination push has not come without consequences. As of this posting there are at least 1 million adverse reactions in VAERS to the covid vaccines including permanent disability and death. Some observers have found that the neurological side effects from the the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines including tremors, loss of feeling, loss of function, Bell's palsy, Guillian-Barre syndrome, etc. are very similar to that of mercury and other heavy metal poisoning. Compare the following adverse reactions taken from the FDA website, and compare them to the known side effects of mercury poisoning from the CDC. Neurological symptoms are very similar. Please note that blood clots and other cardiovascular events are symptoms of the mRNA spike protein, and are not a symptom of mercury poisoning. Blood clotting is not a known side effect of mercury. Known Serious Adverse Side Effects to Covid vaccines (all brands) Here is a listing of Covid vaccine side effects according to a slide presentation from the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting on Oct. 22, 2020: Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome Acute disseminated encephaloymelitis (a brief and widespread inflammation of the brain and spinal cord that damages myelin-the protective nerve fiber cover) Transverse myelitis Encephalitis/myelitis/encephalomyelitis/meningoencephalitis/meningitis/encepholaphathy Convulsions/seizures Stroke Narcolepsy and cataplexy Anaphlyaxis Acute myocardial infarction Myocarditis/pericarditis Autoimmune disease Deaths Pregnancy and birth outcomes Other acute demyelinating diseases Non-anaphylactic allergic reactions Thrombocytopenia Disseminated intravascular coagulation Venous thromboembolism Arthritis and arthralgia/joint pain Kawasaki disease Vaccine enhanced disease Symptoms of Mercury Poisoning According to the EPA, the following are symptoms of acute mercury poisoning: Tremors Emotional changes (such as mood swings, irritability, nervousness, excessive shyness) Insomnia Neuromuscular changes (such as weakness, muscle atrophy, twitching) Headaches Disturbances in sensations Changes in nerve responses Poor performance on tests of mental function Skin rashes and dermatitis Mood swings Memory loss Mental disturbances Muscle weakness Notice the similarities, especially regarding neurological conditions such as tremors and convulsions. What is Thimerosal? Thimerosal is a known ingredient found in vaccines. It is 50% mercury by weight, and is used as a preservative, which means it's supposed to prevent contamination from microbes. Why any company would put a known neurotoxin in their products is puzzling to say the least. Some health authorities including the WHO claim that the presence of a mercury atom in thimerosal does not make it inherently dangerous, as sodium chloride (aka table salt) is composed of chlorine, which is a dangerous poison. Fair enough. But have they tested thimerosal on animals and humans to find the effective lethal dose? It turns out they have. According to pubchem.com the lethal dose of thimerosal on mice is 75 mg/kg. Human testing on infants showed troubling results. According to pubchem, ten of 13 human infants exposed to topical applications of a thimerosal tincture 0.1% for the treatment of exomphalos died. Additionally, the compound is listed on pubchem.com as a health hazard and acutely toxic. This information is publicly available. The fact remains that we don't know what's in the vaccines. Their ingredients are kept secret. But thimerosal is a confirmed ingredient of many vaccines of the past verified by the vaccine makers themselves. The FDA recently made application to the courts not to reveal the contents of the Pfizer vaccine until 2076. Interesting, isn't it? Why not be transparent with their ingredients? What are they hiding?

Here is a description of thimerosal taken verbatim from fda.gov explaining what it does: Thimerosal as a Preservative Compare this to the description below from pubchem.com of symptoms of acute thimerosal poisoning: Please note that it cannot be confirmed that thimerosal is in the covid vaccines and causing adverse effects. Just that the symptoms are strangely similar to that of mercury poisoning. Unless the pharmaceutical companies suddenly become transparent and disclose all the ingredients, the burden of proof is on them to verify that it isn't. How Does Chelation Work? The principle behind chelation is very simple. It's related to the acid/alkali relationship between substances. When people refer to the pH of a substance or solution they are measuring whether it is acidic or alkaline. A 7 on the pH scale is neutral, meaning it is neither acidic or alkaline. Distilled water falls in this category. Our blood has an average pH of 7.4, which means it is slightly alkaline or basic. In contrast stomach acid has an average pH of 2.5. Chelation comes from the Greek chele meaning claw. It is the process of an acidic molecule binding with an alkaline molecule. Many cleaning products use the same process. When you use vinegar to clean a coffee maker, you are using a chelating agent, in this case vinegar, to remove the limescale. Chelation therapy has been approved by the FDA to remove heavy metals from the blood. It has been used for decades. Whether using intravenous EDTA or [CitriChel](https://divinisal.com/products/citrichel), which is the remarkable oral chelation formula sold by DiviniSal, chelation will remove metallic substances from the body. If you or anyone you know has been injured by the covid vaccines, chelation therapy may help. [CitriChel](https://divinisal.com/products/citrichel) was originally developed to chelate calcium ions from arterial plaque, thereby relieving cardiovascular conditions. But it can also be used to remove heavy metals from the body. It works the same way. You may purchase [CitriChel](https://divinisal.com/products/citrichel) from our store. Please share this article.
