You may just feel tired all the time or you find that you have been feeling irritable and moody frequently. For the people of Lemont looking for professional help in determining the cause(s) of their condition a medical consultation based on broad spectrum testing gives the patient guidance and direction on what steps to take to improve their functional health and wellness, Advanced Alternative Medcare is here to help. Comprehensive Scientific Testing One precept of naturopathic medicine is to treat the underlying cause of a condition, not just the symptoms. To achieve this objective we rely on comprehensive scientific testing which provides a detailed analysis of brain neurotransmitters, adrenal function, cortisol levels, endocrine/hormones, immune system, thyroid gland and other bodily functions. These body functions are heavily interconnected and it is important for Advanced Alternative Medcare's Dr. Steven Van Lopik to have this detailed scientific medical data to evaluate and create a personal individualized treatment plan to help restore and rebuild your health. When it comes to your health - test, don't guess! When you show signs of an illness, condition, or imbalance it is very important to determine the root cause(s). For instance, the early stage of Lyme disease mimics an intense flu which has led to many misdiagnosed individuals. Our comprehensive scientific testing allows for accurate evaluation of a person's health status. What's more, for homeopathic remedies to reach their maximum effectiveness it is necessary to understand the underlying cause of the symptoms for the best synergistic results in treating the body as a whole system. Thus, naturopathic/homeopathic treatments are made more effective with the comprehensive scientific testing we offer our Lemont patients to help empower their health.

Vanlopik Food and Environment Sensitivity/Allergy Testing 1-page Today, allergy is of utmost importance in most any therapeutic protocol since immune compromisation is virtually inescapable in today's toxic world. All patients will have signs of an allergy of one form or another which can pose a great hindrance to the healing process. Due to toxic waste, agricultural methods using chemicals in plants and livestock, pollution, vaccination, food additives, etc., allergies today can be considered present in everyone in varying degrees. The dietary of the patient is of paramount importance in the healing process. If you are able to identify just a few of the prime dietary allergens, and have can abstain for six weeks, you may experience enormous benefit. Advanced Alternative Medcare believes that the worst allergens today are artificial sweeteners, wheat (gluten), dairy (cow milk) to name a few. If you have weight issues, it is very possible you will lose weight if you remove artificial sweeteners, wheat and dairy from your diet which can also help improve gastrointestinal issues. In addition, other improvements may include sinus post nasal drip, sinusitis, colds and flu may be less frequent, arthritic pain may reduce in intensity, a few of the conditions of healing the body may experience with appropriate testing and an elimination diet treatment plan. \"Allergy can be simply thought of as hypersensitivity disorders with digestive disturbances, skin problems, sinus congestion and infections, headaches, and other symptoms resulting from external causes such as food, pollen, dust, mold and other environmental inhalants as the primary offenders to the body.\" Dr. Steven F.
