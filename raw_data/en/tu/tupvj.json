The majority of [patients](389/691;56%) obtained an S1 antibody titer that is considered adequate (300 BAU/ml). Twenty-nine did not remaining seroconvert but not to sufficient levels (10-300 BAU/ml). Adequate responses were observed in the [therapy]recipients. However, even in these low-responder groups considerable numbers of [patients]did mount sufficient antibody titers.
