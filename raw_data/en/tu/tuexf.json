The first perspective is regional -historical, from which I examine the rise and growths of the private sector from a regional and historical point of view. The second perspective is institutional, from which I examine the perceptions of private higher education among different groups of stakeholders in comparison to its counterpart, the public secto r, through three different phases of private higher education provision: 1)the entry point 2) the experience stage and 3) the exit to the job market.

The public sector was found to fall short in meeting quantitative and qualitative demands for hig her education. The sector of private higher education in Saudi Arabia Overall, this research is of a qualitative nature. For the regional -historical perspective, I use a wide range of literature and second -hand data. For the institutional perspective, I make use of empirical data collected from my fieldwork, which is also used for discussions in the third dimension along with government policy documents. Based on the overall findings of this research, tentative recommendations are made for the future development of Saudi private higher education. 2 Acknowledgements I would like to extend my sincere appreciation and gratitude to God and to all those who encouraged and assisted me in this monumental task.

I shall then discuss the rise of private higher education in the Middle East, and in pa rticular, Saudi Arabia, in order to familiarise my readers with the regional context of private higher education. Then I shall present my research questions in this regard and also the conceptual framework and the structure of this thesis. However, at thi s point, allow me to briefly elaborate on the immediate background of this research. Research Background Though private higher education has been common worldwide for many decades, it was only in 1998 that the first such institutions were permitted to o pen in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Also, there are few works on Saudi private higher education. Therefore, this thesis makes its unique contribution through an examination of the factors that have contributed to the emergence and the development of the p rivate sector. In doing so, this study also investigates the extent to which this sector is distinct from its counterpart, the public sector. The public sector was found to fall short in meeting quantitative and qualitative demands for higher education. The demand on higher education has been beyond the capacity of the public sector. Stakeholders perceive differences between public and private higher education. The private sector is seen to offer higher quality education in terms of teaching, learning, and extracurricular activities, etc. The private sector is also VHHQ\u0003WR\u0003LPSURYH\u0003JUDGXDWHV\u00b7\u0003HPSOR\\DELOLW\\\u0003EHFDXVH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003IHDWXUHV\u0003DERYH\u0003DV\u0003ZHOO\u0003DV\u0003LWV\u0003 emphasis on practical class assignments and internships which link graduates more directly with the labo ur market. Although still only a small part of total enrolment, the private sector also provides access to some students who cannot gain admission to the public universities. The Government is found to have a major role on the emergence of the private sector - no private institution existed before its formal invitation to the 10 sector. The Government , however, has demonstrated an ambivalent attitude towards private higher education \u00b3in terms of planning, regulation, recognition and financial support. For t he purpose of this research, I adopted a qualitative research design for this exploratory study. The perceptions of a broad range of stakeholders --students, graduates, faculty and administrators, employers, government officials --were gathered through semi -structured interviews and thematically analysed. Secondary research sources included relevant literature on higher education and government policy documents. Higher Education in the 20th Century A wider research background for this research is the r ise of private higher education in the global context. Over the past few decades, higher education throughout the world has undergone significant changes regarding its role and structure (Teichler, 19 88, 2006). Until the early twentieth century, higher edu cation was limited to a few universities outside Europe, North America, and the colonies of Great Britain (Rohstock, 2011). truth or inter -VXEMHFWLYH\u0003FRQVHQVXV\u00b5\u0003 )UHLG\u0003HW\u0003DO\u0011\u000f 2007, p.594). While these remain important functions for higher education other economic and social demands became important focuses for it. Thus, higher education was no longer limited to the purpose of training for the elite. 7KH\u0003\u00b6PDVVLILFDWLRQ\u00b7\u0003RI\u0003 higher education systems started to take place in the 1930s in the USA, and shortly after the Second World War in the UK, the USSR, and other European countries. During this period, the economic and social roles of governments changed and as a result, higher education expansion was seen as a significant means to fulfil wider political, social, and economic objectives of modern governments (Robbins, 1963; Wittrock & Wagner, 1996). Policymakers were chiefly concerned with the human capital requirements in their planning for higher education . Modern neoclassic economists like Mincer (19 93) and Becker (1964) argued that investment in human 11 capital through educ ation and training would lead to economic prosperity for both individuals and businesses. It was argued that in order to increase the store of human capital within a nation, higher education should be available tuition free to all because their knowledge a nd skills would be of social benefit (Sadlak,2000). Similarly, governments of developed and developing countries towards the end of the twentieth century became more concerned about improving the store of human resources, especially with the advent of glo balisation and the knowledge economy (Blondal et al., 2002). Individuals also became increasingly keen to pursue higher education for its observed positive impact on their employability, personal income, and social status (Mincer, 1993). Thus, higher edu cation and governments have been facing significant financial and academic challenges because of this expansion of higher education (Teixeira, 2009). As the world globalises, economic competitiveness often depends on the extent to which a country can part icipate in the knowledge -based economy (Blondal et al., 2002). The Growth of Private Higher Education Worldwide While many governments in advanced economies were adopting a modern welfare state model in which equality and distribution of wealth was a key principle, funding the continuous expansion in higher education proved challenging (Barr, 2004). The increasing demand for higher education proved to be beyond the financial capacity of many governments, especially with the crisis of the welfare state from the 1980s onwards ( Barr, 2004 ). Since then, there has been a need for greater efficiency in the allocation and distribution of public resources (Cave et al., 1990). Managerial values and conducts were promoted in public institutions, including higher education ( Amaral et al., 2003). It was no longer feasible for governments to be fully responsible for the rising cost of higher education ( Neave & Van Vught, 1994 ). This was in line with macro -level fiscal policies designed to restrain government expenditure and to increase private involvement in the provision of social services, a process of l iberalisation (Middleton, 1996; Ball, 200 7). As governments began to reduce their direct control over higher education, the system became more diversified and public institutions were no longer the only form of higher education provided (Teichler, 2006). P rivatisation was one policy introduced to reduce 12 dependence upon government funding. Recognising and accrediting privately managed higher education institutions has been an increasingly popular practice. One reason for this has been to enable such institut ions to meet the increasing demand of higher education , which the public sector finds difficult to manage alone. Research by the Programme for Research on Private higher education (PROPHE) found that up to 31 % of the global share of higher education is no w run privately (Levy, 2011), in the sense RI\u0003LWV\u0003QRW\u0003EHLQJ\u0003D\u0003VWDWH\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQ\u0011\u0003+RZHYHU\u000f\u0003LGHDV\u0003VXFK\u0003DV\u0003\u00b6SULYDWH\u00b7\u0003RU\u0003\u00b6SXEOLF\u00b7\u0003DUH\u0003QRZ\u0003 rather complex, which will be discussed at length later in this thesis. Unlike in Saudi Arabia, the private provision of higher education is not new around the world. In the USA, Latin America and Japan, it has existed for over a century. However, since the late 1980s private higher education has expanded and spread to most countries (Levy, 2010 b). The rapid growth of priva te higher education has been particularly significant since the last decade of the twentieth century (Altbach, 2005 ,2009 ; Levy, 2002, 2005). In the early twenty -first century, there have been increases in the availability of private higher education in post -socialist Central and Easte rn European countries (Altbach , 2005 ; Levy, 2007). Historically, growth in this sector ranged from the old and traditional \u00b3aimed at the elite and religious groups \u00b3to educational institutions which had a wider appeal. According to the extant literature, there are very few countries which have a long history of private higher education . One notable exception is the USA, which depended on the private sector until the late nineteenth century (Chronister, 1980; Thelin, 2011 ). It is interesting to note that although the USA is considered to have the largest number of private higher education institutions, student enrolment in these institutions accounts for less than 20% of the total enrolment (Altbach, 1999, 2005). However, there is a notable increase in the emergence of private profit -making institutions such as Phoenix and Strayer in the USA in recent decades ( Kinser & Levy, 2006 ). Similarly, a number of East Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, and the Philippines, have long -established private higher education , with up to 80% of the students in these countries pursuing courses in them (Altbach, 1999). There are some countries in which there is not a long -standing trad ition of private higher education . Yet in these countries, when private education was firstly introduced, LW\u0003ZDV\u0003RIWHQ\u0003FRQVLGHUHG\u0003WR\u0003EH\u0003\u00b4JURZLQJ\u0003WRR\u0003IDVW\u00b5\u0003 $OWEDFK\u000f\u0003\u0014 \u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0018 \u0003/HY\\\u000f\u0003\u0014 \u0015\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0015\u000f\u0003 2006b). For example, there are Asian countries such as China and Vietnam which do 13 not have an established tradition of private higher education institutions, but they are currently witnessing substantial growth in both the supply of and the demand for public higher education. China now has around 1,200 such institu tions (Altbach et al. ,2009; Gupta, 2008). In India, the sector is growing extremely rapidly, with one of the largest number of private higher education institutions in the world (Gupta, 2008; Levy, 2008). Altbach et al. (2009) and Levy (2005,2007) explain that the private sector has been the fastest growing segment of higher education in many Central and Eastern European countries since the 1990s and the fall of Soviet Communism. But the percentage of enrolment in privat e higher education varies greatly between countries of the old Soviet bloc (Slantcheva & Levy, 2007). Levy indicates that this expansion has been unplanned and unregulated (Levy,2002). Interestingly, countries such as Poland have developed private higher e ducation sectors which account for up to 30% of the entire higher education sector ( Levy, 2003 ). In other countries, such as Russia and Bulgaria, the private sector accounts for roughly 10% of higher education , while in Albania and Croatia the private sector is extremely minimal (Levy, 2003). Although private higher education institutions are the fastest growing segment of higher education in Africa, the enrolment still accounts for a small share of the total enrolment (Varghese, 2004). South Africa is among the African countries in which the private sector is growing very rapidly and, interestingly, most of these are profit -making institutions (Mabizela, 2007; Kinser & Levy, 2006). Latin America presents an i nteresting case. Although there is a long tradition of private higher education, at the same time the region is experiencing extremely fast rates of growth. Latin American countries have been experiencing a large growth in the private sector since the 1960 s (Levy, 1986a), and in most of them the percentage of student enrolment in private institutions accounts for about a third of the total enrolment in higher education (Kinser et al., 2010). In places like Brazil and Chile, the private sector accounts for half the total enrolment (Altbach, 1999; Levy, 2005). Research shows that in other parts of the world, growth in the private sector is slower. Western Europe remains cautious about the emergence of the private sector. There its contribution to higher educa tion is limited and is the lowest for any region in the world. In this geographical area 90% of the enrolment is in the public sector (Altbach, 1999, 2005). The private sector is still small in major European countries like France, the UK, and Germany. Research also shows that there are countries such as Japan and Poland 14 which are experiencing a decline in private higher education growth (Levy, 2010 a) due to demographic trends rather than anything directly related to the performance of universities. Levy ex plains that this is a result of social and political factors, such as declining population and further control from the government. Although Portugal was one of the first countries in Western Europe which allowed private higher education, there is now a de cline in the number of students enrolled in those institutions ( Amaral & Teixeira ,2000 ; Teixeira, 2006). Exploring the growth of private higher education institutions in an international context allows for better understanding of differences in the dev elopment of the private sector throughout the world. The previously cited research makes clear that private higher education institutions have begun to step into the market of higher education in many parts of the world. Further, when we look at the growth we find that there is significant variation across countries, as some exhibit tremendous growth while other countries experience moderate or mild growth. We can see how developing countries are increasingly dependent upon private institutions, whereas the developed countries are still primarily dependent upon their strong public education sectors. Coffman (200 3) and Levy (2009) have traced the recent growth of private higher education institutions in the Gulf Cooperation Council States (GCC) of Saudi Arabi a, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Oman. In Saudi Arabia a second attempt has recently been made to establish a private higher education sector . The first attempt in 1967 failed to take root and involved just one institution, which was transformed into a publicly funded and governed university. The following section serves as a brief introduction to the development of private higher education in the Arab region. Private Higher Education in the Arab World Private universities in the Middle East were first established in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The University of Saint -Joseph de Beyrouth, founded in 1875, was a French medical college located in Beirut and. The American University of Beirut was established in 1866 (Ghabra & Arnold, 2007 ;Herrera,2006 ). The American University in Cairo was founded in 1919 by American missionaries and was an English - language school. It was licensed in the State of New York with its Boa rd of Trustees 15 and administrative offices in New York City ( Ghabra & Arnold, 2007 ). These early institutions, with Western curricula, administration, and accreditation, served as models for the wider Arab world. Bertelsen (2009) observes that these institutions demonstrated: Successful governance, quality assurance and funding can achieve academic success and recognition, as well as contributing significantly to human and other development in the host societies and the wider Middl e East. (p. 2). These institutions all eventually faced political pressures, backlash against the West, nationalist pride and resentment, threats of nationalisation, and in the case of Lebanon, violence. While struggling to maintain their autonomy, the tw o American universities were required to hire ever greater numbers of Egyptian and Lebanese faculty members. The real beginnings of widespread private higher education in the Middle East dates from the 1980s. Private universities were founded in Jordan, E gypt, Sudan, and the UAE with varying degrees of quality, success, and educational approaches. By the early 1990s, in the Gulf States the pace rapidly accelerated.

Noticeably, Saudi Arabia, the largest and wealthiest nation in the Gulf, had shown the least openness to this trend. Origins of Saudi Private Higher Educa tion The first private university in Saudi was opened in 1967 \u00b3King Abdul Aziz University (KAAU). It was located in the city of Jeddah, and functioned as a private higher education institution for four years before it became a public university. The KAAU originated from an idea in an article in Al -Madina Saudi newspapers in 1964 by its chief editor Mohamed Ali Hafiz (Batarfy,2005).

The Government, however, contested the establish ment of a private university in Jeddah. A prominent businessman donated land and premises to be the campus of the new institution. The venture took off with the enthusiasm of its local supporters and the dedication of experts from Arab and Western countri es (Batarfy,2005 ). Eventually, success brought its own problems. Tuition was free, and income from donations and real -estate trusts were not sufficient to sustain the venture. The increasing demands in access to the newly born university led to serious financial difficulties . The university managed to gain minimum support from the Government, but the support was not sufficient to alleviate the problem. In 1971, the University Board asked the Government to take it over. The university thus became a public higher education institution under the same name \u00b3King Abdul Aziz University (Batarfy, 2005). The failure of KAAU as a private university and its takeover by the Government was to have a long -lasting negative impact on the future development of private higher education in the Kingdom which was to persist for decades. The consequences of that failure will be further discussed in details in Chapter 10. After 1971, private higher education ceased to exist in the Kingdom and remained dormant. The idea was revived in the Governme QW\u00b7V\u00036L[WK\u0003'HYHORSPHQW\u00033ODQ\u0003RI\u0003\u0014 \u0018 \u00b22000. Studies were conducted, and the Council of Ministers approved the re -establishment of private higher education in 1998. This was only the second time the Government authorised the development of private higher educ ation in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and it is thus considered a very new phenomenon. The first institutions opened as recently as 2000.

Here are my main research questions: 1, What are the contributing factors behind the emergence and development of private higher education in the Saudi Arabia? 2, To what extent is the Saudi private higher education sector perceived to be distinct from the public sector? 3, What are the wider implications of private higher education for the higher education system and the country in general? A qualitative research design was employed to address these research questions. Data are gathered from two major channels: first, i nterviews with over a hundred stakeholders, and second, \u00b3government policy documents and some other texts such as websites. I also analyse secondary literature to provide background and context for the research. These second -hand data are also used to compl ement and/or support the data from the interviews. The function of private higher education in one country cannot be deduced from experiences in other national contexts. However, private higher education in one country may reflect global trends, while hav ing some distinctive elements of its own. This study hopes to ascertain to what extent this is possible. 18 Personal Perspective Apart from my academic studies for this PhD, this research is much inspired by my personal educational experience and also working experience in Saudi Arabia and beyond. I received my B.A. degree in Business Administration at King Abdul -Aziz University (KAAU), a public university in Saudi Arabia but which, at one time, had been the first private university in Saudi Arabia. I then obtained an M.A. degree in Information Management at Marymount, a private college in Washington D.C. Subsequently, I completed an M.A. degree in Assistive Technology (technology for the disabled) at George Mason, a public university in Virginia. Thus, in my own academic path I have experienced both public and private higher education institutions in two very different countries. These experiences heightened my awareness of differences between public and private higher education. In addition, private education has also been part of my family history. My family have been educational pioneers in Saudi Arabia with my grandfather, Abdul -Raouf Jamjoom establishing with colleagues, Al -Falah school, the first private school for boys in Jeddah 1905. In the 1960s, an uncle of mine was a co -IRXQGHU\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003FRXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003ILUVW\u0003SULYDWH\u0003 university. When I returned from the US to Saudi Arabia a t the end of 2006, I began working at a private college in Jeddah which opened in 2000 marking the new beginning of private higher education in Saudi Arabia. Initially, I helped instructors to develop practical elements in their courses linked to specific market needs. For example, I tried to link up Information Technology course materials to the banking sector based on discussions with bank officials. My work was made possible because the college was a new institution in a new field of education, one wh ich was especially focused on linking theory to practical class assignments related to the labour market. This was vitally important as the public universities had not managed to provide employers with sufficient numbers of adequately trained graduates. 19 My personal working experience added some new perspectives to my understanding of the private sector in Saudi Arabia. In 2007, I became Vice Dean of Student Affairs at this private college. By that time, it had 400 female students and 700 -800 male students attending on two separate campuses. My position included overseeing enrolments and registration; extracurricular activities; the student union as well as the career and counselling centres. These various areas of college operations and my daily contact w ith students gave me new insight into the special qualities (and problems) of private higher education and its contrast with the public sector. For example, I initially did not consider extracurricular activities to be of particular significance compared to academic courses but I came to see the importance these had for students, especially in a closed, restrictive society like Saudi Arabia. Similarly, the importance of internships, student union activities and the career centre were also a revelation to me. The impact of these aspects of college life is vividly expressed by the student stakeholders themselves in Chapter 7 of this study. When I left for the US for my graduate work, private higher education was just beginning in the Saudi Arabia. When I r eturned and took the position of Vice Dean at a private college, I became keenly aware of the difficult transitional state of a new institution offering a new kind of education. Many people, particularly the parents of prospective or newly enrolling studen ts, were doubtful and hesitant about this new college. Did the government really recognize it? Did it have the proper licenses? Was it accredited? Would it last? What would sustain it? Was it really better than public higher education which in Saudi Arabia is tuition -free and comes with a paid stipend? These were questions I had to answer on a daily basis and with serious questioning on my own part. It was these kinds of questions that led me to the research questions of the present study.

Conceptual Framework For the purpose of this research, there is perhaps no single theory which can fit perfectly a s a research framework. Therefore, I develop my own conceptual framework to conduct this proposed multi -faceted analysis of private higher education in Saudi 20 Arabia. I intend to explore the rise, development, and perceptions of private higher education fro m three perspectives: regional -historical, institutional, and socio -political. Allow me to elaborate a little more on these three perspectives. For the first perspective, I place a discussion of the rise and development of private higher education in a regional context, and look for relevant information in history which will shed some light on the birth and growth of the private sector. This is perhaps among the most commonly used approaches. However, I do not intend to investigate certain understudied hi storical events or to clarify some misunderstandings about the local educational history. Instead, I intend only to conduct a regional -historical review which would provide enough background information for my examinations in another two analyses: Parts II I and IV of this thesis . With regard to the second perspective, institutional, I do not plan to investigate the governance or daily management practices of private institutions. Rather, I only wish to place my discussions and analysis in an institutiona l setting. For this part, I look into, in particular, the perceptions of the private sector among different stakeholders of higher education \u00b3students, faculty members, administrators, regulators, and employers, in terms of the three phases of higher educat ion: Entry to the system, Experience within the system, and exit to a job market. This, I believe, is a rather straightforward way to organise the themes and topics which emerged from my field. For the third perspective, I must be cautious in pointing ou t that my analysis bears a very small ambition. I do not propose to investigate local politics, international relationship, or social changes in the Middle East, as one might read in a conventional political or social study. Rather, my scope of analysis is much narrower than the conventional Middle East studies. I choose two issues which I find most relevant to the inquiry of this thesis: the use of the English language in the private sector, and also the changing relationship between the private sector and the Saudi Government. These two issues, I believe, can shed some interesting light on the past growth and also the future development of private higher education in a Middle East country such as Saudi Arabia. The use of the English language, for instance, brings both benefits and challenges to the participants of higher education and also others who view this issue from a non - educational angle. The changing relationship between the private sector and the Central Government serves to remind us that there is no single universal way to understand 21 private higher education; every country has its particular socio -political context, without which one cannot possibly understand what really happened, and why things happened in the ways they did. In the light of this conceptual framework, I now move on to present the structure of this thesis. Contribution to Knowledge This research contributes to two study areas: first, to higher education studies, in particular studies of the private sector; se cond, to regional studies of the Middle East and, in particular, Saudi Arabia. For the former, studies of the private sector only began to attract wider attentions in the 1990s, and in general, literature on private higher education is still very limited. It is more so, on the regional level of the Middle East. A reason for this scarcity is that the system is relatively new to the region compared to other parts of the world. Also, the research area is less active in this region. Exploring the situation of private higher education in the KSA will add a field to the global landscape, providing comparisons and contrast with the situation in other countries. For the latter, the Middle East, although not a new topic, has been intensively studied from social, cultural, and political perspectives. With regard to the case of Saudi Arabia, most of the international publications are around its modern history, politi cal economy, foreign policy, and cultural identities. Few, if any, study the country from the perspective of higher education. Therefore, this research brings in a new angle to studies of the region. By looking into the role of private higher education, on e can better understand how a modern Middle East country such as Saudi Arabia is coping with the changes and challenges which come with the global economy. The present study is stimulated by the work of Daniel Levy of Yale University. Levy has been a prom inent in arguing that the private Higher Education system has not been a static entity but instead has changed and evolved over many years in response to social, HFRQRPLF\u0003DQG\u0003SROLWLFDO\u0003FKDQJH\u0003 \u0014 \u001b\u0019D\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0019D\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u001a \u0011\u0003/HY\\\u00b7V\u0003ZRUN , amongst others, has asserted that with recent expansion of the private sector, it has now become a major presence within Higher Education generally and therefore it deserves sustained critical 22 investigation. The present study is a contribution towards this aim that Levy advocates, focussing upon developments within the Saudi Arabian H.E. Sector which up to now has not been studied in much detail. The intention of the present study is to make a contribution to the international understanding of the growth and character of private H.E. R oger Geiger of Pennsylvania state University has been another key influence for the present study through his work on typologies of the purpose of the private higher education system. His work has drawn attention to the inherent diversity that exists withi n this sector, something that is traced in some detail through this study in relation to Saudi Arabia Limitations One of the major limitations of this study is related to its data sample. I managed to collect data for my empirical work from one city onl y, where higher education institutions are most concentrated. This will inevitably raise the issue of the generalisabitity of my findings. This also applies to the fact that all student interviewees at the higher education institutions involved in this stu dy specialise in business -related subjects. Another limitation is related to the access to government personnel and policy documents; I managed to interview only a relatively small number of government officials and gain access to a number of government do cuments on private higher education. This limits the scope of my research in particular from the socio -political perspective. 23 Structure of the thesis This study is organised into four parts. Part I, including this chapter, serves as a background disc ussion for later sections. Part II, including Chapters 2 and 3, looks into the rise and development of private higher education in Saudi Arabia from a regional - historical perspective. Part III, including Chapters 6, 7, and 8, adopts an institutional perspe ctive, looking into the three phases of higher education: Entry, Experience, and Exit. Part IV, including Chapters 9 and 10, takes up a socio -political perspective, by looking at the use of the English language in the private sector, and also the changing relationship between the private sector and the Saudi Government. For the plan with each individual chapter , Chapter 2 discusses the complexity involved in defining private higher education. It presents concepts used in the literature for analysing privat e higher education. Chapter 3 provides a brief history of the country, its governance, and its demographics. The Saudi economy is analysed with regard to national development plans, the labour market, unemployment among Saudi Arabian nationals, and the par ticipation of women in the workforce. Chapter 4 surveys the development of the Saudi Arabian education system, particularly public higher education. Chapter 4 analyses the newly emerging private higher education sector. This is seen in the regional cont ext of the Gulf States. Enrolment trends and supply/demand challenges are examined. Following these background chapters, Chapter 5 outlines the methodology of the study, discussing in detail the qualitative interpretive research approach selected.

I first look into the diff iculty of identifying private higher education. This chapter presents some conceptual tools used to analyse private higher education in developing countries, which is also applied to the case of Saudi Arabia. The types and functions of private higher educa tion institutions are surveyed, and key categories for defining and understanding private institutions are presented. Finally, I make use of the typologies produced by Levy (1986a) and Geiger(1986) in identifying key functions of private higher education. Defining Private Higher Education Scholars such as Altbach (1999), Geiger (1986), and Levy, (1986 b, 1999, 2002) acknowledge the complexity of defining private higher education and agree that there is no universal definition applicable to institutions in different countries and regions. The sector emerged diversely in different countries with different histories and contexts (Altbach, 1999). Every nation, to some extent, has its own criteria which differentiate its public and private higher education inst itutions. These criteria are different from those in other national contexts. Boundaries between the two sectors in various regional and national contexts are becoming increasingly blurred, with privatisation taking place within the public sector and with various degrees of state control and supervision over the private sector (Altbach 1999; Levy, 1986 b, 2002, 2003). Therefore, there is a need to understand how private higher education is related to the FRQFHSW\u0003RI\u0003\u00b6SULYDWLVDWLRQ\u00b7\u0011\u0003%XWOHU\u0003 1991, p. 17 \u000f\u0003GHILQHV\u0003SULYDWLVDWLRQ\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4D\u0003VKLIWLQJ\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003 IXQFWLRQ\u000f\u0003HLWKHU\u0003LQ\u0003ZKROH\u0003RU\u0003LQ\u0003SDUW\u0003IURP\u0003WKH\u0003SXEOLF\u0003 VHFWRU\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003 VHFWRU\u00b5\u0011\u0003 According to Maldonado et al. (2004), privatisation in higher education covers a spectrum of organisational forms. At one end is the public higher education institution \u00b6SULYDWLVLQJ\u00b7\u0003 DVSHFWV\u0003 RI\u0003 LWV\u0003 RSHUDWLRQ\u000f\u0003 ZKLOH at the other end is the private sector, 26 establishing institutions designed to be seen as separate from those which fall within the public sector. Th e latter type will be considered here, and will form the main focus of this study \u00b3private higher education in Saudi Arabia. 7R\u0003H[HPSOLI\\\u0003WKLV\u0003FULWLFDO\u0003DSSURDFK\u0003RI\u0003\u00b6IXQFWLRQ\u0003VKLIWLQJ\u00b7\u000f\u0003RQH\u0003PXVW\u0003ILUVW\u0003LGHQWLI\\\u0003\u00b6K\\EULG\u00b7\u0003 forms which blur the boundaries between public and private sectors. This would include those established by public universities. Murphy (1996) describes a range of forms of organisation, including privatisation of services by contracting them to the private sector: an example of this is the lea sing of internal printing and reprographic services to a private contractor to operate exclusively within a university; another example is a sub - contractual arrangement with a catering company to provide a full range of services throughout the institution. $QRWKHU\u0003IRUP\u0003RI\u0003SULYDWLVDWLRQ\u0003PD\\\u0003EH\u0003LGHQWLILHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b6FRVW -VKLIWLQJ\u00b7\u0011\u0003$Q\u0003H[DPSOH\u0003RI\u0003WKLV\u0003LV\u0003 when public higher education institutions begin to charge tuition fees to students to cover some of their costs. In effect, this means charging for public services which were previously paid by the public purse. A further example of a form of privatisation is the establishment by a public higher education institution of an independent company, or a cost unit, or a corporation with operational autonomy as a way of gen blurring boundaries between the public and private sectors. This distinction is also blurred by the tendency for private institutions to operate like public bodies. Levy refers to this as \u00b4LVRPRUSKLVP\u00b5\u0003 /HY\\\u000f\u0003\u0014 \u0011\u0003,Q\u0003VRPH\u0003FDVHV\u000f\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u0003DUH\u0003FRHUFHG\u0003WR\u0003DVVXPH\u0003FHUWDLQ\u0003 organisational forms, while for others certain forms are adop ted for purely commercial reasons, a sort of copying or mimicry (mimesis). One therefore often sees tactics used to disguise certain aspects of a private higher education organisation, for instance the adoption of the curricular outline of an accredited pu blic counterpart by a private institution to ensure its own accreditation. Levy suggests that this blurring between public and private is increasing and that almost the only way to differentiate between the two sectors is through identifying their legal status (Levy, 198 b). According to Levy (1986 b \u0003\u00b4\u0011\u0011\u0011QR\u0003EHKDYLRXUDO\u0003FULWHUL on or set of criter ia distinguishes institutions legally designated private from institutions legally GHVLJQDWHG\u0003SXEOLF\u0011\u00b5\u0003 S\u0011\u0003\u0014\u001a\u0013 \u0011\u00037KLV\u0003YLHZ\u0003ZLOO\u0003EH\u0003H[DPLQHG\u0003LQ\u0003UHODWLRQ\u0003WR\u00036DXGL\u0003$UDE ia. 27 Based on my readings of the scholarship on private higher education (Altbach, 1999), Geiger (1986), and Levy (1986a, 1986b,1999, 2003), the key categories used in analysing the private sector are presented in the table below: Table 1: Perspectives for understanding private Higher Education Perspectives in understanding private Higher Education Funding Different types of financial resources it relies on Ownership The extent to which it is owned by private investors/bodies Orientation The extent to which it is about: 1,Teaching, 2, Research, 3, Religion or 4, Market oriented Functions and Roles The extent to which it aims to provide 1, Wider access to higher education, 2, Different forms of higher education, or 3, Higher quality education Governance The extent to which it is subject to direct government supervision *Based on the work of Altbach(1999), Geiger (1986), and Levy (1986a, 1986b,1999, 2003) The following sections investigate these dimensions and will present the complexity of defining private higher education using any of these criteria alone (Levy, 1986b). I shall examine how these perspectives are explored in studies of private higher educa tion, and to what extent they can be applied to the Saudi context. 28 Funding Funding used to be the most clear -cut distinction between public and private higher institutions. However, many governments since the 1980s have endorsed polices which support the cost -sharing of higher education. The introduction of such policies around WKH\u0003ZRUOG\u0003UHSUHVHQWHG\u0003D\u0003VKLIW\u0003LQ\u0003LGHRORJ\\\u0003IURP\u0003SHUFHLYLQJ\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003DV\u0003D\u0003\u00b4SXEOLF\u0003 JRRG\u00b5\u0003WR\u0003VHHLQJ\u0003LW\u0003DV\u0003D\u0003\u00b4SULYDWH\u0003JRRG\u00b5\u0003 -RKQHV\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0017 \u0011\u0003$OWKRXJK\u0003VRXUFHV\u0003RI\u0003ILQDQF ing vary among private higher education institutions, Altbach ( 1999) and Levy (1992, 2003) have shown how the majority of private ones rely upon tuition fees as their main source of funding. In the USA, for example, reliance on tui tion fees has a long history. A small number of private institutions also have external sources of funding, such as sponsoring by religious organisations. Resources may also take various forms such as endowments, student grants, loans, research grants, or alumni contributions (Altbach, 1999). Indirect supports from governments towards private institutions can also take the form of research contracts. This is the case with most elite private institutions in the USA, where government -sponsored research is und ertaken ( Altbach, 1999 ). Using the source of funding to identify private higher education institutions thus can be confusing . Many public higher education institutions now charge their students and some private institutions receive funds from governments ( Levy, 1986a). Altbach (1999) suggests that the only difference which can be found in this regard is that tuition fees in public higher education institutions are not the main source of funding; rather, each public institution has its budget allocation with in the total government budget. In addition, there are private higher education institutions, such as some in Holland and Belgium, which receive funds from their governments, much equal to the public counterparts (Geiger, 1986). Therefore using funding as a criterion is not sufficient in examining the nature of higher education institution. Sources of funding, however, can still be a reliable differentiating factor between public and private higher education institutions when the public sector does not char ge students any fees. In Saudi Arabia for example, public sector education is still tuition - free, the exception being a small number of programmes which have been recently introduced to the sector. Students in the public sector are also provided with a mon thly stipend. The Government has only recently begun offering financial support towards private higher education institutions, which will be discussed in detail in Chapter 10. Since 2010, government scholarships have been available to fund up to 50 % of th ose enrolled in private institutions, based on their individual merits. No stipends are paid. 29 As will be seen, there is no culture of government support towards private higher education in Saudi Arabia. Ownership and Governance The legal ownership of hi gher education institutions is found to be less ambiguous than other criteria to classify institutions as public or priva te (Levy, 1986b). Altbach (1999) , however, points out the significant variations of ownership within and between countries. Private ins titutions could be owned by either non -profit or profit -making agencies, or both. Individuals or companies might also own private higher education institutions, as in the case of the University of Phoenix, which is owned by the Apollo Group (Kinser & Levy, 2006). According to Altbach (1999) , in most parts of the world private colleges and universities began as non -profit institutions and were legally established by religious organisations. However, profit -making higher education institutions have recently em erged and been expanding at a rapid rate (Kinser & Levy, 2006). 9DUJKHVH\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0013\u0017 \u0003DGGV\u0003WR\u0003$OWEDFK\u00b7V\u0003 \u0014 \u0003REVHUYDWLRQ\u0003E\\\u0003GLVFXVVLQJ\u0003DQRWKHU\u0003IRUP\u0003RI\u0003 ownership in which private institutions work with foreign collaborators.

According to Altbach (1999) transnational private providers are usually based in developed countries, e.g. the UK and Australia, and receivers are in developing countries. This type of provision has several advantag es for the receiver country, such as absorbing the excess demand helping students to be with their families, and most importantly, saving the expenses o f earning a degree abroad (Altbach, 2005). For example, the University of Nottingham has established campuses in Malaysia and China, and Cornell University in Qatar. Australia and the UK present an interesting case, in which public universities education services to students in other countries, mostly in South Africa, Asian countries, and in the Pacific regions. That means that these higher 30 education in stitutions are public in the home country whereas private in their host country. Public higher education institutions from developed countries are establishing sub-branches in other developing or transition countries (Varghese, 2004) imitating the franchis e model of the commercial world. In the Gulf nations, for example, The higher education boom of the 1990s was marked by a reaching out to Western higher education institutions and, to a lesser degree, Asian, for collaboration in the development, administ ration, curricula, faculty recruitment and training, and quality standards of these new national institutions.

In essence, the Wester n institution exercises control over all major elements of the school. :LOORXJKE\\\u00b7V\u0003PRGHOV\u0003SURYLGH\u0003D\u0003VSHFWUXP\u0003RI\u0003FKRLFHV\u0003UHIOHFWLQJ\u0003JUHDWHU\u0003RU\u0003OHVVHU\u0003DPRXQWV\u0003 of control by the external Western partner. The choice faced by the Gulf institution \u00b3its founde rs\u00b3is: How much do they want to exercise control, versus how much credibility do they wish the institution to have from a particular association with a (and Asian) affiliations which have opened between 1992 and 2007. The large number and variety of models clearly indicate that the Gulf is a centre for educational innovation. Willoughby links this phenomenon to the oil wealth of the region, the extreme dependence on foreign skilled workers, the previous weakness and a lack of development of the education sector. A further significant factor is the high population growth rate of the region as a whole. 60 % of the Gulf population is under 16 (Coffman, 2003). So the demand factor in the education sector is immense. In the *XOI\u000f\u0003SULYDWH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003LV\u0003VHHQ\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4D\u0003PHDQV\u0003RI\u0003HQVXULQJ\u0003TXDOLW\\\u0003RI\u0003LQVWUXFWLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003 the relevance to market needs that have been missing from the public universities \u00b5\u0003 (Coffman., p. 3). As we shall see, this is very much the case in Saudi Arabia. These new Gulf affiliations (see Appendix 1) with the West (and Asia) include institutions of a remarkable diversity. Oman has affiliations with universities in England (Bedfo rdshire, Leeds, and Coventry), Scotland (Glasgow Caledonian University), the USA (Carnegie Mellon, University of Missouri -St. Louis), Leipzig University, and universities in India and Australia. Kuwait has partnerships with multiple Indian universities, an Australian university, and Dartmouth College. Qatar has affiliations with American universities (Cornell, Georgetown, Virginia Commonwealth, Texas A&M) as well as CHN University of Higher Professional Education in The Netherlands. Bahrain has relationship s with the Universities of London, Leicester, and The Royal College of Surgeons (Ireland) as well as The University of Newfoundland (Canada). 2). These include partnerships with universities in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Belgium, Australia, Wales, Scotland, USA, and 32 in England. Although these many new joint ventures in the Gulf are still new, their impact are likely to be so cially and economically significant: The fact that so many universities and colleges have come into existence suggest that there are strong social and political dynamics within the region supporting the deeper economic integration of Gulf societies with global and regional economic life. (Wi lloughby, 2008, p. 29). In Saudi Arabia, no transnational institutions exist yet, as no foreign ownership is allowed - unlike in many countries where ownership by foreign individuals is permitted, Saudi Arabian law requires that there be at least five partners acting jointly as owners. A company may also be an owner. Non -profit status and profit -making status are both permitted for private institutions. The majority of private institutions, however, are operating on a profit -making basis.

The extent of control which Saudi government has on the sector is discussed throughout the following chapters. As Levy has written (1986a), the status of legal ownership does not reveal how the institution actually functions. He has shown that in many cases private higher education institutions are found to be less auton omous than their public counterparts, which are completely funded by the government. Pachuashvili (2011) also explains how in a post -communist setting, legally defined non -profit and profit -making private institutions can hardly be differentiated as both o f them rely mainly on tuition fees, and have a market orientation. Orientation Private higher education institutions vary in their orientation: some are research - oriented, others are religiously affiliated, while others are specialised institutions (Altbach, 1999; Geiger, 1986; Levy, 1986a, 1986b, 2003). Most prestigious private universities have a research focus (Altbach, 1999). According to Levy (1992, 2003) and Altbach (2005), the religiously affiliated institutions used to constitute the majority of private institutions world -wide. However, their dominant position is diminishing as specialised institutions are coming to lead the market, such as colleges focusing upon business and finance, legal, or medical studies, rather than offering a full range of academic subjects ( Altbach, 1999 ). Levy (1999, 2003, 2006a, 2006b) asserts that recently 33 developed private higher education institutions possess a unique potential, which allows them to fill certain special niches in preparing gra duates for future employment. One piece of evidence which Levy (1986a) uses to highlight the distinctiveness of private institutions is their mission statement. Levy argues that the mission of private higher education institutions is less inclusive and b road, focusing rather on specific target markets. The students they seek to attract tend to be narrowly focused, selective, and specialised themselves. He further (1986a, 2002, 2006a) observes that private institutions concentrate on fields which are relat HG\u0003WR\u0003\u00b6IXWXUH\u00b7\u0003MREV\u0011\u00031RWZLWKVWDQGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003 above, some studies criticise programmes offered by private institutions for giving priority to private benefits over social ones. For instance James (1991a, p.193 \u00b2194) argues that research and broad educational nee ds are less important to the private sector. Some studies point out that private institutions concentrate on fields that are less expensive to teach and maintain. Comparative study by Teixeira and Amaral (2007) similarly find private higher education inst LWXWLRQV\u0003WR\u0003KDYH\u0003D\u0003\u00b4ORZ -ULVN\u00b5\u0003VWUDWHJ\\\u0003DQG\u0003 concentration on low -cost and /safe initiatives. However, there are exceptions, such as private higher education institutions offering very expensive courses of study, such as medicine, as is the case n the KSA. T his will be examined more fully in later chapters. In terms of orientation, Saudi private higher education is not characterised by a variety of religious affiliations, unlike in other nations where Islam or Christianity is the dominant and/or institutional religion. A particular school of Islam is favoured and LPSRVHG\u0003WKURXJKRXW\u0003WKH\u0003 FRXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u0011\u0003 %XW\u0003LW\u0003PXVW\u0003EH\u0003 VWDWHG\u0003 WKDW\u0003XQOLNH\u0003 D\u0003 country such as the USA, no private higher education institution in the KSA focuses on religious (Islamic) studies al so in contrast to some of their counterparts in the public sector. Also, most of the Saudi Arabian private institutions are focused on teaching rather than research, with only one exception - the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), a new research university. Before I end my discussion in this section, I also want to discuss briefly a special higher education institution, as it may shed some interesting lights on the future development of higher education in the KSA. In September of 2009 King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), a graduate -level research university was opened for admission. Located by the Red Sea about 50 miles from Jeddah, KAUST has a vast campus --36 sq. kilometres --which includes a marine sanctua ry and research facility --and 34 a small city contained with its borders. The cost of the project --$12.5 billion --comes with the financial support from King Abdullah and the royal family. A $10 billion endowment fund is also being created for the University (Cambanis, 2007 ). For students who are admitted, tuition is free with additional stipends. Graduate students may receive stipends of up to $20,000 per year. KAUST offers both M.S c. and Ph.D. FRXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003 VWDWH\u0003 RLO\u0003 company) to develop the initial plan, build the campus and assist in curriculum. The University of Texas (Austin), the University of California (Berkeley) and Stanford University have partnered with KAUST to d evelop specific curricula and assist with selecting faculty (KAUST, 2012). These are among the first such Western affiliations in Saudi Arabia. KAUST is focused on applied research and has established multi - disciplinary research centres. These centres w ill pursue research in areas such as clean combustion, solar and alternative energy science, water desalination and computational ELRVFLHQFH\u0011\u0003\u0003\u0003.$867\u0003PD\\\u0003VHUYH\u0003DQRWKHU\u0003IXQFWLRQ\u0003YLWDO\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003.LQJGRP\u00b7V\u0003IXWXUH --the training of the next generation of universit a very s ignificant departure from traditional Saudi social norms.

To one extent, the private sector is set to provide more educational opportunities or to offer different forms of education than is provided by the existing public sector, or to introduce educational provision of higher quality as a response to a public sector which fails the expectations of its stakeholders. Geiger (1986) and Levy (1986 a) have observed that private higher education or function (Levy, 1986 a, 199 9, 2003; Geiger, 1986). Levy (1986b; 2010 b) LGHQWLILHV\u0003WKUHH\u0003\u00b6ZDYHV\u00b7\u0003ZKLFK\u0003DSSHDUHG\u0003LQ\u0003VHTXHQFH\u0011\u0003 7KH\u0003 first wave represents the establishment of private higher education to accommodate the needs of certain religious or ethnic/identity groups. The second wave is marked by the establishment of elite private institutions as a reaction to the mass orientation of public higher education institutions, when students are looking for prestigious forms of education. In Latin America, for example, public higher educati on growth came first as a religious response to public sector secularisation , and then as an elite response to a massifying and socio - economically more open public sector open (Levy, 1986a) . The third wave witnesses the establishment of private institut ions to absorb the excess demand on higher education which the state public sector can no longer fulfil. He adds, however, that demand -absorbing institutions may cross these category boundaries and also have a religious orientation and/or be prestigious. Geiger (1986), working at the same time as Levy, develops his ideas along similar lines. He describes three main functions for private higher education institutions. They are to SURYLGH\u0003\u00b6PRUH\u00b7\u000f\u0003\u00b6EHWWHU\u00b7\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003\u00b6GLIIHUHQW\u00b7\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0011\u00037KH\u0003\u00b6PRUH\u00b7\u0003IXQFWLRQ\u0003 occur s when private higher education institutions exist to absorb an immense demand which public institutions cannot PHHW\u0011\u00037KH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0003LQ\u0003WKLV\u0003FDVH\u0003EHFRPHV\u0003D\u0003\u00b6PDVV\u00b7\u0003VHFWRU\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003 thus becomes the major provider of higher education.

However, 2006b). In countries where public -sector educ ation is limited and deficient, a large non -selective private sector is often developed to provide for the large group which is expelled from the public sector, such as happened in the Philippines (James,1991a) . The second function, outlined by Geiger, is WR\u0003SURYLGH\u0003\u00b6GLIIHUHQW\u00b7\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0011\u00033ULYDWH\u0003 higher education institutions are found to exist even when the public sector has the capacity to absorb the demand for places in higher education. This role is played when the state allows private provision to resp ond to certain needs which are not met by the public sector institutions. An example of this is the necessity of public sector colleges to be available for all; therefore they cannot discriminate in favour of minority groups. Levy (2011) has further catego ULVHG\u0003WKLV\u0003W\\SH\u0003RI\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQ\u0003XQGHU\u0003WKH\u0003\u00b6LGHQWLW\\\u00b7\u0003W\\SH\u0011\u0003$Q\u0003 example of an identity institution is the Catholic University of Korea, a private institution with a history 150 years. It serves a distinct minority group within the country of specific cultural and religious orientations. Thus, the public sector in this case is not faced with a capacity issue, but rather an issue of a demand from specific cultural groups to have access to a distinctive form of higher education, which is obviously outside their norms of higher education provision. Where cultural, social, and economic diversity is alongside a strong and relatively uniform public sector, the private sector can exploit the demand for distinctive forms of provision. Supposedly, the issue of quality (r eal or perceived) may also encourage the growth of a high -quality private sector. ,Q\u0003*HLJHU\u00b7V\u0003DQDO\\VLV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003GLIIHUHQW\u0003UROHV\u0003RI\u0003SULYDWH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003 third function is to compensate for the low quality found in the public sector by prRYLGLQJ\u0003\u00b6EHWWHU\u00b7\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0011\u0003,Q\u0003WKLV\u0003VFHQDULR\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0003LV\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003KLJKHU\u0003TXDOLW\\\u0003DQG\u0003 is perceived by students and their parents as offering a better alternative to a failing public sector . Private institutions may also offer courses of a quality matc hing what is offered by the public sector, thus enhancing competition within the higher education system. Levy (2011) provides a similar typology on private institutions according to their criteria for access and the clientele they serve. In addition to p. 15). Levy (2010 b, 2011) highlights the fact that the USA is an exception to KDYLQJ\u0003SULYDWH\u0003\u00b6HOLWH\u00b7\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u000f\u0003DV\u0003WKLV\u0003W\\SH\u0003PRVWO\\\u0003H[LVWV\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003SXEOLF\u0003VHFWRU\u0003 Levy, 2009).

(Levy, 2009, p. 16). His point is that when examining the place of such instituti ons within the wider higher education system, one needs to look at the indirect impacts they exert. In addition, serious demand -absorbing and demand -absorbing institutions are also sometimes GHVFULEHG\u0003DV\u0003\u00b6JDUDJH\u00b7\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u0003RU\u0003\u00b6GLSORPD\u0003PLOOV\u00b7\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003DUH\u0003OH ss selective in recruiting students and staff. Demand -absorbing and serious demand -absorbing institutions are less selective with regard to student access. However, serious demand -absorbing institutions tend to I uture employability. They therefore orient themselves to the labour market through different activities (Levy, 2008). Serious demand institutions are found to be more innovative and entrepreneurial in their linkage with the labour market. In contrast, dema nd-absorption institutions lack academic quality and infrastructure development, partly because financial resources are taken out of the system as profit. Along with the World Bank (1994), advocates of private sector provision within higher education argu e that such expansion frees places within the public system. They also 38 point out that it reduces state spending commitments and increases diversity and choice. Using a shareholder model from businesses, private institutions are arguably more accountable. P ossibly the strongest argument is that this brings additional financial resources into the system. Private provision may be an ideal compl ement where public institutions are perceived to be weak. However, recent studies suggest that quality issues in pri vate education remain, one being academic staff - private colleges are likely to employ academic staff on a part -time basis, who also work full -time in the public sector ( for instance, Fried et al., 2007, pp. 619\u00b2634). Evidence from a surve y of many Euro pean countries (Fried et al., 2007 ) shows that the quality of education offered by the private sector is likely to be inferior to that of the public sector. However, in their conclusion the authors suggest that negative findings may partly be the result of using criteria for assessment which were designed for public -sector higher education institutions and therefore discriminate against private sector institutions. Another key dimension in examining characteristics of private sector higher education is its relation to the state. It is to this that we turn in the following section. 39 Governance: Private Higher Education and the State Altbach (1999 ), Altbach et al. (1999), Geiger (1986), and Levy (1986a, 1986b) have outlined the diversity in private higher ed ucation within and among nations. Although it is now widespread, governments around the globe do not equally recognise this sector (Kinser et al., 2010). In some countries, for example, private higher education, although long-standing, remains marginalise d by governments. This is one of the key findings of the Europe -wide study undertaken by UNESCO (Fried et al., 2007). It was also found that policies in a particular country affect the emergence, growth, and nature of this sector (Levy & Zumeta, 2011; Slan tcheva, 2007).

Varghese (2004) argues that internal and external policies can encourage the presence of private higher education institutions. In Central and Eastern Europe, with the fall of communist party state, the private sector was encouraged to enter the educational arena (Altbach, 2005; Varghese, 2004). In most developing countries it was an external policy which drove the H[SDQVLRQ\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003VHFWRU\u000f\u0003VXFK\u0003DV\u0003WKDW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003:RUOG\u0003%DQN\u00b7V\u00036WUXFWXUDO\u0003 Adjustment Programme of the 1980s (World Bank, 1994).

In countries which fall within this category, the state benefits from the private sector absorbing the excess demand for higher education, without having to pay any subsidies to the private sector. Basically, there is a remote relationship between the State and the private education sector. Overall, the private sector is ignored. The demand -absorbing type of private institution, discussed above, is mostly the result of this lax regulatory growth policy (Levy, 2008) . Since then governments have given more attention to the private sector. In nations which fall within Zumeta \u00b7V\u0003\u00b6FHQWUDO\u0003SODQQLQJ\u00b7\u0003PRGH\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0003LV\u0003 recognised and receives the same treatment as the public sector. It plays its role in a planned higher education system. The distinction between the public and private sectors is barely discernible. Private institutions have their own allocation within the main higher education budget; they are thus forced to follow government regulations. Zumeta suggests that this kind of control makes the private sector quasi -public, making it less flexible in meeting mark et demands and less able to diversify its activities. ,Q\u0003=XPHWD\u00b7V\u0003\u00b6PDUNHW\u0003FRPSHWLWLYH\u00b7\u0003PRGH\u000f\u0003WKH\u00036WDWH\u0003SOD\\V\u0003OHVV\u0003RI\u0003D\u0003SODQQLQJ\u0003DQG\u0003UHJXODWRU\\\u0003 role. The State employs market forces to guide the allocations of programmes and resources. In this case, the Sta te encourages competition between public and private higher education institutions. The State, in effect, allows the public and private institutions to operate in a similar environment. Student aids and grants in these States are portable, giving the stude nt freedom of choice. The student can choose either a private or a public institution, since the aid and support from the State will be there, UHJDUGOHVV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003VWXGHQW\u00b7V\u0003FKRLFH\u0011\u0003 Nevertheless, there are some cases which demonstrate changes in the Governme QW\u00b7V\u0003 stance toward the private sector. In Japan, for example, after three decades of the existence of private higher education, the Government recognised its importance, increasing subsidies to this sector. The State policy chose to support private higher education institutions financially, however, with some control over enrolment quotas. Private higher education became a part of government planning (Goodman & Yonezawa , 2007). But since the late 1980s, the market model has been adopted in the Japanese higher education system. Georgia is another example where the government stance towards the private sector of higher education changed from being laissez -faire 41 towards gre ater central planning immediately after its independence from the Soviet Union (Pachuashvili, 2011). Pachuashvili (2011, p. 404) suggests that factors which shape government policies towards private higher education are multiple and on the private higher education sector, to those related to funding the private sector (Zumeta, 2011). It should be noted that not all private institutions, especially profit -making ones, operate within the regulatory or accreditation system of the country in which they operate. They therefore offer something which they FDOO\u0003\u00b6KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u00b7\u0003EXW\u0003LW\u0003LV\u0003QRW\u0003R fficially recognised by government. In his discussion of the relation between governments and private higher education, do not have to be particula rly for the private sector to affect its growth. Government can affect the private higher education sector through its policies for the public sector (Zumeta, 199 6, 2001), such as policies for public expansion, or for tuition fees (Levy, 2008; Zumeta, 1992 , 199 6, 2011).

In countries like Thailand for example, the Government places more regulation on the private sector than on the public(Levy, 2009) .

This is because the boundaries between public and private higher education institutions are becoming more blurred. I examined the concept of privatisation in higher education studies, and the case of Saudi Ara bia with reference to five perspectives of private higher education, namely funding, ownership, orientation, function and roles, and governance. I explored what these different perspectives meant for the private higher education sector in other countries a nd how it was relevant to the Saudi context. In terms of funding private higher education, the institutions, in contrast to the free public sector, heavily rely on tuition fees with limited support from the Government in the form of scholarships. In terms of orientation, these private institutions are more concern with teaching rather than research or vocational training. In terms of ownership, private institutions are owned by private investors or non -profit organisations. In terms of functions and roles of private institutions, three assumptions were explored respectively: wider access, different forms, or higher quality, and I will further explore these three assumptions in later chapters. In terms of governance, the private sector is under the close sup ervision of the Government and this will also be further explored in Chapter 10. These perspectives will appear again in later chapters. I will also bring in data collected from my empirical work, in order to enrich my discussions from certain perspectives. For instance, I will come back to the issue of functions and roles in Chapter 6 , with particular focuses on admission, teaching, and learning. I will further discuss the issue of orientation in Chapter 7 with particular reference to the labour market in the Saudi context; I will also focus on the relationship between the private sect or and the Government in Chapter 10. In the next chapter I will move on to provide a general introduction to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in terms of its demographics, economy, and the labour market. 43 PART II Chapter 3 The Saudi Arabian Context Introduction This chapter provides an overview of the context in which the research takes place.

The Islamic State Saudi Arabia occupies about three -fourths of the Arabian Peninsula. With a land area of 830,000 square miles, it is about one -third the size of the continental US. It is bordered by Iraq, Kuwait, and Jordan to the north; by Yemen and Oman to the south; the UAE, Qatar and the Arab Gulf to the east and by the Red Sea to the west. While most of its land mass is rugged desert, there is a central plateau and a narrow western coastal plain bordered by high mountains. Once at the centre of the caravan routes, Saudi Arabia is strategically located between three continents: Europe, Asia, and Africa.

Other centres of population include Tabuk in the north, Abha and Khamis Mushait in the south and Buraidah, the capital of Al -Qaseem province, in the central region( Al -Farsi, 1998). The origin of the Saudi state lies in the historical partnership that evolved between the ruling clan of Al -Saud and the puritanical Muslim movement that emerged in the 18th century in central Arabia. That movement is based on the teachings of the religious scholar Mohamed ibn Abdul -Wahhab --1703-92 (Al-Rasheed, 2 002). The essence of Wahhabism is a fierce monotheism and the indivisibility of state and religion. It came about as a result of the perceived ignorance of the populace in the eighteenth century of WUXH\u0003,VODP\u0011\u0003,W\u0003UHMHFWHG\u0003WKH\u0003RSXOHQFH\u0003RI\u0003\u00b6RIILFLDO\u00b7\u0003,VOD m as represented by the Khalifate of the Ottomans (PSLUH\u0003WKDW\u0003UXOHG\u0003WKH\u0003UHJLRQ\u0003IURP\u0003,VWDQEXO\u0011\u0003,W\u0003GHFODUHG\u0003\u00b6-LKDG\u00b7\u0003RQ\u0003WKRVH\u0003 Muslims who were perceived to have deviated from the true path. The movement found in a local emir, one Muhammad bin Saud (d. 1765) a willing partner ( Al-Rasheed, 2002). The po litical religious partnership between Al -Saud family and Wahhabism went through three incarnations (Champion, 2003). The first rose in 1744 and ended in the second decade of the 19th century. Its demise came because of the missionary zeal of this fundamen talist movement. It incurred the wrath of the Ottomans Empire and was crushed in 1818 by Egyptian troops commanded by the sons of Muhammad Ali, the ruler of Egypt. The second Saudi state established itself in 1824, but was defeated in 1891 by the rise of a rival clan, the Al -Rasheeds from northern Arabia, who had the support of the Ot tomans( Champion, 2003 ). It was Abdul -Aziz ibn Saud (1876 -1953), a direct descendant of the first Saudi rulers, who laid the basis of the present Saudi Arabian state. In a dar ing raid in 1902, he led a small group of followers to capture Riyadh and defeat his enemies, the Al -Rasheeds. He 45 declared the establishment of his state on 8th January 1926. This was internationally recognised in 1927. By 1932 he managed to unify the co untry through further conquests and political manoeuvring and established an absolute monarchy: the present Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Al-Rasheed, 2002 ).

The substantial wealth generated by t he oil boom since the early 1970s has allowed Saudi Arabia to undergo rapid development in all material fields. Yet this rapid development has highlighted the contradictions felt by a society that needs all of its human resources, yet strictly limits femal e employment. Adding to the problem, Saudi Arabia has been forced to import a disproportionate number of foreign workers, while a significant number of its own nationals (women) are forced to remain at home by social convention. Seen through a modern soc io-economic lens, it is easy to feel that there is something wrong somewhere.

The King directly administers the country through his governors. Eventually, bureaucratic complexities made it necessary to develop a modern central administration. In 1953, a Council of Mini sters appointed by and headed by the King was established. Decisions were taken after consultation with senior members of the ruling family and the religious establishment. In 1992, The Basic Law of Government was promulgated and the National Consultativ e Assembly was established. This body of 150 members appointed by the King is charged with supervising government departments as well as initiating certain types of legislation. A tribal tradition that survived the modernisation of the Kingdom gives acces s by ordinary citizens to high officials through direct petitioning. In discussing the governance of the country it is also vitally important to emphasis the doctrine that underpins the whole structure --the indivisibility of state and religion. The relig ious establishment in the Kingdom plays a significant role in shaping the laws that govern the country ( Vassiliev,1998 ). Demographics According to the Central Department of Statistics and Information (CDSI), in 2004 Saudi Arabia had a population of 22,678,262 million of which 16,527340 million were Saudi citizens while 6,150,922 were non -Saudi nationals which represented 72.9 % and 27.1 % of the population, respectively. With a growth rate of 3.2 %, population increased to 27,136,977 million in 2010 . Of that, 18,707,576 million were Saudi nationals, representing 68.9% of the total population while expatriates increased to 8,429,401 million, representing 31.1 % of the population (CDSI, 201 1). The gender split 47 in the population is almost evenly divid ed: 50.1% male and 49.9 female ( CDSI, 201 1). As illustrated in Figure 1 below, Saudi Arabia is a young country.

A simple agricul tural base complemented by confined to the neighbouring countries centred on the coastal cities of the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf.

This was followed by a second oil boom between 2002 -2008(Cordesman, 2003 ;Abdelkarim,1999 ). In this period, oil prices exceeded $100 a barrel. Nevertheless, that increase in wealth was not free from challenges \u00b3including unemployment am ong Saudis, inflation and lack of diversification in the general economy (Saif, 2009 ).

Traditional social norms in general, and education, in particular, have had to interact with the global marketplace of ideas and face the challenges that this interaction presents. In the recent past, the Kingdom was not immune from the effect of globalisation and the new trend towards a kno wledge - based economy.

International organizations, such as the United Nations, assisted in ea rly planning. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) office in Riyadh focused on the technical training of Saudi nationals. Then the need for a systematic mechanism was felt and in 1960, the Supreme Planning Board of Saudi Arabia was established. In 1965, this evolved into the Central Planning Organisation which in 1975 became the Ministry of Planning. Since then, the Ministry has been responsible for the development of the economic direction of the country and has been the primary author of Saudi $UDELD\u00b7V\u0003)LYH\u0003<HDU\u0003'HYHORSPHQW\u00033ODQV $O\u0003)DUVL\u000f\u0003\u0014 \u001b \u00117KH\u0003 first of these covered the period 1970 \u00b21975.

The import of expatriate labour, on a massive scale, thus became a necessity.

Although the development of human resources has been an aim of Saudi planners since the First Development Plan, it seems that it did not become a priority until the Third Development Plan (1980 -1985). The two earlier plans focused on developing the infrastructure of the country. With the realisation that the country lacked qualified manpower to implement those plans, a substantial increase in expatriate manpower became inevitable. Simultaneously, there was a significant increase in educational facilities at all levels, with concentration on vocational training. Construction of schools expanded significantly, followed by an increase in enrolment at all academic levels. It was hoped that the output of these educational facilities woul d satisfy the labour market DQG\u0003WKXV\u0003OHVVHQ\u0003WKH\u0003FRXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003UHOLDQFH\u0003RQ\u0003LPSRUWHG\u0003ODERXU 0LQLVWU\\\u0003RI\u00033ODQQLQJ\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0014 \u0011 51 The Third Development Plan (1980 \u00b21985) changed spending emphasis. Spending on infrastructure declined, but it rose markedly on education, he alth, and social services. The planned diversification and development of the productive sectors of the economy - -such as primary industries --did not meet its targets. However, the two major new industrial cities of Jubail and Yanbu were largely completed. Within the Third Plan, there was an emphasis on the management skills of Saudi nationals (Al -Farsi, 1998). Saudi citizens were encouraged, through incentives, to enrol in training courses. Concurrently, the private sector was encouraged to expand training programmes and government loans were made dependent upon the provision of full -time training schemes for Saudi citizens (Al-Farsi, 1998) . The objectives for manpower development were: a substantial increase in the size of trained Saudi manpower available to the market; an increase in productivity in all sectors; the deployment of trained nationals in sectors with the greatest potential for growth; and reduced dependence on foreign manpower. Other objectives of the Plan included diversifying the economy, re forming government administration and encouraging and developing the private sector (Ministry of Planning, 200 0). The Fourth Development Plan (1985 -1990),while consolidating the previous three, emphasised several other noticeable themes, one of which was a commitment to reduce the number of unskilled and manual labour foreign workers in the Kingdom by more than half a million. It also aimed to continue the development of Saudi manpower, through the evaluation of education and training programmes and curricula.

It requires companies to have 30% of their workforce to be Saudis if they have twenty or more employees in their companies. To achieve this goal, a range of measures was introduced. A freez e on applications to hire new foreign workers or renew residence permits for existing workers was put into effect. Non -compliance incurred exclusion from participation in government tenders. It also incurred exclusion from access to government subsidies an d facilities (Madhi and Barrientos, 2003). nationals. Under this programme, companies are categorised to a scheme of four colours: red, yellow, green, and premium. Companies are labelled under one of these four categories, based on the level of Saudisation they fulfil. Companies under premium, then green categories, re ceive more incentives and facilities than the other two categories \u00b3the red category being the worst (Ministry of Labour, 2012). The Seventh Development Plan (2000 -2004) is not much different from the Sixth. However, it focused more on economic diversifi cation and a greater role for the private sector in the Saudi economy. The Plan called for 95% of jobs for Saudis to be created by the private sector. Therefore, educational planners faced the challenge of facilitating the supply of graduates required to s atisfy the specific needs of the private sector. In particular, it was observed that female graduates had studied subjects \u00b2-such as education --more suited for employment by the public sector (Ministry of Planning, 2000), The Eighth Development P lan (2005 -2009) again focused on economic diversification as well as education. It also marked a major shift in focus towards the inclusion of 53 women in the workforce. The Plan called for establishing new universities and new colleges with technical speci alizations. It argued that privatization, and the development of a knowledge -based economy and tourism, would help promote the goal of economic diversification (Ministry of Planning, 2009) . Clearly training and education have been of major concern to the Government. Without success in these fields, it is difficult to see how the economy can be diversified and reliance on the export of oil substantially reduced, let alone enhancing employment opportunities for its citizens. The Saudi Labour Market An exa mination of the structure of the Saudi labour market helps underscore the possible contribution that private higher education can make.

As Table 2 below VKRZV\u000f\u00036DXGLV\u00b7\u0003HPSOR\\PHQW\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003SXEOLF\u0003VHFWRU\u0003LV\u0003 higher than that in the private sector. The situation is reversed in the private sector where non - Saudis predominate. Even in 2004, the private sector sourced more than half its workforce from outside the country.

Table 3 below displays the manpower structure of Saudis and non -Saudis, by major occupations. Table 3: Manpower Structure by Occupation and Nationality Source: Ministry of Economy and Planning - Central Department of Statistics, Obtained from Table 5.6, UNDP, Human Development Report \u00b2 Saudi Arabia, 2003, p.82) The high dependency on expatriate labour is not unique to the KSA, but is common to almost all the Arabian Gulf countries, because they all developed in a similar way: accelerated deve lopment fuelled by increasing oil revenue. In all those states the lack of sufficient competent national human resources was a problem facing their governments, forcing them to import capability from outside (Donn & Almanthri; 2010) . Dependency on foreig n labour was not a temporary one; rather, the number of expatriates employed has increased consistently year on year. Alharthi (2000) examined the complexity of the phenomenon and suggested economic and socio -cultural factors behind the high percentage of non-nationals in the labour market . Some of these will be discussed in the section below.

The unemployment rate for Saudis has been estimated to be 10% of the total labour force of which 6.8% are male and 29.6% are female(M inistry Of Planning , 2009). Nevertheless, this rate vari es among different age groups, being the highest among ages of 20 -24 (Ministry of Planning, 2009 ) Unemployment among Saudi nationals is unlike unemployment in most other countries where it usually results from poor economic conditions and the general poverty of a country. This cannot be said of Saudi Arabia.

This allows those Saudis to generate wealth without actively involving themselves in any work. This was also possible because the country did not permit foreigners to own enterprises in the country.

Al -0XQDMMHG\u00b7V\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0014\u0013 \u0003 study shows that women in Saudi Arabia currently represent only 14.4 % of t he national workforce. In the Gulf region women constitute 59.9% of the workforce in the UAE, 42.49 % in Kuwait, 36.4 % in Qatar and 34.9 % for Bahrain ( Al-0XQDMMHG\u00b7V\u0003\u000f\u0015\u0013\u0014\u0013 . :RPHQ\u00b7V\u0003SDUWLFLSDWLRQ\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003JRYHUQPHQW\u0003VHFWRU\u0003LV\u0003KLJKHU\u0003WKDQ\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHF tor being 62% and 38% respectively. Within the public sector, women are mostly found in the education, health, and social service sectors constituting 88%, 9%, and 1% respectively ( Al -Humaid, 2002). According to Ramady (2005), high enrolment by women in education, is due to the greater employment opportunities this field offered. In the words of Al -+DPLG\u0003DQG\u0003-DPMRRP \u0003\u0003\u00b4 There was an urgent need for female graduates in education to work in the schools whose number were increasing day in and 57 day out as D\u0003UHVXOW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003VSUHDG\u0003RI\u0003ZRPHQ\u00b7V\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0011\u00b5 (Al-Hamid & Jamjoom, 2009, p. 761). Additionally , Al- Munajj ed (2010) suggests that this pattern could also be a result of sex segregation by occupation. In Saudi Arabia, women are concentrated in certain professions that are seen as feminine (Al- Munajjid, 2010). Therefore, the education sector includes the largest proportion of females participating in the governmental labor market (Al -Hamid & Jamjoom, 2009; Al- Munajjed, 2010) . This proportion reached around 87.6% in 2002 of the total number of women working in the Government sector. While the Government sector was recruiting female employees, recruitment of women by the public sector has been decreasing over the years. According to the Ministry of Civil Services records, the number of female a pplicants for teaching posts in KSA reached 73,500 when the total number of available posts was 7,710 (Al- Munajjed,2010) . This means that 89% of applicants for job posts will not find a job, which constitutes a serious burden on the labor market. This co incides with a more recent study by Al - Munajjed (2010) which reveals that women do not feel optimistic about their future in the labour market. According to the Al - Hamid and Jamjoom study (2009), there is a current saturation in the market, in particula r with unemployed female teachers. The private sector has been charged, through government policies, to provide job opportunities because of the saturation of the public sector. However, the Government UHDOLVHG\u0003WKDW\u0003WKH\u0003ODERXU\u0003PDUNHW\u00b7V\u0003DEVRUSWLRQ\u0003FDSDFLW\\\u0003 is not the only factor affecting the ZRPHQ\u00b7V\u0003HPSOR\\PHQW\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0011\u0003\u0003$GGLWLRQDOO\\\u000f\u0003WKH\\\u0003ZHUH\u0003IRXQG\u0003QRW\u0003WR\u0003KDYH\u0003 sufficient education and training as needed by the labour market (Al-Hamid & Jamjoom, 2009). Al-Munajjed (2010; p.11) for example, c riticised the education system for not preparing women for need to success fully compete in the labour market. The current educational system relies on rote learning and does not sufficiently promote analysis, skills development, problem solving, communication, and creativity. In addition, there is a shortage of appro priate education in areas vital to the development of the new knowledge -based economy, such as math, science, technology, and computer literacy. As a result, Saudi women are not suf ficiently empowered to participate in digital VRFLHW\\\u0011\u00b5\u0003 In 2004, the Shura Council called for a comprehensive national strategy to address the expansion of education, work and training areas for Saudi women in a way that suits their nature and does not conflict with the Islamic Sharia laws (Al -Hamid & Jamjoom, 58 2009). Perhaps, economic planners and policymakers started to realise tha t the recruitment and training of women could help solve the difficulties of Saud ising the workforce. Such educational expansion would also help to satisfy the rising expectations of the increasing number of women who will begin graduating from secondary s chools, colleges and universities. This focus may have been compounded by the tendency of girls to excel academically in secondary schools, with proportionately more females than males graduating. Ramady (2005) suggest s that the kind of educational progra mmes available to women are still limited.

They also suggested using technology to provide dista nce work for women and also for expanding the scope of careers open to women. However, they place more emphasis on preparing women for the labour market through education and training institutions. In Al- 0XQDMMHG\u00b7V\u0003ZRUGV \u0003\u0003 \u00b4The national system of education is failing to prepare Saudi women for competitive roles in the labor force limiting them to traditional fields of work such as teaching and work in the service sector \u00b5\u0003(Al-Munajjed 2010. p.3) Nevertheless, the extent to which private higher edu cation is addressing the unemployment issue in Saudi Arabia will be the focus of our discussion in Chapter 8. 59 Conclusion As has been seen, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia faces a unique combination of challenges -- historical, cultural, social, demograp hic and economic.

But that came with a high cost --continuing unemployment among Saudi nationals. As a consequence of sudden prosperity and high levels of spending by the Government, Saudis shunned manual and vocational not always efficient public sector. When oil revenues declined, the Government placed new emphasis on jobs for Saudis in the private sector. The Seventh Development Plan (2000 -04) calle d for 95% of Saudi jobs to be in the private sector, somewhat unrealistically since more than half the labour force remains expatriate. Contributing to this unemployment is a high birth rate and a low mortality rate. Nearly 60% of the population is under 25. Lack of high quality education has ill prepared Saudis for private sector work. Half of those who graduate from the higher education system have majored in social or religious studies --for which there is little need and few have scientific, technic al or management training. The market tends to view Saudis as unqualified, lacking in specialised skills. Cultural factors again are in evidence with the role of Saudi women. Historically, women were given little or no education, had limited social mobi lity and no possibility of employment. Even today, woman only comprise 14% of the workforce, 60 low even by Gulf standards. Now, women are being educated in huge numbers (as will be seen in the next chapter) but there are still few places for them in the jo b world. In conclusion, there are many challenges before the Kingdom. A key to addressing them will be the role of higher education --public and private --which will be the topics of the next two chapters 61 Chapter 4 Higher Education in Saudi Arabia - Emer gence, Development and Challenges Introduction This chapter provides a sketch of the Saudi Education system -its emergence, development and challenges. It begins with a brief review of the development of the education system in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The structure of the system of education will be presented, followed by a discussion of the different forms of institutions it currently consti tutes. In terms of i ts present challenges, I particularly focus on the mismatch between the development of the general and the higher education systems. I highlight the capacity issue facing the higher education sector, I also examine the role of the pri vate sector in this regard. Origins of Education in Saudi Arabia Since the emergence of the modern Kingdom in 1932, Saudi Arabia has undergone rapid and dramatic changes in the economic, social, and most importantly educational spheres. Before 1932, fe w people had the opportunity to acquire basic skills such as reading and writing. These skills were offered and taught only in religious institutions, ZKLFK\u0003ZHUH\u0003NQRZQ\u0003DV\u0003\u00b6NDWDWHHE\u00b7\u000f\u0003DV\u0003ZHOO\u0003DV\u0003LQ\u0003PRVTXHV\u0011\u0003$Q\u0003RUJDQLVHG\u0003HGXFDWLRQDO\u0003V\\VWHP\u0003 NQRZQ\u0003DV\u0003\u00b6PDGUDVD K\u00b7\u0003WKHQ\u0003HYROYHG\u0003LQ\u0003PDMRU\u0003UHJLRQDO\u0003FHQWUHV\u0003VXFK\u0003DV\u00030DNNDK\u000f\u00030HGLQD\u000f\u0003 and Jeddah --cities that were historically under Turkish control (Al -Hamid et al, 2007) . Before the emergence of a unified country, conditions varied from region to region. While the wester n region of the Hejaz was relatively stable, the Najd, in the central region, and the regions of the East were rife with instability and tribal disputes. Neglect by the controlling Ottoman Empire, which prevailed until the First World War, 62 contributed in general to what amounted to the total absence of a nationwide educational system. Economic and social conditions were not conducive to any form of IRUPDO\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0011\u0003\u00033HRSOH\u00b7V\u0003GDLO\\\u0003OLYHV\u0003ZHUH\u0003D\u0003FRQVWDQW\u0003VWUXJJOH\u0003IRU\u0003VXUYLYDO\u000f\u0003OHDYLQJ\u0003OLWWOH\u0003 time or inclin ation to think of education. According to Al-Sunbul et al., ( 1998), before the establishment of the Directorate of Education, education in KSA went through three phases: traditional inherited education, organized Ottoman public education, and private education. The traditional inherited education was a type of education that was delivered in mosques (that is, two +DUDP\u00030RVTXHV\u0003LQ\u00030DNNDK\u0003DQG\u00030DGLQDK \u0003DQG\u0003LQ\u0003\u00b6NDWDWHHE\u00b7\u0011\u0003\u00037HDFKLQJ\u0003LQ\u0003PRVTXHV\u0003 covered the subjects of history, UHOLJLRQ\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003OLWHUDWXUH\u000f\u0003ZKLOH\u0003LQVWUXFWLRQ\u0003LQ\u0003\u00b6NDWDWHHE\u00b7\u0003 IRFXVHG\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003DOSKDEHW\u000f\u0003UHDGLQJ\u000f\u0003ZULWLQJ\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003PHPRULVLQJ\u0003YHUVHV\u0003IURP\u0003WKH\u00034XU\u00b7DQ\u0011\u0003\u00037KH\u0003 Ottoman government, on the other hand, supervised the organized Ottoman public education system, with Turkish a s the main language of instruction. Under this system, pupils spent three years in primary education, while secondary education students had a choice of either three or five years of education. Lastly, private education was managed and financed by the pri vate sector. In essence, it followed traditional education guidelines, but provided subjects other than the purely religious ones. Schools of this type were established through efforts by individuals and financed by donations. The first school of this t ype was established by a man from India who recognised the need for establishing a proper school for the Indian community. The school had a curriculum based on what was used in Islamic schools in India. This type of private schools prospered in both the eastern and western regions, while the central region of Najd remained dependent on the traditional type of teaching ( Al-Sunbul et al., 1997). These three phases characterized the educational landscape of the country before the rise of the modern Saudi state. Among the first things the founding monarch, King Abdul Aziz, did after capturing the western region of Hejaz was the establishment of the Directorate of Education on March 16, 1926 (Al -Aqil, 2005). The role of this directora te was to set policies, rules and regulations for the educational system of the country. The King began to establish a modern political system to govern the country, by setting up a number of ministries. In 1954, the Directorate of Education became the Ministry of Education and was entrusted with the task of unifying the education system of the country. The Directorate supervised a number of educational institutions, both public and private ( Al-Aqil, 2005 ). However, there was still no unified curriculum, with 63 each educational institution having its own. A number of schools imported their curriculum from neighbouring Arab countries. The main effort of the Ministry of Education was directed at establishing public schools in all regions of the country. Nevertheless, the Ministry was faced with the challenge of finding enough qualified teachers. Setting up enough schools to service the increasing demand for education in the diverse regions of the country was a daunting challenge (MOHE, 2010). To operate, t he Ministry had to import all its resources the neighbouring countries. The Ministry faced not only a lack of teachers, but also the absence of basic equipment to publish or print educational materials. The situation was brought on largely due to the Gove UQPHQW\u00b7V\u0003UHOLJLRXV\u0003RULHQWDWLRQ\u000f\u0003ZKLFK\u0003IRUFHG\u0003WKH\u00030LQLVWU\\\u0003WR\u0003GHYHORS\u0003LWV\u0003OHDUQLQJ\u0003 resources internally ( Al-Dawoud,1996 ). In 2002, the Ministry was renamed the Ministry of Education and Teaching, and it oversees kindergarten education as well as general e ducation for boys and girls. +RZHYHU\u000f\u0003LW\u0003LV\u0003ZRUWK\u0003QRWLQJ\u0003WKDW\u0003JLUOV\u00b7\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003KDV\u0003RQO\\\u0003EHHQ\u0003VXSHUYLVHG\u0003E\\\u0003WKLV\u0003 Ministry since 2003.

The agreement stipulated that the education of girls would be strictly supervised. Education would be conducted by females, but still under the watchful eyes of dependable men (Sabbagh, 1996). Structure of the General Education System The duration of the school programme in the KSA totals 12 years: 6 years in primary school, 3 in intermediate, and the final 3 in secondary education. Also, prior to starting their primary education, students have the option of spending 2 years in pre -school and kindergarten. Upon the completion of their primary education, students are admitted to intermediate education. After finishing intermediate education, students can then choose among three paths. They c an either pursue vocational training in secondary institutions (industrial, commercial, agriculture, supervisory), or enrol in normal secondary school. Notably, only students choosing the last path can pursue university 64 education or any other post -secondar y degrees. The others are more limited to technical colleges. In addition, students attending normal secondary school can major in either science or arts (literature), provided that their grades meet the en trance requirements.

For a student, his or her university major is largely det ermined by the results of these assessments, combined with secondary school results, as universities use both these tests and high school grades to select student applications. Higher Education in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia The increasing financial re sources at the disposal of the country since the start of oil exploitation in 1938 had a tremendous impact on the development of the educational system. As the Kingdom entered a period of significant economic development, the Government recognised the nee d for educational institutions that would equip Saudi citizens for the emerging domestic labour market. At that time, the country lacked enough skilled workers to manage the new economy ( Bahthelah, 2005 ). Over the years, the education system enjoyed a steady, though slow development until a wave of rapid development in the 1970s. The a dvent of an increasingly integrated information and knowledge -driven global economy are other recent factors leading the Government to give this sector highest priority for further development. At the time of the founding monarch, King Abdul -Aziz, the country had no higher education institutions. The highest educational level a student could achieve was to graduate from the Preparatory Scholarship School, which was established in 1935 under the supervision of the Directorate of Education. This establishment only prepared students for university education in other countries (Al -Hamid et al., 2007). The first Saudi students to pursue higher education were sent in 1926 on scholarship to Al -Azhar University in Egypt. However, the government soon realised the necessity of having its own higher education system and thus began to build and expand it. According to the MOHE (2010) report, the development of the Saudi higher education system went through three stages. During the foundation stage (1949 -1960), the building blocks of the higher education sector were developed . The first college was open ed in the Kingdom in 1949. That was the Faculty of Sharia (Jurisprudence) in Makkah ( Al-Sunbul et al., 1997 ). Less than five 67 years later, two colleges were established in Riyadh - the College of Jurisprudence and the College of A rabic Language. The educational orientation and emphasis on religious subjects and language remained at the core of the curriculum. In 1957, a royal decree RUGHUHG\u0003WKH\u0003HVWDEOLVKPHQW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003.LQJGRP\u00b7V\u0003ILUVW\u0003XQLYHUVLW\\ \u0003WKH\u00038QLYHUVLW\\\u0003RI\u00035L\\DGK\u000f\u0003 later to be renamed the King Saud University, which consisted of four colleges. The four colleges were the Faculty of Literature, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Management Sciences and Faculty of Pharmacy. During the expansion stage (1961 -1980), new higher educatio n institutions were HVWDEOLVKHG\u000f\u0003LQFOXGLQJ\u0003XQLYHUVLWLHV\u000f\u0003WHDFKHU\u0003WUDLQLQJ\u0003FROOHJHV\u0003DQG\u0003ZRPHQ\u00b7V\u0003FROOHJHV\u0011\u00036L[\u0003 new universities were established in the major cities of Medina, Jeddah, Mekkah, Riyadh, Dhahran, and Al -Hasa (see Table 4 below). Branches of thes e universities were established in a limited number of cities, like Abha, Qaseem, and Ehsa (MOHE, 2010). Among the existing eight universities, two were Islamic universities with no colleges for science and technology and the third, King Fahad University for Petroleum and Minerals, has no colleges for religion, humanities or social sciences (Bashshur, 2004). Teacher training colleges and women's colleges are higher education institutions that specialize in producing teachers for general education; the for mer is for male students, while the latter is for female students who later teach in girls' schools. Degrees in education are offered to students upon the completion of a four -year program, which include the practical teaching requirement. Female enrolmen t in these colleges has been relatively high, perhaps because teaching was the only profession available to women besides working in the health sector. The third phase of development was the comprehensive stage (1981 -2009). After the establishment of Umm Al-Qura University in Mekkah in 1980, no new universities were established until the year 1998, with the establishment of King Khalid University in the southern region. This was not the birth of a new institution, but the result of merging two local branc hes of two main universities, the south branches of Imam Mohammed bin Saud Islamic University and King Saud University. Between 1998 and 1999, new forms of higher education were permitted --private higher education institutions and community colleges, which will be detailed later in this chapter. However, it was not until 2009 that a royal decree approved the establishment of new public universities. In sheer numbers, it appears that there are twelve new public universities since the last one was establishe d in 1998. In fact, however, there are only five new schools; the other 68 seven are the result of merging branches of existing universities. This situation underlines the fact that there has been little expansion in the sector for almost two decades, espec ially at the university level. This suggests issues and challenges facing this sector as will be discussed below. 69 Table 4: Saudi Higher Education Institutions 1961 -2012 Higher Education Body No. Colleges Year Established * Umm Al-Qura Univers 24 1980 1961 -1980 Al-Imam Mohammed Ibn Saud Islamic University 5 1961 Kind Saud University 46 1957 King Abdulaziz University 25 1967 King Fahd University for Petroleum and Minerals 9 1975 King Faisal University 33 1975 King Khalid University 37 1998 1998 -2010 Qassim University 26 2005 Taibah University 21 2005 Taif University 18 2006 King Saud University for Health Sciences 7 2006 Jazan University 14 2005 8QLYHUVLW\\\u0003RI\u0003+D\u00b7LO 10 2005 Al Jouf University 15 2006 University of Tabuk 11 2007 Al Baha University 11 2007 Najran University 10 2007 Princess Nora Bint Abdulrahman University 33 2008 Northern Borders University 12 2008 Total Public Universities 380 Technical colleges 35 Prince Sultan Military College for Health Sciences 1 Institute of Public Administration 0 Yunbu and Jubail Colleges 4 Total 40 Private Higher Education 38 2000 -2010 General Total 458 Source: Ministry of Higher Education (2009, p.21) (*) Based on data from the Mi nistry of Education (2008, p.7) 70 In term of governance, all public and private colleges and universities are now under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE).

Nevertheless, the Council of Higher Education is the supreme governing body for all post -secondary institutions. This council is involved in approving the establishment of new academic units, programmes and inst itutions. It also has the responsibility of coordinating activities between higher education institutions, appointing rectors of public universities, and approving the bylaws for university operations (MOHE. 2009). The greatest challenge facing the King GRP\u00b7V\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003V\\VWHP --both public and private --is the gap between supply and demand . Projections indicate that by 2030, of approximately 760,000 secondary school graduates, only 250,000 will gain admittance into the higher education system --a gap of 67% (Arab, 2007, p.223 -\u0015\u0017 \u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003\u00b4JDS\u0003 FULVLV\u00b5\u0003ZLOO\u0003EH\u0003GLVFXVVHG\u0003PRUH\u0003IXOO\\\u0003 later in the chapter . But beyond the demographic factors presented in Chapter 3, what socio -economic forces contribute to this demand for university education? The sudden oil boom in the 1970s, with all the social and economic development brought to the country, affected Saudi attitudes towards certain professions and thus towards the type of higher education institutions they may choose to enrol in. University education seems to be important not only for employment, but also for social prestige and most importantly as D\u0003 NH\\\u0003 DVSHFW\u0003 RI\u0003 \u00b4PDUULDJH -DELOLW\\\u00b5--Saudi Arabia is still characterized by traditional \u00b4DUUDQJHG\u0003PDUULDJHV\u0011\u00b5\u0003,QWHUHVWLQJO\\\u000f\u0003WKRXJK\u0003WKLV\u0003ZRXOG\u0003EH\u0003H[SHFWHG\u0003DPRQJ\u0003F ertain social classes, it seems that university education is still highly regarded among all social classes. Enrolment rates for vocational education are still low in comparison to the total enrolment in higher education - at only 9% of the total enrolment in higher education (MOHE, 2010) , despite a gradual increase in this path over the years. Another possible reason why secondary school students prefer higher education is the fact that it is free. All public education in the KSA, including higher education, is provided without cost. Furthermore, all Saudi students of higher education in the KSA 71 receive monthly stipends equivalent to around $250. All enrolled students, r egardless of their academic performance or social background, are eligible to receive this amount. During the early years of higher education in the KSA, such an incentive was important to encourage Saudi nationals to pursue higher education. This policy is still active, even though now the demand has greatly surpassed the supply. By calculation, we might find that university student stipends constitute a great deal of the higher education budget, an amount that would be more than sufficient to build new u niversities.

In PEP, courses are offered at night or in the late afternoon. The notion of tuition was also introduced in the Saudi higher education system through the newly emerging private higher education sector . It may be difficult to comprehend the slow, unbalanc ed growth in the capacity of the higher education system in a rich country like Saudi Arabia. Many questions are raised UHJDUGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003IDFW\u0003WKDW\u0003WKH\u0003FRXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003SURYLVLRQ\u0003GHSHQG ed for almost twenty -five years on eight universities (Alkhazim, 2003). The Government strategy for not expanding is unclear, one may speculate that the economic situation could be the reason. After the great boom in receipts due to high oil prices between1975 -1985, the decline in oil prices in 1996 and consequent shri nkage of government receipts had a major impact on education expenditure. In addition, starting from 1991, the Saudi Governments started to pay for the costs of the Kuwait War. According to Niblock, and Malik (2007) , some Arab countries, including Saudi A rabia, financed 80% of the Kuwait war. According to Obid (2000), because of this war the Saudi Government incurred huge debt which affected its budget and spending. Notwithstanding the above, it may be worth noting that, based on the UNDP report of 2003 (UNDP,2003), the budget allocation for general education is higher than that for higher education. In addition, the share of the latter was comparatively decreased from what it was in 1970 in the face of the increase of expenditure on general education fr om 59% to 82 % of the total education budget. This could be a factor affecting the 72 expansion of higher education in the country. Bashsher (2004) explains that spending more on general education and less o n higher education was a trend across world . Acco rding to him, this orientation was based on an economic analysis prevailing in the 1970s and 1980s, which estimated the financial returns to the economy from education. This analysis suggested that primary education yielded a higher return to the economy than higher education. However, this position was later challenged with new evidence RQ\u0003WKLV\u0003GHEDWH\u0003 :RUOG\u0003%DQN\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0013\u000f\u0003S\u0011\u0017 \u0003ZKLFK\u0003VD\\V \u0003\u00b4WKH\u0003TXDOLW\\\u0003RI\u0003NQRZOHGJH\u0003JHQHUDWHG\u0003 within higher education institutions, and its availability to the wider economy, is EHFRPLQJ\u0003LQFUHDVLQJO\\\u0003FULWLFDO\u0003WR\u0003QDWLRQDO\u0003FRPSHWLWLYHQHVV\u0011\u00b5\u0003 %XVKVKHU\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0017\u000f\u0003S\u0011\u0016 The Kingdom entered the 21st century, however, with a healthier financial outlook. The Government was released from the burden of the debt generated by the Kuwait War and the price of oil has increased steadily. In fact, financial allocations for human resources development increased during the 8th Five Year Plan (2005 \u00b22009) from about SR69.9 billion to about SR104.6 billion, an annual average growth rate of 14.4%, which confirms the commitment of the Kingdom to providing financial support for expanding educational opportunities( Ministry of Planning, 2009 ). The allocated budget for higher education has increased by more than 200% between the years 2005 -2009, from around 3 billion to around 9 billion US dollars (MOHE, 2010). This would account for the current expansion in the Saudi higher education system . External Scholarships and Community Colleges Sending students abroad on scholarship s is not new to the KSA. As was briefly mentioned, the Government has been sending students abroad since the 1930s when there were no higher education institutions av ailable in the Kingdom. In the past many, if not all, administrators, academics and high -ranking officials have received their qualifications from universities abroad. External scholarships were exclusive to government agencies and public universities. Additionally, some Saudi nationals travelled abroad for education at their own expense. The number of scholarship beneficiaries has increased over the years. By 1977 -78, government scholarships already covered 9,007 students: 8,216 male and 880 female, with Egypt being the major hosting country. Since the mid -1970s, the United States 73 and Europe have become significant hosting countries ( Al-Mousa, 2009 ). The economic recession between the late 1980s and late 1990s affected the number of students sent abr oad by the Government s on scholarships (Al -Essa, 2011). The reduction, however, might be proportional to the demographic boom in the country. Government funding for study abroad was not stopped but considerably reduced. Scholarship levels remained low u ntil the inception of the King Abdullah Scholarship Programme in 2005. The King Abdullah Scholarship Programme DOVR\u0003FDOOHG\u0003\u00b47KH\u0003&XVWRGLDQ\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u00037ZR\u0003 +RO\\\u0003 0RVTXHV\u0003([WHUQDO\u00036FKRODUVKLS\u00033URJUDP\u00b5 \u0003ZDV\u0003LQLWLDOO\\\u0003 ODXQFKHG\u0003WR\u0003FRYHU\u0003ILYH\u0003 years, with different gr oups of students to be sent during this period. According to Al - Mousa (2009), this program me is considered the largest in the history of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The State has allocated 7 billion Saudi Riyals for scholarship s in prestigious universit ies in a number of countries( Al-Ohali & Al -Aqili, 2009 ). It is estimated that more than 80,000 students benefited during the first phase of the program me (2005 -2010) and were sent to 55 different countries around the world (MOHE, 2010). Though the year of 2010 was supposed to be the final year of the program me, in that year a royal decree extended it for another five years and this is considered the second phase of this program me. This scholarship program me financially supports S audi students who study abroad to obtain undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. The mission of the programme has been \u00b4\u00abIRU\u0003VFLHQWLILF\u000f\u0003FXOWXUDO\u000f\u0003HGXFDWLRQDO\u0003DQG\u0003VFKRODUO\\\u0003H[FKDQJH\u0003ZLWK\u0003GLIIHUHQW\u0003SDUWV\u0003RI\u0003 WKH\u0003ZRUOG\u00ab\u0003DQG\u0003WR\u0003HVWDEOLVK\u0003KLJKO\\\u0003TXDOLILHG\u00036DXG L\u0003FDOLEUHV\u0003IRU\u0003WKH\u0003ODERXU\u0003PDUNHW\u0011\u00b5\u0003 $O - Mousa, 2009, p. 719). This scholarship programme focuses on certain disciplines which have been needed in the labour market, including both graduate and post graduate studies (Al -Ohali & Al - Aqili, 2009; Al - Mousa, 2 009). The existence of the vast King Abdullah Scholarship Programme can be attributed to the economic wealth of the Government at the start of the 21st century, a result of high oil prices. In addition, Al -Essa suggests that political considerations also played a major role in the inception of this program: \u00b47KH\u0003*RYHUQPHQW\u0003ZDV\u0003ZLOOLQJ\u0003WR\u0003VWDUW\u0003VXFK\u0003D\u0003SURJUDPPH\u0003DV\u0003VRRQ\u0003DV\u0003SRVVLEOH\u0003WR\u0003 counter the criticism made against the country since 11 Saudis were among the KLMDFNHUV\u0003RI\u0003 \u0012\u0014\u0014\u00b5\u0003 $O -Essa, 2011, p. 37). 74 Thus the Government needed to change its image and needed to consider countries other than the USA where Saudi students can pursue their higher education degrees . Al- Essa (2011) explains that the Saudi educatio n system was accused internally, and by the West, especially the US, of OLPLWLQJ\u0003VWXGHQWV\u00b7\u0003DZDUHQHVV\u0003RI\u0003RWKHU\u0003FXOWXUHV\u0003DQG\u0003LQ\u0003IDLOLQJ\u0003 to prepare Saudis for the labour market. This resulted in high unemployment and, eventually, involvement by some Saudis i n radical organisations. In the United States, for example, immediately after the 9/11 incident, there was an obvious change in public attitudes towards Saudis. The doors were no longer wide open to Saudi students. The US became less generous in issuin g visas to them (The Observatory, 2006). The USA was no longer a welcoming environment in which Saudis could pursue their education. The Saudi Government \u00b7V\u0003FKDQJH\u0003RI\u0003GLUHFWLRQ\u0003WR\u0003(DVW\u0003$VLD\u0003 - including India, China, Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea - was to rescue its students from humiliation in the USA ( The Observatory, 2006). However, the Government also sought to rebuild its relationship with the United States. visas to Saudi students increased, by around 63%, to what they were in 2004/2005. With all the positives of this large -scale scholarship program, there are still opponents to this initiative. In addition to their worries of the brain drain that this programme might cause, they complain that money spent on scholarships should have been invested in building new universities ( The Observatory,2006 ). 7KH\u0003ODUJH\u0003QXPEHU\u0003RI\u0003VWXGHQWV\u00b7\u0003SXUVXLQJ\u0003WKHLU\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003DEURDG\u0003XQGHUOLQH s the need for expanding the higher education system in the KSA. Study abroad might be a sound temporary solution to lessen the pressure on local higher -education institutions. Nevertheless, it is most likely that this programme will not last very long, and the Saudi higher -education sector will eventually face the need to increase its intake capacity. The establishment of new public universities did not make a significant difference as the majority resulted from merging a number of branches. Now, comple tely new types of higher -education institutions have been established. Community colleges and private higher -education institutions are two alternatives to public universities lately introduced to the KLQJGRP\u00b7V\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003V\\VWHP\u0003WR\u0003DEVRUE\u0003WKH\u0003 75 high demand f or access to higher education. A brief description of community colleges will be presented, but the main focus will be on private higher col leges offer two -year vocational programmes in specialized areas of medical science, applied science, computer -engineering science, and financial science. Upon fulfilling graduation requirements, students are granted associate degrees. Community colleges in Saudi Arabia were first established in 2 000 in three cities: Hail, Geezan, and Tabouk. Since then, their numbers have been increasing: there are now around 43 community colleges, each of which is linked to a public university. Upon the completion of their associate degrees, students can ente r the job market or transfer to the linked public university and, in two years, can receive a bachelor's degree. According to data collected from the 2003 -2004 academic year, of the 79,000 students enrolled in higher -education institutions at the interm ediate diploma level, 7,500 students (i.e., 9.5%) were enrolled in community colleges, 89% of whom were male and 11% of whom were female. The largest number of students enrolled in community colleges is found to be in Riyadh, followed by Tabuk and Baha at the rate of 30.85%, 14.89%, and 14.61%, respectively. Students who attend community colleges receive free tuition but they do not receive the $250 monthly stipend that students receive in the public universities. Given the lack of capacity in the higher education sector, community colleges may be a means of addressing some of that demand but the lack of a stipend does act as a disincentive for some students. Supply and Demand Challenges in Higher Education: The contribution of the private sector High er education in the KSA faces local challenges as well as the rapid pace of global change. (Al -Ohali, Al -Aqili; 2009). Keeping pace with high population growth, the wide geographic distribution of communities in this huge country, and the increase in the number of secondary school graduates are among the most serious challenges facing Saudi higher education. Indeed, rapid increases in the number of secondary school graduates has led to a steady growth in the demand for higher education. This demand 76 is even expected to increase more with primary education now being compulsory. This was not the case until the Seventh Development Plan of the country (M inistry Of Planning , 2000). According to the UNDP (2003), gross enrolment of both genders in primary and secondary education increased from 813, 000 in 1975 to around 4 million in 2002. In 2004 and 2008, the total enrolment in general education was 4,355, 658 and 4, 717, 275 respectively with an average annual growth rate of 2.0% ( Ministry Of Planning , 2009). For the same period (2004 -2008), the output of secondary education increased from 239,379 in 2004 to 321,043 in 2008 with an annual growth rate of 9.2% (MOP, 2009). It was estimated that the number of high school graduates has increased by 400% between 1993 and 2008 (Al -Ohali; 2007). Table 5 below illustrates the dramatic changes in Saudi higher education enrolment between 1969 and 2005. Clearly there have been massive enrolment increases over time. In 1970 -71, there were 8000 male students and no female students! In 1980 -81, there were 40,000 male students and 16,000 female students. By 2004 -05, there were 219,000 male students and 206,000 female students enrolled. These are impressive gains but they do not tell the whole story which reve als a looming demand gap. 77 Table 5: Higher Education Enrolment Numbers: 1969 -2005 Year Total No. of Students No. of Male students No. of Female Students 1969 -70 7000 7000 1970 -71 8000 8000 1971 -72 9000 8000 1000 1972 -73 2007, p. 195 78 Though there has been growth in enrolment at all levels of education, there have not been equal expansions in the secondary and higher education sectors. As Table 6 below shows, the gap between the number of secondary education graduates and that of higher education/post -secondary admissions has been fairly n oticeable since 1985 -86 and widened in recent decades.. It is not clear from the study of Al -Medhary (1998) whether the percentage of students accepted takes into account those who did not actually apply for higher education. What is clear from the tabl e is how the gap has been increasing over the years. In 1985 -86, 87% of secondary students were accepted into higher education institutions but by 1999 -2000 the gap had increased and only 45% were accepted. Table 6: Public Higher Education Absorption Capacity Year Secondary School leavers Students admitted in higher education Percentage of study conducted by Al -Medhary 1998 Data 1999/2000: Ministry of Planning (2000) , 7th Five Year Plan (2000 -2004) The Government \u00b7V\u00031LQWK\u0003'HYHORSPHQW\u00033ODQ\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0014\u0013 -2014) suggests that the Ministry of Higher Education is making some effort to narrow this gap (Ministry of Planning, 2009). According to this plan, the number of students enrolled in higher education institutions increased by 7.4% from 2004 -2008, and the number of students accepted into higher education institutions increased by 6.8%. With all the efforts by the Government to reduce this gap between supply and demand in higher education, the high birth rate, as previously described, is yet another significant challenge to the closing of this gap. A study done by Aasim Arab (2007) estimates the gap between general and highe r education enrolment for the next 25 years (See Table 7 below). In his study, the numbers of students graduating from secondary education and those to be accepted at the university level were calculated by assuming that the present rate of growth will con tinue without any change in general and higher education. The 79 estimate indicated a tendency for the gap to increase from 62.5% in 2009/2010 to 67.2% in 2030/31. The study also estimates that the gap will be wider for females than males. Arab estimates that by the end of 2030 -31, the number of female secondary school graduates will have increased by 326% (from 2005) to reach 416,000, a growth rate of 4.8% per year (Arab, 2007, p.396). For the same period, male secondary school graduates will increase by 324% to about 370,000 graduates, also at a growth rate of 4.8% (Arab, 2007p.395). Even the Government \u00b7V\u0003RZQ\u0003UHFHQW\u0003(LJKWK\u0003'HYHORSPHQW\u0003 Plan (2000 -2004) estimated that the demand gap would be 69% by the end of 2004 - 2005. Thus, it is likely that by 2030 ne arly half a million secondary school graduates will not find places in the existing higher education system. This presents a daunting challenge not only for education but in terms of meeting the needs of a modern globalized economy. 80 Table 7: Supply -Demand: Expected Gap Number of students not expected to be Absorbed in Higher Education in Five -Year Periods Year Expected Graduates of Secondary School Expected to join HE Not Expected to Join HE % of those not absorbed by HE As has been seen, the total enrolment share of the Saudi private sector is only 3.49%. This can hardly address the huge future demand indicated above. Aasim Arab has conducted a detailed survey of Saudi private higher education. In his unpublished study he concludes: \u00b4\u00abWKDW\u0003XQGHU\u0003WKH\u0003IDLOXUH\u0003RI\u0003JRYHUQPHQW\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003WR\u0003DEVRUE\u0003WKH\u0003JURZLQJ\u0003 number of secondary stage graduates and the failure of private higher education to increase its share in absorption of these graduates, short and medium solutions will not help i n making private higher education institutions capable of absorbing JUHDWHU\u0003QXPEHUV\u0003RI\u0003WKHVH\u0003JUDGXDWHV\u00b5\u0003 $UDE\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u001a\u000f\u0003S\u0011\u0003\u0017\u0014\u0017 \u0011\u0003\u0003 There are a number of points worth emphasizing here. First, the private education sector of the KSA is in its infancy. The fi rst institutions only opened 12 years ago. Their wider acceptance among Saudi students (and their parents) will take time - many Saudi people are not even aware of the existence of this sector. Government recognition has been halting and financial suppor t has been limited (though increasing), as will be seen in detail in Chapter 10. Some of the new private higher education institutions are growing rapidly --far beyond expectation. The College of Business Administration in Jeddah, for example, began with 200 students in 2000, and now has 81 nearly 4000 students. Its Board projects an enrolment of up to 10,000 within a decade. As the public develops greater awareness of the value of these new institutions, demand will increase. Second, if these institutions do, in fact, produce a higher quality of education, with students better prepared for the world of work, that too will increase demand. In this regard, my study intends to document the perceptions of those currently involved in and with Saudi private highe r education --students, administration, government and the labour market. It is also hoped that the findings of this thesis may reveal the strength s and weakness es of private higher education institutions and what can be done to increase the competitiveness of this sector in the future. Arab makes the case that Saudi private education will be necessary to meet some part of the demand gap.

It is hoped that higher education in the private sector may be able to expand at a much greater rate than the public sector has over the last thirty years. As presented in Table 8 below, the number of private universities has been steadily increasing - from 4 private colleges in 2000 to 18 private colleges and 9 private universities in 2010. 82 Table 8: Saudi Private Higher Education Institutions 2000-2012 Private Higher Education Instituion Location Teaching started Gender 1 King Abdullah University for Science and Technology Jeddah 2009/2010 Mixed education 2 Prince Sultan University Riyadh 2000/2001 Male/Female 3 Arab Open University Riyadh, Jeddah, 2003/2004 Male/Female 4 Prince Mohamed bin Fahd University Al Khobar 2007/2008 Male/Female 5 Alfaisal University Riyadh 2008/2009 Riyadh 2004/2005 Male/Female 7 Effat University Jeddah 2000/2001 Female 8 Dar Al Uloom University Riyadh 2009/2010 Male/Female 9 Fahad Bin Sultan University Tabuk 2006/2007 Male/ Female 10 Dar Al - Hekma College Jeddah 2000/2001 Female 11 Prince Sultan College for Tourism and Business Abha 2000/2001 Male 12 Albaha Private College of Science Al Baha 2000/2001 Male/Female 13 College of Business Administration Jeddah 2004/2005 Male/Female 14 Soliman Fakeeh College for Science and Nursing Jeddah 2004/2005 Male/Female 15 Riyadh College of Dentistry Riyadh 2004/2005 Male/Female 16 Ibn Sina National College for Medical studies Jeddah 2005/2006 Male/Female 17 Qassim Private College Qassim 2006/2007 Male/Female 18 Prince Sultan College for Tourism and Management Jeddah 2007/2008 Male/Female 19 Batterjee Medical College Jeddah 2007/2008 Male/Female 20 Saad College of Nursing and Allied Health Sciences Al-khobar 2007/2008 Male/Female 21 Arriyadah college of Medical Sciences Jeddah 2007/2008 Male/Female 22 Almarefah College for Science and Technology Riyadh 2009/2010 Male/Female 23 Buraydah college for Applied medical Sciences Buraydah 2009/2010 Male/Female 24 Mohammed Al Mani College for Medical Sciences Al Khobar 2009/2010 Male/Female 25 Global colleges Riyadh 2009/2010 Male/Female 26 Al-Farabi Dentistry College Riyadh 2009/2010 Graduate College Riyadh 2010/2011 Male/Female 28 Al-Ghad International Medical Science colleges Riyadh, Jeddah, Qassim, Tabuk, Najran \\Al-Madinah, Hafr Al Male/Female Source: Ministry of Higher Education (2012a) 83 In term s of geographic locations, the distribution of Saudi private universities is noticeably uneven - they are more likely to be found in major cities of the country (MOHE, 2009, p.83).

With regard to gender, all private universities serve both genders but on separate campuses with three exceptions. Two private institutions in the city of Jeddah --namely, Effat University and Dar Al -Hekma University --accept women only. King Abdulla h University of Science and Technology accepts both men and women students who attend classes together on one campus. Enrolment in the Saudi Private Sector In absolute numbers, the number of institutions in the private sector appears to be higher than that of the public sector, 27 for the former and 21 for the latter. However, such numbers do not reveal the number of colleges within each university.

As Table 9 above demonstrates, private education accounts for only 3.49% of total enrolment . Enrolment in private higher education are even lower than that in technical colleges, which constitute 9.28% of total enrolment and even slightly less than that of community colleges which constitute 3.94% of enrolment (MOHE, 2009). Interestingly, while the number of female students exceeds male students in the public sector, the situation is reversed in the private sector. In the private sector, male enrolment surpasses female enrolment by 2% --51% male students and 49% female students. In the public sector there are 45.3% male students and 54.7% female students. 0RUHRYHU\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u00b7V\u0003 enrolment share in the KSA is very low compared to other countries in East Asia or Eastern Europe where the average enrolment rate for private higher education is 70% for the former and around 30% for the latter. However, only limited data on private sector enrolment in the GCC and other Arab countries are available to compare with that of the KSA. According to a UNESCO report (2009) on higher education institutions in the Arab world, compared to other GCC countries Saudi Arabia are behind the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain in the number of its private sector universities: the UAE has 55 private universities, Bahrain has 13, and KSA has 9. However, this report did not count existing private colleges, which would reflect a different view about the size of the private sector if included.

These King Abdul lah scholarships -- described previous ly in the chapter--benefited over 80,000 students between 2005 and 2010 (MOHE, 2010). Table 11 below documents that the number of Saudis studying abroad on scholarships (6913) is only slightly more than those studying abroad at their own expense (6745). Table 11: Enrolled students Studying Abroad 2009 Country Scholarships Self-Support Total Rates (%) Male Female Male Female Male Female Arab Countries 8468 2878 Ministry of Higher Education (2009, p.148) Conclusion In this chapter, I carried out a survey of the general education system and also the development of higher education in the KSA. The Saudi education system presents its own series of challenges to the Kingdom. Education began over a century ago in small, local religious schools. The first public system was established under Ottoman rule with instructions in Turkish. By the 1950s, there was still no organised curriculum. It was difficult to recruit qualified teachers. Conservative religious forces blocked th e use of foreign educational resources. As a result, there was a delay by the Government in curriculum development and the updating of older textbooks. The first public university did not open until 1957. By 1980, there were six new public universities, but no other new ones were established until 2009. With steady population growth, the higher education system has barely expanded over 30 years. This has created the greatest challenge of all for higher education \u00b3a lack of 88 capacity. In 2009 \u00b210, 62% of stu dents attempting to enrol in higher education failed to obtain admission. It is estimated that by 2030 this gap will increase to such an extent that 67% of students who apply will not be admitted. Another significant factor driving this heightened demand w as the growth in oil revenues over the last 40 years. This has led to changing social attitudes: young Saudis saw education as vital to well -paid employment, social prestige, and marriage. Demand was also stimulated by public higher education being tuition -charge free and with the Government paying a stipend of $250 per month. This education was open to all, regardless of academic performance. Clearly, capacity is an important issue in the Saudi higher education system. Therefore, private higher education is necessary in Saudi Arabia, and there is no question that private higher education is to some extent providing wider access to higher education. However, the share of the private sector in the total enrolment is very low. This is because the sector is st ill in its early stages of development. Its public recognition has yet to be increased. Another possible reason is the financial burden which it imposes upon students . Public higher education remains free for all but students in the private sector have onl y limited access to scholarships. Therefore, at this moment the first assumption regarding the capacity does not apply to the Saudi context. I shall approach a discussion of this point in a later chapter with reference to my empirical data. But now I shall move on to the methodology of empirical work. 89 Chapter 5 Research methodology Introduction The discussion in this chapter mainly applies to the empirical part of this research. Data collected from my fieldwork is used in Parts III and IV of this study. In the following sections, I elaborate the rationale for the empirical part of this research. I also explain how the study was conducted, as well as how and why the participants and survey site were chosen. Data collection methods \u00b3the interview process \u00b3are presented in detail, as are the data analysis procedures. Research issues such as validity, reliability, and ethical considerations are discussed, again with reference to the literature in the field. The purpose of my fieldwork has been to explore pr ivate higher education in Saudi Arabia. It intended to examine the emergence of the private sector of higher education through the perceptions of stakeholders. Therefore, the principal research method used within the study has been that of interviews with stakeholders. The themes and topics covered in Parts III and IV are derived from the views and opinions of my interviewees. I believe an empirical study like this will help us understand the nature of the private higher education sector and will contribute in answering my research question s. Research Paradigm The design of this study depended on the paradigm adopted. Lawson and Garrod \u0015\u0013\u0013\u0016 \u0003GHILQH\u0003\u00b4UHVHDUFK\u0003SDUDGLJP\u00b5\u0003DV\u0003EHLQJ\u0003D\u0003VHW\u0003RI\u0003LGHDV\u0003DQG\u0003EHOLHIV\u0003ZKLFK\u0003GHILQH\u0003 existing knowledge and the nature of the problems to be investigated, orient the appropriate methods of investigation and the way in which the findings should be analysed a nd interpreted. According to c onstructivism) (Cohen et al., 2011). While the former approaches state that reality is objectively measurable through a collection of quantitative data drawn from the observable world which is being studied (Denzin & Lincolin , 2005), the latter establishes WKDW\u0003\u00b6PXOWLSOH\u0003UHDOLWLHV\u00b7\u0003GR\u0003QRW\u0003H[LVW\u0003REMHFWLYHO\\\u0003EXW\u0003 are actively constructed by people. This individual and unique nature of realities needs to be examined through the eyes of participants rather than researchers (Cohen et al., 2011). The study approa ches its investigation of Saudi private higher education from an interpretive paradigm. This researcher would argue that the interpretative paradigm is EHWWHU\u0003VXLWHG\u0003WR\u0003WKLV\u0003SXUSRVH\u0003UDWKHU\u0003WKDQ\u0003\u00b4SRVLWLYLVW\u00b5\u0003DQG\u0003SRVW\u0003SRVLWLYLVWV\u00b5\u0003SDUDGLJPV\u0003DV\u0003 the last two paradigms state that the social world is not any different from the natural world. This led those schools of thought to believe that both worlds can be studied in the same way (M erttens, 2010). The latter two paradigms are inconsistent with the purpose o f this thesis because they imply that social science should be understood in relation to laws parallel to natural science, laws from which generalizations can be made (Denzin& Lincolin;2005 ). Contrarily, a qualitative/interpretative approach contradicts the assumption that human behaviour can be governed by universal laws (Pring, 2000). An interpretive paradigm tends to suppose a relativist ontology (there are multiple realities), a subjectivist Lincoln; 2000, p.21). This research is primarily concerned with the understanding of individuals rather than testing or verifying general law.

If a quantitative approach had been used, I would not have obtained the same rich data the qualitative approach provides. A quantitative survey requires the researcher to have considerable knowledge of the subject matter so as to be able to develop variables that can be examined throu gh quantitative methods like surveys. Themes and concepts that emerge from this qualitative study could be later examined quantitatively; they could form variables for later investigation. The different views expressed and issues raised by stakeholders in interviews could be analysed later by quantitative methods. The qualitative research approach used for this study is concerned more with depth of information about the sector rather than breadth.

Jeddah is a city that has its own significance because of its strategic location. Jeddah has always been the first to establish private educational institutions in the Kingdom. The first p rivate primary school established in the country was in the city of Jeddah, as was the first private higher education institution --the King Abdul Aziz University --later to become a public institution. Again, when the door was opened for the second time for private higher education, the first private institution established was in the city of Jeddah. Cost, time, and convenience were other factors considered when planning for the sample of the study (Cohen et al., 2000). Coming from the city of Jeddah and considering the three factors suggested above motivated me as the researcher to select 92 the participants from this urban area. In addition, Jeddah, together with the city of Riyadh, has the highest number of private higher education institutions. I also thou ght that sampling in one region would not have a major effect on the results as the conditions and context of higher education is similar among the different parts of the country. All higher education institutions operate under the same rules and regulatio ns and there are not many differences between them -- the exception being King Fahad University for Petroleum and Minerals in the Eastern region. However, the case that the participants interviewed here come only from higher institutions of the city of Jeddah might suggest that the background and the particular characteristics of this city DIIHFWV\u0003VWDNHKROGHUV\u00b7\u0003H[SHULHQFHV\u0003UHJDUGLQJ\u0003SULYDWH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0011\u0003)RU\u0003H[DPSOH\u000f\u0003RQH\u0003 particular cultural difference between Jeddah and other parts of the country is tha t Jeddah is a less culturally conservative city. Its citizens --particularly its women --are more open in their attitudes compared to those in other Saudi cities. While believing that Jeddah generally presents a representative sample for the Kingdom, I tri ed to remain sensitive to any elements in the interviews which might reflect the unique qualities of that city. Participants in this study were selected from three private higher education institutions and from the single public university in the city, a s well as employers from the labour market and from the Ministry of Higher Education. Each of the private institutions did not represent two separate case stud ies as the aim was not to compare them. However, SDUWLFLSDQWV\u00b7\u0003UHVSRQVHV\u0003VXJJHVW ed different vie ws between public and private higher education institutions. The reason that the sample was obtained from those three private higher education institutions is that they are the first private institutions established in the city of Jeddah and thus have a hi story and also a number of graduates. Another reason is that, to some extent, I wanted to unify my sample. Thus, I limited my sample to business subjects as the business major is common to all three private higher education institutions. Based on this d ecision, my sample from the public sector was taken only from the College of Business Administration. However, I intentionally interviewed a few students from various other majors to see if they had different perceptions. 93 Sampling Techniques Purposive snowball sampling techniques were used for this study. In purposive sampling, participants are selected to allow the researcher to develop understanding in the area of investigation. The selection of participants in this fashion is based on their relevance to the aim of the research (Mason, 2002). As the aim of this research is to explore and develop an understanding about private higher education in the KSA through the view of its stakeholders, I wanted my sample to include stakeholders from both sectors ( public and private), to involve both genders, to only include undergraduate students and exclude graduate students. Snowball sampling technique is a non -SUREDELOLW\\\u0003 VDPSOLQJ\u0003 PHWKRG\u0003 LQ\u0003 ZKLFK\u0003 \u00b4WKH\u0003 researcher identifies one or more individuals from the popul DWLRQV\u0003RI\u0003LQWHUHVW\u0011\u00b5\u0003\u0003$IWHU\u0003 they have been interviewed, they are used as informants to identify other members of the population (Robson, 2002, p. 265 -266). In other words, participants in the study are recruited according to referrals made by those who we re interviewed before them (Cohen et al., 2000). The pool of participants keeps increasing through this same technique (Vogt, 1999). Adri aans (1992) asserts that if the objectives of a study are mainly explorat ory, qualitative and descriptive, this technique of sampling can be used. While this technique lowers the requirements of research resources, it can however reduce the likelihood that the sample represents a good cross section of the population. That said, however, I requested lists of names of students and employers from private institutions as a starting point. Then the snowballing technique was later applied. M y previous work in a private college allowed me to network with people from other private higher education institutions in the city of Jeddah. Networking was very helpful in recruiting people, especially for my pilot study as almost all stakeholders interviewed were providers of private higher education and those working in administrative positions. 94 Participants in the Study The sample in the study was comprised of the following stakeholders: 1. policymakers from the Ministry of Higher Education, 2. members of the Boards of Trustees of private higher education institutions, 3. faculty and staff from public and private higher educati on institutions, and 4. students and graduates from the three different private universities and the one public university. It was believed that each type of stakeholder could provide relevant information to this study through their own perspectives about private higher education. Their views and experiences could help to construct a better view of private higher education in the city of Jeddah and, to some extent, the country as a whole. I also chose to involve students and graduates of both genders. Howe ver, the sample resulted in a smaller male representation than female due to cultural constraints that restrict male and female interactions, especially in public places. Hence, only a few face -to-face interviews with male participants were carried out th rough previous arrangement. Most of the interviews with men were conducted via telephone. Another reason is that the number of male students is less than the number of female students among the three private institutions selected, only one of which has a male campus. Table 12 below shows the number of participants under each stakeholder category. I had interviewed people from the same private institution while doing the pilot study.

Baker (1994), for example, ex plains how important a pilot study is in examining the appropriateness of a particular instrument of investigation. Van Teijlingen and Hundley (2001) also suggest a number of advantages in conducting a pilot study before the full study. One of the benefits is that it gives the researcher an early warning about possible areas in which the research could fail, or whether suggested research methods are unsuitable and it enables the researcher to deduce whether there are any politics that might influence the co ntinuity of the research. All the highlighted advantages of conducting a pilot study seemed especially appropriate to this research. I did not have any previous experience in conducting this type of research. It was good training for me before conducting the actual study, and the fact that it was only a pilot study made for more relaxed, and less tense interviews. Through the pilot study I became aware that interviews were not simple tasks and were a challenging method for data collection. I realised t he necessity of improving my interviewing skills. Nevertheless, as I listened to the pilot study interviews I sensed that my skills progressively improved. The scarcity of studies available on private higher education in the KSA required me to do a pilo t study for my research to explore the field and to develop a better focus. The pilot study did have an influence on the kind of participants involved in the main study. For the pilot, my sample covered only one type of private higher education stakeholder : faculty and staff. However, I thought, as this study is an exploratory one, I would benefit from a wider perspective of private higher education and to include other stakeholders in my study (policymakers, students, employers). This change required adding questions that address the relation between the labour market and private higher education. 96 Methods of Data Collection Consistent with the interpretive approach employed in this study, interviews were an appropriate technique to allow participants to express their views, perceptions and experiences. Kvale (2009) finds interviews to be \u00b4SDUWLFXODUO\\\u0003VXLWHG\u0003IRU\u0003VWXG\\LQJ\u0003SHRSOH\u00b7V\u0003XQGHUVWDQGLQJ\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003PHDQLQJV\u0003LQ\u0003WKHLU\u0003 lived world, describing their experiences and self - understanding, and clarifying an d HODERUDWLQJ\u0003WKHLU\u0003RZQ\u0003SHUVSHFWLYHV\u0003RQ\u0003WKHLU\u0003OLYHG\u0003ZRUOG\u00b5\u0003\u0003 S\u0011\u0014\u0013\u0018 \u0003 Interviews provide more depth and detailed information than other qualitative methods (Robson, 2002). Using interviews for this study allowed participants to present their views on priva te higher education in the KSA in their own words. The interviews were semi -VWUXFWXUHG\u0003WR\u0003DOORZ\u0003PH\u0003WR\u0003GLJ\u0003GHHSHU\u0003LQWR\u0003SDUWLFLSDQWV\u00b7\u0003YLHZV\u0003 which is an advantage that structured interviews do not have. Indeed, in structured interviews the researcher has to stick to the order of the questions, the wording, even on his or her expressions thus limiting the exploration of the phenomenon of study (Moustakas, 1994). Therefore, Robson (2002) suggests that, the less structured the interview, the more flexibility th e interviewee has in his or her responses. In semi - structured interviews, the interviewer has the flexibility to change the order and the wording of the interview questions (Merriam, 1998). Unstructured interviews were avoided so I could have more contr ol over the data while performing my analysis, especially since I have limited experience in handling data. In unstructured interviews, the researcher has no prepared schedule for the interview but only notes on major areas to be covered (Robson, 2002). This could take the researcher into many directions if the researcher is not expert enough. In addition to interviews, data were also gathered from documents. These included ministerial and governmental reports and websites. Reasons for reviewing documen ts are twofold. First, it is a way to verify data collected from the interviews (data triangulation) (Robson, 2002). Secondly, as Yin (2003) suggests, documents FRPSOHPHQW\u0003JDSV\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003LQWHUYLHZV\u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003FHUWDLQO\\\u0003DSSOLHG\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u00030LQLVWU\\\u00b7V\u0003FDVH\u0003DV\u0003QRW\u0003 much data were gathered through the interview process.

However, this did not mean that they were concerned that I was complying with research protocols or that they were aware of it. Participants took the process of the interview seriously and got greatly involved although they did not carefully examine the consent form. For instance, they tended not to have the patien ce WR\u0003UHDG\u0003WKH\u0003FRQVHQW\u0003IRUP\u0011\u0003\u00037KH\\\u0003ZRXOG\u0003VLPSO\\\u0003VD\\ \u0003\u00b4-XVW\u0003WHOO\u0003PH\u0011\u0003\u0003:KDW\u0003GRHV\u0003WKLV\u0003IRUP\u0003 VD\\\"\u00b5\u0003\u00037KHQ\u0003WKH\\\u0003ZRXOG\u0003VLJQ\u0003LW\u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003DWWLWXGH\u0003ZDV\u0003REVHUYHG\u0003QRW\u0003RQO\\\u0003ZLWK\u0003VWXGHQWV\u000f\u0003EXW\u0003 also with faculty members and staff who were interviewed. As this attitude was prevalent, I decided to first go over the consent form in detail with participants to make sure they were informed about the conditions and then asked them to sign it to ensure protection for the participants and for myself as the researcher. All consent forms were carefully filed. In addition to the individual consent forms, I had to submit institutional consent forms to the institutions to obtain their permission to access their premises for interviewing students, faculty, and staff. Then I had to obtain the informed -consent forms from each participant. No institutional consent forms were used while doing the pilot study as I felt that, as long as I was interviewing only senior officials in the college administration, those who were in charge, then I should not worry about having official approval. Thus, they were provided with only the individual consent forms. As the main study involved other stakeholders, I had then to submit institutional consent forms in DGGLWLRQ\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003LQGLYLGXDO\u0003FRQVHQW\u0003IRUPV\u0003WR\u0003REWDLQ\u0003WKH\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u00b7\u0003SHUP ission to access their premises to interview those other stakeholders. Though my interviews during the pilot study were with the senior administrative staff in those institutions, it did not guarantee easy access for my main field work. I had to contact certain offices in these institutions to obtain institutional approval. Offices were contacted via email to which I had attached the institutional consent form, explaining the nature of my research and the ethical considerations to be taken by me as a researcher. I made several phone calls to these offices to follow up on my request --to no avail. After three weeks, I went to these institutions to talk in person. The source of the delay occurred in two private higher education institutions, not the one I use d to work 99 in. The private university where I previously worked was more helpful, and we proceeded faster. Apparently, the private institutions contacted did not understand the nature of my research. It seems that personnel from these institutions thought that I was evaluating their institutions. I had to reassure them that I was investigating Saudi private higher education as a whole and was not assessing or criticising individual institutions. They tried to compile a list of students and faculty I could interview. I appreciated their efforts, and it was a good starting point, but I did not follow their lists as it would have biased my sample. Interviews were conducted in different ways, depending on the interviewees and their availability. A friendly a nd informal conversational style was used with students and graduates. While interviewing other stakeholders (faculty, staff, and employers), I had to employ a more formal mode. Arranging interview appointments was not an easy task with all levels of stak eholders. Students were busy with their studies, while graduates, employers, faculty and staff were busy with their own work. However, I managed to conduct all the interviews in an appropriate time for the participants. All interviews were conducted face to face, except seven which were telephone interviews, and one which was a written interview. Telephone interviews involved some male participants (students and graduates) as there was difficulty involved in meeting with them alone in public. Gender se paration in Saudi society is mandatory. This tool was a good alternative especially with male students from the public sector. With regard to the consent form, the context was explained in full to the participants. All telephone participants found such ex planations to be sufficient and none asked for the material to be emailed to them for examination. Face -to-face meetings with male participants took place either in the private higher education institutions to which I had DFFHVV\u0003RU\u0003DW\u0003WKH\u0003HPSOR\\HUV\u00b7\u0003RIILF es. This contrasted with public institutions in which I was denied access because of religious reasons. Although there are ways for women to get access to these places, the procedure is extremely complicated, which makes this option almost impossible. In addition to the social constraints I faced when interviewing male participants, there was a political obstacle. I was not allowed to do telephone interviews with employees of 100 the Ministry of Higher Education. After waiting for a long time to conduct a telephone interview with a representative of the Ministry, on the agreed day he unexpectedly refused to be interviewed. He explained that such information is sensitive and that it would represent the views of the Ministry. He requested written questions. I wondered what kind of discussion this participant expected, if the research topic and consent form were to be sent in advance to his secretary at the Ministry. A written form of the interview questions was sent via email. I then had to wait many months, asking repeatedly for a response before this person from the Ministry responded electronically to the interview questions. I was pleased at least to receive any response from the Ministry. Nevertheless, there were points that needed further elaboration, b ut no reply was received. Thus, I was forced to resort to Ministry documents, publications, and websites to analyse the Government \u00b7V\u0003YLHZ\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003PDWWHU\u0011\u0003 Interview Schedules and Procedures Four different interview schedules were used for this study, on e for each category of stakeholder: students and graduates, faculty and staff of higher education institutions, employers and the Government sector represented by the Ministry of Higher Education and other government officials (see Appendix 3 for intervie w schedules). In particular, students and graduates were asked the same questions, with the exception that graduates were asked about their current jobs and the time they had waited before getting their first job. The interview schedules provided a frame work for eliciting the data needed to H[DPLQH\u0003HDFK\u0003VWDNHKROGHU\u00b7V\u0003SHUFHSWLRQV\u0003RI\u0003SULYDWH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0011\u0003 Before starting any interview, I introduced myself and explained the purpose of my research. During the interview I was concerned with providing a re laxed environment for my participants. The duration of each interview was, on average, one hour. All interviews were tape -recorded, and handwritten notes were also taken. For each interview, a copy of the interview schedule was printed with a space und er each theme to be covered for note taking or to pencil in further elaborations needed from the interviewee. These points and comments were very helpful for later interviews. Notes regarding the sequence of the questions or about which questions should b e asked were also written after the interviews. 101 Considering the exploratory nature of my study, interview questions were broad in nature so as not to direct my interviews toward any particular view. As the interview schedules were semi -structured, the s equence of the questions varied among interviewees but all were within the same frame. All interviews were mainly conducted in Arabic, and occasionally in English. Only two interviews --with foreign instructors --were conducted completely in English. I ha d learnt an important lesson from my pilot study --when participants are interviewed in English, they become less elaborative and tend to provide short answers. While conducting the pilot study, all participants were given the freedom to reply to my questio ns in either language, Arabic or English. Few insisted on using English; but, unfortunately, for those who did, it resulted in poorer quality interviews compared to those conducted in Arabic. Nevertheless, it was necessary for my main study to conduct in terviews in English with the foreign instructors interviewed as they do not speak Arabic. An unusual thing occurred while interviewing students from private higher education institutions. I intended to ask questions in Arabic, but the majority of students were answering in English. If the whole reply was not in English, most of the words were, even from those who were not fluent in English. A possible explanation of this behaviour is that in a country like Saudi Arabia, there is this connection between the use of English and the sense of social class. People tend to use English as a sign of social privilege or prestige as will be more fully discussed in Chapter 9. The flow and smoothness of the interviews were a major concern for me. There were PDQ\\\u0003WLPHV\u0003ZKHQ\u0003SDUWLFLSDQWV\u00b7\u0003DQVZHUV\u0003ZHUH\u0003UHODWHG\u0003WR\u0003RWKHU\u0003TXHVWLRQV\u0003WKDW\u0003,\u0003ZDV\u0003JRLQJ\u0003 to ask later. In that case I had only to prompt and ask for elaboration of the point.

In a few cases, listening to my previous interviews suggested that I probe for a particular question next time. Robson (2002) explains the benefit of probing: \u00b4Probes help you manage the conversation by regulating the length of answers and degree of details, clarifying unclear sentences or phrases, filling in the missing steps DQG\u0003NHHSLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003FRQYHUVDWLRQ\u0003RQ\u0003WRSLF\u0011\u00b5\u0003 S\u0011\u0014\u0019\u0017 \u0011\u0003 102 I realised the value of semi-structured interviews for probing, something that structured questionnaires lack , as Robson (2002) has noted.

Lico ln and Guba (1985) and Maxwell (1996), for example, suggest that interviewing and analysing data are to be integrated so each informs the other. Seidman (2006), on the other hand, suggests avoiding in -depth analysis until all inter views are conducted to avoid imposition of views from one participant to another. As a researcher, I think I hold a position between these two views. I was not doing full transcription and analysis of my data while I was in the field for my interviews. At the beginning, I used to listen to the interviews and put down ideas that I felt were relevant to my research questions. I thought that doing so was a good substitute for transcribing the whole interview.

Thematic analysis is a technique usually used in grounded theory; however, according Braun and Clarke (2006) thematic analysis is a method that involves the generation and application of codes to data, and the identification, analysis and report of patterns (themes). Thematic analysis involves transcribing the data, coding, generating, and categorising themes. My analysis involv ed six stages suggested by Braun and Clarke (2006). Before I proceeded with the six stages, I selected several interviews from each category of the stakeholders I interviewed. As I did the detail ed transcription myself, I realised that some interviews were more comprehensive, more elaborative than others. 7KXV\u0003,\u0003VWDUWHG\u0003P\\\u0003DQDO\\VLV\u0003ZLWK\u0003WKRVH\u0003VHOHFWHG\u0011\u0003%UDXQW\u0003DQG\u0003&ODUN\u00b7V\u0003VL[\u0003VWDJHV\u0003DUH 104 Phase Description of the process 1.Familiarising yourself with your data: 2.Generating initial codes: 3.

Source: Braun and Clarke( 2006, p.87) Transcription and Translation I transcribed the interviews in full, analysed them in Arabic, and then translated into English only those which would later be later used in the research. My decision was based on my experience with data collected for the pilot study. Although I am compet ent in both Arabic and English, I did realise that a more accurate meaning was achievable when analysing the data in Arabic first. The decision to analyse the data in Arabic had the disadvantage of not allowing the use of specialised software packages for data analysis. I did not have access to any software which deals with Arabic while conducting this study. Although Robson (2002) highlights the limitation of analysing data manually, especially for a large sample, encouraging the use of software 105 applicat ions, I did not find analysing data manually to be burdensome, as my sample size was relatively manageable. Coding, Themes and Sub -themes By the time I finished conducting the interviews and transcribing the data, I had in the back of my mind a genera l idea of some of the major themes. Nevertheless, I wanted to dig deeper for important themes or ideas that might have been omitted by me unintentionally. I then developed codes to help me organise the themes and ideas that HPHUJHG\u0011\u0003 \u0003&RGLQJ\u0003 PHDQV\u0003 \u00b4QDPLQJ\u0003 V egments categorizes, VXPPDUL]HV\u0003DQG\u0003DFFRXQWV\u0003IRU\u0003HDFK\u0003SLHFH\u0003RI\u0003GDWD\u00b5\u0003 &RKHQ\u0003HW\u0003DO\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014\u0014 \u0011\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003$QRWKHU\u0003 LPSRUWDQW\u0003WKLQJ\u0003WKDW\u0003FRGLQJ\u0003KHOSHG\u0003DFKLHYH\u0003ZDV\u0003WR\u0003SD\\\u0003PRUH\u0003DWWHQWLRQ\u0003WR\u0003SHRSOH\u00b7V\u0003ZRUGV\u0003 and highlight supportive codes. As this study adopted an approach that was not positivist, themes were developed inductively and not deductively. In another way I was keen to identify patterns in the GDWD\u0003WR\u0003JHQHUDWH\u0003IXUWKHU\u0003WKHPHV\u0011\u0003,QGXFWLYH\u0003DQDO\\VLV\u0003LV\u0003\u00b4D\u0003SURFHVV\u0003RI\u0003FRGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003GDWD\u0003 without try ing to fit into a pre -existing coding frame or the researcher ana lytical SUHFRQFHSWLRQ\u00b5\u0003 %UDXQ & Clarke, 2006, p. 83). According to Robson (2002) and Strauss and Corbin (19 90), qualitative coding directs the researcher to new areas that were not considere d when the research idea was initially proposed. For coding, I applied old techniques used for data analysis, such as the use of different colours to highlight different codes. I then copied and pasted relevant codes and categorised them under different t hemes as will be explained in the following section. 7KLV\u0003FRGLQJ\u0003FDQ\u0003EH\u0003XQGHUVWRRG\u0003DV\u0003D\u0003\u00b4ILUVW\u0003OHYHO\u0003RI\u0003FRGLQJ\u00b5\u0003 0LOHV\u0003 \u0003+XEHUPDQ\u000f\u0003\u0014 \u0017 \u0003 since I was summarizing segments of data. After doing the first level of coding, codes were then grouped into broad er themes %UDXQ\u0003 \u0003&ODUNH\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0019 \u0011\u00037KLV\u0003LV\u0003UHIHUUHG\u0003WR\u0003DV\u0003\u00b4SDWWHUQ\u0003FRGLQJ\u00b5\u0003 0LOHV\u0003 \u0003+XEHUPDQ\u000f\u0003 1994). Pattern coding is a meta -level of coding and has the advantage importance of information provided to the research question being investigate d. After identifying themes, I started with a higher level analysis. Miles and Huberman (1994)suggest coding and identifying themes in the data corresponding to a primary level of analysis, but higher ones should be carried out. To facilitate this proce ss these authors suggest displaying the data in a manageable form. To address this purpose, I entered the data on thematic maps (Cohen et al., 2011; Miles & Huberman, 1994) EHFDXVH\u0003WKH\\\u0003DUH\u0003JRRG\u0003IRU\u0003\u00b4H[SORUDWRU\\\u0003H\\HEDOOLQJ\u00b5\u00030LOHV\u0003 \u0003+XEHUPDQ\u000f\u0014 \u0017\u000fS\u0011\u0003 \u0016 \u0011\u0003\u0003 Themes emerged include the following: 1) English as a medium of Instruction 2) Admission requirement with sub -themes: elites, underachievers, and non Saudi nationals 3) Subjects of studies offered 4) Teaching learning, assessment, and extracurricular activities 5) Relevance to the labour market with sub -themes: practical class assignments and VWUXFWXUHG\u000f\u0003ZRUN\u0003H[SHULHQFH\u000f\u0003RWKHU\u0003VNLOOV\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003JUDGXDWHV\u00b7\u0003SURIHVVLRQDOLVP\u0003 6) Private higher education and the state with sub -themes: the reluctant state, the controlling state, a nd the supportive state. In further analysis of the data I organised these topics into the current format of this thesis. Having all the data displayed on maps I started to look for further meanings and to link them es back to the research questions. A fter identifying my themes and subthemes, I began a descriptive analysis of my data. I was putting quotes, developing story and establishing coherence between themes and their identified subthemes and looking for consistency and/or discrepancies, if any, among the same category of stakeholders or among different categories. From this descriptive analytical account of my data, I moved to the interpretive level by trying to discover meanings embedded in these data. Through the analysis of interview data, I believe a mosaic emerged presenting a detailed, nuanced, and multifaceted view of a newly emerging field of education. The analysis of the interviews produced several recurring general themes with various sub -themes which will be presented in the followi ng chapters. It is unavoidable that some of these themes overlap to some extent. Themes discussed are supported with interview quotes that are most representative of overall views, giving consideration to all viewpoints to insure neutrality and to avoid any bias. 107 6RPH\u0003LQWHUYLHZHHV\u0003DUH\u0003TXRWHG\u0003PRUH\u0003WKDQ\u0003RQFH\u0003WKURXJKRXW\u0003WKH\u0003FKDSWHUV\u0011\u0003\u0003,QWHUYLHZHHV\u00b7\u0003 anonymity was respected. In addition, I have whether they are students, graduates, faculty members, employers, or government officials. Other than employers a nd governments officials, the kind of sector (public or private) for each interviewee quoted is also identified. My use of the qualitative interview approach allowed me to investigate a new field and to gain a sense of how this field appears to those who a re part of it and who are shaping it as it emerges. There definitely was a sense of discovery, energy and even excitement about this development process that I hope the quoted material to interrogate data collected on private higher education in the KSA. While this study includes some factual data on Saudi private higher education that can be analysed in terms of Ge LJHU\u00b7V\u0003WKUHH\u0003IXQFWLRQV\u0003 this still tells us little about the actual operation of this sector. Thus, involving those who are experiencing Saudi private higher education should provide a wider, more detailed perspective on the system . Validity and Reliabil ity Rigor in a study comes from the validity of the research, and the reliability of the findings (Trochim & Donnelly, 2006). Initially, reliability and validity are both measures used in quantitative research but are also now used as quality criteria in qualitative research (King & Horrocks, 2010; Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Robson, 2002; Silverman, 2001). Validity is a concept used in quantitative research as a powerful source quantitative research is about the consistency in the research findings, the term is also used for qualitative studies (Creswell, 2003), and defined topic of much debate. King and Horrocks (2 010) explain that there are three positions toward using the quality criteria of validity and reliability in quantitative research. One position supports the use of the same measures; the second suggests other measures are to be considered to ensure qualit y criteria for qualitative research. The third position refuses any criteria to be applicable for qualitative research. Cohen et al (2007) listed 18 types of criteria for validity. Nevertheless, they suggested that not all of them need to be met in one pi HFH\u0003RI\u0003UHVHDUFK\u000f\u0003EXW\u0003UDWKHU\u0003WKDW\u0003\u00b4WKH\u0003UHVHDUFKHU\u0003QHHGV\u0003 WR\u0003ORFDWH\u0003GLVFXVVLRQ\u0003RI\u0003YDOLGLW\\\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003UHVHDUFK\u0003SDUDGLJP\u0003WKDW\u0003LV\u0003EHLQJ\u0003XVHG\u00b5\u0003 S\u0011\u0014\u0016\u0017 \u0011 Healy and Perry (2000) suggest that these two terms should be evaluated according to the type of paradigm (i. e.,quantitative or qualitative) through which the Horrocks;2010). 0D[ZHOO\u0003 \u0014 \u0015 \u0003DUJXHV\u0003DJDLQVW\u0003XVLQJ\u0003\u00b4YDOLGLW\\\u00b5\u0003DV\u0003D\u0003FULWHULRQ\u0003IRU\u0003TXDOLWDWLYH\u0003UHVHDUFK\u0003DQG\u0003 rather found authenticity and understanding to be more appropriate. Trustworthiness of qualitative research is anoth er measure suggested to be equivalent to validity and reliability that can be used to measure truth in qualitative research (Lincoln & Cuba; 1985). There is, as yet, no consensus among scholars about the quality criteria to be used for qualitative research with regard to validity and reliability measures. Considering that all qualitative study has a margin of subjectivity and bias I tried to find a balance between my influence as a researcher and the internal consistency of the process (Denscombe , 1998). I tried to be very reflective during the data collection stage. In my particular case, I worked in one of the private higher education institutions where I interviewed some participants. This situation might suggest that I have presuppositions re garding private higher education but also that some of the interviewees might feel some caution in giving their answers. To enhance the validity of the interviews, I was intentionally trying to be open during the interviews, and I was inviting my interview ees to feel free in responding. In this sense, I followed recommendations from Arksey and Knight (1999) about building rapport in my interviews. I gave the participants the scope to express the way they see things, inviting their trust and openness. I did this to ensure that the interpretation of the data emerges from the analysis rather than from my imposing a previous framework or meanings thus 109 HQVXULQJ\u0003\u00b4LQWHUSUHWLYH\u0003YDOLGLW\\\u00b5\u0003 0D[ZHOO\u000f\u0003\u0014 \u0015 \u0011\u0003\u0003,Q\u0003DGGLWLRQ\u000f\u0003,\u0003DWWHPSWHG\u0003WR\u0003HQVXUH\u0003 what Maxwell (1992) calls \u00b4GHVFULSWLRQ\u0003YDOLGLW\\\u00b5\u0003 UHODWHG\u0003 GHVFULSWLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003 accuracy of the data gathered. To avoid incompleteness of the data gathered, I followed two techniques suggested by Robson (2002) such as audio -taping and full -transcribing of all my interviews. I n this way I tried to address the validity of the data collected in order to deal with comprehensive data, and to avoid that data being distorted (Cohen et al, 2007). To ensure the internal validity of a qualitative study there are several techniques tha t can be used such as triangulation, member -checking, long term observation, and peer examinations (Merriam, 200 9). Given the nature of my study and time restriction, triangulation was the only technique used. In addition, distance was another factor which prevented me from getting participants to validate the transcribed interviews. Interviews were transcribed in the UK. Thus, it was not easy to communicate with the participants who reside in Saudi Arabia. Patton (2002) discusses four types of triangula tion: data triangulation, theory triangulation, and methodological triangulation. Data triangulation is the only type employed in this study. In my research I triangulated the data through gathering information from interview s and documents. Through triangulation, a better picture can be achieved taking into consideration several levels of the phenomenon being studied (De Vaus, 2001). Thus I also considered ensuring the validity of data provided by using different levels of stakeholders --students, graduates, faculty members, and employers. \u00b45HOLDELOLW\\\u00b5\u0003LV\u0003WUDGLWLRQDOO\\\u0003XQGHUVWRRG\u0003DV\u0003D\u0003PHDVXUHPHQW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003FRQVLVWHQF\\\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003GDWD\u0003 with the research background and is also a measurement of the suitability of t he data for analysis ( Saunders et al. , 2009).

(See Appendix 4). The kind of relationship between the interviewer and the participants (Ramazanoglu & Holland, 2002) was clarified in the consent form. The consent form provided to the participants clarifies the nature of the research as well as the extent of the participants \u00b7\u0003 involvement so they are aware of their role in the research. 111 The consent form provided to the participants assured them that their contributions to the research would be anonymous. Respecting institutional anonymity, I avoided providing background inf ormation about institutions involved in the study as it would provide the local reader with enough information to identify the institution in question. Due to the relatively small size of the Saudi higher education sector and especially its private sector , which has only recently emerged, it might have easily led to identifying the institution under discussion. This could eventually lead to identifying respondents, especially at the management level because of the limited number of people working given the right to withdraw from the study at any time. 112 Conclusion In this chapter, I elaborate the research methodology for the empirical part of thi s study. The inadequacies of a quantitative approach have been discussed above. Based on the lack of objective information surrounding my topic \u00b3Saudi private higher education \u00b3a qualitative interpretive method was selected for exploratory purposes. It is believed that this will yield richer data and greater access to what Creswell (200 3) calls \u00b4SDUWLFLSDQWV\u00b7\u0003PHDQLQJV\u00b5\u0011\u0003\u0003 My study is limited in scope to three private higher education institutions and one public one, and to business majors in those institutio ns. I lacked the time and resources to conduct a more extensive study. Nevertheless, it is believed that the qualitative approach employed (with over one hundred stakeholders) will yield greater depth and detail than a large-scale quantitative survey might have produced. Great care was taken with the interview process, ethically and procedurally. Detailed thematic mapping of the interview data yielded themes and subthemes which I believe are representative of the views of the study sample as a whole. But part of the benefits of this approach is that contradictory views as well as ambiguous perceptions are also in evidence in the results. The next five chapters document the use of this research method and, it is hoped, provide greater understanding of a ne w field of social interaction \u00b3Saudi private higher education. 113 PART III The Institutional Dimension ,Q\u0003WKLV\u0003SDUW\u000f\u0003,\u0003VKDOO\u0003H[DPLQH\u0003VWDNHKROGHUV\u00b7\u0003SHUFHSWLRQV\u0003RQ\u0003SULYDWH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003LQ\u0003 comparison to the public sector, through three different phases of private higher education provision: 1) the entry point, 2) the experience stage, and 3) the exit to th e job market.

This is to add to our understanding about the nature of the sector and the impact which this has on the Saudi higher education system. Admission requirements Private higher education is distinguished from the public sector by its admission requirements. As was discussed earlier in Chapter 2, the charge of a tuition fee is the most noticeable difference between public and private higher education institutions in Saudi Arabia \u00b2 public highe r education is free for all students, but private higher education usually means a considerable financial outlay . Consequently, this has an impact upon the student groups who attend these institutions. Another IDFWRU\u0003WKDW\u0003LQIOXHQFHV\u0003VWXGHQW\u00b7V\u0003FKRLFH\u0003EHWZH en the two sectors is the difference in their admission standards. Admission to public higher education in Saudi Arabia is determined by their Grade Point Average (GPA) - a combination of secondary school grades and a series of standardised tests. The subj ects available to applicants are determined by their results Science subjects in particular are highly competitive, while humanity subjects such as literature and business studies have lower academic requirements. In the private sector, however, the admiss ion requirements are less strict. Students who fail to achieve the scores necessary for public universities may therefore be able to pursue their studies in a private institution. As a consequence, private institutions can sometimes be understood as primar ily for students who are economically advantaged but less competent in academic performance. The sections below examine the extents to which these distinct criteria of the private sector address limitations in the public sector of higher education. 115 I am lo oking at two assumptions about student groups in private higher education . First, it serves primarily the wealthy , and second, it is the destination for those who are less competent accordingly . The Elites? Or the Underachievers? As discussed earlier in Chapter 2, private higher education in some countries and UHJLRQV\u0003LV\u0003WUDGLWLRQDOO\\\u0003DVVRFLDWHG\u0003ZLWK\u0003\u00b6HOLWLVP\u00b7\u0003 $OWEDFK et al. , 2009; Levy 1986, 2008, \u0015\u0013\u0013 \u0011\u0003\u00b6(OLWH\u00b7\u0003LQ\u0003WKLV\u0003OLWHUDWXUH\u0003UHIHUV\u0003WR\u0003\u00b6DFDGHPLF\u0003HOLWH\u00b7\u0011\u0003+DUYDUG\u00038QLYHUVLW\\\u0003DQ d Yale University are among the most well -known private institutions for academic elites (Altbach et al, 2009).

In their early days, private higher education institutions were primarily destinations for students from the middle and upper social classes. Students of similar social backgrounds were mor e likely to choose the same institution. At that time there was no financial support from the Government, and private institutions themselves offered few scholarships. Naturally, this affected the types of student which the sector attracted. To some extent , the tuition fee level of the institution reflects the social class of its students. Dar Al -Hekma College, for example, when first opened, had the highest level of tuition fees in the city of Jeddah, thus attracting students from the wealthiest background . Although the academic credentials of the college were not clear to society at that time, it was perceived to be prestigious for students to be studying there.

Therefore, there is a marked difference in outlook and attitude in students from the cities. Most of the stud ents in private higher education are city -dwellers, and this difference in experience may be the reason they are not that comfortable with many students in the public universities. It is not a simple question of snobbery or elitism. This is a rather compli cated issue of socio - cultural identities among different social groups in the increasingly stratified society of Saudi Arabia. Some other scholars have address this phenomenon elsewhere (see Yamani, 2000 for instance), and I will not look into this issue i n my thesis. The social class factor has developed some negative perceptions about students in the private sector.

There appeared to be an absence of motivation from both groups of stakeholders. Students from the public sector have also criticised the quality of education they have received, as will be further discussed below. A frequent comment from faculty of both the public and private sectors was concerning the deficiencies of secondary education. Both sectors blamed the general education system for the quality of students coming to them. The quality of secondary schools, in particular, has been a serious issue. Secondary schools have depended on the same obsolete curriculum for many years. The problems in general education were not limited to the curriculum but also to the competence of the teachers. One problem with the teaching profession in the KSA is that the system did not require them to be licensed before teaching. The quality of teaching in general schools was felt to be a basic factor affecting the end -product of general education in the KSA. The Government policy of Saudisation of the professions, including teaching in general education, has contributed to the problem. This process began 15 years ago. Before then, the country depended on 121 instructors from other Arab countries who were, to some extent, better trained. In social terms, the teaching profession was beheld by many to not be a prestigious one. The Non -Saudis The pool of students in private higher education institutions in the KSA is distinct from its public counterpart, which has limited admission for fo reign students. For this study, I interviewed some students and graduates who were non -Saudi nationals. Almost all the foreign students in private institutions are the children of expatriates working in the Kingdom. Opportunities for non -Saudi nationals t o study in the Saudi public higher education sector were possible until the late 1980s, when pressure for admission to the public sector forced a reversal of the policy. The exception to this was the Al -Madinah University in which non -Saudis are admitted t o Islamic studies and courses. This situation disadvantaged expatriates and their children, especially Arabs and other Muslims who traditionally prefer not to send their daughters away to study. This caused many expatriates to leave the Kingdom when their children needed access to higher education . In many cases it was not easy for those children to go back to live in their own countries after spending most of their lives in the KSA. A faculty member who teaches in both sectors explained: \u00b43XEOLF\u0003XQLYHUVLW ies used to admit non -Saudis, but as their numbers passed Saudis, especially in subjects such as science, the pressure on admission into the public sector forced a reversal of this policy.

These international schools are mostly established by embassies to accomm odate their own nationals. In these schools, students are hardly exposed to the Arabic language. Thus, even if the public sector was open for them, their lack of fluency in Arabic would limit their access to public universities, which use Arabic for instru ction. A Pakistani student from a private sector who does not speak Arabic explained: \u00b4%HLQJ\u0003QRQ -Arabs, we really have limited opportunities for higher education here in the KSA.

Instructors find foreign students to be more serious and dedicated and their presence helps to raise the academic standards of the institution. Perhaps this is affected, to a large extent, by the kind of general education which those students received. These international schools do not fall under the control of the Ministry of Education. They have different curricula from those of national public and private ins titutions. An international school in the KSA teaches the same curriculum as 123 used in its own country which is, to some extent, more advanced than those of local Saudi schools with its emphasis on generic skills. In addition to teaching in English, they disFRXUDJH\u0003PHPRULVDWLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003IRFXV\u0003RQ\u0003GHYHORSLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003VWXGHQW\u00b7V\u0003DQDO\\WLFDO\u0003DQG\u0003SUREOHP - solving skills. Assessments in national schools depended on memorisation, with no emphasis on teaching students how to learn or how to search for information.

Again data suggest that the public sector has failed to address the d emand of some groups.

Statistics show that specialisation in the humanities and social sciences represent s 80% of university graduates in education and religious studies (MOHE, 2005). Graduates with such subjects are believed to have saturated the market.

While private instit utions offer subjects provided by the public sector, the private sector has also been entrepreneurial in offering subjects which were neglected by the public sector. Levy (1986a, 2003) provides a comparative analysis on the subjects offered by private and public higher education institutions in Latin America (Levy, 1986a). Cao (2008) also has made deep investigation of the kinds of subjects offered by private and public higher education institutions in China, while Fried et al. (2007) studied European countries, and they all have consistent observation on the kinds of subject offered by private higher education institutions. Levy (2003) explains that newly developed private higher education institutions generally offer subjects which require less financial commitment and more modest facilities. Amral et al. (2007) suggest a resource - dependence theory to be a guiding rule for private higher education institutions. They explained that private higher education institutions tend to offer subjects that are of lo w FRVW\u0003DQG\u0003PHHW\u0003VWXGHQWV\u00b7\u0003DQG\u0003PDUNHW\u0003QHHGV\u000f\u0003DV\u0003WKH\\\u0003GHSHQG\u0003RQ\u0003WXLWLRQV\u0003DQG\u0003IHHV\u0003WDNHQ\u0003 from students for their survival. Levy (1986a, 2003) and Cao (2008) both observed that public institutions offer subjects which are more traditional, while in private institutions subjects of market orientation and a commercial element are offered. I have briefly examined the difference between subjects offered in public and private institutions through the perceptions of the stakeholders. But I do not intend to make a com parison of subjects available in two sectors here. It is, however, an area worth further investigation. The chart provided in Appendix 5 illustrates degree programmes currently being offered by private higher education institutions in the KSA. They cover a wide spectrum, ranging from low -cost to high -FRVW\u0003VXEMHFWV\u0011\u00033ULYDWH\u0003SURYLGHUV\u00b7\u0003LQYHVWPHQWV\u0003LQ\u0003KLJK -cost subjects differ from the norm.

For example, one college started with a complete concentration on business -related subjects. Another concentrated on hospitality and tourism, while three offered subject s in engineering. Other colleges offered mixed courses from many subjects. An example of this is Dar Al-Hekma College in Jeddah, which offers graphic and interior design subjects (the arts); nursing (health sciences); law (political science); special educa tional needs (education); and banking, finance, and information management (business administration). 125 Subjects in the humanities are offered by only three private higher education institutions. One is Effat University, which offers psychology and early ch ildhood development. Another is Dar Al -Hekma College, which offers special education. Dar Al-Uloom University, in Riyadh, offers the two latter subjects. However, the highest concentration is in health sciences such as medicine, pharmaceutical studies, and nursing, which are offered by more than one third of private higher education institutions. Based on my personal observation of and working experience in the private sector, I tend to believe that the degree of specialisation in private higher education institutions, however, is most likely to decrease, as most of the private colleges have become, or are in the process of becoming, universities. The majority of private higher education institutions started as small colleges, and around seven of them have now become universities. A private institution in the KSA is entitled to become a university once it has three or more colleges or more. The main concern is that private institutions may continue to expand and this would result in their being the same as p ublic institutions. Levy (2002) describes the transformation of private institutions to the public model as \u00b4LVRPRUSKLF\u00b5\u0011\u0003 Private higher education LQVWLWXWLRQV\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003 .6$\u0003DUH\u0003 FRQVLVWHQW\u0003ZLWK\u0003/HY\\\u00b7V\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0013\u0016 \u0003 findings, in that they are innovative and in many cases influence changes in their counterparts in the public sector. Private institutions took the lead in establishing colleges which specifically focused on the subject of business administration. Almost none of the public higher education institutions ha d a separate college for this subject. For example, in the KAAU of Jeddah, the subject came under the College of Economics and Administration. Private institutions were the first to allow students to specialise in marketing, banking, finance, human resourc es, logistics, hospitality, tourism, management information systems, and quality management. There was no possibility of such specialisation in the public sector. In the KAAU, for example, during the 1990s students could only study in four areas: public a dministration, business administration, accounting, and economics. However, I recently learned that the KAAU, a public institution, is now offering similar tracks to those that some private institutions are offering. These include management, marketing, ac counting, international business, hospital management, and management information systems. In 2006, two public higher education institutions have introduced additional specialisation s 126 in hospitality and tourism management, namely the KAAU and KSU, after th ey were first offered by Prince Sultan Private College in 2001.

Labour market needs are changing too fast, and market needs are thus in continuous change. Among my interviewees, there were those who had the same opinion and liked the fact that the Government has not spe cified subjects for private institutions to offer but instead left it open.

However, interviewed providers of higher education explained that they base their decision on the kind of subjects they offer by surveying employers, parents, and students. That suggests that private inst itutions address different markets in the kinds of subject they offer. Faculty respondents discussed the importance relevance of subjects to the labour market was a concern for many students interviewed. Interviewed administrators at private institutions also explained that many students, before applying for a specific degree prog ramme, ask whether employment opportunities are available after graduation.

It was interesting to find that some students interviewed considered enrolling in private higher education because of personal interests in particular subjects.

These subjects include: graphic design, architecture, law, special education, and electrical engineering. As we have seen earlier in Chapter 3\u000f\u0003ZRPHQ\u00b7V\u0003LQYROYHPHQW\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003ODERXU\u0003PDUNHW\u0003LV\u0003 limited. The reason is partly the lim ited subjects available to them (Al -Munajjed, 2010; Ramadi, 2005). Student -gender segregation in the public universities has meant that some subjects have not been available for women. Indeed, this is a significant thing in a context where students had lim ited opportunities in the kinds of subject which they could pursue. A student remarked: \u00b4,W\u0003ZDV\u0003H[FLWLQJ\u0003WR\u0003EH\u0003DPRQJ\u0003WKH\u0003ILUVW\u0003WR\u0003VWXG\\\u0003LQ\u0003DUHDV\u0003ZKLFK\u0003ZH\u0003JLUOV\u0003LQ\u00036DXGL\u0003 $UDELD\u0003KDG\u0003QHYHU\u0003LPDJLQHG\u0003RXUVHOYHV\u0003LQ\u0011\u00b5 130 An administrator from the private sector remarked: \u00b4,\u0003FDQ\u0003VHH\u0003D\u0003ORW\u0003RI\u0003GHYHORSPHQW\u0003LQ\u0003ZKDW\u0003ZRPHQ\u0003LQ\u00036DXGL\u0003$UDELD\u0003WKLQN\u0003WKH\\\u0003 can do.

Unless the labour market becomes ready to absorb graduates, the impact of private institutions offering new subjects for women would still be a cha llenge later on in their lives. The fact that women need to be segregated from men in the workplace presents a challenge for employers who do not mind recruiting students. Some respondents showed concern over the employment opportunities for women: \u00b47KHUH is a significant phenomenon with the private institutions, which is that many professions are open to women in Saudi. I really want to work. I decided to choose a major that would ensure my employment, thus I decided HYHQ\u0003PDUNHWLQJ\u0011\u00b5\u0003 A faculty member of a private institution echoed the same concern, but showed some hope: \u00b4$OWKough I have my doubts about where these graduates in architecture will be working, I still feel that because of the fast development in the country, there will EH\u0003DYDLODEOH\u0003SRVLWLRQV\u0003IRU\u0003WKHP\u0003VRRQ\u0011\u00b5 This discrepancy between subjects offered to women and av ailability of jobs in the labour market is similar to the case of the KAAU, when they offered students the option of a business degree when women did not have the opportunities to be in the job market. Many stakeholders clearly perceived the public sector as falling short in its provision of some subjects. My interviewees described these shortfalls as occurring either because subjects were not offered in the public sector at all, as in the case of busine ss specialisations, or because subjects were offered but only with an insufficient number of 131 places, or because subjects were offered but not open to students. The ability of the private sector to fill these gaps in public sector provision was a recurrent theme. 132 Conclusion In this chapter, I looked into the Entry phase concerning private higher education from two perspectives: admission requirements (tuition fees and admission standards) and the subject choices. For the former, private institutions are m ore likely to be dominated by students from a wealthy background, as a tuition fee is charged in the private sector while the public sector remains free for all. There exists a noticeable correlation between VWXGHQWV\u00b7\u0003VRFLDO\u0003EDFNJURXQG\u0003DQG\u0003WKHLU\u0003HQUROPHQW\u0003 in private institutions. Social class plays a role in the private sector as many students have come from upper income groups who can afford the tuition. Many come in search of better quality. There is also a status element involved but students were more c omfortable with those of a similar background. However, this situation has gradually changed with the introduction of scholarships in the private sector, funded by both the Government and the institutions themselves. Private institutions also impose a lowe r admission requirement than the public sector, making it a desirable alternative for those who cannot enrol in a more competitive public sector institution . Students with lower GPAs \u00b3although not necessarily underachievers \u00b3also gain access to higher educa tion in the private sector. The public sector has become very selective because of high demand. While there were HDUO\\\u0003SHUFHSWLRQV\u0003RI\u0003SULYDWH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003DV\u0003EHLQJ\u0003D\u0003SODFH\u0003IRU\u0003\u00b4WKH\u0003HOLWH\u00b5\u0003RU\u0003\u00b4ORZ\u0003 DFKLHYHUV\u000f\u00b5\u0003 \u00b3have also brought stronger academic talents to these new schools. Also, the private sector endorses a more open policy towards non -Saudi students (the children of expatriate workers) offering them opportunities of higher education that are denied to them in the public sector. Non -Saudis thus gain access to higher education even though they are not allowed into the public universities. In terms of the issue of subject choices, my student interviewees tended to perceive private highe r education as offering students access to subjects, especially for women, which they would otherwise be unable to study. Through my research, I came to learn WKDW\u0003RQH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003PDLQ\u0003IDFWRUV\u0003LQIOXHQFLQJ\u0003D\u0003VWXGHQW\u00b7V\u0003GHFLVLRQ\u0003WR\u0003HQURO\u0003LQ\u0003SULYDWH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003 educatio n institutions and not the public has been what kind of subject the student wants to pursue, i.e. the courses and subjects offered. Although there is some overlap between the two, many private sector colleges offer more specialised subjects, particularly i n the field of business studies. In addition, private institutions offer subjects to students which are not available to them in the public sector. 133 Chapter 7 Experiences of Private Higher Education Teaching, Learning, and Beyond Introduction In this chap ter, I shall explore the private sector from a number of dimensions: teaching, learning and assessment, and extracurricular activities. By looking into these aspects of private higher education, I aim to explore the possible reasons behind the establishmen t and development of private higher education in the KSA, with reference to the views and perceptions of those who are most immediately involved in the higher education system. My analysis in this chapter also shows that private higher education, although being distinct in many ways, is not without limitations and challenges. Teaching and learning In general, most of my interviewees, students and faculty members alike, have positive views about the general quality of their private institutions, when comparing them with the local public counterparts. Some respondents were highly critical of the quality in the public sector. For instance, a faculty member at one of the chosen institutions, who is also a graduate of a public university, criticised that p ublic university based on her personal experience. She said, university A \u00b4\u0011\u0011\u0011\u0003LV\u0003OLNH\u0003DQ\u0003ROG\u0003IDFWRU\\\u0003ZKLFK\u0003LV\u0003\u0011\u0011\u0011\u0003SURGXFLQJ\u0003JUDGXDWHV\u0003ZLWK\u0003REVROHWH\u0003VWDQGDUGV\u0011\u0003,I\u0003 I were to work in a private university with the qualification that I gained from (university A), I would have faced a major challenge. There would have been a great gap between my knowledge and what the market requires from me. I was fortunate to be exposed to international education as it prepared me well for my MRE\u0011\u00b5 Here, the interviewee identi fies one of the major problems facing the public sector - a lag between the requirement of a changing market, or in a wider sense, a changing society. She also referred to her exposure to international education, implying that the 134 public sector is lagging behind an international standard, and failing to prepare its students for what is required of them in the real world. In other words, the idea of employability is at play here in her concern of quality. Administrators of private institutions believed the mselves to be providing better quality education than the public sector. A vice dean from the private sector explained: \u00b4WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0003FDQ\u0003WDUJHW\u0003LWV\u0003SDUWLFXODU\u0003QLFKH\u0003JURXS\u0003RI\u0003SHRSOH\u0003WKDW\u0003LW\u0003LV\u0003FDSDEOH\u0003 of serving ...

However, the majority of the interviewees in the chosen public institutions, academics and administrators in particular, claimed that such an impression was only a stereotyped prejudice. Almost all faculty members interviewed from the public sector were positive about the public sect or during the interviews. However, I find it rather difficult to determine whether this widespread positive perception reflected their genuine opinions or was a mere defence of the public sector in which they found themselves. They seemed to have a rather generalised view about the public sector, coloured by their perception of certain subjects such as medicine, which obviously has a higher standard in the public sector.

These include the following: English as a medium of instruction, quality of educational materials, teaching methods used, and extracurricular activities. 137 &ODVV\u00036L]H\u0003DQG\u0003\u00b66SHFLDO\u0003$WWHQWLRQ\u00b7 A noticeable difference between private and public higher education institutions is class size. The impact of class size on the quality of teaching, output and students achievements has been discussed in the literature. Hancock(1996), for example argues that the quali ty of teaching is reduced when classrooms are overcrowded because resources are spread thinly to accommodate larger number s of students. Noble (2000) suggests that it is not feasible for educators to have effective teaching in large classrooms. A study d one by Adeyemi (2008) finds that the quality of output is better in schools with small class sizes than with larger ones. According to McKeachie (198 0): Analysis of research suggests that, in general, large classes are simply not as effective as small cla sses for retention of knowledge, critical thinking, and attitude change. Few instructors are satisfied with the achievement of knowledge if it is not remembered, if the students are unable to use it in solving problems where the knowledge is relevant, or i f the students fail to relate the knowledge to relevant attitudes. If one takes these more basic outcomes of retention [of knowledge],problem solving, and attitude differentiation as criteria of learning, the weight of the evidence clearly favours small cl asses (pp. 182 & 185). While the impact of class size on VWXGHQWV\u00b7 achievement is still under debate (Williams et al., 1985), my interviewees found small class size to have a positive impact on the quality of education they receive. The number of studen ts in private institutions is relatively low. Although the number has been increasing with government scholarships for the private sector, the number of students is still very low compared with the public sector. Arab (2007) has cited a ratio of 16 student s per teacher in private institutions compared with a ratio of 23 students per teacher in the public universities (pp. 74, 75). However, I still think the latter ratio is much lower than currently is the case. I was a student in the public sector and the c lass size averaged 45 students. My interviews with stakeholders from the public sector confirm ed that the ratio was still high. Faculty in private institutions (who came from the public sector) admitted that the size of the class and the number of students were factors which had an effect on the quality of teaching. Instructors in private institutions from the public sector appreciated the effect this has 138 on their teaching methods and assessments. One instructor commented about her experience in the public sector: \u00b4,\u0003XVHG\u0003WR\u0003KDYH\u0003PRUH\u0003WKDQ\u0003D\u0003KXQGUHG\u0003VWXGHQWV\u0003LQ\u0003RQH\u0003VHVVLRQ\u0011\u0003<RX\u0003FDQ\u0003LPDJLQH\u0003 how difficult it was to be able to recognise each student I was teaching.

Clegg et al. find that extracurricular activities include all academic activities which students have out of the classrooms. This includes: paid work, art, drama, music, faith/cultural ac tivities, family, domestic or caring activities, political activity, sports and/or other physical activity, and volunteering (Clegg et al., 2010, p. 618). Extracurricular activities discussed by the interviewees included: international field trips, sports activities, clubs, workshops and seminars, and lectures unrelated to specific courses but which are offered by their colleges and/or arranged by student unions. Data from the interviews conducted suggest that private higher education institutions unders tand the role of extracurricular activities in a much different way from their public counterparts. Participants in this study viewed extracurricular activities as having more emphasis in private higher education institutions. Employers, faculty members , and students in this study perceived that private higher education institutions provide more extracurricular activities than the public sector.

Student - teacher ratios are lower in the private schools, whi ch is appreciated by students and teachers alike. Students also benefit from the greater personal attention in smaller classes. Extracurricular activities in the private schools were understood to be much better than in the public sector. Students are ap preciative that such activities are given greater emphasis.

Discussion of this will involve practical learning, structured work experience, and career centre services. Background As a key regional player in the Middle East economy, Saudi Arabia is investing in the development of its human resources to facilitate a gradual transition away from reliance on its hydrocarbon resources. The Government needs a qualified workforce to compe te in this era of global competitive economy and to replace the great number of foreign workers that the private sector still prefers. This dependence leads to less employment of Saudi citizens. The last two decades have witnessed heavy investment at all l evels of education, which has led to higher numbers of university graduates. The employability of these graduates, however, remains a key challenge facing both the graduates themselves and policymakers. The relatively high unemployment rate among graduate s in the Kingdom has been a VHULRXV\u0003LVVXH\u0003IDFLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003FRXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003JRYHUQPHQW\u0003OHDGHUV\u0003 0LQLVWU\\\u0003RI\u00033ODQQLQJ\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0018 \u0011\u0003,Q\u0003 the past, unemployment was not a serious concern for the Government or the private sector because the vast structure of the public sector abs orbed all university graduates. The public sector used to be the primary destination for higher education graduates. Furthermore, tasks in the public sector were routine and required a minimal level of skills. This guarantee of a public - sector job for all university graduates induced in them a false sense of security, making them less concerned about the kinds of skill they obtained. The Government sector had been the provider of almost all services. 154 However, the public sector has now been challenged by an oversupply of graduates, and it is no longer able to guarantee jobs for all graduates. In its fourth Five -Year Development Plan (19 85), the Government decided to involve the private sector in the development effort and assigned to it the task of acceler ating the employment of Saudi nationals. As was discussed in Chapter 3, the Government HYHQ\u0003LQWURGXFHG\u0003WKH\u0003\u00b66DXGLVDWLRQ\u00b7\u0003SROLF\\\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003\u0014 \u0013V\u0003WR\u0003UHGXFH\u0003UHOLDQFH\u0003RQ\u0003IRUHLJQ\u0003 labour and to increase employment opportunities for Saudis. Prior to the introduction of this policy, the private sector might not have worried about the quality of the Saudi university graduates as employers preferred hiring foreign workers. That preference (Al-Hamid and Jamjoom, 2009 ; Al-Humaid, 2002 ; Al-Khudair, 2001 , Ghaban et al. 2002 ). While the Government is trying to solve the unemployment issue through its policies directed towards the labour market, graduates become better prepared for the labour ma rket, the private sector will continue to be challenged by effectively employing them.

Its application varies among various time periods and national contexts (Hillage & Pollard, 1998). This concept, however, did not become part of higher education policy until the 1990s, most significantly in the UK (York e, 200 6).

Another indicator of institutional employability measures the period between graduation and obtaining a first job. The shorter the period that students have to wait before obtaining the first job, the higher rate of employability the educational institutions have (Harvey et al., 1997). Funds are then allocated among institutions according to their institutional employability. It is worth noting that since their inception Saudi public institutions have not had play in government funding decisions in a European country like the UK was not something considered in the KSA. Each Saud i public institution receives its budget allocation according to proposals submitted to the Ministry of Higher Education. The performance of a public institution thus has no effect on its allocated budget, which highlights the absence of an important motiv e for the institution to perform better.

It is a fact that external factors have an effect on the prosperity of graduates. But it seems that there is still confusion regarding the difference between employment and employability. Higher education institutions vary in the extent to which they are linked to the labour market. However, the literature suggests that private higher education institutions are being proactive in relation to it ( Cao 2008). Levy (1986, 1992, 2003, 2006a ) suggests that meeting market needs (which the public sector f ailed to do) is among the main reasons for the recent expansion in private higher education ZRUOGZLGH\u0011\u00033ULYDWH\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u00b7\u0003 linkage to the labour market is deemed to be important for the legitimacy of these types of institution (Kinser & Levy, 200 6; Slant cheva, 2007; Levy, 2007). Private higher 157 education institutions, especially newly emergent ones, are observed to be distinct in their relation to the labour market (Levy, 1992, 2003, 2006 a, 2009, 2011; Cao, 200 8). This is found to be true even with private institutions which are perceived to be of lesser quality than public ones. Levy (2008, 2011) has even classified these private LQVWLWXWLRQV\u0003WR\u0003EH\u0003\u00b4VHULRXV\u0003GHPDQG -DEVRUELQJ\u00b5\u0003EHFDXVH\u0003RI\u0003WKHLU\u0003RULHQWDWLRQ\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003ODERXU\u0003 market.

Among the characteristics discussed is that the courses offered by private institutions are mostly specialised and aimed mor e towards the job market (Levy, 1986a). This is seen, for example, in studies of Bangladesh (Alam et al., 2007), Georgia ( Sharvashidze, 2005), Poland (Duczmal, 200 5), and Africa (Verghase, 2004), countries in which private higher education offers courses which are purely linked to the job market. Career Services and networking are other employment - related activities observed in private higher education institutions (Levy, 1986 a, 1992, 2003, 2006; Cao, 200 8; Cohen, 2001; Pritchard, 1992; Wolf & Castor, 2001). &DR\u00b7V\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0013 8) study on private higher education thoroughly covers institutional efforts directly linked to the labour mar ket.

While employment outcomes can hardly be accurately investigated in the newly expanding Saudi pr ivate sector, topics which were raised by my interviewees and that have relevance to the employability of the graduates are presented in this chapter. I shall also 158 discuss characteristics and practices of private institutions which are perceived to have studies discuss the relation between higher education institutions and the labour market and distinguish between higher education practices which make those institutions relevant or linked to the labour market (Bernnan, et al., 1996).

The kinds of soft skill s which employers say they need will be discussed later in the chapter. Practical Learning and Structured Work Experience Practical learning is an area in which private institutions manifested their concerns for the career -development of thei r students. Practical learning, as it is discussed in this 161 section, refers to education which takes place through practical class assignments and hands -on projects. These require students to interact with people in their field of work and to apply the theo retical knowledge covered in class. Interestingly, almost all students interviewed from private higher education institutions perceived that knowledge delivered in public institutions is purely theoretical and has no practical application. They believed th at the private system does not impart practical knowledge through its curriculum. This perception was also confirmed by students, graduates, and faculty in the public sector. A student from the private sector remarked: \u00b4,\u0003KDYH\u0003D\u0003IULHQG\u0003ZKR\u0003LV\u0003WDNLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003 same marketing course as mine, but in the public university.

It is worth noting that unlike other countries, where private institutions differentiate themselves by offering technical and vocational degrees (Kruss & Kraak, 2003), private in stitutions in Saudi Arabia only offer university degrees, although they all seem to be with market -orientation . 163 Structured Work Experience In addition to practical classroom projects and assignments, structured work experience is another avenue of prac tical learning particularly Education defines cooperative education as \u00b4D\u0003VWUXFWXUHG\u0003HGXFDWLRQDO\u0003VWUDWHJ\\\u0003 integrating classroom studies with learning through SURGXFWLYH\u0003ZRUN\u0003H[SHULHQFHV\u0003LQ\u0003D\u0003ILHOG\u0003UHODWHG\u0003WR\u0003D\u0003VWXGHQW\u00b7V\u0003DFDGHPLF\u0003RU\u0003FDUHHU\u0003JRDOV\u00b5\u0003 (Groenewald, 2004, p. 17). The advent of cooperative education programmes in countries like the USA and Canada was to meet the needs of industrial expansion in t he twentieth century (Sovilla & Varty, 2004; McCallum & Wilson, 1988). In Europe too, the economic and technical restructuring of these countries required some initiatives from the EU member states to enhance y RXQJ\u0003SHRSOH\u00b7V\u0003HPSOR\\DELOLW\\\u0003DQG\u0003WR\u0003IDFLOLWDWH\u0003WKH\u0003WUDQVLWLRQ\u0003IRU\u0003JUDGXDWHV\u0003IURP\u0003 school to work (Guile and Young , 2002; Stern & Wagner, 1999). Internship programmes in the Saudi context involve students spending a certain period working in a business organi sation in an area relevant to their specialisation before they graduate. Data suggest, however, that among higher education institutions (both public and private) the duration of training varies, the maximum being six months and the minimum being ninety hours. Trainee students usually have two supervisors: one academic instructor in the higher education institution, and the ot her from the workplace. Each student at the end of the training period needs to submit a report, setting out the assignments and responsibilities given to them by employers and an evaluation of their responses. In addition to the written report, some priva te institutions required students to provide an oral presentation to a panel for evaluation and feedback. Private institutions also received feedback or evaluation reports from employers on the performance of their students. Co-op training is another elem ent in which private higher education institutions of the KSA have taken the lead, providing this before the public sector. For example, when I graduated from the public university in Jeddah in 2000, internship training was neither SDUW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003\u00b6FR -op train LQJ\u00b7\u000f\u0003QRU\u0003SDUW\u0003RI\u0003LWV\u0003FXUULFXOXP\u0011\u0003)RU\u0003H[DPSOH\u000f\u0003VWXGHQWV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003 Faculty of Economics and Administration used to submit a research project which did not have any practical elements. The absence of the co -op training from public 164 XQLYHUVLWLHV\u00b7\u0003 FXUULFXOXP\u0003 LQ\u0003 6D udi Arabia was a serious issue which was raised and discussed by a uthors such as Al -Hammad (2000, 2001a), Al -Sultan (2000) and Buk hari (2001). The first Saudi symposium on co -op training was held in 2001 by a public XQLYHUVLW\\\u0011\u00037KH\u0003V\\PSRVLXP\u00b7V\u0003LQWHQWLRQ\u0003ZDV to conduct a discussion on its importance, DQG\u0003LWV\u0003QHHGV\u0003ZKLOH\u0003EHQHILWLQJ\u0003IURP\u0003RWKHU\u0003FRXQWULHV\u00b7\u0003H[SHULHQFHV\u0003 $O -Hammad, 2001b). Indeed, in Saudi Arabia, co -op training should be of high value, especially with the limited opportunities for the students to interact with the real world before they graduate; there is also no culture of voluntary work in which students could experience the world of work before they became real employees. In addition, because families support and sponsor their children until the ir late ages, the majority of students did not need to work before they graduate. The literature discusses the benefits of co -op training not only for students, but also employers and higher education institutions themselves. Weisz and Chapman (2004) found that this co -RS\u0003WUDLQLQJ\u0003HQKDQFHG\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u00b7\u0003UHODWLRQVKLSV\u0003ZLWK\u0003LQGXVWU\\\u0003DQG\u0003 positively impacted staff and curriculum developments. The positive impact which this programme has for students was discussed by Gardner et al. (1992), Riggio et al. (1994) and Dressler and Keeling (2004), who summarised the benefits which students gained from it, and improved problem solving: analytic al thinking; improved performance in the classroom, increased GPA; increased commitment to HGXFDWLRQDO\u0003JRDOV \u0003LQFUHDVHG\u0003DELOLW\\\u0003WR\u0003ILQDQFH\u0003WKHLU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u00b5\u0003 'UHVVOHU\u0003 \u0003.HHOLQJ\u000f\u0003 2004, p. 225).

Among employers interviewed in the study, some found that the co -op programme gave them the opportunity to get some new ideas from a young workforce, which echoes the findings of Hurd and Hendy (1997) and Reeve (2001), on the benefits emplo yers gain from co -op training. While the benefit which stakeholders gain from internship programmes is not part of this study design, all interviewees seemed aware of its role in serving as a pathway to employment, although there were also some complaints. 165 Screening for new hires was considered by half of the employers interviewed and was also among the benefits discussed by Braunstein and Loken (2004) and Metzger (2004). Indeed, this should be beneficial to employers, especially with the difficulty they f ace in dismissing Saudi nationals.

Employers were seen to take trainees more seriously when the required duration of the trainin g period was longer. More specifically, trainees who were required to work for six months were given more serious work, i.e. non -administrative in nature, than those who were requested to work for ninety hours. If one compared the knowledge and experience gained by students at university A, a public institution, who were required to complete ninety hours of training, and students at College A, a private institution, who were required to complete three months of training, it would be apparent that students at the private institution had benefited much more.

This is even more pronounced in the case of women. As we have mentioned earlier in the chapter, students \u00b3especially female ones\u00b3faced difficulties finding places for training, as ge nder segregation is mandatory in the workplace. Not all companies in the KSA are ready to take students. The culture of internships or co -op training is still new to the higher education system and to the labour market in the KSA, as internship or co -op training had not been part of the curriculum in public universities, as is now the case. The importance of it is clear but more collaboration is still needed between higher education and the market. The benefits to both should be apparent. Employers should take this kind of training more seriously. Apostolides and Looye (1997) suggest quality supervision, a sense of contribution to projects, and challenging assignments to be key factors for successful co -op training. 168 &DUHHU\u0003&HQWUH\u0003DQG\u00036WXGHQWV\u00b7\u0003&RQQHFWLRQV\u0003 In the section above we have seen the scarcity of places available in the labour market where students can obtain their co -op training.

Career centres offer help with CV -writing and interview tips, in addition to planning and organising career days. The main function of the centre, in all private institutions visited, was to coordinate between employers and senior and graduate students to facilitate internships and employment. Each private institution developed its own database of organisations and companies at which students could do their internships. The career centre continues to serve the s tudents even after they graduate. The career centre remains the bridge between employers who are looking for qualified people to employ, and graduates who are looking for jobs. &DUHHU\u0003FHQWUHV\u00b7\u0003VHUYLFHV\u0003ZHUH\u0003KLJKO\\\u0003YDOXHG\u0003E\\\u0003PDQ\\\u0003DV\u0003WKH\\\u0003UHPDUNHG \u00b4,\u0003WKLQN [the added value in private higher education ] is the career centre, which VHQGV\u0003VWXGHQWV \u0003&9V\u0003WR\u0003PDMRU\u0003FRPSDQLHV\u0011\u0003,\u0003WKLQN\u0003WKLV\u0003LV\u0003RQO\\\u0003LQ\u0003SULYDWH\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u0011\u00b5 \u00b4,\u0003WKLQN\u0003WKH\u0003SUHVHQFH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003FDUHHU\u0003FHQWUH\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003FROOHJH\u0003LV\u0003YHU\\\u0003LPSRUWDQW \u0003LW\u0003UHDOO\\\u0003 helped PH\u0003D\u0003ORW\u0003LQ\u0003VHQGLQJ\u0003P\\\u0003&9\u0003WR\u0003PRUH\u0003WKDQ\u0003RQH\u0003FRPSDQ\\\u0011\u00b5 On the other hand, students interviewed from the public sector confirmed that nothing similar exists in it yet.

This is absolutely not the case in the public sector. When university A was first 169 visited for the purpos e of this research in 2008, there was then no properly developed career centre in the Faculty of Administration and Economics. At that time there was only one career centre for the whole of the university, and it was only responsible for employing students within the university.

Perhaps the small size of a private college made it easier for employe rs to get hold of career centres. Fifty percent of the employers I have interviewed commented that they do not know whom to contact in public universities. They confessed that private institutions were more active in involving private businesses in their activities. \u00b6&DUHHU\u0003 'D\\\u00b7\u0003 ZDV\u0003 WKH\u0003 PRVW\u0003 UHFRJQLVDEOH\u0003 link between institutions and business organisations. Although public institutions did organise career days for their students, none of the employers interviewed appeared to be aware of them. It is possible that lack of promotion by public universities wa s the reason, or because perhaps the negative perception which employers had of public institutions diminished their enthusiasm for those events. Indeed, career day and extracurricular activities, discussed in the previous chapter, allow students to develo p networks to rely on while searching for training or jobs. While the career centre is available and active at private institutions, some graduate interviewees explained that they had relied on their own connections to find places for their internship.

This was also observed during my visit to a found er of a private college and a dean of another private institution, who proudly named their graduates who were now holding high positions in different organisations. The list was not a long one, and what was interesting was the fact that they all came from well-known families and of relatively high social class. This, in itself, makes one wonder whether private higher education institutions really did provide better education for their students. Had those institutions allowed them to prosper in the labour ma rket or had they found places where students of high to middle social classes clustered, and then made use of social connectivity and networking to prosper further. Chrisholm (199 9) argues that due to the oversupply of qualified graduates, employers vigorously look for generic skills which are less related to formal credentials. Walter (2004, p. 538) claims that with the rapid technological change, it is somewhat dangerous to concentrate on excessively specific technical skills. During my interviews, most employers indicated their emphasis on the soft skills, which is consistent with the OLWHUDWXUH\u0003RQ\u0003JUDGXDWHV\u00b7\u0003HPSOR\\DELOLW\\\u000f\u0003DV\u0003GLVFXVVHG\u0003HDUOLHU\u000f\u0003ZKLFK\u0003VWUHVVHV\u0003WKH\u0003LPSRUWDQFH\u0003 of generic skills, also discussed earlier in the chapter.

Some interviewees expressed the view that paying for education in private higher education institutions meant that graduates required higher -paid jobs. Perhaps this could present a serious element which further complicates the issue of unemployment among private university graduates, as the majority of them had paid for their education and would h ave liked to have seen a return on that investment.

That was the issue of punctuality. It was an issue which I have experienced while conducting this research, and with all types of stakeholders, incl uding the very employers who complained about regarding others. For example, I arranged interview appointments with three students, but they did not show up for the meeting and offered no explanation or word of apology \u00b3they simply disappeared. This was a serious complaint by employers, and more than a few had experienced it with graduates who came for job interviews. 175 While graduates of private institutions, for the previously discussed skills and connections, achieved better employment opportunities than g raduates of the public sector, they still had competitors. Students in private institutions believed that those who stud y abroad on scholarships were a threat to their eventual chances of employment. Senior students from the private sector perceived such graduates as a threat: \u00b47KH\u0003FRPSHWLWLRQ\u0003LV\u0003UHDOO\\\u0003KLJK\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003ODERXU\u0003PDUNHW\u0003IURP\u0003VWXGHQWV\u0003ZKR\u0003UHFHLYHG\u0003 their degree abroad \u0011\u00b5 \u00b47KH\u0003ODERXU\u0003PDUNHW\u0003LV\u0003REVHVVHG\u0003ZLWK\u0003IRUHLJQ\u0003GHJUHHV\u0011\u00035HJDUGOHVV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003QDPH\u0003RI\u0003 WKH\u0003:HVWHUQ\u0003XQLYHUVLW\\\u000f\u0003WKH\\\u0003SUHIHU\u0003WKHP\u0003WR\u0003ORFDO\u0003RQHV\u0011\u00b5 That worry was not a misplaced one, since employers did show a preference for graduates who received their education abroad. These employers did not emphasise the perceived superior knowledge of students who had studied abroad, but were impressed by their overall personality and attitude. An employer who prefers to hire Saudis with foreign degrees remarked: \u00b46WXGHQWV\u0003 UH ceiving their education from abroad tend to be more creative, FRPPLWWHG\u000f\u0003LQGHSHQGHQW\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003KDYH\u0003EHWWHU\u0003FRPPXQLFDWLRQ\u0003VNLOOV\u0011\u00b5 Several years ago, only a few people went abroad to study on scholarships or at their own expense. One might wonder what the situat ion will be when the over -80,000 students sent to other countries on scholarship return home in the near future. Indeed, the large number of graduates who are sent to foreign universities become a source of outside competition for graduates from both priva te and public sector institutions. Nevertheless, graduates of local universities might be less worried if they knew that there were some employers who were critical of graduates of international universities. An employer commented: \u00b4,W\u0003GHSHQGV\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003XQLY ersity; not all universities are the same.

Very few employers had a high opinion of graduates from public institutions, other than the KFUPM, which was perceived to be very successful in producing capable graduates. Employers, however, viewed all graduates critically in terms of matur ity, attitude, and readiness to work. Therefore, the relationship between Saudi private higher education and the labour market is consistent with the observations of authors such as Levy (1986a, 2003, 2006a), and Cao (200 8). The failure of the public sec tor to meet the market needs can explain the need for its re -emergence in higher education by playing the important role of improving the employability of the graduates. Findings suggest that the private sector of higher education has the characteristics o I\u0003EHLQJ\u0003\u00b6EHWWHU\u00b7\u0003LQ\u0003WKDW\u0003UROH\u0003WKDQ\u0003WKH\u0003SXEOLF\u0003 VHFWRU\u000f\u0003UHVSRQGLQJ\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003ODERXU\u0003PDUNHW\u00b7V\u0003QHHGV\u0011\u0003 It is clear that private institutions are putting effort into the employability of their graduates, but there are problems within the labour market itself.

Beyond English fluency, employers vi ewed graduates critically in terms of maturity, attitude, readiness to work. Employers considered teamwork as a vital skill which private sector students perceive d they had learned as part of group class projects. Two key features of private higher educa tion were perceived as beneficial by students and employers: practical class assignments (which require interaction with people in the VWXGHQW\u00b7V\u0003ILHOG\u0003RI\u0003ZRUN \u0003DQG\u0003LQWHUQVKLSV\u0003 ZKLFK\u0003UHTXLUH\u0003ZRUN\u0003LQ\u0003D\u0003FRPSDQ\\\u0003IRU\u0003XS\u0003WR\u0003VL[\u0003 months before graduation). Inte rnships are seen as pathways to employment. But there have been problems with implementing these structured work experiences. Employers 177 feel the institutions are not clear about what they want. Students find the training to be inadequate but employers a re wary of investing time if the internship period is too short --90 days rather than six months. In general, the labour market is perceived as being not ready to properly train internees. Students, particularly women, have trouble finding workplaces to perform their internships. But career centres in the private sector have developed databases which help link employers with students. Those centres also help students to prepare for the job market. 178 Summary for Part III In this part of the thesis, I l ooked into private higher education in Saudi Arabia from the institutional perspective. With this in mind , I divide my discussion into three chapters, corresponding to the three phases of higher education: Entry, Experience, and Exit. I covered wide ranges of issues under these three phases, including admission policies, subject choices, teaching and learning practices, assessment, extracurricular activities, employment preparation etc. I made use of the empirical data from my fieldwork, in order to present my readers with a sketch of perceptions of private higher education among different groups of stakeholders in the Saudi context. With regard to the Entry phase, as we have seen earlier in Chapter 4, the public sector is falling short of absorbing secondar y school graduates. Data from this chapter, however, suggest that WKHUH\u0003DUH\u0003DOVR\u0003GHPDQGV\u0003IRU\u0003\u00b6GLIIHUHQW\u00b7\u0003DQG\u0003\u00b6EHWWHU\u00b7\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u000f\u0003 to which the public sector is also failing to respond. The atmosphere of the public sector is not taken to be prestigious for s ome. Private higher education, because of its perceived distinct requirements for admission, addresses other failures of the public sector. As we have seen, some respondents saw a difference in social class between students in private and public institutio ns. For them, it was clear that private higher education was an enclave of wealthier upper -class students, a fact which they perceived to be desirable. The open access to the public sector , being free for all, is understood to affect the prestige of the pu blic institution, in which students from all social classes can enrol. The public sector, because of its limited capacity and competitive admission, constrains many applicants, who do not necessarily have low academic achievements, the opportunities to pur sue their higher education. While equity and quality might be for private higher education has removed or at least lessened the financial barrier to DFFHVV\u0011\u0003%DVHG\u0003RQ\u0003UHVSRQGHQWV\u00b7\u0003FRPPHQWV\u000f\u0003WKLV\u0003DSSHDUV\u0003WR\u0003EH\u0003 altering the perception that private institutions are enclaves for the social elite or for lower achievers. Those interviewed identified several ways in which private higher education offered incre ased opportunities to marginalised groups. This was particularly visible in the case of non -Saudis, who had very limited access to higher education prior to the advent of the private sector. Private higher education institutions in the KSA 179 have helped to o vercome a major problem which expatriates used to face when their children reached university level. These institutions have also provided greater access for students with lower GPAs who could not gain entry to the public universities. Many of those studen ts are proving to be academic achievers. Through flexible admission and WXLWLRQ\u0003IHHV\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0003LV\u0003UHVSRQGLQJ\u0003WR\u0003VWXGHQWV\u00b7\u0003GHPDQG\u0003IRU\u0003\u00b6PRUH\u00b7\u0003DQG\u0003\u00b6EHWWHU\u00b7\u0003 higher education. While these admission criteria have led people to take a negative view of the private sector \u00b3that it is a place for the wealthy or the lower achiever \u00b3such negative views have changed with the introduction of government scholarship. With regard to the Experience phase, there was an overall perception among students, faculty, and graduates that the education being received by students in private institutions was superior, at least in some aspects, to what is being received by students at public institutions. Understandings of public and private higher education institutions suggest the possible motives behind the establishment of private higher education.

Several different factors contribut ed to this perception. Another important issue related to the Experience phase is class size, which was understood to produce a higher quality of instruction in the private sector. Many, although not all students, felt that they benefited from the increas ed level of personal attention which they received in private institutions. This perception was reflected by students and faculty of public institutions, who also believed that students in private institutions received more direct attention from faculty. The private sector was also noted to be distinct for its extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities and in -class activities resulted from the small class size in the SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0003DQG\u0003DUH\u0003DSSDUHQWO\\\u0003GHYHORSLQJ\u0003VWXGHQWV\u00b7\u0003VNLOOV\u0003DQG\u0003SHUVRQDOLW\\ .

Opinions were divided on the question of assessment methods. Although some respondents were harshly critical of teaching in public institutions an d praised the more practical teaching methods found in the private sector, others pointed out that the same flaws might also be present there. The strong consensus found among respondents 180 regarding class size and the use of English was absent when they wer e asked about teaching methods. Finally, this suggests the motives for private higher education to respond to the demand for \u00b6EHWWHU\u00b7\u0003DQG\u0003\u00b6GLIIHUHQW\u00b7\u0003TXDOLWLHV\u0003RI\u0003WHDFKLQJ\u0003DQG\u0003OHDUQLQJ\u0003DQG\u0003D\u0003QHHG\u0003IRU\u0003\u00b6PRUH\u00b7\u0003 opportunities of higher education. With regard t o the Exit phase, while it is early to have a firm and accurate opinion about a sector which is young and small in size, private institutions in Saudi Arabia are found to bear more relevance to the market. For example, programmes offered by private institu tions are market -oriented. Private institutions took the lead in offering new majors, especially for women, which should eventually give them wider opportunities in the labour market, which is still male dominated . Offering programmes in English is another significant feature of private institutions which is relevant to the labour market. As in so many other areas which this study has explored, employers found English fluency to be quite significant, in fact the mo st important job skill. Employers also emphasise the importance of communication skills and self -confidence. Private institutions are addressing those skills through assigning students work -related projects, the internship programme, and through involving students in social activities. Career centres in private institutions provide services which are deemed to be important for both students and employers. In general, employers have a positive view, with few criticisms, regarding the employability of privat H\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u00b7\u0003JUDGXDWHV \u00b3compared to those from the public sector. Very few employers had a high opinion of graduates from public institutions, other than the KFUPM, which was perceived to be very successful in producing capable graduates. Employers, howe ver, viewed all graduates critically in terms of maturity, loyalty attitude, and readiness to work. Therefore, the relationship between Saudi private higher education and the labour market is consistent with the observations of authors such as Levy (1986 a, 2003, 2006a), and Cao (2008) . The failure of the public sector to meet market needs can explain the need for WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u00b7V\u0003 emergence in higher education to play an important role in improving the employability of graduates.

In the final Part of this thesis, I will explore the role of private higher education from a socio -political perspective. To this end, I look into the use of English language in the private sector, also one of its distinctive feature s. I also explore the changing relationship between the private sector and the Saudi government. 182 PART IV A BIGGER PICTURE This part examines private higher education from a wider perspective. It first looks at the role of the English language in private higher education and its implication from a socio -cultural angle.

Overall, English as the language of instruction is seen as a distinctive feature of the private sector. By making English their language of instruction, newly established private higher education insti tutions have a competitive advantage over public providers. The difference in the language of instruction , therefore , remains one of the major differences between public and private higher education institutions. The majority of interviewees viewed English -language instruction as a positive feature of private higher education. However, the use of English is more than a mere choice of instruction language. It also bears certain symbolic meanings in terms of the interaction between Saudi Arabia and the globa l economy. For many Saudis who are involved in, or aspire to be involved in, a globalised market, master y of the English language has become of crucial importance. It is noteworthy that all stakeholders interviewed showed their concerns about the role of the English language in higher education provision. I did not include any specific questions relating to the language of instruction at first, but as my fieldwork went on, I noticed that almost all interviewees raised the topic in their answers to a variety of questions. I included this topic in later interviews. English and the Regional Context In the interviews, students, faculty, administrators, and employers all considered the use of the English language an important feature of private higher education . Arabic is the medium of instruction at all educational levels, including higher education , with the exception of the King Fahad University for Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), a public university, originally set up by ARAMCO, the American Oil company oper ating in the country. The other exceptions are colleges of natural and applied sciences in public institutions. 184 The issue of using English as the language of instruction is important, given the fact that private higher education institutions in the KSA ar e not branches of international universities. In other words, the use of the English language is not a requirement of a foreign provider, but a choice of domestic providers - a clear strategy, in other words. In past decades, we have seen that English -speaking countries like the UK, USA, and Australia have been establishing branches of their universities around the world, teaching their home curricula to students in the host country. This is the case in the UAE where foreign providers are allowed to establ ish their branches, but it is not the case in the KSA where foreign ownership is still not allowed in private higher education provision. The significance of this issue can be better understood in the light of the regional educational traditions in the K SA. Seeing itself as the centre of the Muslim world and EHLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003ELUWKSODFH\u0003RI\u0003,VODP\u0003ZKHUH\u0003WKH\u0003UHOLJLRQ\u00b7V\u0003PRVW\u0003VDFUHG\u0003VKULQHV\u0003DUH\u0003VLWXDWHG\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003 KSA attaches special significance to the Arabic language \u00b3WKH\u0003ODQJXDJH\u0003RI\u0003,VODP\u00b7V\u0003KRO\\\u0003 ERRN\u000f\u0003WKH\u00034XU\u00b7DQ\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH 3URSKHW\u00b7V\u0003WHDFKLQJV\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003+DGHHWK\u0011\u00037KH\u0003$UDELF\u0003ODQJXDJH\u000f\u0003 therefore, has a semi -sacred status in the Muslim community, and in particular in the KSA, as a result of the total dominance of the Islamic faith in all aspects of life in the KSA. This largely expla ins the fact that neither English nor any other foreign languages play a role in the public educational systems of the KSA. The issue of foreign language is further complicated by the regional history. Although Saudi Arabia has never been colonised by a W estern country, Saudi society shares a fear of loss of cultural identity and language like other neighbouring states in the recent past, and hence sees of the use of the English language as a threat to their own culture (Kirkpatrick, 2011).

English is now the language of science, medicine, and technology. More than 80% of scientific papers are first published in English ( Crystal, 2003 ).

Since 2006, the English language has started to become part of primary education - before that, students in the public sector started to learn English only in secondary school. Also, new regulations were introduced which mandate that students start learning English in Grade 6 rather than in Grade 7. In 2011, a decision was made by the Ministry of Education to require English education starting from Grade 4 ( Saudi Gazette, 2011 ). $QRWKHU\u0003H[DPSOH\u0003RI\u0003WKLV\u0003LV\u0003WKH\u0003*RYHUQPHQW\u00b7V\u0003FKDQJHG\u0003SRVLWLRQ\u0003RQ\u0003LQWHUQDWLRQDO\u0003VFKRROV\u0003 ZKLFK\u0003WHDFK\u0003LQ\u0003(QJOLVK\u0003WR\u0003FDWHU\u0003WR\u0003H[SDWULDWHV\u00b7\u0003FKLOGUHQ\u0011\u0003%HIRUH\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013 \u000f\u0003QR\u00036DXGL\u0003FLWL]HQ\u0003 was allowed to join those schools without the written permission from the Ministry of Education.

As we shall see in the following section, it is, in fact, an issue which was raised by some academic staff from the private sector as any academic programmes. They use exams such as TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) to classify entrants. Stude nts are either qualified to start an academic programme or requested to undertake a preparation year to improve their English language and other academic skills. This admission requirement is another possible factor which makes students refrain from studyi ng their higher education degree in English or might make them unqualified to pursue a degree in the private sector. It is worth noting that in 2008 a public university in the city of Jeddah established a VHSDUDWH\u0003LQVWLWXWH\u0003WR\u0003HQKDQFH\u0003VWXGHQW\u00b7V\u0003FRPSHWHQF e in English.

Previously, students in subjects other than natural scie nces, applied science, and English literature, took only two levels of basic English. Some in the public sector are suspicious about the actual effects of this programme on its targeted students.

While Chungs (2006) argues that there are no comprehensive studies of the effectiveness of using English as a medium for instruction and that its impact on learning is not clear , a number of studies agree that the most observed benefit RI\u0003XVLQJ\u0003(QJOLVK\u0003DV\u0003D\u0003PHGLXP\u0003RI\u0003LQVWUXFWLRQ\u0003LV\u0003VLPSO\\\u0003WKDW\u0003WKLV\u0003HQKDQFHV\u0003VWXGHQWV\u00b7\u0003 proficiency in English (Chang, 2010; Dupuy, 2000; Wu, 2006). Advantages and concerns perceived by interviewees on the use of English as a medium of instruction is consistent with what has been discussed in the literature. Quality of educational materials available in the public sector was a constantly raised issue. The using of English in private institutions has bee n valued in this regard.

The fact that students leave 194 secondary school with a less than satisfactory level of English has been a serious problem ( Al-Mishary, 2006 ).

Al -Ghamdi (2005) finds that memorisation and grammar -translation methods used in English teaching play a significant role in this negative outcome. However, not all students ar e faced with this problem - some are much better prepared in a different path of education. Private secondary education leads many students to private higher education institutions. The majority of student interviewees from private institutions were gradua tes of private secondary education, with only a small number being graduates of public secondary education. Private schools attach greater importance to the English language than public schools. Students of private schools, generally, are only second to in ternational schools in the ratio of their English -language instruction. Unlike public schools, which have begun teaching English to students in the seventh grade (only recently revised to the fourth), private schools teach English as a separate subject, s tarting in kindergarten and extending through high school. Exposure to the English language from an early age was not the only difference between students in private schools from their counterparts in public schools. -the quality of English teaching is mu ch higher in private schools as well. While public and private schools are required to follow the syllabus and use textbooks assigned by the Ministry of Education, private schools can teach more advanced English courses alongside the one mandated by the Ministry of Education. Therefore, studen ts from private schools are found to be less intimidated in pursuing their higher education in English in the interviews. The following section presents the challenge which private institutions face while recruiting faculty when the use of English partiall y contributes to the issue. While it is an internationally accepted fact that the use of English in higher education allows more mobility among students and academics (Coleman, 2006), this is not exactly the case for Saudi Arabia, as is presented in the se ction below. 195 The Faculty Recruitment Challenge Providers of private higher education have experienced challenges in recruiting qualified faculty, which is a pressing issue, especially with the rapid expansion of higher education in the country and in th e neighbouring GCC states. Instruction in English in private institutions has increased the difficulties in recruiting faculty. Teachers need to be competent not only in the subject they teach, but also must be competent in the language of instruction. The socio -religious status quo in the Kingdom perhaps cause s discomforts to many Westerners. This factor has a significant impact on the ability of private higher education institutions to attract good foreign instructors . Although Saudi Arabia might be seen as be an attractive place for Muslim instructors who might value being close to the holy places, this is not the case for non -Muslim Arabs or faculty from Western countries. Even after the modernisation of the KSA, people preferred to go to other Gulf Sta tes, which are relatively more open, allowing them to lead similar lifestyles to those they had enjoyed in their own countries. A vice dean of a private college complained: \u00b4,W\u0003LV\u0003UHDOO\\\u0003KDUG\u0003WR\u0003DWWUDFW\u0003IDFXOW\\\u0003IURP\u0003RWKHU\u0003FRXQWULHV\u0003WR\u0003FRPH\u0003DQG\u0003WHDFK\u0003LQ\u0003D strict FRXQWU\\\u0003OLNH\u00036DXGL\u0003$UDELD\u0011\u00b5 A faculty member from a private institution echoed this view, adding: \u00b46DXGL\u0003$UDELD\u0003LV\u0003QRW\u0003DQ\u0003DWWUDFWLYH\u0003ZRUNLQJ\u0003SODFH\u0003IRU\u0003PDQ\\\u0003IRUHLJQHUV\u000f\u0003LQFOXGLQJ\u0003 those from other Arab countries.

It should be emphasised that the higher education sector, until recently (2005), was not an attractive working place because of the relatively low level of remuneration. According to a fa culty member from the public sector: \u00b47KH\u0003\u0003ORZ\u0003VDODU\\\u0003LVVXH\u0003WRJHWKHU\u0003ZLWK\u0003WKH\u0003VWLIOLQJ\u0003EXUHDXFUDF\\\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003SXEOLF\u0003VHFWRU\u0003 have both, to some extent, caused many good university graduates to refrain from joining the teaching profession and to seek work elsew KHUH\u0011\u00b5 196 This made public higher education dependent for many years on the same Saudi faculty who had been privileged enough to be sent abroad on government scholarships. Later, LQ\u0003WKH\u0003\u0014 \u001b\u0013V\u000f\u0003ZKHQ\u0003WKH\u0003FRXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003ILQDQFLDO\u0003VLWXDWLRQ\u0003FKDQJHG\u0003GUDVWLFDOO\\\u000f\u0003WKHUH\u0003 was a substantial decrease in the budget available for scholarships. Thus, the public sector depended for many years on the same faculty. Some of those who reached their retirement age were reappointed by individual contracts. When private higher education institutions were opened, public sector faculty saw in it a means of supplementing their income by teaching in both sectors. However, it was available only for those who could work in English. Therefore, the private sector is limited in its use of public sector staff to those who are bilingual. Apart from the employment security that the public sector provided, there was not much difference in UHPXQHUDWLRQ\u0003EHWZHHQ\u0003WKH\u0003VHFWRUV\u0011\u00037KH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u00b7V\u0003UHLPEXUVHPHQW\u0003PLJKW\u0003KDYH\u0003EHHQ\u0003 somewhat higher, attracting t HPSRUDU\\\u0003ZRUNHUV\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003VHFWRU\u0011\u0003+RZHYHU\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003.LQJ\u00b7V\u0003 Decree No. 227/A, issued on 21st September, 2005, increased the salaries of public sector employees, including those in higher education institutions, by 15%.

However, some students with a serious attitude toward s their studies prefer to have foreign instructors who do not speak Arabic.

However, the situation in the labour market has changed. The pu blic sector has been saturated, and the private sector is the only option for most graduates now.

One third of the employers interviewed found graduates from private institutions to be less competent in English than students of KFUPM University \u00b3which is the only public un iversity which conducts all its classes in English.

English is perceived to contribute to the quality of education delivered in private higher education institu tions. English usage gives access to up -to-date books and learning resources not available in public universities. Nevertheless, this is not free of challenges. The private sector finds it challenging to recruit qualified faculty, partly because English f luency is required. It is difficult to recruit from abroad. Public sector teaching jobs are less demanding and have equal pay, but the private sector does hire some talented public faculty who have retired. As in so many other areas which this study has e xplored, employers found English fluency to be quite significant \u00b3indeed, the most important job skill. While it may be questioned whether English is needed in the majority of jobs in the Kingdom, graduates were expected to write business reports in Englis h. Employers also linked fluency in English to good communication skills and to self -confidence . It is also perceived as a gateway to good jobs in a global economy. 205 Chapter 10 Private Higher Education and the State Introduction In a state such as Saudi Arabia, where the Government is heavily involved in all aspects of the economy and public life, it is impossible to ignore its role in the emergence of the private higher education sector. We have seen in Chapter 2 KRZ\u0003JRYHUQPHQWV\u00b7 stances about the sector are found to affect the nature and the function[s] of the private sector. In order to better understand the emergence of this sector and its development, it is therefore necessary to understand the relationship between the Saudi Government and private education institutions. The exploration of this relationship is discussed in this chapter mainly through the perceptions of providers of private higher education and complemented with information from the Ministry of Higher Educatio n policy documents. The relationship between private higher education and the Government is most clearly seen through the authorising the pri vate sector to provide higher education; financially supporting that sector or granting operating incentives; assessing, evaluating, and approving the programmes ; and controlling the quality of the sector (Zumeta, 1992, 1996 , 2011 ;Fielden & Varghese, 2009) . As discussed earlier in Chapter 2, governments have different stances towards private higher education, namely, laissez faire, central planning, and market competitive ( Zumeta , 1996, 2011). Nevertheless, Levy (2011) suggests that even governments which used to fall into the laissez -faire category are now instituting some regulations in relation to WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0011\u0003\u0003$FFRUGLQJ\u0003WR\u0003/HY\\\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0014\u0014 \u0003\u00b4DV\u0003SULYDWH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003JURZV\u0003 ODUJHO\\\u0003RQ\u0003LWV\u0003RZQ\u000f\u0003RIWHQ\u0003VKDUSO\\\u000f\u0003LW\u0003EHFRPHV\u0003FUXFLDO\u0003WR\u0003DFFHVV\u0003SROLF\\\u0011\u00b5\u0003 -72) explain: \u00b4+LJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003VKRXOG\u0003QRW\u0003EH\u0003OHIW\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003YDJDULHV\u0003RI\u0003PDUNHW\u0003IRUFHV\u0011\u00030DUNHWV\u0003DUH\u0003 more reliable in ensuring efficiency than equity, while the role in ensuring quality is debatable.

A number of countries, those of Eastern and Central Europe among them, experienced a period where higher education was freely open to the private sector. In these countries, government re gulations on the private sector of higher education emerged only after the Government realised that the absence of regulations had had a detrimental effect on the quality of higher education (Levy, 2007). In Poland, for instance, the Government created th e State Accreditation Commission in 2001, after ten years of limited government oversight of private higher education. This quasi -autonomous body became responsible for evaluating both public and private institutions (Duczmal, 2006). This illustrates what /HY\\\u0003FDOOV\u0003\u00b4UHDFWLYH\u0003SROLF\\PDNLQJ\u0011\u00b5\u0003\u0003 /HY\\\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014\u0014 \u0011\u0003\u0003 Saudi Arabia does not fall within the category described above by Levy (2011) as no private higher education institutions existed before the Government \u00b7V\u0003DSSURYDO\u0003RI\u0003WKHLU\u0003 establishment. Unlike other c ountries where government regulations are developed to govern already existing private institutions, in Saudi Arabia government regulation of private sector higher education was designed before private higher education institutions existed. Nevertheless, those polices have not been comprehensive, as the private sector is still relatively new. Modifications or new policies are introduced now and then. 207 The Reluctant State As discussed in Chapter 1, the current expansion of the Saudi private higher education sector is the result of a 1998 decree which authorised the creation of new private higher education institutions. These had not previously existed in the country since the nationalisation of King Abdul -Aziz University in 1967, an institution which began as a private sch ool. The rise of Saudi private higher education was perceived by most of the interviewees from the management level to be late. Interestingly, this delay was perceived by some as resistance by the Government to incorporate the private sector into the highe r education system. This delay was also perceived negatively as demonstrating a lack of planning and the absence of vision on the part of policymakers.

That said, as will be seen in the coming chapter, private institutions have more flexibility and freedom with their activities than those in the public sector. As to the Govern PHQW\u00b7V fear about the influence of the West, while it is difficult to control, at least has minimise d it by not allowing any Western branches where it might have less control. As illustrated above, the Government have been criticised for being late in its decision to permit private higher education. Interviewees had different perceptions of the reasons for the Government \u00b7V\u0003GHOD\\\u0011\u0003,W\u0003PD\\\u0003EH\u000f\u0003KRZHYHU\u000f\u0003WKDW\u0003WKHVH\u0003UHVSRQGHQWV\u0003 were implicitly comparing government poli cy on private higher education to other arenas of KSA government policy, at least more than to private higher education policy in other countries, which they may know little about. The Saudi Government 's 1998 decision to permit private higher education may well have been influenced by the observation of regional trends allowing private higher education. As has been documented in Chapter 1, other states in the Arab world, particularly other members of the GCC, were taking similar steps toward creating or exp anding private higher education sector. In addition, the 90s was a period in which private sector education proliferated not only i n the Arab 210 world but worldwide. However, it took the Saudi government around a decade to approve the establishment of this s ector in the Kingdom. After almost a decade of hesitation, the Government finally allowed private sector participation in higher education. We can see how the Government moved from opposing to uncertain to allowing. The Government s regulatory framework will be examined below. 211 The Controlling State: Licensing and Regulations Among those interviewed, the predominant response to the creation of the private higher education sector was that it was largely unplanned and may have been experimental. \u00b47KHUH was no fertile ground that would help with improvement. I think it was a kind of a trial -and-error phase in the beginning.

Nevertheless, two years later, Decree No. 212 (September 1st 2000) was issued. Additional regulations were approved allowing the private sector to establish for -profit higher education institutions. Since then, for -profit private higher education institutions have proliferated in the KSA. According to Al - Eassa (2010), after the introduction of the regulations for the non -for-profit status of private institutions, no application was made to establish such institutions \u00b2 everyone went for the non-for-profit model. . It was observed that government regulations o n both types of institutions are exactly the same. The reason that causes providers to choose between being for -profit or no n- for-profit was not investigated. It is clear, however, that the Saudi Government have not given the non -for-profit institutions a ny extra facilities that would encourage private institutions to be non-for-profit . One might argue, however, that non -for-profit intuitions have the advantage of not paying the t ax that for-profit institutions have to pay. In Saudi Arabia, unlike in othe r countries, 2.5% is a fixed tax rate which should not have a significant affect on the profits to be generated by private institutions.

The Saudi government , as represented by the Ministry of Hi gher Education , defines its relation with the private sector as joint planning and joint organization ( Al-Dali & Al -Rayes, 2009 ). These two kinds of relations are covered through licensing and accreditation requirements set by the Ministry of Higher Educat ion as will be discussed below. New private higher education institutions in Saudi Arabia are required to be licensed by the Ministry of Higher Education in order to operate. These private institutions go through four stages before they receive the final approval: preliminary licence , general approval, special approval, and final licen ce (Al-Dali & Al -Rayes, 2009 ; MOHE, 201 2b). A preliminary licence is granted to the institution upon the acceptance of a feasibility study showing the need for the subjects offered, together with details of the venture, such as: 1. Objectives of establishing the P rivate Higher Education Institutions and its mission. 2. The total cost of the venture including cost of land, buildings and facilities. 3. Ways of financing the venture. 4. Financial status of the proposers and their ability to sustain the venture. 5. Details of the owners and their background. 6. The site of the institution. 213 7. The maximum absorption capacity of the institution. 8. The expected number of students to be enrolled in ever y major. 9. The fees to be charged. 10. The institution's plans for staff recruitment and faculty qualifications. 11. The expected starting date after gaining approval.

Its membership includes ministry staff, as well as others recruited from the nation's un iversities. The committee has the responsibility for evaluating the physical facilities and the technical and organisational state of the institution. It is particularly concerned that the institution should meet approved standards in the capacity of the buildings, the quality of classrooms/lecture halls, the adequacy of laboratories and computer facilities, the availability of language laboratories and a library, as well as the quality of faculty offices and health units. The Ministry sets specific standa rds for each category, which the private institutions must meet. 214 The Committee also examines the organisational structure of the institution and the existence and appointment of: a board of trustees; a dean, deputy deans, and departmental principals; a nd a college council and departmental councils. They also examine faculty qualifications in each department of the institution. The third stage --special approval --is concerned with the academic plans of the private educational institution. This involves the Ministry sending the institution's academic plans to three different outstanding higher education institutions specialising in the fields under assessment. Those institutions are asked to evaluate the academic plans proposed by the applicant institution. A committee at MOHE then discusses the evaluation provided by the three experts from each of the assessing universities. The resulting collective assessment is then discussed with the applicant. The General Committee of Licensing and Approval then grants the approval of the academic program. However, as specified in Article 23 of the regulations governing the private sector, the Ministry must also approve any changes in the academic plans. The same rule also applies to any adjustments in the institution's rules and procedures. A special approval licence is then granted upon compliance with these detailed academic criteria. This t hird stage of licensing regarding academic plans drew some critical responses. An administrator from a private college remarked: \u00b47KH\u0003WKLUG\u0003OHYHO\u0003RI\u0003DSSURYDO \u00b3that affects academic plans \u00b3is still problematic.

It work s under the Higher Education Council but has an administrative and financial autonomy (MOHE, 2004). This accrediting body was established after licensing procedures were developed, it was given the responsibility of assess ing higher education institutions, and, ba sed on its possible evaluation, the private institution could become nationally accredited. It should be emphasised that as yet no Saudi private institution has been accredited --eight years after the NCAAA was established. The fourth stage of the licensin g process culminates in the issuing of the final license to operate. This is granted upon ensuring that the institution has fulfilled all the requirements of the three stages discussed above, together with a major final requirement of a financial guarantee . This is an insurance policy provided by the institution to the Ministry, to ensure that the Ministry can run the institution should the venture fail, thus ensuring continuity of education for the students. The guarantee is calculated at 5,000 Saudi Riya l (SR) per student, with the total amount depend ent on the proposed capacity of the institution. Providers of private higher education have found this bank guarantee to be difficult to meet. An owner -partner from one private college explained: \u00b47KLV\u0003LV\u0003a very serious financial burden on us.

Quality assurance mechanisms in private higher education are found to be closely linked to the proliferation of demand -absorbing private higher education institutions (Lemaitre, 2009). Before then, the size of the private higher education sector was small and the presence of such a mechanism was not necessary. Teixeira (2006) and Galbraith (2003) discuss the fact that many countries are suffering from low -quality private higher education institutions. The accreditation of higher education institutions --whether public or private --has been a policy concern in many countries (Eaton 2007). Many governments have been active in launching accreditation requirements to evaluate the academic standards of private higher education institutions. The responsibility for accreditation varies between countries. Kinser et al (201\u0013 \u0003 VXJJHVW\u0003 \u00b4QHZ\u0003 TXDOLW\\\u0003 assurance mechanisms and regulatory regimes have emerged to address the specific issues raised by non -VWDWH\u0003VSRQVRUHG\u0003HGXFDWLRQDO\u0003HQWLWLHV\u00b5 S\u0011\u0003L[ \u0011\u0003$OWEDFK et al.

But in the KSA the presence of this accrediting body has been important to address quality issues in both sectors. Nevertheless, the presence of private higher educat ion may have expedited its presence. 217 Established in 2004, the NCAAA arranged with every university in the Kingdom to have a quality assurance department to supervise quality mechanisms and to ensure compliance with its requirements. Higher education inst itutions need to be re - accredited by the NCAAA once every five years. The National Commission has been actively working with higher education institutions, both public and private. A number of workshops were conducted to educate academics and staff about the National Commission's standards and the way the assessment works. Institutions have been instructed to self -assess themselves according to the Commission's criteria. The private higher education institutions I visited stressed how hard they have been working to meet the Commission's requirements.

External reviewers --who were experts 218 recruited by the National Commission from the UK, Australia, and the USA --visited these private higher education institutions. Evidence for compliance with the requirements of the NCAAA must be verifie d by the reviewing committee through random selection of elements and people from the institutions being examined. Though this quality assurance scheme is being applied to both public and private higher education institutions, the private sector has been more concerned about it. That is because private higher education institutions will not receive their final licence from the Ministry unless they pass the accreditation requirements, thus it will have an impact on their credibility.

This contrasts with the public sector, in which there is still no quality mechanism that affect s their operations. Unlike the public sector, public institutions do not need to be accredited or licensed by the Government . In addition, in the public sector, there is still no link between accreditation and budget allocation in the.

Levy (2009, 2011) discusses how it is not always 219 clear whether such regulations are truly practised or not. Interviews with providers of private h igher education suggest that such regulations are not only text on paper but are actually implemented and that the Government is serious about it. While some find such regulations to be overwhelming, others find the Government involvement and regulations to be indispensible. According to the Government itself, the Ministry of Higher Education is responsible for all aspects of private higher education in the KSA. According to the same Ministry official cited above: \u00b47KH\u00030LQLVWU\\\u0003RI\u0003+LJKHU\u0003(GXFDWLRQ\u0003KDV\u0003IXOO\u0003FRQWURO\u0003DQG\u0003LQIOXHQFH\u0011\u00037KLV\u0003LV\u0003EHFDXVH\u0003 the bylaws of private higher education give the Minister of Higher Education full UHVSRQVLELOLW\\\u0003DQG\u0003DXWKRULW\\\u0003LQ\u0003PRVW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003UHODWHG\u0003LPSRUWDQW\u0003LVVXHV\u0011\u00b5\u0003 The regulations for private higher education published by the MOHE tend to support this position. According to these rules, the Ministry is involved in all aspects of decision - making. For example, the appointments of college deans need to be approved by the Ministry. Similar ly, Boards of Trustees for private institutions must include representatives from the Ministry. College councils also contain members appointed by the Ministry.

Some faculty respondents criticised what they saw as obstructive or misguided policies; but, overall, interviewees saw the Ministry's oversight as important in maintaining the quality of education in the private sector. One recurring concern with that oversig ht is the issue of flexibility. A private sector administrator remarked: \u00b4*RYHUQPHQW\u0003FRQWURO\u0003LV\u0003RND\\\u0003EXW\u0003WKHUH\u0003QHHGV\u0003WR\u0003EH\u0003IOH[LELOLW\\\u000f\u0003OHVV\u0003EXUHDXFUDF\\\u0003LQ\u0003 WKH\u0003SURFHGXUHV\u0011\u00b5 A board member of the same school observed: \u00b47KH\u0003JRYHUQPHQW\u0003QHHGV\u0003PRUH\u0003IOH[LELO ity in dealing with each college.

Thus, as discussed earlier, the increasing demand for higher education proliferation of private higher education institutions. Levy (2011) also explains how private higher educat ion institutions receive different support from the Government , according to their type (elite, semi -elite, or demand - absorbing, for -profit or no t-for-profit). Thus, the same government could have different stances depending on the type of private higher education institution. Government regulation of the private sector does not imply financial support. The relationship between institutional autonomy and government financial support is not always clear. There are countries where governments have too muc h control over higher education institutions while not providing any financial support to that sector (Levy, 2010a). This section present s the kind of support that private institutions get from the Government . During the pilot study, I found financial constraints to be a major concern for private higher education providers. As in many private education institutions around the world, tuition fees have been the main financial resource for those institutions in the KSA. Nevertheless, at the beginning, r ecruiting students was a big challenge for private higher education as their tuition fees are considered high when compared to the public sector which is not only tuition fees free but also provides students with monthly stipends. The Dean of a private co llege commented: \u00b47XLWLRQ\u0003IHHV\u0003FKDUJHG\u0003E\\\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u000f\u0003WKRXJK\u0003PRGHVW\u000f\u0003DUH\u0003DOZD\\V\u0003SHUFHLYHG\u0003WR\u0003 be high.

Without financial support from the Government , enrolment in private higher education institutions would be difficult, if not impossible, for them. Providers of private higher education have been looking for some recognition from the Government that they are providing a crucial service in the field of higher education. The private sector feels it should be given more consideration by the Gover nment . I heard a recurring note of irritation on this point. For example, a private college board member complained: \u00b4:H\u0003were regarded DV\u0003RXWVLGHUV\u000f\u0003DV\u0003DQ\u0003XQZDQWHG\u0003FKLOG\u0011\u00b5 An administrator from a private college remarked: \u00b47KH\u0003Government shouldn't expand its public sector but, rather, support the private sector more, as the cost of students in private institutions is 50% lower than in the SXEOLF\u0003VHFWRU\u0011\u0003,\u0003KDYH\u0003VRPH\u0003ZRUULHV\u0003WKDW\u0003WKLV\u0003VXSSRUW\u0003ZLOO\u0003QRW\u0003FRQWLQXH\u0011\u00b5 There was a sense of frustr ation about this lack of financial support.

It was not long after the Saudi Government permitted private higher education tha t it started to financially support the private sector. (Al -Dali & Al -Rayes, 2009). The 223 Government has been gradually responding to the financial challenges facing the sector. The first financial incentive the Government offered to the private sector wa s the leasing of government lands, which are owned by the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs, as well as other government authorities. This was approved by the Council of Ministers Decree No. 87, released on the 6th of April 2002 (MOHE, 2012 b). The second form of financial support from the Government was soft loans to licensed private higher education institutions. Though this kind of financial incentive from the Government was available during the pilot study, none of the providers interviewed recog nised this kind of support from the Government . This was a bit surprising until one of the interviewees (a faculty member from a private college) clarified the contradicting policies of the Government : \u00b43ULYDWH\u0003SURYLGHUV\u0003DUH\u0003QRW\u0003HOLJLEOH\u0003WR\u0003UHFHLYH\u0003ORDQV from the Government unless they provide the Ministry of Finance with almost one third of the value of the loan.

Donations are another minor source of 224 income for private higher education institutions. Some private higher education instituti ons sought financial help from well -known wealthy businessmen through personal networking. Donated funds by the executives were then offered to students in the form of scholarships. However, charity foundations and for -profit institutions are not compatib le. A dean from the private sector described the financial constraints facing his institution: \u00b4\u0011\u0011\u00112XU\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQ\u000f\u0003EHLQJ\u0003\u00b6IRU -SURILW\u000f\u00b7\u0003UHFHLYHV\u0003IHZ\u0003GRQDWLRQV\u0003IURP\u0003EXVLQHVVPHQ\u0011\u0003\u0003 The perception of profiteering from charitable donations has surfaced, to the detriment of the for -SURILW\u0003VHFWRU\u0011\u0011\u0011\u00b5 It is worth noting that in Saudi Arabia, people are still not used to donating to educational institutions, people still have the perceptions that donations or Zakat \u00b2the religiously fixed portion of wealth -- should be spent on building mosques or on poor people, and that education is the Government \u00b7V responsibility. What seems to have been increasing the frustration of the private sector is seeing the Government \u00b7V\u0003H[WHUQDO\u0003VFKRODUVKLS\u0003SURJUDP me, which sends t housands of students abroad. One of the interviewees, a former dean from a private college, commented: \u00b47KH\u0003Government is financially sponsoring students to study abroad in majors that ZH\u0003DUH\u0003RIIHULQJ\u00ab7KH\u0003 Government might save more money if, rather, it sponsored VWXGHQWV\u0003WR\u0003JR\u0003WR\u0003SULYDWH\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u0011\u00b5 ,QGHHG\u0003 WKH\u0003 JRYHUQPHQW\u00b7V\u0003 GHFLVLRQ\u0003 to send thousands of students abroad was not received well by providers of private higher education. At that time, private institutions were struggling to recruit students. The Government , possibly , succeeded in alleviat ing this anger from the private provide rs through its scholarship programme which will be discussed in the following section. Internal Scholarships Seven years after the inception of private higher education, the Ministry of Higher Education decreed the establishment of an internal scholar ship programme allowing 225 students to enrol in private higher education institutions. (Decree No. 6304/MB of August 18th 2006.) This scholarship programme has five phases (Al -Dali & Al-Rayes; 2009). From 2006 to 2010, around 10,000 scholarships were grant ed to the amount of 326,571,000 Saudi Riyals. In the first phase, the number of scholarships that each institution was eligible for did not exc eed 30% of the total enrolment ( Al-Dali & Al - Rayes; 2009 ). The Ministry allocated certain amounts for each subj ect. This meant that, in many cases, the scholarship covered only part of the tuition fees and the student had to pay the rest. (MOHE, 2012 b). Two types of scholarships were offered: 1) full scholarships, which covered secondary school to secondary school grades and the cumulative GPA, the scholarship programme required that disci plines that students were applying for had to be market -oriented. One would not expect this requirement for a private institution since the Government \u00b7V\u0003OLFHQVLQJ\u0003UXOHV\u0003DOUHDG\\\u0003HQWDLO\u0003PDUNHW\u0003RULHQWDWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003DOO\u0003FRXUVHV\u0003 offered. These scholarships covered s tudents already enrolled, as well as those to be enrolled in private institutions. However, newly applying students had to pass the standard examination needed for admission to public higher education institutions. Generally, this is not among the require ments for admission to private higher education institutions in the Kingdom. Only a few private institutions required this assessment for admission. In 2010, the Ministry of Higher Education increased its support for scholarships to private higher educat ion institutions to cover up to 50% of the total enrolment in the institution. Apparently, the Government scholarship programme induced trust in the private sector, as well as providing much needed financial relief. As one of the students commented: \u00b4:H\u0003XVHG\u0003WR\u0003IHDU\u0003WKDW\u0003GHJUHHV\u0003IURP\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0003ZRXOG\u0003QRW\u0003EH\u0003UHFRJQLVHG \u0003EXW\u0003 with Government scholarships being offered to students in private higher education LQVWLWXWLRQV\u000f\u0003WKDW\u0003PHDQV\u0003WKDW\u0003WKH\u00030LQLVWU\\\u0003LV\u0003DSSURYLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003VHFWRU\u0011\u00b5\u0003 A faculty member at a private college confirmed that view: 226 \u00b4*RYHUQPHQW\u0003VFKRODUVKLSV\u00b7\u0003EHLQJ\u0003PDGH\u0003DYDLODEOH\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0003VLJQLILHV\u0003WUXVW\u0003 LQ\u0003WKDW\u0003VHFWRU\u0011\u00b5\u0003\u0003 In agreement with what my interviewees said, I remember that, before the Government \u00b7V\u0003VFKRODUVKLS\u0003 programme started, a major concern of new applicants was whether private higher education was approved by the Government or not. But with the scholarship program me, it is likely that Saudis realised that the Government would not offer this kind of financial suppor t unless it was to improve a sector viewed favourably by the Government . In addition to the sense of trust that government scholarships provided for the private sector, they also helped to alleviate the financial burden on students, particularly students from low -income families who otherwise would not be able to enrol in this sector. A student applying to a private college remarked: \u00b4,\u0003ZDV\u0003LQ\u0003P\\\u0003ILIWK\u0003VHPHVWHU\u0003LQ\u0003D\u0003SXEOLF\u0003XQLYHUVLW\\\u00ab\u0003EXW\u0003ZKHQ\u0003,\u0003KHDUG\u0003DERXW\u0003WKH\u0003 internal scholarship program me, I decided WR\u0003FRPH\u0003KHUH\u0003 WR\u0003D\u0003SULYDWH\u0003FROOHJH \u0011\u00b5 Before the Government \u00b7V\u0003LQWHUQDO\u0003VFKRODUVKLS\u0003SURJUDP\u000f\u0003LQGLUHFW\u0003ILQDQFLDO\u0003VXSSRUW\u0003FDPH\u0003 \u00b7V\u0003 +XPDQ\u0003 5HVRXUFHV\u0003 'HYHORSPHQW\u0003 )XQG\u000f\u0003 ZKLFK\u0003 offered loans to students. However, support has been restr icted to certain majors, such as banking, logistics, human resources management, and tourism. Increased public financial support is highly needed in the context of Saudi Arabia: financial resources available to the private sector are limited. The ef fect of government support on student enrolment in private higher -education institutions has been discussed in the international literature. A study conducted by Tierney (1980) analysed data gathered on new students. He found that student aid has a great effect on student choice in attending either private or public schools. Astin and Inouye (1988), looked at the effect of public policy on private higher education institutions, specifically student aid policy. Zumeta (199 6), also finds that with the variation among different states of USA , where he did his study, as to policies of private higher education, there was an obvious correlation between the policies . With the increase of student aid, there was an increase in enrolment in private higher education institutions, particularly of students from low -to-middle income families. These same patterns seem to be emerging in the KLQJGRP\u00b7V\u0003SULYDWH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003V ector with 227 increased government financial support and --just as important --recognition of the value of these institutions. It is the case that the public universities, facing increasing demand, have adopted more restrictive admission standards. This in t urn has placed more demand on the private sector. 228 Conclusion In this chapter, I have focused on the relationship between the private sector and the Government in the Saudi context. This relationship is of a complicated nature, as it evolves from one stage to another, changed by new policies and regulations. While private higher education i n the KSA was initiated by the government rather than the private sector, the government was perceived as being a reluctant partner. Planning, implementation, and decision -making were hesitant and characterised by what has been called \u00b6experimental, trial and error approach \u00b7. 7KH\u0003*RYHUQPHQW\u00b7V\u0003VWDQFH\u0003WRZDUGV\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0003FKDQJHG\u0003IURP\u0003EHLQJ\u0003UHOXFWDQW\u0003 about approving the private sector, to inviting the private sector to participate in higher education provision but with detailed regulations, to gradual ly supporting it financially. Overall, the Government plays a major role in the development of private higher education, for without its suspect of the private sector, higher education would still be entirely dominated by public institutions. From the per spective of regulations alone, Saudi Government may have appeared to be pro -active, as the Government appears more concerned about controlling the private sector than facilitating its development and integration into the higher education system. Licensing and accreditation requirements preceded the establishment of private institutions. On the other hand, the Government could be considered as reactive to the slow growth in the private sector by allowing profit -making private institutions to attract private investment and through providing scholarships to students in private institutions. 229 Chapter 11 Concluding Thoughts Through this thesis, I intend to present my readers with a multi -faceted analysis that will help them better understand the role of the private sector in the higher education system, and also in the changing society of a modern Middle East country such as Saudi Arabia. I have examined the private higher education in Saudi Arabia from three perspectives: regional -historical, institution al and socio -political. This was in an attempt to answer my research questions: 1, What are the contributing factors behind the emergence and development of private higher education in the KSA ? 2, To what extent is the Saudi private higher education sector perceived to be distinct from the public sector? 3, What are the wider implications of private higher education for the higher education system and the country in general? My thesis, accordingly, was organised into four Parts. Part I and II looked into the rise and early development of the private sector mainly from a historical angle. Part III examined the perceptions of the private sector among the different stakeholders involved - students, admi nistrators, faculty members, policy makers and employers, and the extent to which the private sector addresses limitations in the public sector of higher education. Part IV explored the role of the private sector in a wider socio -political context, by look ing at the use of English language in the sector as a symbolic interaction between the country and the outside world, and also the changing relationship between the sector and the central government. In this concluding chapter, however, I would like to su mmarise my findings in a slightly different format for the avoidance of a dreary repetition of previous discussions. To do so, I go back to the title of this thesis and address the keywords one by one - emergence, development, and perceptions of private hi gher education in Saudi Arabia. I then go a step further in discussing some of the bigger issues that emerge from my previous chapters, such as social class, gender equity, globalisation, cultural identity, etc. These issues are explored in relationship to the debate of public goods versus private goods, or social benefits and private gains of higher education. I then return to an early assumption 230 regarding the role of private higher education - whether it provides more, better or different education. The t hesis ends with my recommendations for various stakeholders of private higher education in Saudi Arabia. But before the summary of my findings, I would like to reflect upon the methodology of my empirical work, in particular its limitations. Methodology and Limitations There were no published works on the emergence of private higher education in Saudi Arabia and its implications. I therefore adopted a qualitative research design which I felt was particularly appropriate for the kind of study I was und ertaking. The sector is so new that there is little understanding about its nature, and the extent to which it is different from the public sector. The nature and the distinctiveness of the private sector and the context in which both sectors exist are imp ortant things to consider while understanding the emergence of this new sector. Therefore the present study offers an opening for others to follow. From the beginning, I understood that my work would be exploratory. The basic outlines of my study topic were barely known. I believed that by gathering and analysing the perceptions of a broad variety of stakeholders, including students, academic and administrative staff, employers, and government officials, I would be able to present a provisional picture o f this field. My previous work as an administrator in a Saudi Arabian private college and my review of secondary literature on private higher education, as well as contemporary government documents, all contributed to the context of this research and the a nalysis of the data obtained. More than one hundred interviews were conducted, which were subjected to detailed thematic analysis. The result is a mosaic of informative, nuanced, and sometimes surprising perceptions. That mosaic is multifaceted, and despi te containing many common themes and sub -themes, it thus also contains some contradictory opinions, ZKLFK\u0003DUH\u0003DOO\u0003RQH\u0003ZRXOG\u0003H[SHFW\u0003RI\u0003\u00b6KXPDQ\u0003WUXWK\u00b7\u0011\u0003 Undertaking such a large number of interviews involved a considerable organisation of resources as well a s time. These interviews required transcribing into Arabic, then translating into English, prior to the thematic mapping process which was also very 231 time-intensive. As I was operating as a single researcher within the time frame of a PhD programme, resourc es were necessarily limited. The study sample was selected from one city only \u00b3Jeddah, involving four higher education institutions. Jeddah is representative because its higher education operates in a way which reflects the country as a whole. Most of the students interviewed were business subjects. I chose this major to unify my sample and also because it was a subject common to all three of the private institutions which I surveyed. I did some interviews, however, with other majors for control purposes, but these did not reveal any significant difference in perception. However, in a possible future study, it might be that students in the subjects of health sciences, such as medicine, would produce different opinion. All medical classes are in English and admission standards are very high in the public sector. To make a valid comparison between the two sectors I need to choose subjects available to students in both sectors. Business subjects are among the few that are offered by both public and private sect ors. It would thus be very useful to compare perceptions of quality in the health sciences in the public and private sectors. While I intended not to compare the private colleges involved, it must be said that I have not noticed a significant difference in the impressions of people of different colleges. The only noted difference was in relation to extracurricular activities, which appeared to have more presence in one institution than the others. Also there were not substantial differences in the percept ions of male and female participants. Another limitation in the study was that the difficulty for me to obtain access to current government officials, and much more so to get their perceptions on the record for my research. Obviously the research can muc h benefit from a richer source of personal perceptions of the key stakeholders of higher education. At the moment this remains extremely difficult especially for a female researcher as myself. Without a data input from the policy makers one can only specul ate on the decisions and intentions, and make a consideration of important higher education policies and practices based on second hand data. Based on my personal experience and observation of government officials I suspect I would be able to gain more inf ormation beyond mere diplomatic answers and official accounts. Therefore, in order to account for this process of avoidance, future research using other sources such as published statements could be accessed. 232 A primary reason for adopting the research approach employed in the present study is because the researcher wanted to open the investigation of this field for wider study. This is the first study of private higher education in Saudi Arabia since it emerged about a decade ago. As there is no publis hed research on this subject it is hoped that the present study can lead to further investigations, some of which may ask different questions and thus adopt different approaches. The exploratory, investigative approach adopted here was designed to broaden our awareness of how the emerging and expanding private higher education sector appears to those who are part of it.

Defining Private Higher Education in Saudi Arabia In Chapter 2, I discussed the perspectives for understanding private Higher Education, including funding, ownership, orientation, functions an d role, and governance. So what exactly counts as private higher education in Saudi Arabia? At this point, with all the analysis in previous chapter, it is perhaps easier for me to offer a clearer definition. The clearest distinctions between the private a nd the public sectors are the facts that - first, in Saudi Arabia, private institutions are those that are not owned by the government; and, second, private institutions charge tuition fees. Private higher education in Saudi Arabia is not owned by indivi duals but rather by companies and non -for profit organisations. While many governments around the world still have restrictions on for -profit higher education institutions, in Saudi Arabia it was not too long after the private sector came into existence th at the government waived this restriction. The government takes an equal stance in its relationship between for profit and non -for profit private higher education institutions. Both types of higher education institutions comply with government regulations and they both receive the same support from the government. The impact of institutional type on the performance and the seriousness of the institutions have not been investigated but it might worth further investigation. 233 Also, it is worth noticing that fo reign ownership is still not permitted in private higher education in Saudi Arabia. This is consistent with the conservative tradition in the political economy of Saudi Arabia. It is still unclear whether, or when, the government will allow this form of ow nership. However, if it is to be allowed, one may wonder how feasible it is for foreign providers to recruit qualified staff considering the existing private institutions are facing great difficulty in this regard. One may also be interested in the ways in which foreign ownership in private higher education affects the standard of educational provision, and leads to wider social changes. While the private sector enjoys more flexibility and less bureaucracy in its daily management than in its public count erpart, there is tight control from the government. Such a tight control is manifested through a series of policies and regulations that favour government intervention and supervision. At the moment the intention of this tight control is still not entirel y clear - whether the government is more concerned with the quality of educational provision in the private sector, or the possibilities that the private sector may act against the interests or preference of the government. The government is still uncertai n in its stance towards the private sector in terms of policy making, implementation and financial support. My concern about government control RYHU\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0003KHUH\u0003LV\u0003DERXW\u0003WKH\u0003ZD\\V\u0003LQ\u0003ZKLFK\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u00b7V\u0003LQQRYDWLRQ\u0003LV\u0003 affected. If the pri vate sector is to take a bigger role in the Higher Education sector in Saudi Arabia, the sector should be given more flexibility in its governance. Emergence I now move on to summarise my main findings in this thesis. With regard to the emergence of private higher education, I explored the early rise and development of the private sector in Saudi Arabia. As has been seen, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia faces a unique combination of challenges \u00b3historical, cultural, social, demographic and economic. These challenges each have a direct impact on the development and call for a better higher education system. The relationship between the ruling family and the Wahbi move ment has meant that religion has a profound effect on all aspects of Saudi life including education and economic development. Moreover, while the country has amassed great wealth from oil, developments in the country have been subject to the 234 unpredictable cycle of rising and falling oil prices. Pace of developments has been slower than the growth in demographics. $V\u0003P\\\u0003DQDO\\VLV\u0003LQ\u0003\u00033DUW\u0003,,\u0003VKRZV\u000f\u0003RQH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003JUHDWHVW\u0003FKDOOHQJHV\u0003IDFLQJ\u00036DXGL\u0003$UDELD\u00b7V\u0003 higher education sector is the gap between demand and sup ply. Findings suggest that the higher education system of the KSA is in need of private higher education, not as an elitist adjunct to a successful public higher education system, but as a necessary complementary element to a public system which not only l acks the capacity, but is also being challenged on many fronts. To some extent, one can argue that private higher HGXFDWLRQ\u0003LQ\u00036DXGL\u0003$UDELD\u0003KDV\u0003VXUJHG\u0003DV\u0003D\u0003UHVSRQVH\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003SXEOLF\u0003VHFWRU\u00b7V\u0003IDLOXUH\u0003WR\u0003PHHW\u0003 qualitative and quantitative demands on the sector. The higher education system barely expanded over a 30 -year period from the 1960s to the end of the 20th Century that was marked during the same period by significant population growth, as Table 4 shows. This created a critical lack of capacity and eventual ly affected the quality of the sector. The quality of education and graduates has been another shortcoming of the public sector, resulting in high unemployment rates among university graduates. Another underlying factor in the early rise of the private s HFWRU\u0003LV\u0003WKH\u0003JRYHUQPHQW\u00b7V\u0003 approval. As I mentioned in Chapter 10, no private higher education institutions existed before the Government approved the establishment of the first private college in 1998. Despite widespread recognition of the concerns relatin g to the public sector, it was only when the Government permitted the private sector to operate that it began to emerge. 7KLV\u0003FRQILUPV\u0003/HY\\\u00b7V\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0013 \u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014\u0013\u000f\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014\u0014 \u0003REVHUYDWLRQV\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003SURPRWLRQDO\u0003UROH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003 Government on the emergence of private higher educ ation in the Middle East. In Saudi Arabia this decision followed significant pressure and encouragement from private investors who had for years been asking to develop a private sector within higher education. There was delay, indecision, resistance, denia l--and lack of planning. Overall, there was a sense that the Government feared a loss of control. Also, regulations were very detailed from the beginning. The MOHE was given a supervisory role to ensure that private institutions complied with all regulati ons. Restrictive ownership requirements were set up. The academic programs were to be designed to meet labour market needs. New institutions must be licensed by the MOHE in order to operate. The requirements of the preliminary license are quite detailed and stringent. 235 Though it is still unclear why the government decided to allow the private sector to come into being, one would suspect that it was mainly due to the efforts of the private sector. The government appeared reluctant towards the introduction of the private sector, but perhaps it was becoming clearer to the government that the public sector was not entirely successful in higher education provision for the Saudi society. The private sector may have appeared as a reasonable choice for the governm ent at the time. Furthermore, the global pressure was perhaps stronger than any resistance from the Government. Global pressures which coloured the need for higher quality and more relevant higher education perhaps proved to be stronger than any tendency in government circles to maintain the status quo. The world -wide proliferation of high quality higher education, particularly in neighbouring Arab countries, together with the advent of the knowledge economy, may have produced a compelling momentum towards the encouragement of the private provision of higher education. I will discuss this further in the following section. Development Two things seem to contribute to the development of the private sector of HE in the .6$\u000f\u0003LWV\u0003GLVWLQFWLYHQHVV\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003JRYHUQPHQW\u00b7V\u0003FKDQJHG\u0003VWDQFH\u0003WRZDUGV\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003VHFWRU\u0011\u0003 For the former, we have seen that the private sector is distinctive in a number of perspectives, which were discussed in Chapters 6, 7, 8 and 9. A leading se lling-point for the promotion of the private sector, discussed in Chapter 9, has been its use of the medium of English instruction in contrast to Arabic -medium instruction in the public sector. The research identified that the use of the English medium was not just an important characteristic, but a defining one of the private sector, shared by all providers. It was also the reason why some young people chose private education, whereas others decided not to choose the private provision because they preferre d to study in the Arabic medium. The use of English is not simply a matter of linguistic fluency and capability but also signals and implies a change in course content and quality. The role English seems to play for these stakeholders is multifaceted, inc orporating educational, economic, social, and political dimensions. Even the small number of interviewees who expressed 236 criticism of the use of English was clearly reacting to a powerful social reality. Another aspect of this difference is the perception t hat command of English assists in employability. English was perceived to have a high value as a necessary skill in a globalised economy. It was considered the most important job faces challenges in maintaining its own recruitment of highly fluent English -language speakers to faculties. Providers of private higher education have difficulty finding qualified faculty. Recruiting non -Muslim or Western facu lty is difficult because of the restrictive way of life in the Kingdom. Furthermore, there is also a lack of locally produced English -language texts, along with lecturers who understand both the UK/USA contexts and that which prevails in the KSA. Moreover, that access into WKH\u0003 VHFWRU\u0003LV\u0003OLPLWHG\u0003 E\\\u0003 D\u0003VWXGHQW\u00b7V\u0003DELOLW\\\u0003 DQG\u0003ZLOOLQJQHVV\u0003WR\u0003VWXG\\\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003(QJOLVK\u0003 medium. A further concern is the extent to which the promotion of the use of the English medium can lead to a loss of a distinctively Arabic cultural ide ntity to the work of a higher education institution. I will discuss this point further in a following section. From the institutional perspective, the private sector is, first of all, distinctive in its admission policies, particularly the fact that it is more accessible for those who fail to get into the public system for reasons of academic requirements or national policies; and second, the provision of subjects that bear more relevance to a changing job market under the influence of a global economy. Moreover, private institutions are perceived as distinct for their smaller class sizes and IRU\u0003WKH\u0003\u00b6VSHFLDO\u0003DWWHQWLRQ\u00b7\u0003WKH\\\u0003JLYH\u0003WR\u0003WKHLU\u0003VWXGHQWV\u000f\u0003DV\u0003GLVFXVVHG\u0003LQ\u0003&KDSWHU\u0003\u001a\u0011\u00036WXGHQW - teacher ratios were favourably commented on by both students and facult y academics. ,Q\u0003SULYDWH\u0003LQVWLWXWLRQV\u000f\u0003FODVVHV\u0003DUH\u0003VPDOOHU\u0003DQG\u0003VWXGHQWV\u0003DUH\u0003JLYHQ\u0003PRUH\u0003\u00b6VSHFLDO\u0003DWWHQWLRQ\u00b7\u000f\u0003 which they value highly. Students are also able to make presentations in class, which is not the case in the public universities. Faculty find that s maller class sizes allow them to assign more demanding work which requires more time to grade.

Moreover, the presence of extracurricul ar activities is another perceived distinction and selling point for private institutions in Saudi Arabia, with its implication for student development and graduate employability. Furthermore, the private sector is also distinctive in the ways in which it prepares graduates for the job market. A linkage of higher education to the labour market is a key concern in a country with high levels of unemployment among its Saudi nationals. My 237 discussion in Chapter 8 suggests that Saudi private higher education is better linked to the labour market than the public sector, which also echoes global trends in private higher education as discussed by Levy (1986a, 2006b, 2009, 2010b) and Cao (2008). In addition to the use of the English language and the market -orientatio n of the majors offered, internships and practical learning are found to be other distinct practices for Saudi private higher education which are related to the labour market. The private Higher Education sector has managed to establish more effective net works for connections with the private sector in the market such as through career centres and events and activities hosted by the private institutions. Last, but not least, the presence of extracurricular activities is another perceived distinction and selling point for private institutions in Saudi Arabia, with its implication for student development and graduate employability. All stakeholders perceived those activities as having a greater emphasis in the private sector. This included international field trips, sports, clubs, workshops, seminars and lectures. Graduates of private institutions are perceived to be better equipped with soft skills which are believed to be important for employers. Employers who were interviewed believed that extracurricul ar activities better prepared student graduates for the real world and helped to develop their personalities. Public sector faculty members noted the many bureaucratic limits on offering such activities in their schools. Private sector students valued the particular efforts made by their institutions to provide such activities. One third of the interviewees understood extracurricular activities to be valuable in developing SHUVRQDOLWLHV\u0003DQG\u0003VNLOOV\u0011\u0003$V\u0003D\u0003UHVXOW\u000f\u0003WKH\\\u0003IHOW\u0003WKHPVHOYHV\u0003WR\u0003EH\u0003\u00b6EHWWHU\u0003URXQGHG\u00b7\u0011\u00036 tudent union activities and student elections in the private sector were also enthusiastically received.

The analysis shows that the Government stance towards private higher education has changed from denial, to reluctance, to experiment and to partial support. I believe that the Government plays an important role in the deve lopment of private higher education in Saudi Arabia through the implementation of quality control policies. The National Commission for Academic 238 Assessment and Accreditation (NCAAA) was set up in 2004 as an independent body to further assess these institut ions and to accredit them. Another contributing factor to the development of the private sector is the Government financial support to the private sector. Initially, the Government did lease land for these institutions. Soft loans were also offered but in terviewees complained that private providers had to put up one WKLUG\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003ORDQ\u00b7V\u0003YDOXH --which was too much. Moreover, the introduction of student scholarships to private institutions has led to a growth in the number of students enrolled in the sector, but so far no student loan programs have been made available by the Government or by the banking sector. There is as yet no culture of endowment as these institutions are still very new. Overall, the Government plays a significant role in the development of private higher education with its detailed regulations and its financial support. Perceptions Throughout my analysis in Part III and IV, I have presented the overall perceptions of the private sector. However, I am not suggestin that there were no va riations among these percetions. In this section, I would like to highlight some differences in the perceptions of various groups of stakeholders that can lead to further research. For the stakeholders, I refer to mainly three groups in the following disc ussion - students, faculty members and employers. I also examine the possible differences between the public and private sectors. First, there was a disagreement over the choice of the private sector. Some view private higher education to be a place for low achievers while some see it as a place for a better quality of higher education provision. The question here is rather to what extent admission requirements affect the quality of higher education provision at private institutions - if students are enro lled at a lower requirement, to what extent can they catch up with a higher quality education provision? And how do we evaluate the quality of a given higher education insitution - by its capacity in producing graduates who are professioanlly adequate or b y its admission policies that favour applicants who are academically capable? It sounds somehow paradoxical, while the public sector is more selective in enrolment, the quality of education delivered is highly questionable. And also, the labour market appe ars to favour graduates from the private sector over those from the public sector. For this point, I tend to agree with Cross (1974, P.87) who 239 DUJXHV\u0003WKDW\u0003\u00b4WKH\u0003TXDOLW\\\u0003DQG\u0003LQGHHG\u0003VXFFHVV\u0003RI\u0003+(\u0003GHSHQGV\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003IXOILOPHQW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003QHZ\u0003 task It is not to select t hose who will be successful but to make successful those who FRPH\u0003\u00b5\u0011 6HFRQG\u000f\u0003UHJDUGLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003QRWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003\u00b6TXDOLW\\\u00b7\u0003LQ\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003SURYLVLRQ\u000f\u0003VWXGHQWV\u0003LQ\u0003ERWK\u0003 sectors favour certain practices in the private sector, such as small class size and special attention to individual students.

Students in the private sector complain that teachers are not entirely competent, while teachers tend to blame students for their lack of basic language skills, and employers are still not entirely satisfied with the English language competence of pr ivate institutions graduates even if they were better than public sector graduates. One must investigate this matter a bit further in order to better understand the cause of the problem. The private sector is capable of further improving its educational pr ovision in English, but first, it must also 240 address this issue properly. If students are not adequately prepared, they should be requested to take longer training in academic English; if faculty members are not competent enough, the private sector should m ake greater efforts securing better teaching staff; if employers are demanding graduates of higher English language competence, the private sector can also involve them in curriculum design procedure in this regard. Last, but not least, in a comparison b etween the private sector and international standards, students within the privates hold slightly different opinions - some regard the private sector as a desirable alternative to overseas studies, while those who are exposed to overseas education before b elieve that there is still a gap between the two. Here, those two groups hold different standards of quality of higher education. The former compare the private sector with its local public counterpart, while the latter use international standards. Also, e mployers are aware of this gap perceived by the latter group, as they tend to prefer overseas returners than local graduates from the private sector. This perhaps indicates that the private sector, though regarded as providing higher quality education than its local public sector, has a lot to catch up with to match international standards - it is after all a young sector in its early stage of development in various aspects. The role of private higher education in the KSA, public or private good? In this section, I intend to briefly discuss some contentious issues that emerged from my analysis in this thesis that bear wider social implications, such as social class, gender equity, and globalisation, etc. These issues are beyond the scope of the inqu iry in this thesis. In this section, I therefore discuss their relevance to the Saudi context, and also suggest further questions for future studies. There is no agreement over the extent to which higher education is a public or private good (see Teixeira & Dill, 2011 ). The situation varies greatly from country to country, from era to era. One key issue in this debate is the distribution of the cost of higher education - to what extent higher education s hould be understood as a public good and therefore paid for by the society (through tax, for instance) that benefits from an increase in the growth of professional personnel, knowledge and economy, or as a 241 private good and therefore paid for by individuals (through tuition fees) who most directly benefit from their participation in higher education. In a number of European countries such as France, higher education remains free for everyone (Windolf 1997). But in some other countries, higher education is in creasingly regarded as a private good. For instance, in England, higher education was regarded as mainly a public good before a market philosophy prevailed - universities did not charge tuition fees and received stable funding from government (see Barr 199 3 for instance). However, since 1998, the tuition fee has risen from a maximum of 1,000 pounds to a maximum of 9,000 pounds in 20121. Students are widely described as customers or consumers of higher education, and are, therefore, requested to share the cost. Higher education, accordingly, is increasingly regarded as a form of private good that is subject to certain rule and regulations of a market of educational credentials and experiences. The University of Exeter, for instance, has recently introduced some new policies and practices for its \u00b6 \u000f\u0013\u0013\u0013\u0003SRXQGV\u0003H[SHULHQFH\u00b7\u0003FDPSDLJQ2.

I am not to discuss the role of the entire higher education system, but only focus on the private sector. In particular, I want to explore , apart from its most noticeable contribution to private gains such as a quality experience and employability, to what extent the private sector also contributes to wider social gains. 1 see for instance this BBC report by Sean Coughlan, Tuition fees set to rise next year, available at http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education -18984938 , last accessed on 1st October, 2012. 2 see Times Higher Education Supplement report by Rebecca Attwood Exeter goes to the top of the cap, available at http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=415355 , last accessed on 1st October, 2012. 242 Private Higher Education and the Private Benefits The private higher education sector in Saudi Arabia is perhaps more of a private good. This is evident from my previous discussions.

For future studies, it will be interesting to explore the private gains of students in Saudi Arabia, either in the public or the private sector, or both, through their participation of higher education, in particular how students themselves interpret and understand these benefits. Private Higher Education and the Public Benefits One must be cautious in applying this discussion of public benefits to the Saudi context. To begin with, f actors that have been widely discussed in existing literatures, such as citizenship and democratic values, are not readily applicable to the Saudi context. The kingdom is ruled by religious laws and has a very different political system than a modern democ racy. To what extent these factors commonly used in Western settings can be applied to Saudi Arabia is open to further examination. Second, the private higher education sector is mainly teaching oriented, with now only one exception - the King Abdullah Uni versity for Science and Technology; research is not a main concern of the private sector at the moment. 243 Training the New Professionals 3HUKDSV\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003PRVW\u0003UHOHYDQW\u0003IDFWRU\u0003LQ\u0003WKLV\u0003UHJDUG\u0003LV\u0003\u00b6WKH\u0003WUDLQLQJ\u0003RI\u0003KLJKO\\\u0003 TXDOLILHG\u0003 SHUVRQQHO\u00b7\u0011\u0003 $V\u0003 P\\\u0003 SUHYLRXV\u0003 G iscussion shows, the private sector is believed to outperform the public sector in preparing its graduates for employment - students from the private sector are better equipped with English language skills, professional attitudes, work ethics and a global way of thinking, which could benefit the society and the economy in the long term. $\u0003UHODWHG\u0003LVVXH\u0003LV\u0003WKH\u0003SROLF\\\u0003RI\u0003\u00b66DXGLULVDWLRQ\u00b7\u0003WKDW\u0003LQWHQGV\u0003WR\u0003UHGXFH\u0003WKH\u0003FRXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003KHDY\\\u0003 reliance on foreign workers, and gradually replace them with Saudis. One may ask whether the private sector is acting against such policies by providing higher education opportunities to non -Saudi applicants. I want to point out that non -Saudis with a university degree and above only accounted for a small part of the total employment (5.56% in 20083). The majority of the non -Saudi workers are without any qualifications or with only primary education (68.7% of the total employment of non -Saudis in 20084), and are therefore excluded from the competition for high end jobs in the market. Though the exact statistic is not available at the moment, one may conclude that the proportion of non -Saudi graduates from the private sector in the job market is perhaps minimal. In other words, even if the private sector provides educational opportuniti es to non-Saudi students, they account for so small a proportion of the total employment as WR\u0003UDLVH\u0003QR\u0003FRQFHUQ\u0003IRU\u0003WKH\u0003JHQHUDO\u0003\u00b46DXGLDLVDWLRQ\u00b5\u0003SURFHVV\u0011\u0003 However, the ratio of foreign workers in the private sector is a different matter. It appears that fo reign faculty is the dominant group in private higher education institutions. Statistics from 2009 show that out of 1,537 employees in the private sector, 1,186 are non -Saudis - that is 77%. In comparison, in the public sector, non -Saudis account for 35.5% of the total employment5. Apparently, the ratio of non -Saudi workers is much higher in the private higher education.

For instance, in the United States, private universities such as Harvard and Yale are traditionally associated with social class. They charge higher tuition fees than their public counterparts, and attract students from privileged family backgrounds. This phenomenon has been studied widely in for instance), all intend to reveal or better understand the relationship between private (highe r) education, educational elitism and social class. A large number of studies argue that social class, measured by family LQFRPH\u0003RU\u0003SDUHQW\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u000f\u0003HWF\u0011\u000f\u0003KDV\u0003D\u0003SRVLWLYH\u0003LPSDFW\u0003RQ\u0003FKLOGUHQ\u00b7V\u0003FKDQFH\u0003LQ\u0003TXDOLW\\\u0003 education, and in the case of higher education , the elite sector (private universities/colleges in the United States, and Oxbridge in the United Kingdom for instance). It would appear that the access to the elite higher education sector plays an LPSRUWDQW\u0003UROH\u0003LQ\u0003RQH\u00b7V\u0003VRFLDO\u0003PRELOLW\\\u000f\u0003ZKHWKHU\u0003LW\u0003LV\u0003W o achieve upward mobility or to maintain family social privilege. Looking back at the private sector in Saudi Arabia, one may wonder whether it will, following the footsteps of the American counterparts, become the elite sector of higher education in the near future. Although the sector is at its early stage of development, some of its practices tend to suggest its strategic vision - its relatively high tuition fee, its closer link to the global economy, and its focus on the quality of educational p rovision. The sector is already attracting students from wealthy family backgrounds, though it remains unclear who exactly these students are by the usual sociological measurements, such as their parental occupation and education, family income, etc.. Or p erhaps, considering the socio -political hierarchy of Saudi Arabia (the substantial number of royal family members), one is also curious about the role of the private sector in SURGXFLQJ\u0003D\u0003QHZ\u0003VRFLDO\u0003JURXS\u000f\u0003LI\u0003QRW\u0003D\u0003FODVV\u000f\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003FRXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003VORZ\u0003EXW\u0003JUDGXDO\u0003 socio - economic transition. 245 At this moment, there are a number of questions regarding the future development of the private higher education sector in Saudi Arabia that deserve our attention: Will the private sector play an significant role in producing ne w social and/or intellectual elites of Saudi Arabia who are exposed to quality higher education and subject to a global mentality? Or will the private sector be crucial to social mobility of the domestic social elites? Or rather perhaps, will the private s ector become the elite sector in Saudi Arabia in the near future, or become instead the incubator of the new middle class? The answers to these questions are far from being clear at this moment. It is for future studies to investigate. Therefore, it is p erhaps early to discuss the impact of private higher education on social class in Saudi Arabia, as the country is yet to see a clearer stratification among social classes by the standards used in most European or American studies. Before further studies id entify the shape of social classes in Saudi Arabia, and the factors that can be used to identify one social class from another, there is not much we can say about this issue at the moment. On the other hand, there is evidence of a positive impact on educ ational equity. The private sector in Saudi Arabia has managed to provide access to those who are otherwise denied from higher education, in particular the non -Saudis. As my previous discussion indicates, the public sector only accepts Saudi students, and students of foreign nationalities were once forced to leave the countries for access to higher education before the private sector came into existence. Also, the private sector has been more willing to accommodate demands of female students in terms of the subjects of studies available. This will be further discussed in the following section. Nonetheless, one should not overlook the fact that relatively high tuition fees are charged by the private institutions. This implies that the private sector is main ly accessible for students from the affluent family background. Those who are less financially capable can only resort to a limited number of scholarships, or choose the public sector instead. To what extent the private sector will be dominated by the soci ally privileged in Saudi Arabia remains unclear at the moment. 246 Gender Equity Gender equity is among the most discussed issues in internal news magazines such as Time, Newsweek, The Economist, etc. and regional studies of the Middle East, Saudi Arabia being no exception6. As an Islamic state, Saudi Arabia is subject to a long history and tradition of gender segregation. However, I do not wish to engage in a discussion of the legitimacy of this history and tradition at this moment, as it is a complicated issue that involve s many factors such as religious belief, war history and social convention. I will limit my discussion to the role of the private higher education sector in gender equity in Saudi Arabia. As my previous discussion has shown, the private higher education sector has introduced a number of practices that favour gender equity, such as new subjects of studies that suit female students. These subjects will, slowly but surely, help their female graduates to step into a wider spectrum of professions. The private sector appears to be more flexible than its public counterpart in accommodating the demands of female students, but in an Islamic state such as Saudi Arabia, the private sector needs to tread carefully - it needs to cautiously test the social acceptance of these changes and fit the general pace of socio -cultural reforms. The relationship between the new practices of the private higher education sector and wider social changes is unclear - whether the private sector is mainly echoing the social changes that are already taking place, or the private sector is leading social changes, or the innovations of the private sector are gathering momentum for wider social changes to come. But one message is clear; the private sector is making a positive contribution to g ender equity by providing female students with wider access to higher education and new professions in the job markets. The recent years have witnessed other new practices in private institutions in Saudi Arabia. For instance, the King Abdullah Universit y for Science and Technology recently EHFDPH\u0003WKH\u0003FRXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003ILUVW\u0003PL[HG -gender university. Opened in September 2009, this 6 http://www.economist.com/node/21557327 last accessed on 1st October, 2012. 247 private university is located near Jeddah, and is designed to produce Saudi scientists7. Only in this university can male and female st udents mix. However, this new practice of \u00b6FR-HGXFDWLRQ\u00b7\u0003ZDV\u0003QRW\u0003ZLWKRXW\u0003VWURQJ\u0003RSSRVLWLRQ\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003XQLYHUVLW\\\u0003ZDV\u0003RQFH\u0003DW\u0003WKH\u0003 heart of debates between liberal and conservative scholars in the country. This is yet another example of how social changes can only happen at a small scale and a slow pace in an Islamic state such as Saudi Arabia. It remains unclear for how long this practice can continue, or whether it will be adopted by other institutions in the future. There is one more issue to be taken in to account in this discussion. One may easily take for granted that gender equity can be measured by certain universal standards, such as education and occupation. But I would argue, for an Islamic society such as Saudi Arabia, some new standards or measur ements need to be developed. These standards or measurements must be sensitive to local culture and history, and must not blindly follow any existing practices and procedures of other countries. Future studies in this regard should pay attention to this po int. Furthermore, one should also be aware of some challenges, if not negative impacts, of this process of greater gender equity on the Saudi society. For this, I would like to add some personal observations. In some of the private institutions, students a re encouraged to develop their own personalities through classroom teaching and extra -curricular activities, and some students, especially females, DUH\u0003EHFRPLQJ\u0003PRUH\u0003\u00b6DPELWLRXV\u00b7\u0011\u0003,\u0003DP\u0003DZDUH\u0003WKDW\u0003WKLV\u0003ZRUG\u0003KDV\u0003D\u0003SRVLWLYH\u0003PHDQLQJ\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003 English language, but it may not be so in the Saudi context - we are nonetheless females. For everyone involved in this debate of gender equity in Saudi Arabia, I would like to remind them of this point. Another interesting point here is about the government stance toward gender policies and practices in the private sector. Evidently, the private sector enjoys more flexibility and freedom in this regard. Some novel practice s such as co -education of male and females students are first implemented in private institutions. One would speculate that the government is using the private sector as a testing field for controversial issues - if there is little resistance in the genera l society, the government can gradually introduce these new policies and practices to the public sector. 7 please see http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2009/10/05/king for full stories. 248 Cultural Identity at the time of Globalisation From the early history of this relatively young kingdom, Saudi Arabia was subject to a certain degree of foreign presence in its social, political, and economic policies and practices.

A final point before I move on to the next section - one should also not over -estimate the impact of globalisation on Saudi higher education in general. Apart from the use of English in the private sector, there are few signs of globalisation in the c RXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003KLJKHU\u0003 education system. Up till now, no international institutions are allowed to have their campuses in Saudi Arabia, and hardly any online foreign degrees are recognised by the government; such programs are therefore not covered by the scholars hip programmes. The influence of globalisation is yet to be further investigated. 250 Understanding Private Higher Education in Saudi Arabia - More? Better? Different?

In the following half -decade this remains to be the case, despite some growth. His study recommended an ambitious plan of opening between 122 and 244 new private colleges by 2030 (2007, p. 414). Therefore the option of expanding the private higher education sector must remain under consideration, especially since expansion has not been happening at a sufficient rate t hrough the public sector. *HLJHU\u00b7V\u0003FDWHJRU\\\u0003RI\u0003\u00b6PRUH\u00b7\u0003ZDV\u0003PRVW\u0003W\\SLFDOO\\\u0003DVVRFLDWHG\u0003ZLWK\u0003FRXQWULHV\u0003ZLWK\u0003D\u0003VPDOO\u0003 public higher education sector, which have restrictive admission standards.

Irrespective of this lack of evidence, the majority of stakeholders interviewed in this study gave strong indications that, in their view, the private sector was providing something they viewed to be better. They highlighted the prevalence of the English medium, access to better educational resources, and better quality of some teaching , while class sizes were smaller and students were given more personal attention, and more majors were offered for more students who could not obtain them in the public sector. There have been perceptions that private institutions are there for the chil dren of the wealthy elite who achieved low high school grades and thus could not gain admission into competitive public universities. Initially, private institutions were less selective in their admissions because of the difficulty in attracting students t o new colleges of a kind which had never existed before. But as these institutions have gradually proved their worth and have become better known, and as government scholarship support has increased, the private colleges are becoming more selective. It sho uld be noted that students who receive these government scholarships must meet the same high academic standards as Saudi Arabian citizens who study abroad on scholarships. It remains to be seen how well the private institutions will do in terms of academic performance. We must await further comparative evaluation between the therefore, not be translated uncritically into a discourse focused upon realities in Saudi Arabia. One example of this was the research -rich focus within a university like Harvard, which places it above almost all others in terms of assessed quality. Such a criterion cannot be used to distinguish between public and private sectors in Saudi Arabia, as the private sector is still mainly teaching oriented. $QRWKHU\u0003EURDG\u0003DUHD\u0003RI\u0003SULYDWH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003ZKLFK\u0003VKRXOG\u0003EH\u0003SODFHG\u0003LQ\u0003*HLJHU\u00b7V\u0003 FDWHJRU\\\u0003RI\u0003\u00b6EHWWHU\u00b7\u0003DUH\u0003WKH\u0003YDULRXV\u0003DFWLYLWLHV\u0003ZKLFK\u0003KHOS\u0003WR\u0003OLQN\u0003VWXGHQWV\u0003ZLWK\u0003WKH\u0003ODERXU\u0003 252 market, a key point in a country with high levels of unemployment among Saudi Arabian nationals.

They also admit students who may not be underachievers but are simply not ranked at the top of their cohort, and thus fail to access courses for which only small numbers are admitted in public universities. For all such social groups, private colleges and universities offer the opportunity for a higher educati on. The greater access available to a more diverse student population again presents a marked difference. Although private higher education colleges may not make a public point about saying so, they operate open enrolment policies, accepting anyone from an y background. The institutions are, therefore, different from public sector colleges, which are required to operate under fairly strict religious guidance and control. $QRWKHU\u0003VHQVH\u0003LQ\u0003ZKLFK\u0003*HLJHU\u0003XVHG\u0003WKH\u0003FDWHJRU\\\u0003\u00b6GLIIHUHQW\u00b7\u0003DULVHV\u0003IURP\u0003VLPSO\\\u0003QRW\u0003 being the norm -the public.

The private sector has the possibility of providing better quality education than is provided in the public sector, but time will tell whether this really is the case. Therefore private higher education has emerged in Saudi Arabia to address the demands which the public sector has fallen short of addressing. The demands are not limited to the capacity of the sector, but are also for a different quality of education, new professions, and the need for better quality graduates. The private sector of higher education has the tools t o provide different and better education, but still faces some challenges which might hinder its success. 254 Looking to the Future: Concerns and Recommendations In this final section of the thesis, I would like to express my concerns about the private higher education sector and make some recommendations to various perspectives and stakeholders of private higher education in Saudi Arabia. Teaching, Learning and Research It is clear that the use of English as the medium of instruction, with the goal of producing fluent graduates, is very important to all stakeholders. It is seen as an essential factor in employability and as the gateway to the global economy. It is also linked to access to high quality publications and software, as well as to majors in t he sciences. Therefore, further emphasis should be placed on English -language skills at the secondary education level, both public and private. Additionally, greater emphasis should be placed on enhancing the English skills of teachers in higher education. The private sector should invest more in developing its own high -quality teachers, rather WKDQ\u0003\u00b6ERUURZLQJ\u00b7\u0003IURP\u0003WKH\u0003SXEOLF\u0003VHFWRU\u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003ZLOO\u0003UHTXLUH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003SD\\\u0003IRU\u0003WHDFKHUV\u0011\u0003:KLOH\u0003 emphasising English, the private sector must make a balance with cultural traditions: Arabic instruction should not be given lesser importance in secondary education as it now sometimes is. More majors should be made available, especially in those specialties most needed by the labour market, such as medicine, engineering, and t he sciences. Practical learning is very well received by students and should be developed and expanded. Internships are also greatly valued by students. More of them should be made available, which will require coordination with the labour market. Private institutions should, however, be clearer about what they want from employers. Extracurricular activities also receive very favourable responses from students and employers as a means of both personal development and better preparation for the job market, which will help students in developing sound personal qualities for their future employment. Punctuality, attitudes, and work habits should be addressed in course work, practical learning classes, or in workshops or seminars offered by school career centre s. Early job success may depend on these simple factors. 255 Private higher education institutions in the KSA echo the global trend in focusing on teaching. With the exception of the recently established King Abdullah University, they do not have many links with research. Research is to varying degrees an important function of public higher education in many countries. This is not so in the KSA.

Governance, Collaboration and Funding An independent body should be formed by those institutions to represent their collective interests with the Government and as a forum for information exchange. There is also a great wealth of information on the experience of private higher education in the rest of the world, which would be useful to those institutions now emerging in the country. More collaboration between private universities is needed to cope with challenges such as faculty recruitment. A concept like that of independent colleges in the USA would be beneficial. The MOHE has a body which deals with private institutions, but these institutions might benefit more if they also have a body which can liaise with the Government as a whole, especially in relation to challenges such as shortages of faculty and instructors. Private institutions should continuously assess their contribution and benchmark themselves against other reputable higher education institutions. Some private stakeholders in the Kingdom may be content with comparing their inst itutions with the public sector, but they would be found wanting when judged with international standards. The Government might want to consider strategies other than quality assurance mechanisms, to enhance quality, e.g. by allowing the establishment of branches of reputable international universities to create a competitive market in higher education and thus raise standards. 256 Private institutions need to consider entrepreneurial activities to generate funds which would allow them to prosper with or wit hout government financial support. With rising oil prices and healthy budgetary surpluses, the Saudi Government could easily continue WR\u0003VXSSRUW\u0003WKH\u0003SULYDWH\u0003KLJKHU\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003VHFWRU\u0011\u00037KH\u0003FKDOOHQJH\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003VHFWRU\u00b7V\u0003ILQDQFLDO\u0003 stability would be acute, should t he State face financial challenges of its own and seek to resort to austerity measures. The private sector will then have to seek other ways of balancing the books. Graduate V\u00b7 Employment In term of the labour market, there is at present inadequate bas ic data about what jobs are available in the country, in what numbers and what skills they require. Research should be undertaken to gather this information and to make it widely available and up to date, as job trends are ever changing in a rapidly develo ping economy. The job skill most often mentioned by employers \u00b3English fluency \u00b3needs critical examination. Is this a necessary job skill across the globe or is it something many employers seek for prestige, or in the sense that graduates who speak English a re smarter? How much English is really needed and for which jobs? The answer to those simple questions would significantly impact upon educational policy. There is no doubt that English is required for some jobs in international business and finance, but the job skills of non - English -speaking Saudi Arabians should not be overlooked either. As noted, internships are held in high esteem by students. But it appears that many employers are not ready for them yet. Ensuring that the training period is longer (s ix months) seems to give employers greater incentive to train, trust, and eventually hire graduates whom they know from intern positions. More structure seems to be needed for these internship programmes. This would require greater communication between the labour market and private institutions. Employers find career centres and career days to be useful for contacting and recruiting students, so those centres should be well funded. In particular, female students have difficulty in finding workplaces for th eir internships and employment. Employers should make increased efforts to train them. They are a vital and underused human resource for the Kingdom and are currently moving through the education system in greater numbers than males. 257 The Role of Governm ent With regard to the role of the Government, it has been a tentative and inconsistent force in recognising the private higher education sector. A number of stakeholders expressed their frustration that the Government did not understand the private secto r as D\u0003SDUWQHU\u0003LQ\u0003PHHWLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003FRXQWU\\\u00b7V\u0003HGXFDWLRQDO\u0003QHHGV\u0011\u0003)LQDQFLDOO\\\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003*RYHUQPHQW\u0003KDV\u0003 increased the amount of scholarships in the private sector to cover up to 50 % of students enrolled. Not all of these scholarships pay full tuition costs, despite th e high academic standards which students must meet to receive them. In fact, those standards are the same required of Saudi students who study abroad. In contrast, the Government pays all of the tuition and a monthly stipend to public sector students, so t here is hardly a level playing field between the two sectors. A further question from some stakeholders was, why there are so many subsidies for Saudi Arabian students to study abroad (at greater cost) when they could be educated in their own country thro ugh an expanded private sector? The Government could provide greater support to the private sector by leasing more government land for campuses. Soft loans could be offered. The Government could also take a direct role in providing low -interest student loa ns, or at least put pressure on the banking sector to do so.

Foreign ownership should be permitted. Additionally, the Government should allow branches of international universities to be established in the Kingdom (as has been rece ntly happening with its Gulf neighbours). This would provide high -quality standards and create greater competition. The Ministry of Labour has more to accomplish to assess the specific needs of the ODERXU\u0003PDUNHW\u0003UHJDUGLQJ\u0003XQLYHUVLW\\\u0003JUDGXDWHV\u00b7\u0003VNLOOV\u0003DQG qualifications. Still there is little 258 basic information about this critical area. It has been suggested by administrators in the private sector that the MOHE should coordinate between the Ministries of Labour and Planning and the Saudi Arabian Monetary Ag ency (SAMA) as higher education policies and budgeting are currently divided between them, which results in delay, confusion, and inaction. No one wants to take the initiative to coordinate policy. More staff is needed within the MOHE, which is knowledgeab le about private higher education. A recommendation has been made to appoint a Deputy Minister for Private Higher Education, someone specifically focused on that sector and with knowledge of its operations and needs. The licensing process should be clarifi ed, streamlined, and made to operate in a timely, predictable manner. For example, after eight years in existence, the NCAAA waited until July 2012 to accredit the first three private institutions. There should also be greater flexibility in applying regul ations, as not all private higher education is the same. Again, the public sector universities are not subjected to these time -consuming and costly requirements. Although they are examined by the NCAAA for quality, the evaluations which result seem not to affect public university budgets. Those budgets should at the very least be performance -based. The Government may want to consider other forms of partnership with the private sector, which are not limited to financial support, but rather offer collaborati on at management level and the sharing of physical resources. There should be less sensitivity between the two sectors of higher education. The Government might want to consider partnerships between public and private institutions, so as to reduce some of the challenges facing them and ensure the continuity of a successful private sector. Coordination and cooperation between the public and the private sectors should encompass academic programmes and information -exchange in all areas. The MOHE might want to expand the ministerial body in charge of private higher education and staff it with capable individuals to deal with the private sector. Staff within the MOHE whose work methods and culture may have worked well for the public sector need to be complemente d by individuals who are in tune with the particular needs and problems of the private sector. It was incongruous to expect individuals steeped in the culture of serving the public sector of education to be able to succeed in planning and guiding the priva te sector. 259 At this point, I now end my discussion here with a hope that my research will contribute to a better understanding of private higher education in Saudi Arabia, and of the change and challenges faced by this modern Middle East country. 260 Appendices 261 Appe ndix ( 1): Partial list of New Universities and Colleges in the Gulf Name and Date of Founding Location Gulf Centre For University Education - 1992 Kuwait University of Wollongoing In Dubai - 1993 Dubai, United Arab Emirates American University, Dubai - 1995 Dubai, United Arab Emirates Majan University - 1995 Oman Caledonian College of Engineering - 1996 Oman Modern College of Business and Science - 1996 Oman Muscat Colloge - 1996 Oman Dubai Polytechnic - 1997 Dubai, United Arab Emirates Univeristy of Sharjah - 1997 Sharjah, United Arab Emirates American University of Sharjah - 1997 Sharjah, United Arab Emirates Zayed University - 1998 United Arab Emirates Mazoon University - 199 Oman Ittihad University - 1999 Ras Al Kahimaj, United Arab Emirates AlZahra Colloege For womed Oman Australion University of Kuwait - 2000 Kuwait Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilanie - 2000 Dubai, United Arab Emirates Sohar Uninversity -2000 Oman Oman Medical College - 2001 Oman Gulf Ubiversity, Bahrain -2001 Bahrain Gulf University, Bahrain - 2001 Bahrain Preston University, Ajman - 2001 Ajman, United Arab Emirates Sur University College - 2001 Oman Waljat College of Applied Sciences - 2001 Oman Arab Open University - 1997 Saudia Arabia, Oman, Bahrain Middle East College of Information Technology - 2002 Oman Weston Reserve University - 2003 Kuwait Carnegie Mellon, Qatar Campus - 2003 Qatar Al Buraimi College - 2003 Oman Dhofar University - 2004 Oman Nizwa University - 2004 Oman Royal University for Women - 2004 Bahrain American University of Kuwait - 2004 Kuwait British University in Dubai - 2004 Dubai, United Arab Emirates Scientific College of Design - 2004 Oman Oman College of Management and Technology - 2004 Oman Gulf College - 2004 Oman Middlesex University, Dubai Campus - 2005 Dubai, United Arab Emirates Georgetown University, Edmund A.
