Learn more about the program here. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a federal program of the Social Security Administration (SSA). SSI provides monthly payments to certain eligible, low-income individuals who are 65 or older, blind, or disabled. Massachusetts provides additional payments called the State Supplement Program (SSP). If you are over-income for SSI, you may still be eligible for a partial benefit from the state. You must first apply for SSI to be eligible for SSP payments. See the Check eligibility page for details. "}
