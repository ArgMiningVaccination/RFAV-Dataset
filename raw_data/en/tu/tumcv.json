We are all about giving high performers tools to perform at the top of their personal and professional game. Over 2,000 students have learned to meditate with us in person and over 5,000 people have learned around the world from our online courses. All of them have graduated with a powerful meditation practice to take with them for life. The Ziva technique is a trifecta of meditation, mindfulness and manifesting (aka making your dreams your reality.) We are also partnering with some of the world's leading neuroscientists and body tracking technology to make ancient tools easy to adopt into your fast paced life. Graduates include Oscar, Grammy, Emmy and Tony award winners as well as CEOs, NBA players, and full time moms. Ziva is based in New York City, where we offer our in person training once a month. We teach in LA several times per year. We also offer corporate and private courses. We have had the pleasure of sharing meditation with Google, Viacom, Barclays Bank and sweetgreen. If you are looking for a practice with the potential to revolutionize how you work and how you chill you are in the right place. Join us for "}
