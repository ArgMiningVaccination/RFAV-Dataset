Feelings of spinning, tilting, falling and loss of balance when walking are all common - now imagine a mother of five trying to cope for caring for her newborn set of twins try to navigate this condition. Today, we share a case study of LW, a 37 year old mother of five - and her journey with vertigo, and path to recovery (case study shared with permission). Causes of Vertigo There are various factors which may cause vertigo, requiring a visit to your health practitioner to help determine potentially serious underlying causes. Often inner ear or sensory nerve pathways are involved (vestibular neuronitis). Inflammation of the inner ear (labyrinthitis) or build up of fluid in the inner ear (Meniere's disease) are also causes of dizziness - Meniere's is typically accompanied by hearing loss. Conventional treatment is often limited making this diagnosis even more frustrating. LW was diagnosed with BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo)- vertigo that involves calcium crystals within the inner ear fluid that touch the sensory hair cells inside the semicircular canals during movement. They stimulate the nerves to send information to the brain about position. Case study - Vertigo and Homeopathic Success LW has been under my naturopathic care for over a decade and has since moved from YYC to B.C. We continue treatment long distance, with referral to local practitioners when necessary. March 7, 2018: Vaginal delivery of twins. March 31, 2018: Reports extreme fatigue, occasional dizzy spells. I recommended midwives run an iron panel to rule out iron deficiency anemia. Continued blood building support. May 1, 2018: Reports feeling \"quite off.\" Mild, occasional dizzy spells are now severe and constant. No relief. I recommended she get her blood pressure checked and referral to MD for blood work and potential ECG. Given recent birth, we wanted to rule out all potential cardiac involvement as well as postpartum hypothyroid. She went to ER in her hometown in BC. I suggested vertigo was the likely diagnosis, but wanted to rule out all potentially serious causes, given her postpartum status. May 2: Reports blood work and ECG unremarkable. Diagnosis BPPV - Vertigo. I recommended immediate manual therapy in the form of osteopathic, chiropractic or acupuncture-- depending on availability in her small hometown. Difficult booking these appointments due to lack of availability where she lives and practical logistics of having newborn twins at home, with three other children to care for. May 4th: Vertigo constant. Reports feeling like \"a total wreck. Cannot hold newborn twins. Sleep deprivation severe. Unable to stand. Vomitting. Cannot open eyes. Feels as though stepped off a ride at the carnival and wont' stop. If eyes are open - the room spins in a circle. Extreme nausea. Feels helpless.\" Vertigo responds to homeopathic treatment Rx: Gelsemium 30CH - this is a key vertigo remedy when extreme dizziness presents along with a heaviness of eyelids and inability to open the eyes. Vertigo will present with a difficulty walking and a loss of balance. I instructed her to take 3 pellets every 15 minutes for the duration of the evening and to connect the next day. Tues May 15th: \" Immediately after I took the first couple of doses I was able to open my eyes and focus them. I'm feeling like I might survivie this. I am able to walk a bit today. I believe the homeopathic remedies are making a big difference.\" Tues May 22nd: \"I'm overjoyed to report that I continue to improve daily. It feels so good to feel more like myself again.\" Homeopathy is a treatment of dis-ease by minute doses of natural substances that stimulate the body to heal.
