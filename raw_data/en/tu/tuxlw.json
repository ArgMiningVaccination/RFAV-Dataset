Get tips from lupus experts on how to eat well. If you have [lupus, the autoimmune disease](//www.everydayhealth.com/lupus/) in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissue, then you know there's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all lupus diet. But that doesn't mean that a healthy diet isn't important to [lupus management](https://www.everydayhealth.com/lupus/pictures-of-tips-to-improve-living-with-lupus/). You need to eat meals that are balanced and heart-healthy, with nutrient-dense foods that minimize inflammation. It's not complicated, but there are some basics to follow. Jessica Goldman Foung, a food writer and author of the low-sodium cookbook Low-So Good, has particular insight into both lupus and nutrition. The San Francisco-area resident was [diagnosed with lupus](/lupus/diagnosis/) in 2004 \u2014 something she says changed both her life and her diet. \"First and foremost, everybody \u2014 and every body \u2014 is different,\" Goldman Foung says. \"And depending on the kind of lupus you have and the drugs you might take, recommended diets will vary from person to person. This is why it's important to discuss nutrition with your doctor or a dietitian before embarking on a new diet adventure.\" What to Keep in Your Lupus Diet \"There's no specific [diet for lupus](/lupus/guide/treatment/), but the Mediterranean-style diet comes close to what's most ideal,\" says [Sotiria Everett, RD](https://renaissance.stonybrookmedicine.edu/family_population_preventive_medicine/divisions/nutrition/sotiria-everett), a clinical assistant professor in the department of family, population, and preventive medicine at Stony Brook School of Medicine in New York. \"You want to eat a diet that's low in fat and sugar and has lots of fruits and vegetables. You should get some of your protein from fish and eat lots of beans and legumes because they're high in fiber, [vitamin B](/drugs/vitamin-b-12), and iron.\" According to Goldman Foung, \"A diet rich in vegetables gives me energy and keeps me feeling strong and healthy.\" She typically eats meals filled with dark leafy greens and other colorful vegetables, eats lots of whole grains, and limits her consumption of meat and [processed foods](/diet-nutrition/processed-foods-linked-shorter-life-span-study-finds/). \"I also try to drink fresh-pressed beet juice as often as possible,\" she adds. \"It's a great way to sneak in some of those body-boosting ingredients.\" Everett adds that eating fish for protein is particularly good. Fish \u2014 especially salmon, tuna, and mackerel \u2014 contain omega-3 fatty acids, which are important because they help fight inflammation, she says. A review of studies published in May 2018 in [Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29648479) found that omega-3 supplementation reduced inflammation and disease activity. [Omega-3s](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/omega-3s/), which are also available as supplements, may decrease your risk for heart disease. This may be especially important for those with lupus because cardiovascular disease accounts for more than one-third of all deaths among patients with systemic lupus erythematosis, according to a report published in September 2016 in [Current Opinion in Rheumatology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4965310/). \"Lupus is an independent [risk factor for heart disease](/heart-disease/), so you should maintain a heart-healthy diet that helps fight inflammation and keeps you at a healthy weight,\" Everett says. You may need to adjust your diet depending on what medication you're taking for lupus. According to the [Lupus Foundation of America](https://www.lupus.org/resources/diet-and-nutrition-with-lupus), if you're on [corticosteroids](https://www.everydayhealth.com/corticosteroids/guide/), which can elevate blood pressure and [cholesterol levels](/high-cholesterol/guide/), you should be sure to limit your fat and salt intake. [Corticosteroids](/corticosteroids/guide/) can also lead to or worsen [osteoporosis](https://www.everydayhealth.com/osteoporosis/guide/); to help counteract this, it's important to consume foods that are high in calcium. The Lupus Foundation of America recommends dark leafy greens (spinach, [broccoli](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/broccoli-nutrition-health-benefits-how-prepare-it-more/)), reduced-fat dairy products, or calcium supplements with [vitamin D](/drugs/vitamin-d). What to Keep Out of Your Lupus Diet For most [people with lupus](/lupus/), the two big things to avoid are high-fat and processed foods. If you have issues like kidney disease, [fluid retention](/diet-nutrition/weight/how-recognize-reduce-water-retention-edema/), or high blood pressure, you may also need to talk to your doctor about salt restriction as well. Nightshade vegetables \u2014 which include tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, and eggplant \u2014 have gotten a bad rap when it comes to lupus because they're believed to trigger inflammation. However, the [Lupus Foundation of America](https://www.lupus.org/resources) notes that the evidence is anecdotal. You might benefit from taking these items off the menu altogether: Processed Foods Think of these as any food that comes from a box or a can. Processed foods are higher in fat, sugar, and salt. (Check the nutritional information for amounts.) Refined foods are on this list, too \u2014 typical white bread, pasta, and white rice. Goldman Foung says that \"by replacing processed goods, packaged foods, and take-out food with meals full of fresh ingredients,\" her diet is \"tastier and healthier.\" Alfalfa Sprouts and Garlic Both these foods contain substances that rev up your immune system, which you don't want if you have lupus. \"I would recommend avoiding both alfalfa sprouts and heavy use of [garlic](/drugs/garlic),\" Everett says. \"You should also talk to your doctor before using any dietary or herbal supplements.\" Too Much Alcohol \"A little red wine is a good source of an antioxidant that benefits heart health, but heavy, sugary alcoholic drinks are empty calories that can increase your risk of [obesity and heart disease](/heart-disease/obesity-heart-disease-whats-connection/),\" Everett says. \"Safe limits for alcohol are one drink per day for women and two drinks a day for men.\" Consider Goldman Foung's advice: \"Changing your diet for lupus doesn't have to mean restricting or complicating your life. With the right attitude and a willingness to experiment, it might actually lead you to a more enjoyable, healthier, and tastier existence than you "}
