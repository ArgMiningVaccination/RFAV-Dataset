Scientists are eagerly testing therapeutic approaches and vaccines. As such, scientists find themselves fielding a lot of questions. In this article, our international team of scientists will take on some frequently asked questions about COVID and a potential vaccine. Future articles will cover vaccines for tumors, historical overview of pandemics, current COVID-19 vaccines, medications for COVID-19, flu vaccine development, and COVID vaccine development status. Stay tuned! How do vaccines work? [Mohamad T (Germany)] Vaccines are biological preparations containing specific viral or bacterial antigens and the vaccine components induce immunity to infectious diseases. Scientists discovered this immune system mechanism where the immune system's memory of prior infections allows recognition and rapid response stops a pathogen's expansion (Figure 1). Vaccines exploit this mechanism by introducing a non-infectious germ that induces the immune response, but doesn't cause disease. When the infectious germ appears, it is rapidly destroyed before causing disease. Recognition of pathogens is performed by the adaptive immune response, in which B-cells and T-cells recognize a unique sequence of amino acids (part of a germ). B-cells can be activated through signals from helper T-cells (example by COVID-19) to expand and produce antibodies. The released antibodies block germs or 'tag' them for killing and after infection, some progeny become 'memory' B-cells for rapid response when a later infection happens. T-cells can also identify germ infected cells and kill them. Figure 1. Immune System Overview ( [https://geekymedics.com/immune-response/](https://geekymedics.com/immune-response/)) In SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) case, in addition to the role of both B and T-cells, IL-6, IL-1b, and IFN-I/III from infected pulmonary epithelia induce inflammatory programs in macrophages and recruit inflammatory monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocytes from circulation (Figure 2). This recruitment drives several hyperinflammation cascades. Inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages can amplify dysfunctional responses in various ways (listed in the top-left corner). The inflammatory response induces neutrophilic NETosis and microthrombosis, aggravating COVID-19 severity. Other myeloid cells, such as pDCs, are purported to have an IFN-dependent role in viral control. Monocyte-derived CXCL9/10/ 11 might recruit NK cells from blood. It is therefore suggested that the antiviral function of NK cells might be regulated through crosstalk with SARS-infected cells and inflammatory monocytes. Figure 2.

[Kawthar Braysh (Lebanon)] Pharmaceutical companies and universities are now racing to develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Over 150 vaccines are under preclinical investigation and 21 candidates are in the clinical stage. A range of technology platforms are being tested, some of which haven't been used in a licensed vaccine before. The traditional approach is the live-attenuated and inactivated vaccine that involves taking the whole virus, weakening or killing it, and injecting it to the patient, such as COVID-19 vaccine (CoronaVac) developed by Sinovac. The new nucleic-based vaccine modalities are considered safe and easy to develop, but they are still unproven for human use. For instance, US Biotech Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273) is an RNA- based vaccine that encodes viral spike gene encapsulated in lipid particles. Other RNA-based vaccines are pursued by BioNTech and Pfizer (BNT162) as well as the DNA vaccine of Inovio. The third approach is the viral vaccine that offers long-term stability and induces strong immune responses. Astrazeneca (ChAdOx1-S) is working on this approach and relies on a non-replicating viral vector (adenovirus) to deliver antigens. The final approach is the peptide vaccine, including protein subunits and virus-like protein, that involves injecting spike protein or just the receptor-binding domain, or empty virus shells lacking the genetic material to mimic the virus structure and trigger the immune response. How does the virus mutate and is the COVID-19 virus mutating? [Alvaro (Bilbao, Spain)] A mutation is an alteration in the nucleotide sequence of the genome. The probability that an alteration is passed to the next generation is known as the mutation rate. The extraordinary ability of some viruses to adapt to new hosts and environments is highly dependent on their capacity to generate new diversity in a short period of time. Viral mutations originate from polymerase errors, but also from the ability of a virus to correct DNA mismatches by proofreading and/or post-replicative repair. Host enzymes, spontaneous nucleic acid damage, and even special genetic elements situated within some viral genomes whose specific function is to produce new mutations are other mechanisms that can introduce mutations. Viruses differ markedly in their mutation rates. RNA viruses mutate faster than DNA viruses, single-stranded viruses mutate faster than those with a double- strand genome. Furthermore, viruses with smaller genomes tend to mutate faster. Viruses mutate naturally, mutations not necessarily translate into a more dangerous or virulent form of the existing virus. Understanding the processes underlying viral mutation rates is key to comprehend and manage drug resistance, immune escape, vaccination, pathogenesis, and the emergence of new diseases. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a low mutation rate, much lower than the viruses that cause influenza and HIV-AIDS. Scientists have identified over 200 mutations affecting this virus. Studies focusing on the spike protein, that allows the virus to enter the cell, have identified a mutation \"D614G\" that might make the virus more infectious and more contagious. The D614G strain is becoming the dominant strain and it is taking over the world. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOVJ9XgYvac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOVJ9XgYvac) Why do you still get the Flu even if you get the vaccine? [Lucas Klemm (USA)] Flu vaccines come in several different formats, but generally cover three or four of the most prevalent strains. Flu vaccines are either live-attenuated or inactivated viruses. Live-attenuated flu vaccines are severely weakened live-virus that can induce strong immunity while inactivated vaccines are completely dead-virus that may require multiple administrations. These can be combined with an adjuvant, like alum, which helps the immune system mount a stronger response to the virus providing better protection. Flu viruses rapidly adapt and can mutate to render the current vaccines ineffective. This causes a constant arms race between us and the flu virus that requires a global effort to predict how the strains will mutate for next year. Scientists use models to predict how the viruses may adapt which informs us how to design next year's vaccines. We have to get a flu vaccine every year due to the constantly mutating viral strains. Flu vaccines are not 100% effective and some people can still get sick even if they get one for reasons including: the viral strain may not be part of the vaccine, viruses may have mutated, and immunity can fade over time. What is the ideal vaccine? How will we assess the efficacy? [Alex B (Spain)] An ideal vaccine should be safe, even in immunocompromised people, and highly effective: after one or two doses, it should elicit long-lived immune response that completely prevents an infection by a subsequent exposure to the wild-type infectious disease (Figure 3). Cost of vaccines should be accessible to everyone globally. Consider that even the people who are unable to receive the vaccine or refuse to get vaccinated, also benefit from the protection of belonging to an immunized community. The ideal route of administration would be via mucosal surfaces, and preferably oral, as it removes the need of skilled personnel for its administration. The ideal vaccine should have a high thermal stability, thus obviating the need for expensive cold chains, critical in developing countries. Clinically speaking, three main factors are essential to develop a SARS-Cov-2 vaccine: - The vaccine should generate a robust immune response generating long-lasting neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. - The ideal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will also induce potent T-lymphocyte immunity. Ideally, this would be a well-coordinated, orchestrated T-cell response that includes T-helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte subsets that recognize SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in the body and annihilate them to block viral replication, along with acquisition of memory T-cells to prevent reinfection months to years later. - The candidate vaccine should limit any serious adverse events (SAEs) at the injection site or systemically. In the case of respiratory disorders caused by infectious agents, it is essential that vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD), antibody-dependent cytokine storm-inducing effects are completely avoided. Figure 3. Vaccine approaches for SARS-Cov-2. DNA and RNA vaccines can be made quickly as they require no culture or fermentation, and are synthesised chemically. [https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00937](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00937) When will the vaccine be available? [Alex P (USA)] A COVID vaccine must be both safe and effective. The speed of COVID vaccine development is unprecedented but both high efficacy and low safety concerns are required. So given that, when can we expect a vaccine? Fingers crossed, potentially early 2021. Check out the New York Times Vaccine Tracker: [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html) We also predict that there will be several vaccines developed globally and different regions will initially be using vaccines developed within their geographical vicinities. Eventually, the most effective, safe, and affordable vaccine or approach will be used internationally. Will there be a second wave of COVID-19? Globally, some countries have contained the spread of the virus but the resurgence of COVID-19 in the US is alarming and demonstrates that if we don't follow public health measures (wearing masks and social distancing) we will indeed see a second wave. What is the future of vaccine development? [Alvaro (Bilbao, Spain)] Identifying the mutations within the virus genome, will be advantageous for the development of vaccines. For example, in the oncology field, neoantigens are a result of mutations in genes that lead to new proteins. The identification of these mutations and the prediction of neoantigens are important processes to produce neoantigen tumor vaccines. In our next article we will cover the different steps necessary for tumor vaccine development.
