This takes you far away from your natural state and environment, thus, causing a plethora of detrimental health effects. While modern medicine gives temporary relief and works only on specific areas, in most cases, it suppresses rather than work on the root cause, not to mention the side effects. This has led many people to look for alternative medicine. This is where naturopathy stands out. Naturopathy is an ancient science that believes in the power of one's body to heal oneself through guided treatments using the elements available in nature. About naturopathy Naturopathy is an ancient science that focuses in the force of one's body to cure oneself through the directed medicines using the components attainable in nature. Different techniques have been used for a long time to treat different conditions. In this yoga retreat, you won't just go through their Emotional Detox program, but you'll also learn essential Naturopathy methodology and a clear understanding of consideration and recovery, which you can also practice at home later. %Naturopathy revolves around five elements including water, fire, earth, air, and space / ether. Hence, this retreat will cover the healing techniques around these five elements. The students will be practicing all the basic techniques mentioned below and are expected to strictly follow AlakhYog's instructions to gain maximum benefits from the treatments. Cleansing through breath (air) The students will be learning how their mental, physical, and emotional patterns can be altered through breath. The impact of an in-depth understanding of right breathing techniques on health is often undermined. Cleansing through water More than 70% of your body is comprised of water with acid and alkaline elements. By drinking the proper amount of water, these elements can be balanced. You will also be covering some water therapies to enhance your state of health. Cleansing with mud (earth) You would be using mud therapy to take out toxins and stomach heat. Cleansing through fasting (space) Fasting refers to abstinence from food for a varying length of time. It has become a very essential technique for the detoxification of the body. You will be taught how to fast properly and how to watch your energy flow during fasting. -Cleansing through fire Heat therapy, when combined with fasting, has a double impact on cleansing. Note To ensure a state of a healthy lifestyle, AlakhYog advises all the students to follow their prescribed techniques and adhere to a disciplined life as per nature. Naturopathy helps you in returning to these roots and unlocking the highest level of health and curing your ailments. Rediscovering this natural state will restore balance within the body and connect you with the nature around you. There will also be yoga classes during the retreat. AlakhYog is not a treatment center. They do not treat or work on traumas, acute or chronic problems. One must decide to participate in this yoga detox retreat with an intention of learning basic naturopathy techniques, which will help you relax and rejuvenate.
