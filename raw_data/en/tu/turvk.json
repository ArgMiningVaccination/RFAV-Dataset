Mindfulness/ E motional Strength Strengthen your mind 3. Spiritual Strength Strengthen your resolve 3Cancer Wellness the Power of 33.2.1.Live well with the Power of 3 Physical Strength. Physical activity intersects with oncology in both the prediagnosis and survivorship settings. According to the American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention, getting more physical activity is associated with a lower risk for several types of cancer. Increasing your physical strength can also decrease side effects and speed recovery in many cases. Mindfulness/Emotional Strength. Cancer and its treatment can be stressful for you and your caregivers. Practicing mindfulness and relaxation can help calm your mind, reduce stress, sharpen your ability to focus, and promote peacefulness. By strengthening your mind, you can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Spiritual Strength. Spirituality may be expressed through an organized religion or in many other ways. Spiritual well-being may help improve quality of life and reduce distress, anger, and discomfort. Your spiritual resolve can play a key role in setting goals and planning treatment. Emotional Strength Spiritual StrengthPhysical Strength 4Maintaining a good diet, regular exercise, practicing mindfulness and following the advice of your care team can reduce the impact of cancer on your everyday life. The Power of 3 is a roadmap for taking an active role in living well.MyFitRx Exercise Program Exercise is medicine in oncology. According to the American Cancer Society, there is sufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of specific doses of exercise training to address cancer-related health outcomes. These include mental benefits, such as a reduction in fatigue, anxiety and depression. Physically, the results translate to an overall increase in quality of life and physical function. Movement is just one way that patients can fight fatigue, increase strength and boost energy during treatment and recovery. MyFitRx is a physician prescribed, customized pathway that is designed to help reduce fatigue, while improving muscle function and range of motion.

Religion may be defined as a specific set of beliefs and practices, usually within an organized group. Spirituality may be defined as an individual's sense of peace, purpose, connection to others, and beliefs about the meaning of life. Spirituality may be found and expressed through an organized religion or in other ways. Patients may think of themselves as spiritual or religious or both. Studies show that spiritual or religious beliefs and practices create a positive mental attitude that may help a patient feel better and improve the well-being of family caregivers.1 Spiritual and religious well-being may help improve health and quality of life in the following ways: Decrease anxiety, depression, anger and discomfort Decrease the sense of isolation (feeling alone) and the risk of suicide Decrease alcohol and drug abuse Lower blood pressure and the risk of heart disease Help the patient adjust to the effects of cancer and its treatment Increase the ability to enjoy life during cancer treatment Give a feeling of personal growth as a result of living with cancer Increase positive feelings, including: - Hope and optimism - Freedom from regret - Satisfaction with life - A sense of inner peace Spiritual distress may make it harder for patients to cope with cancer and associated cancer treatment.
