Some of these studies delve into the modern implications of the science, its practices, diagnostic principles, and outcomes. Typically, scholars attempt to understand the medicinal effect of the plants and treatments that are proposed by Ayurvedic practitioners. In many countries around the world, Ayurvedic medicine is officially recognised, and licenses are issued to certified practitioners. There are even pharmacies that are solely dedicated to providing Ayurvedic medicine. Here are 5 statistics that prove just how significant the field of Ayurveda is to health, medicine and wellness today. Intricate History Said to have been initially recorded orally in Sanskrit, Ayurveda has its origins in India, dating back more than 5000 years. While the the lore behind its adoption into human society is often entrenched in Indian mythology (some of the earlier instances of Ayurveda have been found in the Vedas starting from 3000 BCE; various texts claim that the Creator of the world, Brahma, passed down this science to the ancient mystics in India) - extensive studies of Sushrutha Samahita (a foundational manuscript on the practice of Ayurveda dating back over 1500 years) have found \"the symptoms of the diseases and the prognosis amazingly accurate\" within the texts, and many consider the book to have provided the world with the earliest insight and practical tools into surgery as we know it today. And with the advancement of each civilization and travel, the field became more and more expansive as people gained knowledge of Ayurveda, sometimes building upon its foundational principles and evolving it for the needs of time - as the world evolved. Influence on Mainstream Healthcare Ayurveda began to spread to other parts of the world around the 20th century when people from the West travelled to India, and Hindu gurus living in other regions across the globe introduced foreigners to this natural system of medicine. Over time, it has had a definite impact on mainstream healthcare due to its holistic approach that underscores the connection between human beings and the environment. The first International Congress on Ayurveda was conducted in the year 2009 in Milan, where more than 400 attendees discussed the link between Ayurveda and modern health science. A [paper published on the event](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/929083/) highlights how Ayurveda bridges the gaps in modern medicine - \"The leading causes of mortality nowadays are related to incorrect lifestyle, poor nutrition, and stress. Modern medicine treats mostly external factors or intervenes in the biochemical chain of events... In contrast, Ayurveda analyzes the person apart from the disease by classifying people into different constitutions with distinct characteristics and susceptibilities that determine the type of treatment required.\" Furthermore, in the last decade, insurance companies in India have begun providing coverage for Ayurvedic treatments as part of their medical insurance plans. Use of Medicinal Plants India, being the hub of Ayurveda, is one of the largest sources of medicinal plants in the world. Aloe vera, bay leaves, coriander, lavender, mint, and curry leaves are some of the most commonly used medicinal plants, most of which can even be grown at home. These, in addition to others, are exported to various countries because of their therapeutic powers. Fun fact: aloe vera is considered to be the \"king of medicinal plants\", as per Ayurveda. Although as many as [20,000 medicinal plants are said to have been recorded](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/376327/), traditional Ayurvedic practitioners in India use around 7000 medicinal plants to heal patients. Export of Ayurvedic & Herbal Products Some of the largest importers of Ayurvedic products are Russia, the USA, Canada, Nepal, and UAE. While the USA only recognises Ayurveda as a complementary and alternative practice, Nepal has officially accorded it the status of a medical system. Ken Research reports that India is amongst the largest suppliers of Ayurvedic medicines in the world. In 2020 alone, [the export value of Ayurvedic and herbal products from India](https://www.statista.com/statistics/652418/export-value-of-ayurvedic-and-herbal-products-india/) amounted to $428 million. It is the increasing awareness of the benefits of Ayurveda and the inclination of people to adopt organic healing practices that have resulted in the massive growth of Ayurvedic exports. Registered Ayurvedic Practitioners in India Ayurvedic practitioners in India go through rigid training and assessment to obtain licenses to practice. Currently, India is reported to have 450,000 registered Ayurvedic practitioners. There are legally recognised courses that budding Ayurvedic practitioners can pursue to learn the vast medical system. The Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery is a degree course provided in countries such as Nepal, India, Bangladesh and other South Asian countries. In Summary The pace at which Ayurveda has been incorporated into different countries' national healthcare systems is admittedly slow. But that is a matter of having government-established educational and training institutions. The above-mentioned statistics depict how in-demand Ayurvedic medicine is.
