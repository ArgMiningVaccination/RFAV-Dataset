Since its inception, the University has based its educational, clinical and research programs on the following key principles: Treatment of the whole person Prevention of disease Teaching patients how to take responsibility for their own health Enhancing each individual's inherent healing ability, using natural, nontox ic therapies Over the years the University has broadened its mission to integrate Western scientific standards with traditional natural healing methods from around the world. The University has expanded and strengthened the academic and clinical education of naturopathic medicine practitioners. It has developed unique academic degree programs in acupuncture and Oriental medicine, nutrition, exercise science and wellness, herbal sciences, culinary arts, midwifery, and health psychology, as well as specialize d nondegree programs that reflect its founding philosophy. The education of graduate natural health practitioners and highly qualified undergraduate students at Bastyr University emphasizes development of the scientific understanding of the structure and function of the human body and the disease process, balanced with a profound appreciation for, and ability to activate, the unique self - healing ability inherent in every human being. The University's educational approach is an integrated one, offering trad itional didactic instruction combined with innovative, problem -based learning in rigorous academic and clinical environments. The learning experience emphasizes academic excellence, the development of individual talents and mastery of critical competencies . Students learn under the guidance of outstanding faculty. More than 90 percent of the University's health sciences core faculty members have earned doctoral degrees, and many are successful private practitioners who contribute a wealth of practical exper ience to classroom and clinical instruction. Laboratory experiments, demonstrations, clinical experience and case -oriented instruction help students develop practical, patient - oriented skills and understanding. Student clinicians are also trained to recogn ize when other modes of treatment are in the best interests of the patient and to make appropriate referrals to colleagues in other health care professions. Bastyr University is dedicated to educating individuals to meet the health and well -being needs of the twenty -first century. In practice and through research, Bastyr graduates will further develop ways in which to integrate scientific and traditional healing methods in support of the innate healing power of the individual as part of the great human comm unity. BASTYR UNIVERSITY VISION STATEMENT As the world's leading academic center for advancing and integrating knowledge in the natural health arts and sciences, Bastyr University will transform the health and well -being of the human community. BASTYR UNIVERSITY MISSION STATEMENT We educate future leaders in the natural health arts and sciences. Respecting the healing power of nature and recognizing that body, mind and spirit are intrinsically inseparable, we model an integrated approach to education, r esearch and clinical service. BASTYR UNIVERSITY VALUES Compassion Community Integrity Connection to Nature Whole Systems Health In pursuit of its vision and mission, the University is characterized by: Academic excellence: curricula that present the c utting edge of natural medicine philosophy and practices; programs that facilitate student development of high -level academic and/or clinical expertise; utilization of teaching methodologies that optimally facilitate student skill and knowledge base develo pment; and an educational environment that incorporates and models the principles of natural medicine Pioneering research: foundational inquiry into the underlying concepts of natural medicine; iterative research that continuously evaluates the efficacy of therapeutic strategies and agents; and research partnerships to deepen and broaden the kinds of possible inquiry Renowned clinical services: cutting -edge natural medical care; instruction that helps students model ideal clinical practice behaviors; a nd collaborations that provide opportunities to explore and develop integrated care protocols and clinical practices For the University to fully meet these commitments, it must think and act strategically. Following a campus -wide, iterative and broadly -inclusive process, the University's Board of Trustees in December 2008 adopted and committed itself to the following core strategic initiatives: Strategic Initiative #1: Convene essential generative conversations that inform the cultivation of practitioners and influence policy decisions that contribute to restoring the world's intrinsic health. Strategic Initiative #2: Determine what academic programs are essential to a robust and universal education in the natural health arts and sciences and ensure that e ach program is focused on the achievement of excellence. Strategic Initiative #3: Attract, support and retain world -class faculty and staff in the natural health arts and sciences. Strategic Initiative #4: Attract, support and retain world -class students r epresenting different cultures. Strategic Initiative #5: Our methods of and access to instruction are innovative enough to attract the most diverse and qualified students, while maintaining the highest standards of academic, research and clinical excellenc e. Strategic Initiative #6: Establish a secure base of financial support and appropriate physical assets so we can invest in and support those things that ensure we will always lead the way in education, research and clinical practice of the natural health arts and sciences. Bastyr University has played a key part in establishing the credibility of science -based natural medicine and initiating the current transformation of the health care system. In order to retain the University's leadership role in promot ing the benefits of natural medicine, we will continue to improve and transform the institution into a fully -developed, well - financed mature academic center for the natural health arts and sciences.

The Student Council, like the University as a whole, relies upon student partic ipation to create a more effective learning environment. The Student Council's constitution may be found online at MyBU. The Student Council hosts numerous events during the year, including potluck dinners, dances, a talent show, graduation parties and Bas tyr Community Day. The council has made significant contributions to the University, including sponsoring community events, remodeling the movement room and sponsoring the student exercise room, providing remote viewing for some classrooms, as well as equi pment for the library and other University departments. Each student is required to pay a $25 student activity fee every quarter. These funds are administered by the Student Council and used to support student activities, organizations, programs and servic es.

ADMISSIONS The Office of Admissions works with all prospective stu dents for degree and certificate programs at the University. In addition, the admissions department coordinates campus tours, information sessions, webinars, campus visits and off -campus events to highlight the academic opportunities at the University. REGISTRATION The registrar's office maintains students' academic records, manages course scheduling, handles academic registration and evaluation, records grades, produces transcripts and grade reports, and provides academic advising and evaluation, as well as international and veteran student services. Bastyr University operates on the quarter system. The University's quarter is 11 weeks long. (Summer quarter classes are generally eight weeks; summer clinic is 11 weeks.) Eleven hours of class constitute one credit hour, and 22 hours of lab/practicum constitute one credit hour. Continuing students preregister for courses and clinic shifts by submitting a preregistration form. The preregistration forms must be turned in before the registrar's office will regis ter a student for classes or clinic shifts. Registration for continuing students takes place in the spring for summer and fall quarters and in the fall for winter and spring quarters. New students are automatically registered for their fall quarter courses , beginning in late spring and after they have paid their confirmation deposit. Nonmatriculated students may register for courses after matriculated students have been registered. Priority for courses is given to matriculated students. Students taking a co urse for credit have preference over students auditing a course. Students auditing a course or clinic shift (regardless of matriculation status) will be withdrawn if the course is full and an eligible student elects to register for the course, for credit. Students taking a course that is required for their major have preference over those taking the course as an elective. If a student has withdrawn from her/his program, s/he may only take subsequent program courses with permission from the dean of the schoo l from which the student has withdrawn. Students may elect to audit a course or change their status in a course from an audit to a grade through the second week of the quarter. However, after the first week of the quarter, standard refund policies apply. A fter the second week, a student may not change from a graded option to an audit option or from an audit option to a graded option. Course add/drop/withdrawal forms are obtained from and returned to the registrar's office. Classes may be added or dropped fr om a student's schedule through the add/drop period (ending the close of the first week of each quarter). After the first week of the quarter, all withdrawals will be noted with a W grade on the transcript (except in the case of weekend intensive classes o r non -traditionally scheduled classes that have not yet begun). Assigned clinic shifts may be traded during the shift change period. Elective clinic shifts may be added during that same period. Clinic shift drops are accompanied by financial penalties. (P lease see the registrar's office for additional information.) Withdrawal from classes is not permitted during the final three weeks of a quarter (see the financial policies section for the refund policy and page 144 for a refund schedule). For courses with concentrated scheduling (not evenly spaced throughout a quarter), the timing of additions or drops varies. (In no case may students drop or withdraw from a course after the course has ended.) Students must check with the registrar for specific deadlines.

Students have access to a full range of state and federal financial aid programs.

Automatic inclusion of parking fees with tuition or by payroll deduction is strongly preferred, but payment by cash or check is accepted if auto deduction is not possible. Citations range fr om $10 to $100 depending on the seriousness of the infraction. We do this to ensure that parking spaces are equally available for all. Citations are generally given to those who have not registered their transportation information, those who do not have th e current Bastyr identification on their cars and those who are incorrectly parked. Parking fines are due within two weeks. After two weeks, the fine is automatically charged to the student's account. For more information on transportation and parking iss ues, please see the Transportation web page on MyBU, which is within the Facilities section. OTHER COSTS Books and supplies cost approximately $700 -$2,500/year, depending upon the program of study. Naturopathic medicine students are required to purchase diagnostic equipment at the beginning of NM6221 Physical/Clinical Diagnosis 1 at an estimated cost of $1,000 -$3,000. REFUNDS Dropping all classes by or before the end of the first week of classes entitles a student to a 100 percent tuition refund. An add /drop fee is charged after the free add/drop period has ended. Any clinic drops are accompanied by financial penalties. (See clinic registration staff in the registrar's office for more information.) Refund calculations for drops or withdrawals from classe s after the first week of the quarter are found on the inside back cover of the catalog. For those students receiving federal financial aid, the federal calculation for the return of Title IV funds is required, and refunds will be returned on behalf of the student to the federal government. Amounts are determined by federal regulations. Students with financial problems that will affect the payment of tuition and/or fees should contact the finance office at once to make satisfactory arrangements. The deadlin e for contesting a charge on a student account is 90 days from the close of the quarter in which the charge is applied or 90 days from the actual posting, whichever is later. Financial policies, like all policies of the University, are subject to change an d revision by the management and/or Board of Trustees of the University. Notice of changes is published in MyBU. Facilities CAMPUS Bastyr University's primary academic and administrative facilities are located in Kenmore, Washington.

BASTYR CENTER FOR NATURAL HEALTH THE TEACHING CLINIC OF BASTYR UNIVERSITY Bastyr Center for Natural Health (Bastyr Center or BCNH) is the largest natural health clinic in the Northwest. As the teaching clinic of Bastyr University, Basty r Center provides patient services and student training in a professional clinical setting that emphasizes a natural approach to health care. Bastyr Center serves the health care needs of a diverse patient population, which includes young people, growing f amilies and senior citizens from throughout the Puget Sound area. Bastyr Center provides care for approximately 35,000 patient visits yearly. Services at Bastyr Center include naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, nutrition counselin g, homeopathy, mental health counseling and physical medicine. In an effort to meet the health care needs of patients and to enhance the educational experience for students, Bastyr Center provides specialized care options throughout the year. Specialized c are options include an immune wellness program for people living with HIV/AIDS, ADHD treatment and wellness care, diabetes and cardiovascular wellness care, pediatric wellness care, women's wellness care, and senior wellness care. Early in 2006, Bastyr Cen ter moved to a newly renovated building in the Fremont/Wallingford neighborhood, designed to provide an enhanced environment for promoting health and healing for patients, staff and students. The expanded Bastyr Center features a Chinese herbal medicine di spensary and a larger natural medicine dispensary, offering a wide selection of natural health care products and a variety of gift items. Bastyr Center recently became the first natural health care clinic in the region to receive LEED -CI Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council for compliance with high environmental standards. LEED -CI is the recognized standard for certifying high -performance green interiors that are healthy and productive places to work, less costly to operate and maintain, and h ave a reduced environmental footprint. This past year, the University obtained additional space in the building and is in the process of adding several classrooms and other improvements. Bastyr Center is located at 3670 Stone Way North in Seattle. Parking is available onsite for patients and on the street for students, faculty and staff. For more information, please visit www.BastyrCenter.org. Bastyr University maintains numerous external clinical learning sites, creating tremendous diversity in student cli nical education and experiences.

Summary policies and procedures that apply to undergraduates are described in the catalog under \"Bastyr Undergraduate Programs\" beginning on page 28 of this catalog. The Academic Policy and Procedure Manual , Student Policies and Procedures section of MyBU and all versions of the Student Clinician Handbook provide complete information on all academic policies and procedures. ACADEMIC STATUS The University uses the foll owing terms to denote academic status: Good Standing Academic Warning Probation Final Probation Suspension Dismissal A student whose status is anything other than Good Standing may be required to sign a learning contract, develop an academic improvement pl an and/or be held to other sanctions. In addition, students under Academic Warning, Probation or Final Probation status must complete at least two successive quarters with no academic difficulty in order to petition for a change of status. A change in sta tus is the decision of the student's school or department Student Progress Committee (or the dean or dean's designee). Depending on the nature of the academic deficiency, the categories above are not necessarily followed sequentially. ACADEMIC SUSPENSION POLICY Academic suspension is used when the dean of the school believes a student will benefit from time away from his/her program and has sufficient opportunity to be successful upon his/her return from suspension. The terms of a suspension are unique to each student and are decided by the dean. Suspension will last at least one quarter, and a student may be required to receive remedial academic assistance before being readmitted. Suspended students must petition the dean for reinstatement, may be require d to meet with the dean, and must show that all terms of the student contract, improvement plan and/or other requirements have been met before receiving approval to return to the University. If a student is unable to demonstrate that s/he has adequately resolved the issues that led to suspension, the student may be eligible for dismissal. Removal from a course or clinic shift may be warranted in the case of a student's failure to adhere to instructions, procedures and/or professional expectations that may l ead to the compromised safety of a patient, student, staff or faculty member. Removal from a course or clinic shift constitutes a failure of that class or shift and is not eligible for remediation. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DISMISSALS Recommendations for dismi ssals from the University usually occur in the case of any of the following: 1. Failure to satisfactorily adhere to the terms of the established learning contract or academic improvement plan 2. Failure of the same class twice 3. Failure of two clinic shif ts 4. Three failures in the same quarter 5. A history of poor academic performance relevant to the appropriate department 6. Removal from a course/clinic shift in the case of student failure to adhere to instructions, procedures and/or professional expecta tions that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, student or faculty or staff member DISMISSAL POLICY Each school of Bastyr University has a Student Progress Committee that follows the individual school dismissal policy. Recommendations for dis missal are submitted to the provost for consideration. The provost will make the final decision on student dismissals. APPEAL OF ACADEMIC SUSPENSION OR DISMISSAL An appeal of academic suspension or dismissal is submitted to the provost and can only be ma de in the event of factual error. The written appeal must be made to the provost within five working days of the date on the suspension or dismissal letter or e -mail. The appeal must specify and include the alleged documented inaccuracy and the relevance o f the fact(s). The provost will respond within 10 working days to an appeal of academic suspension or dismissal and can only consider an appeal based on an error of fact. The decision of the provost is final and cannot be appealed. NON-ACADEMIC SEPARATIO N If an instructor, faculty member, clinic supervisor or university administrator determines that a student's behavior, performance or professionalism in the campus, classroom or clinic setting is disruptive or otherwise impeding the student's own success or the success of others, the instructor, faculty member, clinic supervisor or university administrator may take whatever steps deemed appropriate to remedy the situation up to and including requiring the student to leave the classroom, clinic shift, and/o r university property for the remainder of the day. A student who is removed from a class, clinic shift or the university property may also be subject to suspension or other discipline. LIMITS ON STUDENT CREDIT LOADS Bastyr University degree programs are described under each school or department listing in the Bastyr University Catalog . The recommended didactic program for each year and track of the degree programs is specified. Elective courses and clinic credits are expected over and above the required d idactic courses. The Student Policies and Procedures section of MyBU specifies the requirements for full -time, half -time and less -than-half-time enrollment status for each program. Capable students may choose to exceed the full - time recommended enrollment in order to include important electives or special interests in their programs. However, the following are the maximum credit loads for which students may register in each program in any given quarter: Bachelor of Science ................................ ............................. 20 credits Master of Science in Nu trition (all tracks) .......................... 24 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture ................................ ..... 25 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine .. 25 credits Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ................... 30 credits Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine ................................ ........ 30 credits Students who ar e seeking degrees in multiple programs must plan their registrations carefully so that they do not exceed the stated limits. Students in dual programs may use the credit limit of either program. In extraordinary cases, very capable students may be allowed to exceed the maximum for their programs upon approval by their department chairs. Department chairs indicate their approval by signing the students' registration or add/drop forms and noting the credit load being approved. Any approved increase may not exceed 10 percent of the above totals. ATTENDANCE POLICY Course and Lab Attendance Policy Bastyr University does not have a universal course and lab attendance policy. However, faculty members may establish attendance requirements for their course(s) or lab (s). Some state licensing boards and the Veteran's Administration require 90 percent attendance. Students receiving financial assistance from the Veteran's Administration or students who need to meet state licensing board requirements are responsible for notifying the faculty of their need to document attendance. When a student has an excused absence, the faculty member may require that the student complete an assignment to make up for the time missed. An absence is considered excused if the student has a l egitimate personal emergency, a serious illness or a documented birth (midwifery program students), as long as the student calls the faculty member(s) or leaves a message for the faculty member(s) with the faculty services department regarding the situatio n in advance (24 -hour voicemail is available). Faculty may require documentation upon return from the excused absence. It is the student's responsibility to meet with the faculty member to discuss the absence and make up work upon return. Not meeting the s tated attendance requirements for the class may affect the student's final grade, and a student may be required to take the course again. In addition to possible consequences for absences, habitual tardiness may be taken into account by faculty as part of the course grade and/or may be reported to the dean of students for disciplinary action. Students cannot register for two courses or labs that are scheduled at overlapping times. Credit can only be applied to a single course at any one given time. Students cannot attend a course without being registered for it and must attend the section of a course or lab for which they are registered. Failure to follow this policy may result in loss of course credit or a course grade of no show (NS). Clinic Attendance Po licy All student clinicians are required to attend at least 80 percent of each assigned quarter shift in order to receive a grade of achieved competency (AC). Holidays and emergency closures of the clinic do not figure into the total quarter attendance. A student who does not attend at least 80 percent of the shift (two excused absences) will receive a failure grade for that shift and lose all accumulated patient contacts and hours for that shift. The entire shift would need to be taken again. Exceptional c ircumstances resulting in a third absence may be approved at the discretion of the supervisor. Four or more absences will result in an automatic failure for that shift. Please note that 100 percent of the required clinical hours must be completed before re commendation for graduation. Please refer to the Student Clinician Handbook - Global Module for further details. Religious or Spiritual Holidays The University's policy is to attempt to accommodate the observance of religious practices. Religious absences will not count against any attendance requirement, but students are responsible for the information and material covered. Students observing such holidays are required to notify faculty during the first week of classes as well as find substitutes for clin ic shifts affected. Students should follow the reschedule exam procedures in the event an exam falls on a religious holiday. Bastyr University schedules clinical training and occasional required courses or intensives on weekends. Students with religious re strictions against attending classes on weekends need to contact their program chairs, in advance, when such conflicts occur. Efforts will be made to resolve such conflicts, but a resolution cannot be guaranteed. Convention, Conference, Seminar and Worksh op Attendance Policy Occasionally, there may be professional conventions or conferences offered during the academic year that programs encourage their students to attend. Students who wish to attend must receive advance permission from their instructor(s) if there is an attendance requirement for the class or an exam or project due during that time. Students are responsible for the information and material missed. Students who receive permission must arrange with faculty to take missed quizzes and exams imm ediately upon return. Students must also comply with clinic absence policies. Please refer to the Student Clinician Handbook - Global Module for further details. UNIVERSITY CLOSURE In the event of unplanned school closures for weather or community emerge ncies, students are required to make up missed course requirements or clinic contact hours. Should the duration of the closure be too long or too late to make up missed requirements/hours in the time allotted, the University reserves the right to extend the quarter and/or academic year to allow for additional make up time. Please see the inclement weather policy/procedure on MyBU for more information regarding University closure. CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS Bastyr University requires national background che cks for all students enrolling in clinical training courses. Background checks must be completed prior to any student contact with patients at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, an affiliate clinic or a practicum or preceptor site. Students will also be required to immediately notify the dean or department chair of their program and their clinical training program supervisors if charged with and/or convicted of a felony after the background check has been conducted. Students should also note that Bastyr U niversity requires that all felonies be disclosed at time of application for admission. Failure to comply with these disclosure requirements may result in immediate dismissal from the University. See \"Background Checks\" in the Academic Policy and Procedur e Manual for more information. POLICY ON TB TESTING AND HEPATITIS B IMMUNIZATIONS These policies were enacted to protect the health and safety of employees and students who may be exposed to certain biohazards in the campus and clinic working environments . Tuberculosis Screening All faculty, staff and students who work or have shifts at Bastyr Center for Natural Health are required to be screened annually for tuberculosis (TB), and are responsible to provide documentation of their results. Screening resul ts can be submitted directly to the Facilities and Safety Office on campus, room 110, or to the TB Results box, outside the Medical Records service window at the clinic. Bastyr provides two TB testing clinics each year, and all are encouraged to have thei r screening performed in sync with these week -long clinics, called TB Weeks. Two screening options are available: Tuberculosis Skin Test (TST) or QuantiFERON blood test (QFG). Students pay $10 toward the cost of their TST at the TB Week clinic, or $20 at B astyr Center. QFG is available at Bastyr Center for an approximate cost of $110. If a chest x -ray is necessary, Bastyr University agrees to pay $37.50 toward this cost. Questions regarding TB screening or requests for forms can be addressed to the campus F acilities and Safety Office or to the Safety Manager at the clinic. Hepatitis B Immunizations All ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students, AOM and ND faculty and staff at Bastyr Center, and faculty or laboratory and operations assistants who are category I (those who have daily exposure to blood or body fluids) and category II (those who have occasional exposure to blood or body fluids) are required to either take the hepatitis B immunization series, provide documentation that they have had such immunizat ions in the past 10 years, or sign a waiver refusing the immunizations along with a release of liability form. Bastyr University agrees to pay 50 percent of the cost of the hepatitis B immunization series for students. Note: All students are required to pa y in full the cost of testing antibody levels for any of the agents listed above, if they choose to check for individual immunity, prior to waiving or taking any immunizations. Commencement of the immunization series (or submission of a waiver) and TB scre ening shall occur before the first day of work for all faculty and staff, and before ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students begin their clinic shifts. Hepatitis immunization forms/waivers are distributed to students in one of their required clinical cours es. Hepatitis immunization questions can be directed to the Blood Borne Pathogen Safety Officer. Anyone who has elected to waive the immunization series has the option to change that election, at any time, and take the immunization series. DEGREE AND CERT IFICATE REQUIREMENTS To earn a degree at Bastyr University, a degree candidate must have completed the prescribed curriculum (refer to the specific academic program section), earned passing grades in all required courses and clinic shifts, satisfied the re quirement for total degree or certificate credits and been recommended for graduation by the faculty. To be eligible to graduate with a master's degree or graduate -level certificate, the candidate must have a minimum GPA of 3.0; a bachelor's degree candida te must have a minimum GPA of 2.0. Students in the articulated bachelor's/master's AOM degree program must follow the degree requirements of that school. A student is held to degree requirements in effect at the time of initial matriculation unless legal o r accreditation standards mandate a change to an existing degree or certificate program. Those degree and certificate requirements are published in the edition of the Bastyr University Catalog that is in effect at the time of first matriculation. In rare c ircumstances, a course may be deleted from the required curriculum and/or curriculum substitutions may be made at the discretion of the school or the University. A student who is readmitted after an absence of more than one calendar year may be held to the requirements in effect at the time of his/her return or may elect to graduate under degree or certificate requirements specified in a subsequent Bastyr University Catalog with written permission of the program dean/chair. Under no circumstances are the re quirements from an earlier catalog applied. Students in the ND and MSAOM programs must complete their degrees within six years. (In extraordinary circumstances, a one -year extension may be approved for ND students.) Students in the DAOM, MSA, MS Midwifery and MS nutrition programs must complete their degrees within five years. There is no time limit on the completion of undergraduate programs. Students in all degree and certificate programs must have discharged satisfactorily all financial obligations to the University (tuition, fees, library fines, and all other charges), including the graduation fee, for each program in which a degree or certificate is to be awarded. For students who have not met their financial obligations at the time of graduation, the e arned degrees and certificates are posted to their records, but diplomas and official transcripts are held until the financial obligations are cleared. DEADLINES FOR THE AWARDING OF DEGREES The awarding and posting of degrees at Bastyr University are gove rned by the deadlines. These deadlines affect the actual awarding of degrees. Student participation in commencement ceremonies is governed by a separate policy. The dates for final examinations each quarter and for commencement ceremonies are published in the Bastyr University Catalog and the registrar's quarterly calendar. For all bachelor's, master's and professional doctoral degrees awarded by Bastyr University: All coursework must be completed by the last day of the quarter for graduating students. Any IP, I or PC grades in coursework or clinic shifts must be replaced with passing grades no later than the last day of the quarter. If a student has any outstanding course or grade requirements on the last day of the quarter, his/her degree will be pos ted at the close of the subsequent quarter. GRADING POLICY Grades are assigned based on the grading system of the department/program offering the course, rather than by the academic program in which the enrolled student is matriculated. Core courses requ ired for an academic program will be graded according to the normal grading policy for that program. Naturopathic Medicine/Dietetic Internship Bastyr University provides a competency -based learning format in the classroom for students in the naturopathic m edicine program, clinic courses and the dietetic internship program. A competency -based evaluation of student work and performance is structured on the premise of demonstrating competence of a well-defined set of information and/or skills. With a competenc y system of grading, a student is aware of the learning objectives and core competencies for each course and clinic shift, knows how knowledge and understanding of these objectives and competencies are measured, and has the opportunity to demonstrate maste ry by means of quizzes, exams, papers and/or practical application. The competencies established for each course reflect the goals and objectives of the appropriate program of study. Program and department chairs in the professional programs, in consultati on with the faculty, determine the requirements and standards that students must meet in order to earn a grade of Achieved Competency, Partial Competency or Failure. Naturopathic Medicine Degree Program, Dietetic Internship and Clinical Shifts AC - Achi eved Competency PC - Partial Competency F - Failure I - Incomplete - Personal emergency or serious illness W - Withdrawn -Withdrawal form must be completed, signed and filed in the registrar's office at least three weeks before the end of a given qu arter. The W grade is transcripted for all course withdrawals after the first week of the quarter (with the exception of courses that have not yet met). AW - Administrative Withdrawal IP - In Progress - for clinic shifts, preceptorships, clinic entry, th eses, didactic courses and internships N - No Grade CE - Challenge Examination NS - No Show AU - Audit WV - Waived ACHIEVED COMPETENCY (AC): A grade of AC indicates the student has gained the defined knowledge, information, skills and core competencie s and has met the learning objectives as defined in the syllabi. Students must attain a level of achieved competency (AC) in all courses, clinic shifts and internships. AC grades are not factored into the GPA. PARTIAL COMPETENCY (PC): A grade of PC indicat es that an aspect of the learning objectives or core competencies has not been achieved and there is need for further study to earn the required AC. Faculty determine the date by which a PC grade must be converted; however, PC grades must be converted no l ater than the end of the break of the subsequent quarter in which the grade was received. Students may be required to complete a PC contract with the faculty member. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the regis trar's office. Grades of PC that have not been converted to AC grades by the deadline revert to F grades. The course, lab, clinic shift or internship must then be repeated. PC grades do not translate into partial credit on transcripts and are not factored into the GPA. FAILURE (F): A grade of F indicates failure to meet the minimum level of competency for learning objectives or core competencies. A student who receives a failure in a required course, lab, clinic shift or internship must repeat that course, lab, clinic shift or internship. INCOMPLETE (I): A student who is doing satisfactory work in a course but cannot complete the work because of a serious illness or personal emergency may receive an Incomplete grade by filing a request for incomplete grade form with the registrar. Faculty determine the date by which an I grade must be converted; however, I grades must be converted no later than the end of the break subsequent to the quarter in which the grade was received. Students may be required to complet e an I grade contract with the faculty member. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's office. ADMINISTRATIVE WITHDRAWAL (AW): A student who is suffering from a serious illness or experiencing a pers onal emergency and is unable to withdraw from term -based classes within the appropriate time frame may be awarded an AW grade by the registrar. The AW grade is awarded for all incomplete courses in a given quarter. (See \"Administrative Withdrawal\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information.) IN PROGRESS (IP): IP grades are indicated for didactic courses, clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, clinic preparation, theses, internships, and clinic entry courses in which work m ay extend beyond the end of a quarter. If not converted to a passing grade, IP grades may be converted to an F grade. NO GRADE (N): N grades are assigned to indicate that a student is awarded no credit for a course but did not fail that course. N grades a re administrative grades and are assigned only by the registrar. N grades are not refundable. CHALLENGE EXAMINATION (CE): Please see \"Challenge Examinations\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. NO SHOW (NS): NS grades are assi gned to indicate that a student did not attend class. NS grades are not refundable, and no credit is given. AUDIT (AU): Students generally audit a course for their personal enrichment. No credit is given, and no academic grade granted. Courses taken for a udit cannot serve as a prerequisite for a subsequent course. WAIVED (WV): Courses are generally waived if a student has demonstrated competency in a particular subject matter but does not have the appropriate level of coursework from an accredited institut ion to allow a transfer of credit. There is no credit attached to a waived course, and a student is required to make up the corresponding credits waived with additional elective credits. Undergraduate Degree Programs For the undergraduate degree programs, a student must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA in order to remain in good standing. Undergraduate students in the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine must maintain a 2.5 GPA in their first year and a 3.0 GPA in their second year. Any required course in which a student receives a grade of F must be repeated. The letter grading system for acupuncture and Oriental medicine*, nutrition, exercise science, herbal sciences and health psychology undergraduate programs is as follows: A - 95 percent -100 percen t or 4.0 A- - 90 percent -94.9 percent or 3.7 B+ - 87 percent -89.9 percent or 3.3 B - 83 percent -86.9 percent or 3.0 B- - 80 percent -82.9 percent or 2.7 C+ - 77 percent -79.9 percent or 2.3 C - 73 percent -76.9 percent or 2.0 C-* - 70 percent -72.9 percent or 1.7 D+* - 67 percent -69.9 percent or 1.3 D* - 63 percent -66.9 percent or 1.0 D-* - 60 percent -62.9 percent or 0.7 F - Below 60 percent or 0.0 AC - Achieved Competency - for clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, outreach and practical courses PC - Partial Competency - for clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, outreach, and practical courses I - Incomplete - personal emergency or serious illness W - Withdrawn -Withdrawal form must be completed, signed and filed in the registrar's office at least three weeks before the end of a given quarter. The W grade is transcripted for all course withdrawals after the first week of the quarter (with the exception of courses that have not yet met). AW -Administrative Withdrawal IP - In Progress - for didactic courses, clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, outreach, clinic preparation, clinic entry, senior year projects and practical courses N - No Grade CE - Challenge Examination NS - No Show AU - Audit WV - Waived For explanati on of grading terms, see above. *It should be noted that while a C -, D+, D and D - grades are passing, some courses require a C grade for professional standards. Graduate Degree Programs: (DAOM, MSA, MSAOM, MS Midwifery, MSN, MSN/CHP, MSN/DPD) The grading system used for graduate degree programs is identical to the undergraduate system, as shown above, except for the following: There is no grade of D+, D or D - for a graduate student, and the IP grade applies also to ongoing work on a thesis. For an explanat ion of grading terms, see the listing under the professional degree programs. For the graduate degree programs, a student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. Any required course in which a student receives a grade of F must be repeated. Grade Change Policy The grades of PC, IP and I are considered temporary grades and designed to be changed (see \"Grading Policy\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual ). The grades of AC, A, A -, B+, B, B -, C+, C, C -, D+, D, D- and F are considered permanent grades and can only be changed if a faculty error was made at the time of issuance. The faculty member must submit documentation demonstrating the error to the registrar. Students are not allowed to submit additional work after the quarter has ended with the intent to raise an A - through F grade. The option of \"extra credit\" work must be written into the syllabus and collected prior to quarter's end. F or PC in Sequential Courses If a student has an F grade, or a PC that converts to an F grade, in a sequ ence course, the student will not be allowed to continue study in the next sequential course. If a PC grade is not remediated by 5 p.m. on the Friday at the end of the second week of the quarter, the student will be withdrawn from the course. INDEPENDENT STUDY POLICY Independent study allows individual students to study areas of interest not included in the regular curriculum with the aid of an instructor or a selected resource person. Registration forms for independent study are available from the Office of the Registrar. The deadlines for registration, payment and grading of independent study courses are the same as those for regularly scheduled courses. Required courses may not be taken by independent study. Students may take an independent study course only if they are in good academic standing. ND students may request to do an independent study after they have completed at least 50 credits of their degree program. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine and nutrition students must have completed at least 30 credits of their degree program. Psychology students must have completed at least 45 credits of their degree program. Students may apply a maximum of five (5) credits of independent study toward the completion of their degree program. Students pursuing two majors as an undergraduate may apply a maximum of ten (10) credits by independent study, five (5) toward each program. TRANSFER , WAIVER AND SUBSTITUTION POLICY Requests for transfer or waiver of credit must be submitted and reviewed within 12 months of a student's matriculation date or before the quarter in which the student is required to complete the course, whichever comes first. Courses taken prior to entry at Bastyr can only be transferred to Bastyr during a student's first year of attendance. After the first year, previous courses taken can only be considered for waiver of required Bastyr courses, and elective credits must be taken to make up the waived credit. If this timeline is not followed and a course is waived/transferred after the start of th e quarter in which a student is registered for that course, the standard course refund policy will apply. The courses under consideration for waiver or transfer should generally be no older than seven years. Waivers and transfer credit will not be awarded for courses submitted for transfer after the quarter in which the student is expected to take the course at Bastyr University. If an enrolled student wishes to complete a program requirement at another institution with the intent to transfer or waive the c ourse at Bastyr, the student must request approval in advance by submitting a petition to waive, substitute or transfer credits along with the course description from the other institution. Courses submitted for transfer that have not received prior approv al are not guaranteed transferability. TRANSFER Transfer credit recognizes coursework from another accredited institution as satisfying a Bastyr required course. Transfer credit grants credit for the Bastyr course and eliminates the need for the student to take that course. A petition to transfer may be requested by students who, at another accredited institution of higher education, have satisfactorily completed coursework that is the same in terms of content, level and credit as a specific Bastyr course , and meets or exceeds the academic objectives and competencies of a required course in Bastyr's programs. Transfer credit will generally not be granted for classes that are part of another earned degree or for classes that are taught at a different academ ic level. For courses taken prior to matriculation into Bastyr, transfer credit can only be granted within the first year of attendance. Transfer credit may be granted from institutions that are accredited by regional accrediting agencies recognized by the American Council on Education Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation and from institutions that are professionally accredited by the CNME, ACAOM and MEAC. Students who apply to Bastyr University with credit from institutions outside the U.S. are required to have international transcripts evaluated by an independent evaluation service. The evaluation report must be issued by an NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services) accredited evaluation service. Credits from school s outside the U.S. are evaluated according to nationally established norms. WAIVER A waiver does not grant credit; it only eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. Students are required to complete the equivalent number of credits approve d via the waiver with elective credits. A petition to waive may be requested when formal training, coursework or experience has been earned at an accredited or unaccredited institution. A student must provide documentation showing that the competencies of the Bastyr University course have been met. In some cases a competency or challenge exam may be required before the waiver will be granted. The waiver decision rests with the chair of the department responsible for teaching the curriculum. Appeals may be made to the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled, whose decision is final. SUBSTITUTION In some cases, students may request to substitute one Bastyr University course for another Bastyr course if the courses are the same in terms of conten t, level and credit and meet or exceed the academic objectives and competencies of the required course. Substitution both grants credits and eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. For additional information regarding transfer, waiver or substitution of credit, please contact the advising/evaluations unit in the registrar's office. Also see \"Transfer of Credit to Bastyr University\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual at MyBU for further details.

For these students, matriculation is contingent on successful completion of the requirements outstanding at the time of acceptance. The applicant must return a nonrefundable deposit to hold a place in the class within two weeks of receipt of the acceptance letter. The deposit is credited toward tuition at registration. Applicants have six business days from the University's receipt of their deposit in which to request return of the deposit. Following this time, deposits are nonrefundable, even if applicants decide t o reapply and enroll in a subsequent year. Offers of admission are made for a specific quarter of a specific year. For most degree programs, students are admitted only in the fall quarter. An admissions file may be examined by the student (with the excepti on of confidential recommendations) only after acceptance and enrollment. Files remain the property of the University, and information contained within cannot be returned to or copied for the student. Certain items submitted for admission to the University are not considered to be part of a student's permanent academic record. Those items are therefore purged from the file upon receipt by the registrar's office. DEPOSITS All candidates for admission who have been accepted into a program at Bastyr Universit y are required to pay a nonrefundable deposit ($200 for degree programs) to hold a place in the entering class. The deposit is credited toward the student's first quarter tuition. Applicants should be aware that the University may, without notice and at th e discretion of the admissions committee, offer to another student the place of any applicant whose deposit has not been submitted within the specified time. Accepted students who wish to take a summer course (i.e., general or organic chemistry), must pay a separate $100 nonrefundable deposit to hold their place in the summer class. This summer quarter deposit is credited toward the student's summer tuition. Continuing students are not required to pay a deposit for summer courses. Currently enrolled student s who have been accepted into an additional program at the University are not required to pay a deposit. DEFERRAL OF ENROLLMENT Applicants who have accepted their offers of admission may request a deferral of their acceptance for up to one year. The admis sions committee reviews the request and will either approve or deny the request.

DOCUMENTATION OF SUFFICIENT FUNDS International students must provid e complete and accurate documentation of sufficient funds in order to qualify for a student visa. The total of these funds must cover the cost of the first year of school, books and living expenses. Official bank statements as proof of liquid assets are re quired to document sufficient funds. A signed affidavit of support (available from the admissions office) is required if the bank statement/account proving the availability of required funds is not in the student's name. The amount required to cover expens es for the first year is dependent upon the program of study. If you have dependents who will apply for F -2 Visas, the cost of living expenses for the spouse and/or children must be provided. The current cost of total expenses for each students and the cos t of living per each dependent is listed on the 1 -20 documentation worksheet, which is part of the application packet for international students. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND EMPLOYMENT International students are not eligible for U.S. federal or state -funded student aid programs but may obtain private loans with a U.S. citizen or resident as a co -signer. Canadian students also have access to the Canadian federal student loan program and most provincial loans. Documentation of sufficient funding is required fo r F-1 students because off -campus employment is prohibited by the USCIS during the first year of study. International students are limited to no more than 20 hours a week of on -campus employment while school is in session and may work full time during vaca tion periods, as long as they have maintained status and intend to register for the following term. Bastyr University has a very limited amount of international employment money available. FINANCIAL AID The role of the financial aid office at Bastyr Univ ersity is to assist students in obtaining the funding they need to reach their educational goals. Bastyr University participates in the full range of state and federal student financial aid programs. Student eligibility is determined following the state an d federal regulations that apply to each particular aid program. Graduate students primarily rely on federal educational loan programs, including Federal Direct subsidized, unsubsidized and GradPLUS loans, and the Perkins loan program. Employment opportuni ties are provided by the federal and state work -study programs. Additional support is provided by scholarship programs administered by Bastyr University from both endowed programs and University resources. Undergraduate students are also eligible for all o f the programs mentioned above except GradPlus loans, but parents of dependent undergraduate students may apply for a Federal Direct Parent PLUS loan. Undergraduate students may be eligible for federal grants (Pell grants and Federal Supplemental Education al Opportunity grants). Washington state residents may be eligible for a Washington State Need Grant. Private loan programs also provide a supplemental source of funding to students at market rate interest. These loans require a positive credit history and /or a co -signer with good credit. All international students are eligible for University -funded scholarships and grants and also for on -campus employment from University funds. Financial Aid Deadlines: There are no formal University deadlines. However, und ergraduate students are encouraged to apply by April 1 in order to receive consideration for several external grant programs with early deadlines. All students are encouraged to apply for financial aid at least 90 days before the first quarter of attendanc e. Detailed information on application procedures, program costs, and financial aid funding are published annually in the Bastyr University Financial Aid Handbook . The Bastyr University Financial Aid Handbook and financial aid application are located on th e Bastyr website and the MyBU student portal. Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Federal student aid regulations mandate that students who wish to be considered for financial aid must be making satisfactory progress in a degree or certificat e program. This requirement applies to the entire period of enrollment at Bastyr University, even though students may not have received financial aid for some periods of enrollment. Satisfactory academic progress is currently reviewed at the end of each sp ring quarter. It is also students' responsibility to monitor their own progress. All students must meet the published academic standards for their individual programs. Students placed on suspension or limited suspension are not eligible for financial aid. Undergraduate students awarded a State Need Grant must complete at least 50 percent of the credits for which they received funding for that quarter. Failure to complete the required number of credits each quarter will result in cancellation of subsequent disbursements. Satisfactory academic progress is monitored at the end of each quarter for this program. See the student portal (MyBU) under Financial Aid menu option for the complete satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid eligibility. Required Return of Federal Financial Aid The University is required to return federal Title VI funds when a student fully withdraws during the first 60 percent of any quarter. Please see the student portal (MyBU) under financial aid for the complete policy. Required Return of State Financial Aid The University is required to return state financial aid when a student fully withdraws during the first half of any quarter. Please see the student portal (MyBU) under financial aid for the complete policy. Gainfu l Employment Compliance As of July 1, 2011, the U.S. Department of Education will require institutions who participate in the student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, to report certain informatio n about students enrolled in their Title IV eligible programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation. At this time, the regulations only apply to the certificate programs in Chinese Herbal Medicine and Holistic Landscape Design. The fol lowing links to our website will provide that information: Certificate in Chinese Herbal Medicine www.herbal1.bastyr.edu Certificate in Holistic Landscape Design www.landscape.bastyr.edu Bastyr Undergradu ate Programs MISSION STATEMENT FOR UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS The mission of the Bastyr University bachelor's degree completion programs is to help each student build a strong foundation of basic knowledge and skills, as well as fostering a greater understan ding of health of body, mind and spirit. VISION STATEMENT FOR UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS The Bastyr University bachelor's degree completion programs provide students with opportunities to develop competency in basic skills such as written and verbal communica tion, critical thinking and the ability to work cooperatively with others. The degree completion programs also provide students with opportunities to develop competency in the fundamental theories, models, core knowledge and skills of their major field of study. The degree completion programs uniquely emphasize the importance of holism and the natural health arts and sciences. The programs provide students with opportunities to develop a deeper understanding of the interconnections between body, mind and sp irit and learn to foster wellness in themselves and others through approaches found in the natural health arts and sciences. UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AT BASTYR UNIVERSITY As Bastyr University continues to develop undergraduate degree offerings, we strive t o maintain consistency across all programs in terms of admissions requirements, shared courses, double majors and undergraduate student support. The undergraduate experience at Bastyr encompasses a range of academic programs, which are coordinated by the u ndergraduate committee. Admissions requirements, the structure of interdisciplinary courses, double majors and general policy issues affecting undergraduates are all considered by this committee. The undergraduate committee works closely with the admission s office to ensure that applicants who meet all basic criteria are admitted to the University and to the undergraduate program of their choice. THE UNDERGRADUATE MAJORS Exercise Science and Wellness (Curriculum can be found on page 53.) Health Psychology (Curriculum can be found on page 46.) Herbal Sciences (Curriculum can be found on page 67.) Nutrition (Curriculum can be found on page 52.) Nutrition and Culinary Arts (Curriculum can be found on page 57.) Nutrition with DPD (Curriculum can be found on pa ge 55.) Nutrition and Exercise Science (Curriculum can be found on page 56.) FULL-TIME EXPECTATIONS The undergraduate curricula are designed for full -time participants. Students may complete a program on a part-time basis, but should recognize that there may be scheduling conflicts between required courses. It is the responsibility of a student who wishes to complete a program on a part -time basis to work with an advisor to arrange an appropriate schedule. Special sections will not be offered to accommodat e the needs of part -time students. DOUBLE MAJORS FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS Bastyr University will allow students to complete two majors, provided students are in good standing at the time they wish to declare the second major. The second major cannot be declared until the second quarter of attendance. However, students may start attending courses required for the second major in their first quarter of attendance. Students must submit a declaration of double major form to the registrar's office at the time the major is declared. Students are required to have their program of study approved by the appropriate chair(s) and/or dean(s) at the time the double major is declared. There are no predetermined schedules for the double majors. It is the student's resp onsibility to create appropriate schedules for double major combinations. Students must meet quarterly with the undergraduate advisor in the registrar's office for assistance in tracking the progress of the two majors. Students are advised that declaring a double major will increase the amount of time it takes to graduate. The minimum amount of time to complete any double major is three years. If the required courses for any quarter exceed the limit on student credit loads as outlined in the \"Limits on Stu dent Credit Loads\" policy of the Academic Policy & Procedure Manual , the student must obtain permission from the academic chairs of both majors. Students earning a double major must usually complete no fewer than 220 credits. The credit requirement total for double majors is determined by the total of the prerequisite basic proficiency, science and general education credits, the major core credits in both programs (where duplication exists between the majors, it is not required to make up the credits repr esented by the duplication) and any elective credit requirement with defined parameters for one or both majors (for example, two activity credits required for exercise science and wellness majors). UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC PROBATION , SUSPENSION AND DISMI SSAL Summary information on academic probation, suspension and dismissal as well as the appeals process, applicable to all students, is provided on page 13 of this catalog. In addition to the information provided below, more specific standards, guidelines and practices may be developed and published by individual schools and/or programs of the University. Undergraduate students should refer to the complete policies governing probation, suspension, dismissal and appeals published in the Academic Policy and P rocedure Manual . Reasons for Academic Probation An undergraduate student may be placed on academic probation under the following circumstances: The student's cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 The student's GPA for the quarter is below that required f or graduation, even if the student's cumulative GPA is above that required for graduation The student earned a grade lower than the minimum required by the school or program in a required course, internship or clinical rotation The student's record sh ows that s/he has failed a course more than once, or that the student has a number of incompletes and/or withdrawals that the dean or dean's designee considers to be of concern A student placed on academic probation will be required to meet with a faculty advisor to develop an academic improvement plan that the student must complete in order to be removed from academic probation.

Bastyr Center is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary clinic providing quality training for students in all of the Univ ersity's programs. Within the acupuncture and Oriental medicine clinic, students receive clinical training in acupuncture and Chinese herbs. In addition to training at the University clinic, students have the opportunity to train at several community medic al sites that provide clinical experience in working with diverse populations. The clinical training program begins in the first year and is comprised of three observation shifts, one preceptorship and either 14 (MSA) or 16 (MSAOM) student clinician shifts . The three observation shifts can be completed in any of the five quarters preceding clinician status. All observation hours, shifts and interim observation hours must be completed prior to starting as a student clinician, in spring of the second year. Th e preceptorship shift may be performed in either the observation or clinician phase of training. A minimum of one observation shift must be completed in order to do a preceptorship. Students in the MSAOM program or the CCHM program also take eight Chinese herbal shifts and two Chinese herbal dispensary shifts in the latter portion of their program. On a space available basis, students are welcome to take additional clinic shifts for elective credit. However, elective shifts cannot be used to make up missing hours in core shifts due to prior or future absences. Admission as a clinician to the AOM student training clinic at Bastyr Center for Natural Health is based on: 1) good academic standing, 2) completion of a bachelor's degree or being enrolled in or grad uated from an acupuncture master's program, 3) completion of the required prerequisite curriculum, 4) successful passage of the clinic entry written and practical exam, 5) current CPR for health care provider certification, and 6) certification in Clean Ne edle Technique (CNT).

ACUPUNCTURE AND ORIENTAL MEDICINE DOCTORAL PROGRAM MISSION STATEMENT The mission of Bastyr University's Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine program is to develop the knowledge and skills of qualified practitioners in the specialties of integrated oncology and advanced pain management. The program accomplishes this through rigorous training in TCM and biomedical concepts, and by emphasizing an integrative model of care delivery. The program graduates leaders in the field of acupuncture and Oriental medicine prepared for lifelong learning and achievement in clinical practice, education and scholarship. EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES Graduates of the School of Acupuncture an d Oriental Medicine's clinical doctoral program will have the skills to: 1) Develop an advanced TCM diagnosis and treatment plan including all applicable modalities within the scope of practice, commensurate with patients' health statuses 2) Demonstrate an understanding of allopathic oncology and pain treatment protocols in order to inform TCM care 3) Discuss treatment planning issues as part of an integrated medical team 4) Demonstrate an ability to participate as part of a clinic supervisory team educatin g master's students in acupuncture and Oriental medicine 5) Conduct research that demonstrates knowledge and skills in study design and comprehension The AOM clinical doctorate is focused on training students in cancer care and advanced pain management and treatment with an emphasis on training in integrated clinical settings. Students develop skills in clinical research and teaching with an in -depth focus on a medical specialty. Courses include advanced Chinese medical classics, advanced acupuncture techni ques, Chinese herbs and therapeutics classes. Basic science classes focus on oncology and pain conditions pertaining to pathology and pharmacology. The curriculum also includes nutrition and patient management courses. A capstone research project is requir ed. The degree title is \"DAOM,\" Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. At the present time, there is no change in scope of practice for DAOM graduates. Students would choose to pursue this training if they are 1) interested in a doctoral degree in tr aditional Chinese medicine, 2) interested in oncology and management of advanced pain conditions and /or 3) interested in learning to conduct clinical research. This is a clinical doctoral degree, not a PhD program. CLINICAL COMPONENT The DAOM program em phasizes clinical training in integrated care settings, with rotations at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, Seattle, Washington; Providence Regional Medical Center, Everett, Washington; and Skagit Valley Hospital Regional Cancer Care Center, Mount Vernon, Washington. In their final quarter of study, DAOM students travel to China and complete additional studies at Chengdu and Shanghai Universities of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Students take a one -credit elective course, Clinic Entry for China, in spring quarter of their second year in preparation for China studies. There are additional expenses associated with the China studies other than tuition, including travel, lodging and living expenses, and laboratory fees assessed by institutions in China. With pla nning, these expenses can be covered by financial aid. Bastyr University holds fundraising events to support China studies. DAOM students may choose to participate in these fundraising events to help defray travel expenses in China. See the DAOM program di rector for more information. CAPSTONE THESIS PROJECT As part of the program of study, DAOM students must complete a capstone research project. Capstone projects may take a variety of formats, including clinical or basic research, surveys, translation, sys tematic review or theoretical analysis. Students are expected to conduct and complete their capstone project, including final acceptance of their capstone paper, by the time all other program requirements are completed. If additional time is needed for com pletion and all other program requirements are finished, then students will be assessed an additional fee (equal to 1 credit of tuition) on a quarter by quarter basis until completion. Please see OM8199 \"Capstone Continuation\" and/or the Capstone Project H andbook for further details. PREREQUISITES Minimum prerequisites for the doctor of acupuncture and Oriental medicine degree are a master's degree in acupuncture or acupuncture and Oriental medicine or a certificate of acupuncture with 10 years of document ed clinical experience. Prospective students with certificates of acupuncture should contact the admissions office for specialized assistance. Applicants with AOM master's degrees must have graduated from an ACAOM -candidate or -accredited program and have formal academic training in Chinese herbs. If applicants do not have a Chinese herb background, then they must complete the Certificate in Chinese Herbal Medicine as a prerequisite. Students may begin their doctoral studies if the classroom portion of the certificate has been completed. The clinical portion of the CCHM may be done concurrently with the DAOM program. Applicants to the doctoral program need to either have completed or be in the process of completing the following coursework: Intermediate a lgebra ................................ ................................ .... 3 quarter credits General chemistry (allied health level with lab) ................................ ................... 4 quarter credits 1Intermediate algebra is pre -college level. Doctoral applicants must have a background in the basic sciences that is comparable to Ba styr University's master's curriculum. Upon review of past coursework, applicants may be asked to take a higher level science course or complete a competency exam. The minimum GPA for any past college -level education is a 2.50. The curriculum table that follows lists the tentative schedule of courses each quarter. Next to each course are the number of credits per course (Crdt.), the lecture hours each week (Lec.), the lab/clinic hours each week (L/C) and the total contact hours for the course over the en tire quarter (Tot).

This course cannot be audited. Department of Mid wifery MISSION STATEMENT The mission of the Department of Midwifery is to educate and inspire leaders in the profession of midwifery. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The Department of Midwifery educates midwives to conform to national and international standards of midwifery competence and to do the following: practice autonomously in a variety of settings, which may include homes, birth centers, clinics and hospitals promote birth as a normal process requiring a minimum of intervention function within the health care system, consulting and referring appropriately qualify for licensure or registration in a variety of jurisdictions, including certification by the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) promote midwifery through state, provincial and national professional organizations, the political process, research activities and policy development work in partnership with the women they serve in a way that promotes personal responsibility, validates knowledge and experience, and encourages lifelong learn ing promote the Midwives Model of Care PROGRAM OVERVIEW Bastyr University is pleased to offer a Master of Science in Midwifery and a combined Bachelor/Master of Science in Midwifery. The midwifery program at Bastyr is unique. Based on the combined expe rtise of Bastyr University and the former Seattle Midwifery School, the department has developed a rigorous, proven curriculum using state -of-the-art technologies and an extensive network of national and international clinical sites. Bastyr's direct -entry midwifery program is designed to prepare students in all aspects of midwifery care based on the competencies established by the Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA). This robust program is intended for students with little or no background in midwife ry. Upon completion of the three -year program, students are eligible to sit for an examination to become licensed as a midwife in Washington or other states or provinces and to become nationally certified by the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) as a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM). In the United States, direct -entry midwives attend mainly out -of- hospital births. Students have a maximum of five calendar years from first date of enrollment, including leaves of absence, in which to complete the program. The department welcomes students who have previous midwifery training or practicing midwives who have not attended a formal midwifery educational program and/or want to obtain a degree. All students in the program must meet the transfer credit re quirements and complete at least two -thirds of the program and all of the practicum while enrolled at Bastyr. MIDWIFERY MASTER 'S, COMBINED BACHELOR 'S/MASTER 'S PROGRAM The Master of Science in Midwifery is available to students who already hold a bachelor' s degree from a regionally accredited college/university and who complete the program prerequisites prior to entering the program. The combined Bachelor/ Master of Science in Midwifery option is available to students who have completed at least two years a t the undergraduate level (60 semester or 90 quarter credits), including the basic science and proficiency prerequisites and general education requirements. LOW RESIDENCY MODEL One of the most exciting aspects of this program is its low -residency model. This hybrid delivery system allows students to remain in their communities and commute to the Bastyr campus three times each quarter for onsite learning. When not physically on campus, students use the Internet classroom to correspond with classmates and i nstructors, participate in discussions, complete homework assignments and take tests. Each cohort of students (determined by year of entry) attends the same onsite weeks together, which allows for the face -to-face learning experience that is vital to midwi fery training and allows students to build strong relationships with classmates and faculty. Because students are face -to-face with their instructors only three times each quarter, attendance onsite is mandatory. When not attending classes onsite, student s are engaged in learning activities in the virtual classroom using our online learning system as a guide and point of interaction. Learning activities include extensive reading, video viewing, research projects, worksheets, quizzes and online discussions. Students need to be self -directed, self-motivated and have good time management skills in order to be successful in this low -residency program. MIDWIFERY CURRICULUM The midwifery curriculum is enhanced by studies in related fields such as epidemiology, nutrition, pharmacology, genetics, embryology, counseling and education. The Midwifery Care courses are the foundation of the program. All courses build skills necessary for the practice of midwifery through the use of case questions, skills -practice labs, role-plays, discussion, student presentations and research projects. Clinical skills and judgment capabilities are honed during practicum with practicing midwives. The midwifery program addresses both the art and science of midwifery by integrating theory with clinical experience. CLINICAL EXPERIENCE The Department of Midwifery places all students in qualified clinical training sites. The program replicates the age -old apprenticeship model, where students work side -by-side with experienced preceptors who are licensed midwives and other professionals. Department staff work closely with each student in the process of arranging these clinical placements. Students need to live within a one -hour commute of a qualified clinical faculty and must be prepared to r elocate temporarily if the community where they reside does not have adequate clinical training opportunities. This requires flexibility and the support of the student's family, as it may mean separation and economic challenges. The clinical practicum begi ns in the third quarter of the program. Students start off very slowly, primarily observing for the first few months. What students are able to do in their preceptorships mirrors what they are learning in the classroom. Basic clinical skills, such as perfo rming blood draws, IVs, physical/ vaginal exams, pap smears, neonatal resuscitation, etc., are all taught in the classroom first. Students will be required to obtain training in adult CPR, have a TB test, demonstrate rubella immunity and pass a criminal ba ckground check. (A fee will be charged in MW4800 for the background check.) Students returning from a leave of absence will be required to have clinical skills assessed and may need remedial skills training before becoming eligible for a practicum assignme nt. Students may obtain their clinical experience in gynecology/family planning clinics, prenatal/postpartum clinics, homebirth settings, birth centers and hospitals in North America as well as overseas. (See Graduation Requirements for more specifics abou t clinical training requirements.) Students may work with licensed midwives, certified professional midwives, certified nurse -midwives, nurse practitioners, foreign midwives, naturopathic doctors, physician assistants or physicians. Clinical faculty must b e practicing legally and have sufficient obstetrical/gynecological volume to adequately instruct, supervise and evaluate students' clinical training. The Department of Midwifery screens and approves all potential clinical faculty. ADMISSION For general i nformation on the admissions process, please refer to the admissions section in this catalog.

BACHELOR OF SCIENCE WITH A MAJOR IN NUTRITION WITH DIDACTIC PROGRAM IN DIETETICS (BSN/DPD) The Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) is a term used by the American Dietetic Association (ADA) to describe a program that is accredited by the Com mission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education (CADE), which meets academic competencies. Currently, in the United States, the registered dietitian (RD) is the only professional credential in nutrition recognized by all 50 states and with reciprocity in five countries. Verified completion of the DPD and a minimum of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution enable a student to apply for a dietetic internship, to write the registration examination to become an RD after completing the Die tetic Internship and to become an RD after successfully passing the registration examination. The mission of the program is to graduate students who will promote nutrition and well -being through food that sustains the individual, the community and the eart h. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND PREREQUISITES Application for admission to the BSN/DPD at Bastyr University is separate from application to the degree programs. BSN/DPD application packets can be requested from the Bastyr University Office of Admissions at the beginning of spring quarter between the junior and senior year. Acceptance requires the following prerequisites in addition to those for the Bachelor of Science with a Major in Nutrition: public speaking (if general or speech communication, then must p rovide evidence of public speaking practice; this requirement is independent of any curriculum standards of the student's prior institution) and current enrollment at Bastyr University. To be eligible for acceptance into the BSN/DPD, students must have com pleted their junior year and must meet all prerequisites for the BSN completion degree. To be competitive for admission into the BSN/DPD, the following GPAs are required (cumulative from all colleges and universities attended): Cumulative overall GPA - total of all courses 3.00 Cumulative science GPA - biology, organic chemistry, anatomy and physiology, and biochemistry courses only 3.00 Cumulative nutrition GPA - all nutrition courses 3.00 A minimum of 150 hours of volunteer and/or paid work experience is required prior to being admitted to the BSN/DPD. Documentation of hours with signature of sponsor is required. Specific information and forms for documenting these experiences is available from the admissions department. The following is a breakdown of the volunteer and/or paid work hours required for admission: Minimum of 50 hours clinical nutrition (in -patient hospital and/or long -term care) Minimum of 50 hours food service management Minimum of 50 hours community nutrition ADMISSION TO CLINICAL TRAINING In order to enroll in clinical dietetic practicum, students must have successfully completed TR4207, RD4302, must be enrolled in TR4303 as a corequisite, and must have met the criteria for behavior and attitude as outlined in the Nutrition Student Cl inician Handbook .

BOTANICAL MEDICINE DEPARTMENT VISION We facilitate learning about plants and plant -centered medi cine, guiding students to apply this knowledge toward growing, harvesting, manufacturing and clinical practice. The inclusive range of knowledge runs from traditional wisdom to contemporary scientific information, emphasizing critical and creative thought and discovery. A Bachelor of Science degree completion program with a major in herbal sciences is designed to provide a thorough, scientifically rigorous and inspiring exploration of herbalism and its applications. The curriculum of the herbal sciences m ajor does not include the diagnosis and treatment of disease, but rather introduces the student to concepts of disease prevention and health maintenance using medicinal herbs. The curriculum addresses economic, historical and sociopolitical perspectives re garding herbal sciences. Additionally, issues related to herbal product manufacturing and quality assurance/quality control introduce the analytical aspects of herbs and herbal products. This program offers a substantial breadth of perspectives and approac hes in the herbal sciences. The program is based upon scientific inquiry in the herbal sciences. Courses in Anatomy and Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Botany occur during the first year of this program. Beginning in the first year and hea vily concentrated in the second year are courses exploring various aspects of the herbal sciences. Introduction to Herbal Sciences, Herbal Preparations, and Herbal Medicine History and Traditions lay a foundation in the junior year. In Research Methods for Herbal Sciences, the student learns to interpret scientific literature on medicinal herbs. In Ethnobotany, the door opens to the connection between people and plants in indigenous cultures, old and new. The senior year includes Pharmacology, Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Actions of a core of Materia Medica, deepening the knowledge base. Northwest Herbs and First Aid for Herbalists lend hands -on experiences. In additional courses, the student becomes familiar with environmental, economic and political issues surrounding the herbal sciences. There are electives available that cover a wide array of topics including diverse field courses. Additionally, students are required to complete a 44 -hour practicum with herbal manufacturers, herb growers, wildcrafters, pra ctitioners or researchers. Upon completion of this program, each student is uniquely qualified to enter the herbal industry, enter a clinically based program or pursue further education in a related field.

DOCTOR OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE Naturopathic medicine is a distinct profession of primary health care, emphasizing prevention, treatment and the promotion of optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods a nd modalities which encourage the self-healing process, the vis medicatrix naturae . The U.S. Department of Labor defines naturopathic physicians as doctors who \"diagnose, treat, and help prevent diseases using a system of practice that is based on the nat ural healing capacity of individuals. May use physiological, psychological or mechanical methods. May also use natural medicines, prescription or legend drugs, foods, herbs, or other natural remedies.\" Most naturopathic physicians provide natural medicine primary care through office -based, private practice. Many receive additional training in disciplines or modalities such as acupuncture and Oriental medicine. Naturopathic diagnosis and therapeutics are supported by scientific research drawn from peer -reviewed journals from many disciplines, including naturopathic medicine, conventional medicine, European complementary medicine, clinical nutrition, phytotherapy, pharmacognosy, homeopathy, psychology and spirituality. Information technology and new concepts in clinical outcomes assessment are particularly well - suited to evaluating the effectiveness of naturopathic treatment protocols and are being used in research, both at naturopathic medical schools and in the offices of practicing physicians. Clinical rese arch into natural therapies has become an increasingly important focus for naturopathic physicians. A NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE GRADUATE OF BASTYR UNIVERSITY 'S SCHOOL OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE WILL: Be an empowered, strong practitioner Be trained to the st andards of a primary care physician as accepted by the profession Be a provider of excellent and consistent, quality patient care Practice the principles of naturopathic medicine Be an integrated, active participant in the community PRINCIPLES OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE The Healing Power of Nature ( Vis Medicatrix Naturae ) Identify and Treat the Do No Doctor as Teacher ( Docere ) Treat the Whole Person Prevention Wellness SCOPE OF PRACTICE Naturopathic medicine is defined by principles rather than by methods or modalities. Diagnostic and therapeutic methods are diverse. The current scope of practice for a naturopathic physician covers the general practice of naturopathic medicine, as a primary care phys ician. This scope of practice includes, but is not limited to, the following diagnostic and therapeutic modalities: nutritional science, natural hygiene, botanical medicine, naturopathic physical medicine, homeopathy, counseling, spirituality, minor office procedures and methods of laboratory and clinical diagnosis. The scope of practice is defined by state or provincial statute. The curriculum at Bastyr University matches the requirements listed by the Washington State Department of Health. Students have t he responsibility to be informed on licensure and scope of practice in the legal jurisdiction in which they choose to practice.

REQUIRED ABILITIES /SKILLS FOR NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE PROGRAM ADMISSION Bastyr University is committed to providing equal opportunities for differently abled persons. The following policy has been adapted from the American Association of Medical Colleges guidelines to ensure that prospective students have the physical and mental capacities to perform the required duties of a naturopathic physician. A candidate for the naturopathic medicine degree must be able to demonstrate appropriate observational and c ommunication skills, motor function, intellectual -conceptual, integrative and quantitative abilities, and behavioral and social maturity. Technological compensation can be made for some disabilities in certain of these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selection and observation. Observation: The candidate must be able to observe demonstrations an d experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to microbiologic cultures and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and somatic sensation. These are enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. Communication: A candidate must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity, and posture, and perceive nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and w riting. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor: Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to do basic laboratory tests (urinalysis, CBC, etc.), re -position a patient, carry out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and read ECGs and x-rays. A candidate should be abl e to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, applicatio n of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, the suturing of simple wounds, and the performance of simple obstetrical maneuvers. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Intellectual -Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, a critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three -dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes: A candidate must possess the emotion al health required for full utilization of her/his intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing work loads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of un certainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admissions and educational processes. ADMISSIO NS CRITERIA The admissions committee of the naturopathic medicine program determines the processes and procedures that guide the selection of candidates for the naturopathic program. The committee reviews undergraduate and graduate (if applicable) academic records and performance in the required prerequisite courses. The personal statement, references, resumes and in person interviews are also evaluated for evidence of the abilities and skills required of naturopathic physicians. The interview also explores the candidate's awareness of the practice of naturopathic medicine. Bastyr University's naturopathic medicine program is academically challenging. While no minimum GPA is specified, the mean GPA for entering students in the last five years has exceeded 3. 3. INTERVIEWS Qualified applicants who submit complete applications and meet the prerequisites may be invited to interview. Applicants are expected to interview at the University's campus in Kenmore, Washington. A limited number of exceptions are made to accommodate special circumstances. TRANSFER STUDENTS Bastyr University accepts transfer students from naturopathic, medical, osteopathic and chiropractic schools and other accredited professional programs on a space -available basis. For transfer considera tion, credits must be earned from an institution accredited by a regional accrediting agency or from an institution accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). Transfer students are considered for admission in accordance with the fo llowing general guidelines: Applicants must meet the same entrance requirements as candidates for the first -year class. Applicants who wish to transfer credits from prior coursework must demonstrate satisfactory completion of courses that are equivalen t in content and quality to courses given at the University. Satisfactory completion equals a grade of achieved competency, a C or above, or a 2.0 or above. Applicants must provide an official transcript from the college or program from which the transfe r is being requested, demonstrating that they are leaving in good academic standing, and they should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorough evaluation. Transfer applicants must submit a $75 transfer evaluation fee. ADVANCED STANDING STATUS BASED ON PRIOR MEDICAL EDUCATION Applicants who have completed professional programs may be considered for advanced standing status. Those applicants who graduated from accredited chiropractic, medical or osteopathic colleges may be eligib le for advanced standing in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program. All advanced standing students must complete at least two -thirds of the program and do all of their clinical work at Bastyr University. They are eligible for a maximum of 103 credits toward advanced standing. In those instances where the maximum number of advanced standing transfer credits is granted, it will take a minimum of three years (11 quarters) to complete the program. Placement depends upon the amount of coursework com pleted in the original program, similarity of the course content and credits, age of the courses and performance in these courses. A student must provide documentation which shows the competencies of the Bastyr University course have been met. Course waive rs and/or credit transfers are considered only for those courses in which applicants demonstrate a grade of achieved competence, a C or above, or a 2.0 or above. An exam to determine competency may also be required. Advanced standing applicants must comple te all of the course and credit requirements in effect at the time of their enrollment in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program. Final waiver and/or transfer credit decisions rest with the dean of the school in which the curriculum is taught. Advanced standing is determined on a case by case basis and depends on the type of degree program completed, the courses taken and the number of years in practice. Applicants who are eligible for advanced standing must submit a $75 advanced standing evalu ation fee. Applicants must submit a catalog of course descriptions for the years they attended their professional program and should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorough evaluation. If an advanced standing student is found to be deficient in some area(s) of study, s/he may be required to complete additional courses at Bastyr University. For more information on advanced standing status admission policies and procedures, contact the admissions office. BASIC SCIENCES CURRICULU M WITHIN NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE Basic science courses within the naturopathic medicine program emphasize anatomy, physiology and biochemistry as the foundation for further basic sciences and all clinical courses. Further courses include Histology, Patholog y, Pharmacology, Immunology, Infectious Diseases, Embryology, Neuroscience and Research Design. The basic sciences faculty encourages and expects students to advance beyond the simple learning of scientific facts and to integrate systematically the informa tion from basic science disciplines into a unified model of human organization and function. This educational scheme requires students to assume an active role in the learning process and encourages them to adopt this inquisitive behavior for a lifetime. P roblem solving, clinical cases and examples are an integral part of the basic science curriculum. This educational process is an expression of Bastyr University's basic philosophy of a holistic approach to human behavior, health and therapeutics. The basic sciences faculty encourages students to become totally absorbed in an integrated approach to learning and understanding. Instructors are readily available to facilitate this process on an individual basis. The department also offers science courses that s atisfy prerequisite requirements, including courses in General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry. COUNSELING AND HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY CURRICULUM WITHIN NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE The counseling and health psychology curriculum serves naturopathic medical students in understanding and effecting change in the emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensions of human functioning. The naturopathic medicine program includes five core counseling and health psychology courses. These courses are designed to build the following competencies: Study of the nature and process of healing Development of therapeutic counselor characteristics and communication skills Development of comfort in the role of counseling physician and a sense of counseling style and skill. Ability to select and implement holistic counseling interventions and strategies Ability to assess and stimulate psychological wellness Ability to understand and utilize the body/mind/spirit interaction in the healing process Ability to assess psychological fu nctioning and make clinical judgments regarding the appropriateness of treating individuals in naturopathic practice Ability to make appropriate psychological referrals Naturopathic principles and cross -cultural perspectives are woven throughout all coun seling and health psychology courses in the naturopathic medicine program. The following core courses are required of all naturopathic medicine students: PS6305: Naturopathic Counseling 1 - 3 credits PS6306: Naturopathic Counseling 2 - 3 credits PS72 00: Psychological Assessment - 2 credits PS7203: Addictions and Disorders - 2 credits PS7315: Naturopathic Counseling 3 - 2 credits For additional counseling and health psychology courses available as electives to matriculated students, please see the course listings in this catalog or the current quarterly schedule of classes. Departments Within the Naturopathic Medicine Program BOTANICAL MEDICINE (For Department of Botanical Medicine Mission and Vision, see page 66.) Botanical medicine is a core mod ality for naturopathic physicians to use in optimizing the health and well - being of their patients. Medicinal plants have been used as food and medicine by all peoples on all continents. The importance of plants to humans has been recorded in cave painting s 60,000 years old. A contemporary renaissance in herbal medicine weds traditional use and wisdom with modern analytical methodologies for optimal medical applications for today. Empirical knowledge of plant therapeutics is based on Western and holistic th ought rather than reductionistic paradigms and is linked with contemporary scientific knowledge. The core curriculum in botanical medicine for naturopathic medical students covers fundamental plant identification and nomenclature, pharmacognosy, therapeuti c actions, extraction principles, dosage considerations, contraindications, toxicology, herb -drug interactions, clinical applications and treatment regimens. Clinical therapeutics draw from traditional uses, naturopathic formulae and use, and from internat ional scientific and clinical research, as well as advances in phytotherapy. Several of the materia medica courses are linked with a laboratory experience in the botanical medicine lab on campus. Completion of the required curriculum, along with the requir ed clinical experience, prepares the student for effective and safe clinical utilization of preventive and therapeutic botanicals. A variety of botanical medicine elective and special topic courses are offered to students in the naturopathic medicine progr am and other programs, along with independent study options. The Bastyr garden is managed by the botanical medicine department, with support from the University and donations. It is maintained primarily by a staff garden supervisor and work -study students. The botanical medicine department continues to build an herbarium, although the vast University of Washington herbarium is used as one of Bastyr's teaching venues. The department supports a botanical medicine lab to expand class experience and provide a s pace for students to continue exploring their work and passion for herbs. HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE Homeopathic medicine is a broad therapeutic modality that is integral to naturopathic medicine. Homeopathy is based on the law of similars. This principle state s that a substance that is capable of producing symptoms of disease in a healthy person can cure an ill patient presenting a similar pattern of disease symptoms. Homeopathic medicines stimulate a person's inherent defense mechanism. The entire range of mental, emotional and physical symptoms is considered with each patient. A single medicine is then chosen that addresses the complex pattern of the patient, while emphasizing the uniqueness of the individual. The homeopathic curriculum at Bastyr University in cludes the basic principles and philosophy of homeopathy, materia medica of commonly used homeopathic medicines, use of the homeopathic repertory, taking a homeopathic case, homeopathic case analysis and practical therapeutics for common medical situations . All naturopathic students are required to take three courses in homeopathy, HO6300, HO6301, and HO6302 (Homeopathy 1 -3). There are three additional elective courses, HO9301, HO9302, and HO9303 (Homeopathy 4 -6), which explore, in more depth, the areas of homeopathic philosophy, materia medica, case analysis and management, and homeopathic therapeutics. Naturopathic students, upon successful completion of Homeopathy 1 -3, may register for shifts in the Homeopathy Specialty Clinic at Bastyr Center for Natural Health. Students registered for a homeopathy shift must register concurrently for Homeopathy Grand Rounds. PHYSICAL MEDICINE Physical medicine is an integral part of naturopathic medicine. It includes various modalities such as hydrotherapy, osseous and soft tissue manipulation, sports medicine and therapeutic exercise. The course of study and clinical training in physical medicine enable students to develop a solid foundation for entry into the practice of naturopathic medicine. The curriculum offers su fficient hours in manipulation to satisfy the state of Washington's licensing requirement as a naturopathic physician. The physical medicine curriculum begins by teaching students the art of touch and palpation, introduction to basic Swedish massage techni ques and soft tissue manipulation, and then progresses to osseous manipulation. SUMMER MASSAGE INTENSIVE Bastyr University and Bellevue Massage School Center for Healing Arts offer students a summer massage training program that allows them to apply cours ework taken at Bastyr University toward the Washington state requirements for massage licensure. This course cannot be audited. Students interested in further information may meet with their academic advisor in the registrar's office or with their departme nt's program supervisor to discuss the program availability and the course prerequisites. NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE CLINIC ENTRANCE PREREQUISITES Naturopathic medicine students must complete and achieve competency in all required classes prior to entering cl inical training.

NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE /ACUPUNCTURE AND ORIENTAL MEDICINE DUAL TRACK Students in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program who are academically in good standing have the oppo rtunity to apply to the Master of Science in Acupuncture (MSA) or the Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (MSAOM) program in October of their second year of the four -year track. This requires a formal application to the acupuncture and O riental medicine program through the admissions department, followed by a joint interview by both the AOM and ND schools. ND students who are considering applying to the School of AOM as their second program are strongly encouraged to be enrolled as four -year track students during their first two years of attendance. In essence, the dual track program requires that students have successfully completed their pre -clinical ND training before they add a second degree program. Students who are accepted into the AOM program must switch their naturopathic program to the five -year track in order to carry a combined program load. Students with advanced medical training, e.g., DC, DO or MD, must successfully complete the first year of study in their original program before acceptance into dual status. Dual program applicants are able to utilize their basic science coursework in the naturopathic program toward their MSA or MSAOM. Please note that some states require Chinese herbal training for acupuncture licensure. P lease see the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine master's program description for complete information on degree and licensing requirements. DUAL TRACK ELECTIVE CREDITS ND/MSAOM students must complete ten elective credits. ND/MSA students must co mplete thirteen elective credits. For all dual track students, five of the elective credits much be from disciplines other than OM or CH. If a dual track student has waived a required course from either program, core course credit from the opposite program cannot be used to cover the waiver. Use of core credits would result in a shortage of overall credits. The curriculum tables that follow list the tentative schedule of courses each quarter. Next to each course are the number of credits per course (Crdt.) , the lecture hours each week (Lec.), the lab/clinic hours each week (L/C) and the total contact hours for the course over the entire quarter (Tot). DOCTOR OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE /MASTER OF SCIENCE IN ACUPUNCTURE (MSA) OR ACUPUNCTURE AND ORIENTAL MEDICIN E (MSAOM) 2011 -2012 Note: Since a naturopathic medicine student enters the dual program after completion of the 2nd year of the NM program, the curriculum that follows reflects the NM curriculum from the 2009/2010 catalog and the MSA/MSAOM curriculum from the 2011 -2012 catalog.

All students in the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program (ND), Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine program (DAOM), Master of Science in Acupuncture program (MSA), Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Me dicine program (MSAOM), Master of Nutrition program (MSN/CHP and MSN/DPD), Certificate in Chinese Herbal Medicine program (CCHM), and BS Didactic Program in Dietetics (BSN/DPD) receive clinical training at Bastyr Center for Natural Health - Team Care. The program deans/chairs or their designates in conjunction with the clinic medical director oversee the clinical education and training of the students and work closely with each program's lead administrator. The clinical training in Team Care is modeled upon mentorship. The average faculty/student ratio is 1:6, which includes three primary clinicians and three observing clinicians. Each student pair is assigned to a room throughout the quarter. Each clinic shift begins with case preview during which the stude nts present to the supervisor their preparations for the patients they will see that day. During each patient visit, the supervisor spends time in the room with the student team and the patient. Also, during each visit, the supervisor and student team disc uss the patient in the consult rooms, reviewing the assessments and treatment recommendations. Each clinic shift concludes with case review where all the students and supervisors meet jointly to discuss selected cases seen that day. Clinical course numbers and descriptions for each program's required and elective clinical offerings are found in the course description section of the catalog under the appropriate program heading. The narrative section of the catalog provides further information regarding clin ical training under each program and curriculum section. Students in each program receive a Bastyr Center for Natural Health Student Clinician Handbook prior to entering clinical training. This required manual serves as the student's clinic textbook and co ntains information on clinical education requirements, policies and procedures, learning objectives and clinical competencies. External clinical training opportunities have been developed for each program, in order to provide a broader educational experien ce for students. At each external site, Bastyr faculty supervises the student clinicians. For a description of these sites, see Bastyr Center facilities listing on page 12 in this catalog. Students have a preceptorship requirement where they work with a va riety of licensed, practicing health care professionals in various practice settings. These placements provide students with valuable clinical experience. The combination of external training sites, the preceptor experience and clinical rotations in the main clinic assures diversity in each student's clinical experience. Bastyr Center for Natural Health has a well -established CNME -credentialed naturopathic residency program, with positions both at Bastyr Center for Natural Health and numerous external site s. Currently, there are eight naturopathic residency positions at Bastyr Center for Natural Health. These programs are highly competitive and attract graduates from other educational institutions as well as from Bastyr. The residency programs at Bastyr are closely supervised programs of mentorship. Each resident progresses from a purely observational role into an independent role over the course of the year. This progression is monitored and facilitated by a faculty mentor and by the director of the Office of Graduate and Community Medicine. A second year of residency offers clinical supervision and continued skill development. All residents have multiple opportunities to do rotations in other local clinics. The director of the Office of Graduate and Communi ty Medicine is responsible for the administration, development and expansion of the naturopathic residency program. The University is committed to the goal of providing residency opportunities for every graduate.
