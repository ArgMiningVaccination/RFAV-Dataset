Automated processes for this type of analysis, such as natural language processing (NLP), have faced challenges extracting complex stances, like attitudes toward vaccines, from large text. Objective: In this study, we aimed to build upon recent advances in Transformer-based machine learning methods, and test if this could be used as a tool to assess the stance of social media posts towards vaccination during pregnancy. Methods: A total of 16,604 Tweets posted between 1 November 2018 and 30 April 2019 were selected by boolean searches related to maternal vaccination. Tweets were coded by three individual researchers into the categories \"Promotional\", \"Discouraging\", \"Ambiguous\" and \"Neutral\" After creating a final dataset of 2,722 unique tweets, multiple machine learning methods were trained on the dataset and then tested and compared to the human annotators. Results: We received an accuracy of 81.8% (F-score= 0.78) compared to the agreed score between the three annotators. For comparison, the accuracies of the individual annotators compared to the final score were 83.3%, 77.9% and 77.5%. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the ability to achieve close to the same accuracy in categorising tweets using our machine learning models as could be expected by a single human annotator. The potential to use this reliable and accurate automated process could free up valuable time and resource constraints of conducting this analysis, in addition to inform potentially effective and necessary interventions. Objective: Information exchange via Twitter and other forms of social media make public health communication more complex as citizens play an increasingly influential role in shaping acceptable or desired health behaviors. Taking the case of the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic, we explore in detail the dissemination of H1N1-related advice in the UK through Twitter to see how it was used to discourage or encourage vaccine and antiviral uptake. Methods: In three stages we conducted (1) an analysis of general content, retweeting patterns, and URL sharing, (2) a discourse analysis of the public evaluation of press releases and (3) a template analysis of conversations around vaccine and antiviral uptake, using Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) as a way of understanding how the public weighed the costs and benefits. results: Network analysis of retweets showed that information from official sources predominated. Analysing the spread of significant messages through Twitter showed that most content was descriptive but there was some criticism of health authorities. A detailed analysis of responses to press releases revealed some scepticism over the economic beneficiaries of vaccination, that served to undermine public trust. Finally, the conversational analysis showed the influence of peers when weighing up the risks and benefits of medication. conclusion: Most tweets linked to reliable sources, however Twitter was used to discuss both individual and health authority motivations to vaccinate. The PMT framework describes the ways individuals assessed the threat of the H1N1 pandemic, weighing this against the perceived cost of taking medication. These findings offer some valuable insights for social media communication practices in future pandemics. 2013 Pertussis, also called whooping cough, is an infectious and preventable pathology that generates important child morbidity and mortality worldwide. There are different biological preparations for its use in infants, while for adolescents and adults is Tdap, (acellular vaccine of purified extracts of Bordetella pertussis (BP), combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoid) that has been proposed as maternal vaccination (MV). The objective was to identify the benefits of MV in the prevention of childhood pertussis, a review was made in PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCOhosT, OvidSP and Embase databases (years 2008-2016) and an electronic alert system (January-April 2017). 1083 titles were identified and 44 articles were selected. After the MV (administered between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation) the passage of IgG-BP to the fetus is sufficient to generate adequate infant protection, generating two benefits: reducing infant morbidity (number of cases and hospital admissions) and decreasing mortality by pertussis. The MV offers 93% of effectiveness [95%CI: 81-97] and OR: 0.09 [95%CI: 0,03-0,25]. The MV is more favorable in each pregnancy than cocoon strategy, vaccination before pregnancy, before 26 weeks of gestation or in the postpartum. The use of MV is a safe and cost-effectiveness tool to prevent childhood pertussis.
