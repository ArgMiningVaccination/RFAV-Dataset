By 2020 mental health and substance abuse disorders will surpass all physical diseases as a major cause of disability worldwide. Abuse of prescription drugs is the largest drug problem in the United States, and one that is growing. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people from all age groups, ethnic backgrounds, and genders are affected by this disease. The 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) indicates 28.6 million people aged 12 or older used an illicit drug in the past 30 days, which corresponds to about 1 in 10 Americans overall (10.6% ); moreover, an estimated 11.8 million people misused opioids in the past year, including 11.5 million pain reliever misusers and 948,000 heroin users. Additional information is gathered in NSDUH on the misuse of pain reliev ers in the past year. Among people aged 12 or older who misused pain relievers in the past year, about 6 out of 10 people indicated that the main reason they misused pain reliev ers the last time was to relieve physical pain (62.3%), and about half (53.0%) indicated that they obtained the last pain relievers they misused from a friend or relative (SAMHSA, 2017b). Accidental overdose and misuse of prescription drugs leads to the severe consequences of death and addiction. In 2016 there were more than 63,600 drug overdose deaths in the United States. The age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths in 2016 (19.8 per 100,000) was 21% higher than the rate in 2015 (16.3) (Hedegaard et al., 2017). The New York Times recently reported that opioids are now the leading cause of death of Americans under the age of 50 (Katz, 2017). Defining the Problem Health professionals face a dilemma because they need prescription drugs for patients in pain but they also need to prevent the diversion and misuse of the drugs. Among the prescription drugs diverted and misused are opioid analgesics, powerful painkillers that are medically indicated in the treatment of chronic pain; however, when the patient takes the wrong dose, or the wrong person takes the opioid pain medication, consequences can be deadly.While the sales of opioid analgesics increased four -fold between 1999 and 2010, the United States concurrently experienced an almost four -fold increase in opioid o verdose deaths. Other consequences of the abundance of opioids include emergency department visits and admissions, falls and fr actures in older adults, and initiating injection drug use, which increases risk for infections such as hepatitis C and HIV , as well as a rising incidence of newborns experiencing withdr awal syndrome due to opioid use and misuse during pregnancy . West Virginia' s SB437, the Go vernor 's Substance Abuse Prev ention Bill, passed in March 2012, w as a response to the state' s need for additional education about drug div ersion and abuse mitigation. More recent legislation, Senate Bill 273, also known as the Opioid Reduction Act, became effectiv e June 7, 2018. Introduced at the request of Go vernor Jim Justice, the legislation sets limitations on opioid prescriptions and authoriz es a \"nonopioid directiv e\" patients can put in their medical files, formally notif ying healthcare professionals they do not w ant to be prescribed or administered opioid medications (WVDHHR, 2018). The following are some statistics for W est Virginia: In 2016 W est Virginia had the highest r ate of opioid-related o verdose deaths in the United States\u2014 a rate of 52.0 deaths per 100,000 population, which is up from 1.8 deaths per 100,000 in 1999. The peak number of o verdose deaths w as 733 in 2016. The majorit y of these deaths were from synthetic opioids and heroin. Since 2010, deaths related to synthetic opioids quadrupled from 102 to 435 and deaths related to heroin rose from 28 to 235. In 2013 W est Virginia pro viders wrote 110 opioid prescriptions per 100 persons (2.8 million prescriptions). The a verage U .S. rate for opioid prescriptions w as 70 per 100 persons in the same y ear (NIDA, 2018b). West Virginia Department of Health and Human R esources (DHHR) count y-level Neonatal Abstinence S yndrome (NA S)* data for 2017 shows the o verall incidence r ate of NA S was 50.6 cases per 1,000 liv e births (5.06%) for W est Virginia residents (WVDHHR, 2018). * Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is a withdrawal syndrome that occurs after prenatal exposure to drugs is discontinued suddenly at birth. Drug Overdoses In 2016 alone, drug o verdoses killed more Americans than the entire Vietnam W ar and car cr ashes, gun violence, and HIV/AIDS ev er did in a single y ear. In total, more than 170 people are estimated to die from o verdoses ev ery da y in the US , and most of the deaths are link ed to opioids. Source: Lopez, 2017. What is the role of nurses in the problem of prescription drug div ersion, misuse, and abuse? Because nurses are the health professionals who treat the most patients, they are in a unique position to educate, identif y, and interv ene with patients and colleagues who are at risk for prescription drug misuse and abuse. R ecognizing the signs of misuse and risk factors of drug abuse and div ersion b y patients and fellow healthcare professionals is an important responsibilit y of nurses. Educated nurses can be instrumental in changing patterns of misuse and abuse of prescription drugs for individuals, colleagues, and communities, and thereb y reduce the public health epidemic. Glossary of Terms Aberrant drug-related behaviors: any medication-related beha viors that depart from strict adherence to the ph ysician-prescribed plan of care, r anging from mildly problematic behavior (such as hoarding medications) to illegal acts (such as selling medications). Addiction: a primary , chronic, neurobiologic disease whose dev elopment and manifestation is influenced b y genetic, psy chosocial, and en vironmental factors. Addiction behaviors often include impaired control o ver use, compulsiv e use, continued use despite resulting harm, and cr aving (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014). Lik e other chronic diseases, addiction often in volves cycles of relapse and remission. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition (DMS-5) does not use the term addiction for diagnosis (S AMHS A, 2018). Substance use disorder/abuse/nonmedical use: the use of an illicit drug or the intentional self -administr ation of a prescription (or o ver-the counter) medication for an y nonmedical purpose, such as altering one' s state of consciousness, eg, \"getting high. \" The DSM-5 no longer uses the terms substance abuse and substance dependence . Substance use disorders occur when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disabilit y, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. A diagnosis of substance use disorder is based on evidence of impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and pharmacologic criteria.Chronic pain: any pain that lasts sev eral months (v ariously defined as 3 to 6 months), but may last for months or y ears. Whereas acute pain is a normal sensation that alerts the body to injury or damage, chronic pain persists. Chronic pain ma y result from an injury or an ongoing cause such as illness, or there ma y be no clear cause (NIH, 2018). Diversion: the intentional remo val of a medication from legitimate distribution and dispensing channels. Div ersion also in volves the sharing or purchasing of prescription medication between family members and friends or individual theft from family and friends (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014). Div ersion can also occur in healthcare settings if health professionals div ert medication from the intended recipient. Opioid use disorder (OUD): per the DSM-5, a disorder char acteriz ed by loss of control of opioid use, risky opioid use, impaired social functioning, toler ance, and withdr awal. Tolerance and withdr awal do not count tow ard the diagnosis in people experiencing these symptoms when using opioids under appropriate medical supervision. OUD co vers a r ange of sev erity and replaces what DSM- IV termed \"opioid abuse\" and \"opioid dependence. \" An OUD diagnosis is applicable to a person who uses opioids and experiences at least 2 of the 11 symptoms in a 12-month period (S AMHS A, 2018). Misuse: any ther apeutic use of a medication other than as directed or indicated, whether intentional or unintentional, and regardless of whether it results in harm. Increasing a medication dose without clinician appro val is misuse, whether the reason is dependence, tolerance, desire to achiev e greater ther apeutic effect, or forgetfulness (Corsini & Zacharoff , 2014). Physical dependence: a state in which the body has adapted to a drug or class of drugs to the degree that withdr awal syndrome occurs upon abrupt cessation, r apid dose reduction, decreasing blood lev el of the drug, and/or administr ation of an antagonist (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014). Loss of tolerance: when a person stops taking a drug or class of drugs after taking it for a long time, loss of toler ance occurs. Serious adv erse effects, including o verdose, can occur if the person tak es the previously toler ated dose of the drug (S AMHS A, 2018). Recovery: a process of change through which individuals impro ve their health and wellness, liv e a self -directed life, and striv e to reach their full potential. Ev en individuals with sev ere and chronic SUDs can, with help , overcome their SUDs and regain health and social function. Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of recovery lifest yle, it is not the only health y, prosocial feature. P atients taking FDA - appro ved medication to treat OUD can be considered in reco very (S AMHS A, 2018).Relapse: a process in which a person with OUD who has been in remission experiences a return of symptoms or loss of remission. A relapse is different from a return to opioid use in that it in volves more than a single incident of use. R elapses occur o ver a period of time and can be interrupted. R elapse need not be long lasting (S AMHS A, 2018). Remission: a medical term meaning a disappear ance of signs and symptoms of the disease. DSM-5 defines remission as present in people who previously met OUD criteria but no longer meet an y OUD criteria (with the possible ex ception of cr aving). R emission is an essential element of reco very (S AMHS A, 2018). Return to opioid use: one or more instances of opioid misuse without a return of symptoms of OUD . A return to opioid use ma y lead to relapse (S AMHS A, 2018). Tolerance: alteration of the body' s responsiv eness to alcohol or other drugs (including opioids) such that higher doses are required to produce the same effect achiev ed during initial use. T olerance dev elops when someone uses an opioid drug regularly , so that their body becomes accustomed to the drug and needs a larger or more frequent dose to continue to experience the same effect (S AMHS A, 2018). Controlled Substances Drug abuse is not a new problem. The United States Congress passed the first Controlled Substances Act in 1970, but addictiv e drugs were first outla wed in America in the early 1900s. The Controlled Substances Act has fiv e schedules, known as schedules I, II, III, IV , and V . Source: US DEA, 2 018a.Controlled Substances, 2018 DEA Schedule Medical use/abuse potential Examples of abused drugs Schedule I No accepted therapeutic use. Lack of safety even under medical supervision. High potential for abuse; abuse may lead to severe psychological or Accepted therapeutic use. Highly restricted. High potential for abuse; abuse may lead to severe psychological III Accepted therapeutic use. Highly restricted. Less high potential for abuse; abuse may lead to moderate or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence.Products containing not more than 90 milligrams of codeine per dosage unit as depo- testosterone Schedule IV Accepted therapeutic use. Low potential for abuse relative to Schedule I, II, and III drugs; abuse may lead to limited physical dependence (Halcion) Schedule V Accepted therapeutic use. Low potential for abuse relative to Schedule I, II, III, and IV drugs; abuse may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence.Cough preparations containing not more than 200 milligrams of codeine per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams (Robitussin AC, Ph energan with Codeine), an d ezogabine On August 22, 2014 the U .S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) formally rescheduled hydrocodone combination products (HCPs), mo ving them from Schedule III to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act. The Treatment of Pain Pain is part of the human condition; at some point, for short or long periods of time, we all experience pain and suffer its consequences. While pain can serv e as a warning to protect us from further harm, it also can contribute to sev ere and even relentless suffering, surpassing its underlying cause to become a disease in its own domains and dimensions. . . . Severe or chronic pain can o vertake our liv es, ha ving an impact on us as individuals as well as on our family , friends, and communit y. Through the ages, pain and suffering ha ve been the substr ates for great works of fiction, but the reality of the experience, especially when persistent, has little redeeming or romantic qualit y. The personal story of pain can be tr ansformativ e or can blunt the human v alues of jo y, happiness, and ev en human connectedness. Institute of Medicine, 2011 The National Institutes of Health, National Center for Complementary and Integr ative Health (NCCIH), reports the following statistics about chronic pain in the United States: About 25.3 million U .S. adults (11.2%) had pain ev ery da y for the previous 3 months. Nearly 40 million adults (17.6%) had sev ere pain. Individuals with sev ere pain had worse health, used more healthcare, and had more disabilit y than those with less sev ere pain. The annual economic cost of chronic pain in the United States, including both treatment and lost productivit y, has been estimated at nearly $635 billion. (NCCIH, 2018) When Pain Becomes Chronic Pain is a normal ph ysiologic sensation that signals injury or disease. It serv es a vital function, w arning of the need for medical treatment. The International Association for the Study of P ain defines pain asan unpleasant sensory experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. . . . P ain is alw ays subjectiv e. . . . It is unquestionably a sensation in a part or parts of the body , but it is also unpleasant and therefore also an emotional experience. (IA SP, 2012) The Institutes of Medicine define pain this w ay: Pain's occurrence, sev erity, duration, response to treatment, and disabling consequences v ary from person to person because pain, lik e other sev ere chronic conditions, is much more than a biological phenomenon and has profound emotional and cognitiv e effects. P ain can be mild and easily handled with o ver-the-counter medications; it can be acute and recede with treatment; it can be recurrent o ver months or y ears; or it can be chronic and debilitating, requiring almost constant attention and accommodation. (IOM, 2011) Chronic pain is pain that persists, often for weeks, months, or y ears. The presence of chronic pain is a disease state in itself . When the pain' s warning function is completed, continued pain is an abnormal state. Its distinct pathology causes changes in the nerv ous system that often worsen. Its effects on a patient 's psychology and cognitiv e abilit y are significant, and include anxiet y, depression, and anger . Effectiv e pain management is a mor al imper ative because the alleviation of suffering is the guiding star of medicine. Chronic pain prev ention and management often require a comprehensiv e, interdisciplinary approach due to its div erse effects and the combination of biologic, psy chological, and social factors. Chronic diseases, including chronic pain, in volve many physical, cognitiv e, and emotional factors, but chronic pain often lacks reliable \"objectiv e\" measures. Knowledge of pain prev ention and management is not alw ays applied effectiv ely; man y people suffer pain needlessly . Chronic pain can result from age, genetic predisposition, or as part of a separ ate chronic disease, surgery , or injury . Healthcare pro viders must understand \"pain is a uniquely individual, subjectiv e experience\" that depends upon man y factors such as gener al health, genetic char acteristics, previous pain experiences, the brain's processing system, the context, and cultur al and social background (IOM, 2011). Trends in Pain Management and PrescribingIn past decades, concern about undertreatment of pain despite the numerous pharmaceuticals dev eloped to treat it led to increases in prescribing of analgesics as part of a movement to treat pain, especially chronic pain, more aggressiv ely. In 1998 the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) released guidelines that supported the use of opioids for chronic, noncancer pain. In the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical communit y that patients would not become addicted to opioid pain reliev ers. This contributed to the increase in opioid prescriptions that followed. The Joint Commission, an accrediting body , then issued the Pain Standard , which ev aluated healthcare organizations (including hospitals, ambulatory care centers, beha vioral health, and home care) on the basis of their consistent, documented assessment of patients' pain (Zimmerman, 2017). The FSMB Model Policy on the Use of Opioid Analgesics in the Treatment of Chronic Pain has been revised twice since 1998, once in 2004 and again in July 2013. The model policy features the following k ey points: Many Americans suffer from chronic pain that is inadequately or ineffectiv ely treated. Since the 2004 revision, evidence for risk associated with opioids has surged, while evidence for benefits has remained contro versial and insufficient. Appro ximately one-fourth of all patients seen in primary care settings suffers from pain that interferes with their activities of daily living. While under -treatment of pain exists, nev ertheless chronic pain is often intr actable and burdensome and current medical knowledge and ther apies, including opioid analgesics, do not completely eliminate pain in most cases. Furthermore, intr actable pain is not alw ays evidence of undertreatment, and ma y in fact result from o ver-treatment in procedures and medication. (FSMB , 2013) Balance is the goal in treating patients' pain and prev enting drug div ersion. On January 1, 2018 The Joint Commission implemented a new and revised pain assessment and management standards. The new standards, which revise the original standards established in 2001, state that hospitals must: Establish a clinical leadership team Actively engage medical staff and hospital leadership in impro ving pain assessment and management, including str ategies to decrease opioid use and minimiz e risks associated with opioid use Provide at least one non-pharmacologic pain treatment modalit y Facilitate access to prescription drug monitoring progr amsImpro ve pain assessment b y concentr ating more on how pain is affecting patients' physical function Engage patients in treatment decisions about their pain management Address patient education and engagement, including stor age and disposal of opioids to prev ent these medications from being stolen or misused b y others Facilitate referr al of patients addicted to opioids to treatment progr ams. (Joint Commission, 2018) NCCIH is part of the National Institutes of Health P ain Consortium, which coordinates pain research across NIH. NCCIH-supported studies are helping to build an evidence base on the effectiv eness and safet y of complementary modalities for treating chronic pain. The scientific evidence suggests that some complementary health approaches ma y help people manage chronic pain (eg, of opioids being prescribed b y our nation' s doctors, dentists, and nurses is ex cessiv e. While opioids offer relief to man y patients with pain and should remain an a vailable and acceptable option for pain management when medically indicated, it is clear from prescribing data and related addiction treatment admission and o verdose death data that the medical communit y has over-relied on opioids to treat pain. Letter to Chris Christie, Chair President 's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis ASAM, 2017 Opioids are v ery effectiv e in the treatment of acute pain. The International Association for the Study of P ain issued a statement in F ebruary 2018: Opioids are indispensable for the treatment of sev ere short -lived pain during acute painful ev ents and at the end of life (eg, pain associated with cancer). Currently , no other or al medication offers immediate and effectiv e relief of sev ere pain. Although opioids can be highly addictiv e, opioid addiction r arely emerges when opioids are used for short -term treatment of pain, ex cept among a few highly susceptible individuals. For these reasons, IA SP supports the use and a vailabilit y of opioids at all ages for the relief of sev ere pain during short -lived painful ev ents and at the end of life. IA SP's 2010 Declaration of Montreal states that access to pain management is a fundamental human right. In some cases, there is no substitute for opioids in achieving satisfactory pain relief . (IASP, 2018)Widespread opioid analgesics for chronic pain is contro versial. Their increased use is in part due to the pharmaceutical industry' s widely mark eting opioids to physicians and offering incentiv es for prescribing. \"Between 1996 and 2002, Purdue Pharma funded more than 20,000 pain-related educational progr ams through direct sponsorship or financial gr ants and launched a multifaceted campaign to encour age long- term use of [opioid painkillers] for chronic non-cancer pain\" (Lopez, 2018). Purdue provided financial support to the American P ain Societ y, the American Academ y of P ain Medicine, the F ederation of State Medical Boards, The Joint Commission, pain patient groups, and other organizations. These groups adv ocated for more aggressiv e identification and treatment of pain, especially prescription opioids (Lopez, 2018). U.S. cities, counties, and states ha ve filed la wsuits against narcotics manufacturers, claiming that these pharmaceutical companies engaged in a \"campaign of deception\" to boost sales of prescription analgesics such as OxyContin and thereb y caused the national public health epidemic of prescription drug abuse. The la wsuits allege that the companies actively work ed to expand their mark et by engaging in a dishonest campaign to encour age doctors to prescribe opioids for pain relief b y hiring ph ysicians to giv e speeches and write papers to encour age more liber al prescribing pr actices (Glo ver & Girion, 2014). A similar suit against fiv e narcotics manufacturers w as filed in June 2014 b y the cit y of Chicago . The cit y sought damages and accused the drug companies of deceiving the public about the risks associated with the use of pain medications while o verstating their benefits. In Ma y 2018, six more states announced suits against Purdue Pharma, the creator of OxyContin, bringing the total number of la wsuits that ha ve been filed across the United States against opioid mak ers and distributers to hundreds. La wsuits allege that pharmaceutical mak ers claimed that concerns about the potential for opioid addiction were \"opiophopia\" and directly and aggressiv ely mark eted to doctors through videos, pamphlets, and other materials, to foster the idea that opioids were safe and effectiv e, persuading doctors to prescribe more of the drugs (Lopez, 2018). While some la wsuits ha ve been settled and some ex ecutiv es ha ve been con victed for their involvement in the opioid epidemic, opioid companies reject the argument that they ha ve carelessly fueled the current crisis (Lopez, 2018).Even with the increased a wareness of the opioid epidemic, prescribing remains high. In 2016 prescribers wrote 66.5 opioid and 25.2 sedativ e prescriptions for ev ery 100 Americans (CDC, 2017a). Data show that prescribing v aries widely from count y to count y. In 2015, 6 times more opioids per resident were dispensed in the highest -prescribing counties than in the lowest -prescribing counties. Count y-level char acteristics, such as rur al versus urban, income lev el, and demogr aphics, only explained about a third of the differences. This suggests that people receiv e different care depending on where they liv e (CDC, 2017c). Some char acteristics of counties with higher opioid prescribing: Small cities or large towns Higher percent of white residents More dentists and primary care ph ysicians More people who are uninsured or unemplo yed More people who ha ve diabetes, arthritis, or disabilit y (CDC, 2017c) In 2017 FSMB issued Guidelines for the Chronic Use of Opioid Analgesics . The guidelines may apply most directly to the treatment of chronic pain, howev er man y of the str ategies mentioned in the 2017 guidelines are also relev ant to responsible prescribing and the mitigation of risks associated with other controlled substances in the treatment of pain. The diagnosis and treatment of pain is integr al to the pr actice of medicine. In order to implement best pr actices for responsible opioid prescribing, clinicians must understand the relevant pharmacologic and clinical issues in the use of opioid pain medications and should obtain sufficient targeted continuing education and tr aining on the safe prescribing of opioids and other analgesics as well as tr aining in multimodal treatments (FSMB , 2017). Prescription Drug Abuse and Misuse Because of changes in pain treatment, prescriptions of opioid analgesics ha ve increased dramatically from the 1990s. This has resulted in their greater a vailabilit y for nonmedical users (NIDA, 2018a). The U .S. culture of drug use, faith in pharmaceutical solutions, and desire for r apid relief from pain has contributed to the increase in opioid prescriptions. Alcohol use pla ys a role in drug abuse. Manufacturers of pharmaceuticals mark et directly to consumers in all t ypes of media. This, combined with information about medications that is widely a vailable on the Internet, leads to patients' asking doctors for drugs b y name.The increase of prescription opioids has exacted a sev ere toll. Unintentional o verdose deaths ha ve quadrupled since 1999. The CDC considers prescription drug abuse to be epidemic. According to the CDC, appro ximately 116 Americans died from opioid-related causes ev ery da y in 2016. The drugs in volved in o verdose deaths in the United States ha ve changed in recent y ears. The rate of drug o verdose deaths in volving amadol) doubled in a single y ear from 3.1 per 100,000 in 2015 to 6.2 in 2016. Ov erdose deaths in volving heroin increased from 4.1 per 100,000 in 2015 to 4.9 in 2016. Ov erdose deaths o xycodone) increased from 3.9 per 100,000 in 2015 to 4.4 in 2016 (Hedegaard et al. , 2017). In response to this crisis, the feder al government has tak en steps to inform more judicious opioid prescribing through the dev elopment of the CDC' s Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic P ain. Current data shows that the r ates of prescribing are decreasing. Between 2006 and 2016, the annual prescribing r ate per 100 persons decreased from 72.4 to 66.5 for all opioids, which is an o verall 8.1% reduction (CDC, 2017a). The State of W est Virginia is facing a significant drug abuse problem. In 2013 W est Virginia providers wrote 110 opioid prescriptions per 100 persons (2.08 million prescriptions). In the same y ear, the a verage U .S. rate w as 70 opioid prescriptions per 100 persons. In 2016 West Virginia had the highest rate of opioid-related overdose deaths in the nation (SAMHS A, 2017a). \"Other opiates accounted for the highest percentage of treatment admissions in W est Virginia in 2010 (34.9%), which w as 4 times higher than the national percentage (8.7%)\" (WVBHHF , 2013). The most prev alent drugs in volved in o verdose deaths in the state are fentan heroin, anawa, and Cabell counties accounted for 29% of the reported deaths from o xycodone from 2001to 2015 (WVBPH, 2017). In recent y ears the number of individuals using heroin has increased dr amatically; in W est Virginia in 2014-2015, an annual a verage of about 6,000 individuals aged 12 or older (0.36% of all individuals in this age group) had used heroin in the past y ear. In 2013 through 2015, heroin has become the second leading opioid contributing to o verdose deaths. There were 3.4 times more heroin reported deaths in 2011-2015 than in the previous 10 y ears (WVBPH, 2017). Societal and Economic Impacts of Drug AbuseDrug use affects not only the drug abuser but also the family unit and the communit y at large. Ov erdose and accidental death impacts family members and caregiv ers as well as our healthcare system. Drug abuse also impacts on-the-job performance and missed work. A study published in 2016 found the total economic burden of the opioid crisis in the United States is estimated to be $78.5 billion, using data from 2013. More than one-third of this amount is due to increased healthcare and substance abuse treatment costs ($28.9 billion) (Florence et al. , 2016). A U.S. Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) report estimates that in 2015 the economic cost of the national opioid crisis w as $504.0 billion, or 2.8% of GDP that y ear. This is more than 6 times larger than the most recently estimated economic cost of the epidemic (CEA, 2017). West Virginia Univ ersity's chief economist, John Deskins, said the opioid epidemic in W est Virginia has cost the state' s econom y nearly $1 billion. The estimate includes more than $322 million in productivit y loss due to fatalities, more than $316 million in productivit y lost in people who are not working at peak lev els because they are addicts, and more than $320 million in resources tied up in the opioid crisis that could be dev oted to solving other problems (WVUT oday, 2017). The 2018 National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) report on opioids in W est Virginia reveals some societal costs of drug abuse in the state. Other health consequences include increases in cases of hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV . In 2015 W est Virginia reported 6,347 cases of chronic HCV and 63 cases of acute HCV , or rates of 344.2 cases of chronic HCV per 100,000 population and 3.4 cases of acute HCV per 100,000. Among acute cases, nearly 40% were attributed to intr avenous drug use. Of the 39,513 new cases of HIV in 2015 in the United States, 74 occurred in W est Virginia (NIDA, 2018b). Analysis of the impact of W est Virginia o verdose fatalities in 2016 published in the West Virginia Medical Journal shows that the public health tr agedy affects families, communities, and state resources. The number of children in foster care has climbed b y 63%, the number of children requiring early interv ention services has risen 36%, and the number of autopsies has increased b y 53%. F ourteen percent of all W est Virginia infants are born substance-exposed (Gupta & Mullins, 2018). What Drugs Are Most Diverted or Abused? After marijuana, prescription drugs are the second-most abused category of drugs in the United States (S AMHS A, 2017b). The three classes of the most commonly abused prescription drugs are:Opioids that include o xycodone (P 2018a) One w ay to understand the scope of the problem of prescription drug misuse and abuse is to look at data on drug-related hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits. The 2017 Annual Surveillance Report of Drug-Related Risks and Outcomes reports an estimated 259,665 hospitalizations for nonfatal, unintentional drug poisoning occurred in 2014. Opioid poisoning accounted for 20.4% (53,000) of these hospitalizations. Heroin w as specified as the in volved opioid for 21.7% (11,475) of opioid hospitalizations estimated 418,313 ED visits for nonfatal, unintentional drug poisoning occurred in 2014. Opioids accounted for 22.1% (92,262) of these ED visits. Heroin w as specified as the involved opioid for 58.5% (53,930) of opioid ED visits. Cocaine accounted for 6,424 and methamphetamines for 11,012 visits (CDC, 2017a). Who Are the Drug Abusers? People of all ages, genders, and backgrounds use illicit or prescription drugs nonmedically . During 2015 an estimated 2,038,000 persons in the U .S. aged 12 y ears or older had a substance use disorder in volving prescription pain reliev ers, with an estimated r ate of 0.8 per 100 persons (CDC, 2017a). During 2015, nearly 48 million people in the United States aged 12 y ears or older used illicit drugs or misused prescription drugs in the past y ear, with an estimated r ate of 17.8 per 100 persons. Among males, the estimated r ate w as 20.5; among females, it was 15.3. By r ace and ethnicit y, the estimated r ates were 20.7 for non-Hispanic blacks, 17.9 for non-Hispanic whites, and 17.2 for Hispanics. (CDC, 2017a) During 201 an estimated 3.3 million people aged 12 or older were current misusers of prescription pain reliev ers. (S AMHS A, 2017b) In 2016 an estimated 239,000 adolescents aged 12 to 17 were current misusers of pain reliev ers, which corresponds to 1.0% of adolescents. An estimated 631,000 young adults aged 18 to 25 misused pain reliev ers in the past month, which represents 1.8% of y oung adults. F or comparison, in 2013 the r ate of past -year nonmedical pain reliev er use among y outh aged 12 to 17 w as 4.6. F or young adults ages 18 to 25, the r ate w as 8.8%. (S AMHS A, 2017b)In 2016, 11.5 million people aged 12 or older misused prescription pain reliev ers in the past y ear compared with 948,000 people who used heroin. The majorit y of prescription pain reliev er misusers had misused prescription pain reliev ers in the past year but had not used heroin (10.9 million). Appro ximately 641,000 people had misused prescription pain reliev ers and also used heroin in the past y ear. (SAMHS A, 2017b) Overall, more males than females misuse prescription drugs in all age groups ex cept adolescence (12-17 y ears); adolescent girls ex ceed bo ys in the nonmedical use of all prescription drugs, including pain reliev ers, sedativ es, and stimulants. Among nonmedical users of prescription drugs, females 12 to 17 y ears old are also more likely to meet substance use disorder criteria for prescription drugs. Additionally , while more men than women die of prescription opioid o verdose, the r ate of o verdose is increasing more sharply in women than in men. (NIDA, 2018a) How Drug Abusers Get Drugs Drug diversion is the intentional remo val of a prescription medication from the legitimate channels of distribution and dispensing. Div ersion also occurs when family or friends share or purchase prescription medication, or when medication is stolen from its intended recipient or is otherwise illegally acquired (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014). Div ersion can also occur in healthcare settings if health professionals div ert medication from the intended recipient for personal use or financial gain. Friends and Family Although we might assume that drug users acquire their prescription drugs from street dealers, this is not usually the case. Because prescription pain medications are fairly commonly prescribed, often nonmedical users merely ha ve to look in the medicine cabinet of a family member or friend. In 2015 among people aged 12 and older who had misused prescription pain reliev ers in the past 12 months, the following sources were reported for the most recent misuse: 40.5% reported they obtained drugs free of charge from a relativ e or friend. 36.4% reported they obtained drugs through a healthcare pro vider via prescription or by stealing. 34% reported they obtained drugs from one doctor . 9.4% reported they bought or stole drugs from a relativ e or friend. Only 1.7% reported getting drugs from more than 1 doctor . Only 4.9% reported buying drugs from a dealer or str anger .Strikingly , these data suggest that drug dealers are a relativ ely small source of illicitly used prescription opioids. Div ersion through family and friends is now the greatest source of illicit opioids (Dix on, 2018). Doctor Shopping Another source for prescription opioids is legitimate prescriptions obtained illicitly . Patients may request prescriptions from more than one ph ysician, and thereb y receiv e more than one prescription for pharmaceuticals. This is known as \"doctor shopping. \" The patient does not inform the ph ysicians of the multiple prescribers and fills multiple prescriptions for the same or similar medication at different pharmacies. A study b y McDonald and Carlson found that 1 out of ev ery 143 U .S. patients who receiv ed a prescription for an opioid pain medicine in 2008 obtained prescriptions from multiple prescribers, suggesting misuse or abuse of the drugs. The study identified a group of \"extreme\" patients who a veraged 10 prescribers through a 10-month period. When researchers look ed at those who had paid cash for their prescriptions, the a verage rose to 15 prescribers per patient. R esearchers concluded that impro vements in healthcare information technology should focus on prescription monitoring progr ams that allow physicians to pull up a patient 's prescription history . Doctor shoppers are exploiting the lack of good data management. McDonald sa ys, \"Ultimately , healthcare pro viders are the front-line defense against prescription drug div ersion\" (McDonald & Carlson, 2013). Recent data show , howev er, the majorit y of opioids are obtained b y prescription from one physician, not from \"doctor shopping\" (Dix on, 2018). Fraud Patients seeking to feed a habit of drug misuse or abuse ma y attempt to pass fr audulent prescriptions at the pharmacy . Fraudulent prescriptions come in the following forms: Fraudulent prescriptions written for a fictitious patient on a legitimate prescription pad stolen from a prescriber 's office Legitimate prescription that has been altered to obtain additional amounts of a drug Legitimate prescription pad with an altered call-back phone number to v erify the prescription Fraudulent prescription called in b y the drug abuser , who giv es his or her own call- back number Fraudulent prescription created b y a computer for a fictitious doctor or copied from a legitimate doctorIt is incumbent on pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to be cautious about filling prescriptions for controlled substances and to look for signs of fr aud or suspicious patient activit y (US DEA, n.d.). Healthcare Professio nals Drug div ersion isn' t only a problem in patients, howev er. Pharmacists, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals often ha ve access to prescription drugs, including opioid analgesics, and while these individuals usually ha ve greater knowledge than the public, they are still subject to the same propensities, temptations, genetic and medical histories, and ph ysical and mental health problems as patients. Prescribers ma y be in volved in drug div ersion b y providing drugs to patients engaging in the pr actices of fr aud or doctor shopping, who ma y be selling or sharing drugs. \"Recommended clinical pr actices include protecting access to prescription pads, adhering to strict refill policies, and thoroughly documenting when prescribing narcotics. Prescribers can also curb drug div ersion b y adhering to prescribing principles for opioids and other controlled substances\" (HS S CMS , 2014). Health professionals ma y also div ert drugs for their own use. Nurses and other healthcare professionals ha ve about the same prev alence of substance abuse and addiction as the gener al public. But, there are unique workplace factors that actually increase a nurse' s opportunit y and risk for addiction (NCSBN, 2014, 2011). The beha vior that results from this disease has far -reaching and negativ e effects, mot only on clinicians themselv es, but also upon the patients who depend on the nurse for safe, competent care. Substance use disorder can affect nurses regardless of age, occupation, economic circumstances, ethnic background, or gender . The earlier substance use disorder in a nurse is identified and treatment is started, the sooner patients are protected and the better the chances are of the nurse returning to work (NCSBN, 2014). The 2017 Annual Drug Div ersion Digest analyz ed publicly a vailable drug div ersion incidents involving healthcare work ers. The study analyz ed 365 div ersion incidents reported in online news stories; of the 365 incidents, 306 had data for the t ype of institution in volved. Most diversion incidents occurred at hospitals or medical centers (37.25%). Long-term care settings, which include assisted living, nursing home, rehab facilities, respite care, and hospice facilities, were in volved in 26.80% of incidents. Medical pr actices accounted for 16.67%, pharmacies had 13.73%, ambulance services had 2.61%, and other institutions (eg, school nurse and doctor 's offices and jail medical offices) had 2.94% (Protenus, 2018).The same study included data for the drug div erter's role in healthcare for 361 incidents. Nurses were the most common drug div erters, accounting for 41% of the div ersions. Doctors were the second most common drug div erters (20.32%), pharmacists (6.65%), and pharmacy technicians (5.26%). In 12.19% of div ersion cases, the role of the drug diverter in the healthcare organization w as unknown. Of the 365 incidents, 267 included information on the drug t ype; 91.76% of the incidents in volved opioids (Protenus, 2018). The lack of div ersion reporting b y healthcare facilities in America is nothing new . This has gone on for decades, and can negativ ely impact innocent patients while providing no effectiv e rehabilitation for the offender , putting them sadly closer to personal dev astation or ev en death due to their addiction. John Burk e, President International Health F acility Diversion Association (Protenus, 2018) Nurses must be tr ained to recogniz e substance misuse and abuse among fellow nurses because substance abuse on the job and untreated addiction disorder jeopardiz es patient safety. When nurses ha ve been giv en guidelines and a means of reporting suspected substance use, it can result in earlier detection of nurses with substance use disorders and their appropriate treatment. Without such guidelines, nurses are more lik ely to co ver up for colleagues. Gener al symptoms of substance use problems among nurses include the following: Defensiv eness Isolation Irritabilit y Difficult y following through on work assignments Signs and symptoms of a prescription drug substance use disorder among nurses can include the following: Coming to work on da ys off Volunteering for o vertime Incorrect narcotic counts Volunteering to administer medications Waiting to be alone to open a narcotics cabinet Lacking witnesses to v erify the w asting of unused medications Absences from the unit for extended periodsFrequent trips to the bathroom Arriving late or lea ving early Excessiv e number of mistak es including medication errors Negativ e impacts on patient safet y may result from an y of the following: Impaired judgment Slowed reaction time Diverting drugs from patients who need them Neglect of patients Nursing errors (NCSBN, 2014, 2011) Nurses whose substance abuse problems are detected early and treated ha ve a higher likelihood of successful treatment outcomes (NCSBN, 2014, 2011). Nurse managers and colleagues should also w atch for subtle changes in appear ance o ver time and [for] beha vioral changes, such as wearing long sleev es in w arm weather , increasing isolation from colleagues, inappropriate v erbal or emotional response, or diminished alertness, confusion, or memory lapses (NCSBN, 2014). Many nurses with substance use disorder are unidentified, unreported, untreated, and ma y continue to pr actice where their impairment ma y endanger the liv es of their patients. NCSBN, 2014 Addiction and substance abuse ha ve been called an occupational hazard for all health professionals. In addition to gener al risk factors that all members of the population are subject to (eg, depression, anxiet y, stress, low self -esteem, use of other substances, early age of first misuse, alcohol and drug use b y peers, family use, genetic predisposition to alcohol or drug dependence), nurses face specific risk factors in their workplace environments: Role str ain, including burnout, work o verload, feeling of insignificance, and inadequate support at work Problems of daily living, such as loss of a significant other , poor coping skills, insecurit y, and isolation Enabling b y peers and managers, such as o verlooking symptoms out of lo yalty and fear of job lossAttitudes tow ard drugs and drug use; eg, that substance use is an acceptable means of coping with life Faith in drugs for promoting healing due to witnessing positiv e effects of drugs on patients Sense of entitlement, that the nurse must continue to work, leading to r ationalization Special status of nurses as in vulner able to illnesses of patients Professional tr aining about drugs leading to self -diagnosis and self -medication for pain or stress/fatigue from workplace demands Lack of education regarding substance use disorder , including lack of understanding about the addiction process and how to recogniz e signs and symptoms of abuse Lack of controls and securit y of controlled substances and their ready a vailabilit y Physician prescribing pr actices, such as obtaining prescriptions from ph ysician friends without proper assessment and diagnosis protocols Of these risk factors, the top four are access to drugs, attitude, stress, and lack of education about addiction The National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) had made the NCSBN courses \"Understanding Substance Use Disorder in Nursing\" and \"Nurse Manager Guidelines for Substance Use Disorder \" free of charge for all nurses and nursing students (https://www .ncsbn.org/) (NCSBN, 2014, 2011). A Closer Look at Addiction Health Risks of Opioids Health effects related to opioid misuse and abuse include pain relief , drowsiness, nausea, constipation, and euphoria. An acute effect, when tak en in w ays other than prescribed, is life-threatening respir atory depression leading to coma and death. Long-term effects include drug toler ance and addiction. In combination with alcohol, opioid use can cause life-threatening slowing of the heart r ate and respir ation with potential coma and/or death. Certain populations ha ve additional health risks. Y outh often think that prescription drugs are safer to use than illegal drugs because they are prescribed b y a ph ysician and manufactured b y legitimate pharmaceutical companies. Pregnant women who use opioids nonmedically can ha ve spontaneous abortions and low -birth- weight babies. Older adults are at greater risk for sev ere health consequences due to accidental misuse or abuse of opioids because of age-related changes in metabolism, alcohol use, or drug inter actions with multiple prescriptions (NIDA, 2018c). Addiction and accidental o verdose occurs in all populations.Addiction is a primary , chronic, neurobiologic disease, with genetic, psy chosocial, and environmental factors influencing its dev elopment and manifestations. It is often characteriz ed by beha viors that include one or more of the following: Impaired control o ver use Compulsiv e use Continued use despite harm Craving Addiction medicine is a specialt y field in the mechanism and treatment of addiction. The American Societ y of Addiction Medicine' s definition of addiction: Addiction is a primary , chronic disease of br ain rew ard, motiv ation, memory , and related circuitry . Dysfunction in these circuits leads to char acteristic biological, psychological, social and spiritual manifestations. This is reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing rew ard and/or relief b y substance use and other beha viors. Addiction is char acteriz ed by inabilit y to consistently abstain, impairment in beha vioral control, cr aving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one's beha viors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Lik e other chronic diseases, addiction often in volves cycles of relapse and remission. Without treatment or engagement in reco very activities, addiction is progressiv e and can result in disabilit y or premature death. (A SAM, 2015) How Addicting Are Opioids? Opioids are a class of drugs that broadly includes heroin, h ydrocodone, o xycodone, and other morphine-deriv ed drugs. Br ain abnormalities can result from chronic use of such drugs and they cause dependence (the need to k eep taking drugs to a void withdr awal syndrome) and addiction . Dependence can resolv e after deto xification. Addiction, howev er, has complex and long-lasting effects, in volving cr aving that can lead to relapse long after the patient 's dependence resolv es (NIDA, 2018d, 2016). The opiate tr avels through the bloodstream to the br ain, where chemicals attach to proteins called mu opioid receptors on the surfaces of opiate-sensitiv e neurons. When the chemicals link with the receptors, a biochemical process of the release of dopamine into the nucleus accumbens rew ards the individual with feelings of pleasure, in the same manner as when they experience sex and food. Although the opioid ma y be prescribed to reliev e pain, the pleasure rew ard process is activ ated, building motiv ation for repeated use of the drug for pleasure.The br ain creates lasting associations of the feelings of pleasure with the circumstances and en vironment in which they occur , further cementing the motiv ation to continue taking the opioid, despite the risks and obstacles. Although taking drugs for pleasure is the first stage of drug abuse, the beha vior becomes compulsiv e, which leads to toler ance and dependence. R epeated doses of opioids alter the brain. It begins to function normally when the drugs are present and abnormally when they are not. Higher dosages are needed to achiev e the surge of dopamine for the same pleasur able effect; this is known as tolerance . The br ain's opioid receptors gr adually become less responsiv e to the opioid. The dopamine rush has a diminished impact on the reward circuit, which means the drug user experiences a reduced abilit y to enjo y not only the drug but also other pleasur able life experiences. This user might tak e more of the drug, trying to achiev e the same dopamine high. Drug dependence is the condition of being so accustomed to the drug that withdr awal symptoms occur if the drug is not used. Another br ain change in the locus ceruleus from use of opioids results in withdr awal symptoms of jitters, anxiet y, muscle cr amps, and diarrhea because ex cessiv e levels of nor adrenaline are produced. Dependence leads to daily drug use to a void unpleasant symptoms of withdr awal (NIDA, 2018d, include: Anxiet y Irritabilit y Craving for the drug Rapid breathing Yawning Runny nose Salivation Gooseflesh Nasal stuffiness Muscle aches Vomiting Abdominal cr amping Diarrhea Sweating ConfusionEnlarged pupils Tremors Loss of appetite (W ebMD , 2017) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (2018d), long-term use also causes changes in other br ain chemical systems and circuits, affecting functions that include: Learning Judgment Decision-making Stress Memory Behavior It is important to understand the opioid dependence and addiction are chronic medical disorders. Although initially people ma y voluntarily tak e a drug to treat pain or to feel pleasure, the br ain changes that result from opioid use can create a ph ysiologic and psychological need that is difficult to resist (NIDA, 2016, 2018d). Best Practices in Pain Management and Addiction The W est Virginia Board of Medicine expects that ph ysicians to incorpor ate safeguards into their pr actices to minimiz e the potential for the abuse and div ersion of controlled substances (WVBM, 2017). A comprehensiv e approach is necessary to achiev e safe pain management and optimal patient functioning (ph ysical, psy chosocial, social, and work - related) while guarding against misuse, abuse, addiction, and o verdose. It is not enough merely to diagnose and treat patients' pain. It is incumbent on clinicians to understand the treatment of pain, alternativ es to opioids, and medical indications for using opioids in the treatment of chronic pain, including the drugs' gener al char acteristics, toxicities, and inter actions. Medical pro vider tr aining and education on prescription drug abuse is pro vided b y the W est Virginia Department of Health and Human Services Bureau for Beha vioral Health and Health F acilities. Of use to all healthcare pro viders is the Opioid Overdose Prevention Toolkit. It aims to educate healthcare pro viders, patients, and family members about the risks of opioid analgesic misuse, abuse, and o verdose, how to identif y overdose, how to treat it, how to appropriately prescribe and monitor the use of opioids (S AMHS A, 2016a).In brief , the best pr actices appro ved by the W est Virginia Board of Medicine and S AMHS A include the following: Evaluation Treatment plan Informed consent Agreement for treatment Periodic review Consultation Medical records Compliance with controlled substance la ws and regulations These best pr actice recommendations are echoed in publications b y the F ederation of State Medical Boards (2017) and the American Societ y of Addiction Medicine. New legislation in West Virginia, SB 273, the Opioid R eduction Act, codifies prescribing opioid pr actices. Prior to prescribing opioids, clinicians must first prescribe treatment alternativ es such as physical ther apy. A prescribed opioid must not ex ceed a 7-da y supply at the lowest effectiv e dose, and the pro vider must explain the associated risks. The pro vider must document the patient 's medical history , conduct and document a physical examination, dev elop a treatment plan and access relev ant prescription monitoring information under the Controlled Substance Monitoring Progr am Database. Subsequent prescriptions ma y only be issued at least 6 da ys following the initial prescription and the pro vider must document that it is necessary and appropriate for the patient 's treatment. A third prescription for ongoing treatment requires consider ation of referr al to a pain clinic or specialist. For supplies greater than 7 da ys, a patient must sign a narcotics contr act with the prescribing pro vider agreeing to get medication only from that doctor , use the same pharmacy each time, and notif y the pro vider of an y emergency where the patient has been prescribed a controlled substance. Adults receiving an initial opioid prescription in an emergency department or urgent care facilit y are limited to a 4-da y supply of opioid pain medicine. Minors are limited to a 3-da y supply (WV DHHR, 2018). A Clinica l Approach to Mitigate Abuse Patient Evaluation and Health HistoryTo adequately address pain and best outcomes, a ph ysician must complete a thorough patient ev aluation before an y treatment plan can be made or medications prescribed. Such an ev aluation must include a complete medical history and a ph ysical examination. The physician should mak e a thorough examination of the patient 's medical record, nature and intensit y of the pain, current and past treatments for pain, underlying or co-existing diseases or conditions, the effect of the pain on the patient 's physical and psy chological functioning, and history of substance abuse. One or more recogniz ed indications for the use of a controlled substance should be present in the medical record to justif y prescribing (WVBM, 2017). The use of opioid analgesics for other than legitimate medical purposes poses a significant health risk to individual patients and to societ y. Inappropriate prescribing can lead to drug diversion and abuse b y individuals seeking to use opioids nonmedically . It falls to physicians, nurses, and other health professionals to use systematic precautions to minimiz e the possibilit y for abuse and div ersion controlled substances (WVBM, 2017). Prescribers of opioid pain reliev ers must balance the benefits of these drugs to treat chronic pain against the risks of serious adv erse outcomes including addiction, unintentional o verdose, and death. Health professionals ha ve an obligation to ensure that these medications are used safely and effectiv ely by their patients to control pain, and to mitigate risks. The patient ev aluation should include most of the following elements: Medical history and ph ysical examination targeted to the pain condition Nature and intensit y of the pain Current and past treatments, including interv entional treatments, with response to each treatment Underlying or co-existing diseases or conditions, including those that could complicate treatment (ie, obesit y, renal disease, sleep apnea, COPD) Effect of pain on ph ysical and psychological functioning Personal and family history of substance use disorder History of psy chiatric disorders (bipolar , ADD/ADHD , sociopathic, borderline, major depressiv e disorder) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PT SD) Medical indication(s) for use of opioids Review of the PDMP results Obtain consultation with other clinicians when applicableUrine, blood or other t ypes of biological samples and diagnostic mark ers (WVBM, 2017) Clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids in women of childbearing age, as chronic opioid ther apy during pregnancy increases risk of harm to the newborn. Further , opioids should be administered with caution in breastfeeding women, as some opioids ma y be transferred to the bab y in breast milk. When chronic opioid ther apy is used for an elderly patient, clinicians should carefully consider the initial dose, titr ating slowly upw ards if necessary , using a longer dosing interv al, and monitoring more frequently . Patients at risk for sleep disordered breathing are at increased risk for harm with the use of chronic opioid ther apy. Clinicians should consider the use of a screening tool for obstructiv e sleep apnea and refer patients for proper ev aluation and treatment when indicated (WVBM, 2017). Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) The FDA requires that extended-release or al forms of pain medications containing hydromorphone, morphine, xycodone, systems; and methadone tablets or liquid that are indicated for use as pain medicines are subject to a risk management progr am to ensure that the benefits of a drug for a patient outweigh its risks. REMS in volves: Knowing how to assess patients for treatment with opioid analgesics. Knowing how to initiate ther apy, modif y dose, and discontinue use of opioid analgesics. Knowing how to manage ongoing opioid therapy. Knowing how to educate patients and caregiv ers about the safe use of opioids analgesics, including proper storage, protection from theft, and disposal. Knowing gener al and product -specific drug information. (FDA, 2014) All opioids are powerful medications; howev er, extended-release analgesics contain more opioid than immediate-release formulations, which carries a high potential for accidental o verdose, life-threatening respir atory depression, abuse b y patient or people known to the patient, misuse and addiction, ph ysical dependence and toler ance, interactions with other medications, risk of neonatal opioid withdr awal syndrome with prolonged use during pregnancy , and inadv ertent exposure/ingestion b y household contacts, especially children (FDA, 2014).Risk Factors of Opioid Abuse Research shows the following categories of risk factors for opioid abuse and addiction: Genetic predisposition Certain br ain char acteristics that can mak e someone more vulner able to addictiv e substances than the a verage person Psychological factors (eg, stress, personalit y trait lik e high impulsivit y or sensation seeking, depression, anxiet y, eating disorders, personalit y, other psy chiatric disorders) Environmental influences (eg, exposure to ph ysical, sexual, or emotional abuse or trauma, substance use or addiction in the family or among peers, access to an addictiv e substance; exposure to popular culture references that encour age substance use) Starting alcohol, nicotine, or other drug use at an early age (CA SA, 2017) One factor that is strongly predictiv e of opioid abuse, misuse, or other aberr ant drug- related beha vior is a personal or family history of alcohol or drug abuse. Although family history of substance abuse and psy chiatric disorders are relev ant to the appropriateness of opioid pain medications, prescribers should recogniz e that \"a history of substance abuse does not prohibit treatment with extended release opioid analgesics but ma y require additional monitoring and expert consultation\" (FDA, 2014). Pain Assessment Tools When treating chronic pain, healthcare pro viders must assess the nature and lev el of patient pain. Common assessment tools include a numeric pain r ating scale (0-10), the PEG 3-question scale, the W ong-Bak er FACES P ain Rating Scale, and the 20-question P ain Qualit y Assessment Scale (PQA S). Other useful tools help clinicians ev aluate patient risk for adv erse effects when considering prescribing opioid analgesics. These tools allow healthcare pro viders to ask useful, clinically relev ant questions in order to gain a full understanding of the patient before prescribing a potent drug. Here are brief summaries of some assessment tools that healthcare pro viders can use before initiating opioid ther apy: National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Quick Screen : This is a free online tool that helps primary care pro viders screen patients for drug use in gener al medical settings. The tool asks a pre-screening question regarding alcohol, tobacco , non- medical prescription drug, and illegal drug use.Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients in Pain (SOAPP-R): This is a brief tool to facilitate assessment and planning for patients being considered for long-term opioid treatment for chronic pain. Before initiating opioid pain analgesics, pro viders can distinguish between high-risk and low -risk patients. Diagnosis, Intractability, Risk, Efficacy (DIRE): This primary care tool assesses the risk of opioid abuse and whether patients are suitable candidates for long-term opioid ther apy. Opioid Risk Tool (ORT): This tool assesses the risk that patients will dev elop aberr ant drug beha viors when using opioid chronic pain. SAMHS A's Opioid Overdose Prevention Toolkit recommends that a thorough patient assessment and health history include specific questions. F or example: \"In the past 6 months, ha ve you tak en any medications to help y ou calm down, k eep from getting nerv ous or upset, raise y our spirits, mak e you feel better , and the lik e?\" \"Have you been taking an y medications to help y ou sleep? Ha ve you been using alcohol for this purpose?\" \"Have you ev er tak en a medication to help y ou with a drug or alcohol problem?\" \"Have you ev er tak en a medication for a nervous stomach?\" \"Have you tak en a medication to giv e you more energy or to cut down on y our appetite? \"Have you ev er been treated for a possible or suspected opioid o verdose?\" Further , a patient history should include questions about the patient 's use of alcohol, tobacco , and o ver-the-counter medicines. Useful screening tools include NIAAA, A UDIT, USPSTF , and A SSIST. Caution must be observ ed because man y OTC medications and alcohol can depress the centr al nerv ous system and must not be used in combination with prescription opioid analgesics (S AMHS A, 2016a). Physical Examination During a ph ysical examination, pro viders and nurses should also be on the look out for the following signs in patients being seen for chronic pain: Needle marks in neck, hands, feet, and antecubital fossae Signs of opioid into xication, including pinpoint pupils, nodding off, slurred speech, respir atory coma Signs including goose bumps, sweating, diarrhea, sniffles, dilated pupils, lacrimation, muscle tenderness, increased bowel sounds, shiv ering, nausea, emesis, restlessness, and h liv er disease, including jaundice, enlarged liv er and spleen, \"stigmata\" of chronic liv er disease, and ascites (Dix on, 2018) Review of medical records. When considering prescribing opioid analgesics for a new patient, clinicians should carefully review the patient 's medical records. Consulting with the patient 's previous ph ysician could rev eal important information. Treatment Plans with Functional Goals After a thorough examination, a clinician must dev elop a written treatment plan. The plan must include goals that can be used to measure treatment success. Goals might include pain relief and impro ved ph ysical and psy chosocial function. The treatment plan should also indicate other diagnostic ev aluations or treatments. Treatment plans should incorpor nonpharmacologic pain management ex ercise, manipulativ e Opioid Prescribing ocate a cautious approach to pain management. They believ e that the increased prescribing of opioid analgesics for chronic noncancer pain lacks high-qualit y evidence to justif y the therapeutic change and that, while opioids ma y provide short -term pain relief , the long- term benefits of opioid ther apy have not been established. They adv ocate that low doses should be considered only for carefully ev aluated, closely monitored patients when a structured approach is emplo yed and clear benefits for pain and function are documented. To better educate prescribers about the risks v ersus benefits of opioids for chronic pain, they ha ve published the Cautious, Evidence-Based Opioid Prescribing , containing do' s and don'ts for acute and chronic pain management (PROP , 2014). Cautious, Evidence-Based Opioid Prescribing for Chronic Pain Do's Do screen patients for depression and other psy chiatric disorders before initiating COT (chronic opioid ther apy) Do talk with patients about ther apeutic goals, opioid risks, realistic benefits, and prescribing ground rules. Do realiz e that patients are reluctant to disclose a history of substance abuse. Do perform a thorough medical ev aluation and a urine drug screen before initiating COT. Do explain to patients that discontinuing opioids ma y be difficult. Do perform r andom urine drug screens on patients receiving CO T. Don'ts Don't initiate chronic opioid ther apy (CO T) before considering safer alternativ es. Don't continue with CO T with patients who show no progress tow ard treatment goals. Don't assume patients know how to use opioids safely . Don't assume patients use opioids as y ou intend. Don't start a treatment that y ou are not prepared to stop . Don't assume patients are doing well with CO T without careful ev aluation. Don't abandon patients with a prescription drug problem. (PROP , 2014) Informed Consent and Prescribing Agreements As part of an y treatment plan, pro viders must educate patients on the prescription opioid, its safe use (including dosage, frequency of use, expected ther apeutic effects, risks, and side effects); its potential inter actions with other drugs and alcohol; its proper stor age according to manufacturer instructions; and the proper disposal of the medication. As we have mentioned, div ersion of opioids b y family members, caregiv ers, or visitors can be a serious problem with serious consequences for the patient, who should be using the drug as directed, and for the nonmedical user , who ma y be risking injury or accidental death b y illegally using a drug not prescribed.It is imper ative that patients receiv e education so that they ma y give informed consent to the treatment plan recommended b y the ph ysician. What Is Informed Consent? Informed consent involves informing the patient about the risks and benefits of the proposed ther apy and the legal obligations such ther apy imposes on both ph ysician and patient. Informed consent serv es multiple purposes: (1) it pro vides the patient with information about the risks and benefits of opioid ther apy; (2) it fosters adherence to the treatment plan; (3) it limits potential for inadv ertent drug misuse; and (4) it impro ves the efficacy of the treatment progr am. (S AMHS A, 2016a) Health pro viders ha ve the responsibilit y of informing patients about opioid pain medications. The F ederation of State Medical Boards specifies that informed consent documents t ypically address the following points: The limited evidence as to the benefit of opioids or other pharmaceutical ther apies in the management of chronic pain (ex cept for cancer) The potential risks and anticipated benefits of chronic opioid ther apy Potential side effects (both short - and long-term) of the medication, such as constipation and cognitiv e impairment The lik elihood that toler ance to and physical dependence on the medication will develop The risk of drug inter actions and over-sedation The risk of impaired motor skills (affecting driving and other tasks) The risk of substance use disorder , overdose, and death The clinician' s prescribing policies and expectations, including the number and frequency of prescription refills, as well as the clinician' s policy on early refills and replacement of lost or stolen medications Specific reasons for which drug ther apy may be changed or discontinued (including violation of the treatment agreement) or that treatment ma y be discontinued without agreement b y the patient Education of the patient that the complete elimination of pain is not to be expected (FSMB , 2017; WVBM, 2017)Patients need to understand that opioid pain medications work to reliev e pain b y binding to specific receptors in the br ain, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tr act. But stimulating the receptors, or rew ard centers, in the br ain can also affect other body systems, such as those responsible for regulating mood, breathing, and blood pressure. Signs of Overdose Opioids can cause pleasure, nausea, v omiting, allergic reaction, and ev en overdose, which can cause breathing and heartbeat to slow or stop . Opioids ma y significantly reduce pain, but they ma y not er adicate all pain. Life-threatening o verdose can occur when: A patient accidentally tak es an extr a dose or doses A patient accidentally tak es doses more frequently than prescribed A patient deliber ately tak es more medication than prescribed A patient tak es the medication in combination with other drugs or alcohol Any person who is not prescribed the medication tak es it Patients and their caregiv ers must be taught that an o verdose of opioid pain medication is an emergency . If an o verdose is suspected, immediately call 911. Signs of o verdose include: Slow or stopped breathing Slow or stopped heartbeat Limp body Extremely pale and/or clamm y face Blue or purple lips or fingernails Vomiting or emitting gurgling noises Cannot be a wakened Unable to speak Signs of Overmedication Overmedication is a condition that ma y progress to life-threatening o verdose. Signs of overmedication include: Slow or shallow breathing Slow heartbeatLow blood pressure Unusual sleepiness, nodding off Confusion Slurred speech Behavior resembling into xication Pupils pinpoint siz e Difficult y awakening from sleep Patient education must include the following points: Take medicine only if it has been prescribed b y a doctor . Do not tak e more medicine or tak e it more often than instructed. Call a doctor if pain gets worse. Never mix pain medicines with alcohol, sleeping pills, or an y illicit substance. Store medicine in a safe place where children and pets cannot reach it. Know the signs of o verdose and how to use nalo xone to k eep it from becoming fatal. Teach family and friends how to respond to an o verdose. Dispose of unused medication properly . (SAMHS A, 2016a) Patient-Prescriber Agreements The use of a patient -clinician agreement, or treatment agreement, helps to reinforce patient education. The FDA has con vened a working group to dev elop tools for patients and prescribers when considering opioid analgesics for the treatment of pain, including a model opioid patient-prescriber agreement (PPA) that is patient -focused to increase awareness of risks and benefits of opioid analgesics and serv e to emphasiz e the responsibilities of both patient and prescriber (FDA, 2014). Although the FDA 's Safe Use Initiativ e Opioid P atient -Prescriber Agreement is in progress, at the time of this writing it was not y et finaliz ed. SAMSHA 's Opioid Overdose Prevention Toolkit outlines what such an agreement should include. The agreement instructs the patient to stop taking all other pain medications, unless explicitly told to continue by the ph ysician. Such a statement reinforces the need to adhere to a single treatment regimen.The patient agrees to obtain the prescribed medication from only one ph ysician and, if possible, from one designated pharmacy . The patient agrees to tak e the medication only as prescribed (for some patients, it may be possible to offer latitude to adjust the dose as symptoms dictate). The agreement mak es it clear that the patient is responsible for safeguarding the written prescription and the supply of medications and arr anging refills during regular office hours. This responsibilit y includes planning ahead so as not to run out of medication during weekends or v acation. The agreement specifies the consequences for failing to adhere to the treatment plan, which ma y include: Signature of the ph ysician Name and quantit y of the drug prescribed Directions for use Refill information Effectiv e date if other than the date on which the prescription w as written (SAMHS A, 2016a) Periodic Review and Monitoring of Patients Any treatment for pain should periodically be reviewed and ev aluated b y the clinician. New information about the patient 's state of health, condition or cause of pain, psy chosocial and mental health, nature of pain is noted, and the patient 's overall health and lev el of function. The clinician should look at the patient 's dosage, the medication schedule (to determine if the patient is indeed taking the prescription as directed and whether the current treatment should be continued or modified). This decision depends on ev aluation of the progress tow ard the treatment objectiv es previously outlined in the plan of care. A t such a review , it is critical to reinforce correct medication usage. When possible, collater al information about the patient 's response to opioid ther apy may be obtained from family members or other close contacts, as well as review of the state PDMP . The patient ma y be seen more frequently while the treatment plan is being initiated and the opioid dose adjusted. As the patient is stabiliz ed in the treatment regimen, followup visits ma y be scheduled as indicated b y stabilit y and risk lev el. Monitoring plans for a giv en patient should tak e into account the gener ally increased risk for dependence developing a substance use disorder and misuse the longer the patient uses them.Continuation, modification, or termination of opioid ther apy for pain is contingent on the clinician' s evaluation of (1) evidence of the patient 's progress tow ard treatment objectiv es and (2) the absence of substantial risks or adv erse ev ents, such as signs of substance use disorder and/or div ersion. A satisfactory response to treatment would be indicated b y a reduced lev el of pain, increased lev el of function, and/or impro ved qualit y of life. Information from family members or other caregiv ers ma y be considered in ev aluating the patient 's response to treatment. Use of measurement tools to assess the patient 's level of pain, function, and qualit y of life ma y be helpful in documenting ther apeutic outcomes (WVBM, 2017). Monitoring Treatment Regular monitoring and ongoing assessment to determine if the treatment plan is on tr ack and the patient is achieving results is essential. Pro viders should incorpor ate the following practices in their patient monitoring: Clinicians should continue opioid ther apy only if there is clinically meaningful impro vement in pain and function that outweighs risks to patient safet y. Clinicians should prescribe the lowest effectiv e dosage. Clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage to 50 morphine milligr am equiv alents (MME)/da y, and should a void increasing dosage to 90 MME/da y or carefully justif y a decision to titr ate dosage to 90 MME/da y. Long-term opioid use often begins with treatment of acute pain. When opioids are used for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effectiv e dose of immediate-release opioids and should prescribe no greater quantit y than needed for the expected dur ation of pain sev ere enough to require opioids. Three da ys or less will often be sufficient; more than sev en da ys will r arely be needed. Clinicians should ev aluate benefits and harms with patients within 1 to 4 weeks of starting opioid ther apy for chronic pain or of dose escalation. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued ther apy with patients ev ery 3 months or more frequently . If benefits do not outweigh harms of continued opioid ther apy, clinicians should optimiz e other ther apies and work with patients to taper opioids to lower dosages or to taper and discontinue opioids. Clinicians should review the patient 's history of controlled substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring progr am (PDMP) data to determine whether patients are receiving opioid dosages or dangerous combinations that put them at high risk for o verdose. Clinicians should review PDMP data when starting opioidtherapy for chronic pain and periodically during opioid ther apy for chronic pain, ranging from ev ery prescription to every 3 months. When prescribing opioids for chronic pain, clinicians should use urine drug testing before starting opioid ther apy and consider urine drug testing at least annually to assess for prescribed medications as well as other controlled prescription drugs and illicit drugs. Clinicians should a void prescribing opioid pain medication and benz odiazepines concurrently whenev er possible. Clinicians should offer or arr ange evidence-based treatment (usually medication- assisted treatment with in combination with beha vioral ther patients with opioid use disorder . (CDC, 2017b) Identifying Diversion and Drug-Seeking Behaviors The purpose of risk assessment is to determine the lik elihood that a patient will dev elop or displa y aberr ant drug-related beha viors. Healthcare pro viders must be observ ant at all times for signs of nonadher ance to treatment plans and dosage instructions. Aberr ant drug-related beha viors include the following: Escalating the dose without a clinician' s order , especially r apidly escalating the dose. Psychoactiv e tolerance dev elops quickly , forcing a drug abuser to tak e more of the medication to achiev e the same effect, often in doses significantly higher than a therapeutic dose for pain. In contr ast, analgesic toler ance dev elops slowly . It would be expected that patients with stable pain would sta y on the same dose for months or years. Taking the drug in larger doses than prescribed and running out of medication early . Patients abusing opioids may aggressiv ely request refills earlier than expected or request additional doctor visits. Acquiring opioids from sources other than b y order of the clinician, such as an emergency department, acquiring additional doctors, or buy purchasing the drug on the street. Altering or acquiring prescriptions b y means of theft, fr aud, or purchase. Using the drug in an y method other than that which w as prescribed, such as b y snorting, injecting, or chewing oral medications for quick er effect. (CAMH, 2011) As is evident abo ve, not all aberr ant drug-related beha viors b y patients signif y addiction. They ma y instead signif y that the patient: Is experiencing increased painHas accidentally been misusing the medication b y taking more than intended Is dev eloping a ph ysical toler ance to the opioid analgesic, which is not as effectiv e as it once w as Is rationing doses to sa ve money , for example, or selling doses for income May have someone in his or her household or living situation who is stealing medication from the patient (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014) Clinicians need to look closely to determine the reason for the unexpected or aberr ant behaviors. Such beha viors are important clinical signs. It is important to consider all beha viors, and the multitude of reasons that patients ma y not tak e their medications as they are prescribed. Understanding the specific reason for each unexpected beha vior can help the clinician to tak e the correct next step , and mak e decisions that help minimiz e risk, impro ve safet y, and most of all benefit the patient (Corsini & Z acharoff , 2014). General Symptoms of Narcotic Abuse Healthcare professionals must be on the look out for the following signs and symptoms of opioid use disorder: Analgesia (feeling no pain) Sedation Euphoria (feeling high) Respiratory depression (shallow or slow breathing) Small pupils Nausea, v omiting Itching or flushed skin Constipation Slurred speech Confusion or poor judgment Tools for Monitoring Ongoing Opioid Therapy Prescribers ha ve a number of tools at their disposal to help with ongoing assessment of chronic pain patients who are receiving opioid analgesic ther apy. Here are a few of those tools.Addiction Behaviors Checklist (ABC) Developed b y Bruce D . Naliboff with support from V A Health Services R esearch and Development, this is a 20-item, y es/no assessment tool that can increase a pro vider's confidence in determinations of appropriate vs. inappropriate opioid use (W u et al. , 2006). Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) Developed b y Lynn W ebster , this questionnaire filled out b y the patient allows healthcare professionals to determine risk of addiction to prescription opioid medication (W ebster , n.d.). Pain Medication Questionnaire (PMQ) This is a 26-item self -report assessment tool for ongoing monitoring of aberr ant beha viors. It helps clinicians to identif y whether a long-term chronic pain patient is exhibiting aberr ant behaviors associated with opioid medication misuse (Dowling et al. , 2007). Prescription Drug Use Questionnaire (PDUQ) The PDUQ assesses problematic opioid misuse, abuse, and dependence in chronic pain patients. Evidence suggests the PDUQ' s key screening indicators are ex cellent predictors for the presence of addiction (Compton et al. , 2008). DAST Drug Abuse Scr eening Test A self -administered questionnaire consisting of 28 items with binary (y es/no) answers created b y Harv ey A. Skinner in 1982. Scores of 6 or more indicate the presence of substance dependence or abuse with satisfactory measures of reliabilit y and high lev els of validity, sensitivit y, and specificit y (Yudko et al. , 2007). A shorter 10-question DA ST (DA ST- 10) is also used. Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) A 17-item patient self -assessment that helps clinicians identif y whether a patient, currently on long-term opioid ther apy, may be exhibiting aberr ant beha viors associated with misuse of opioid medications. Since the COMM examines concurrent misuse, it is ideal for helping clinicians monitor patients' aberr ant medication-related beha viors o ver the course of treatment (Butler et al. , 2007). Urine ScreensPeriodic and unannounced drug testing (including chromatogr aphy) are useful in monitoring adherence to the treatment plan, as well as in detecting the use of non- prescribed drugs. Drug testing is an important monitoring tool because self -reporting of medication use is not alw ays reliable and beha vioral observ ations ma y detect some problems but not others. It is strongly recommended that patients being treated for addiction be tested as frequently as necessary to ensure ther apeutic adherence, but for patients being treated for pain, clinical judgment trumps recommendations for frequency of testing (WVBM, 2017; FSMB , 2017). Urine screening can indicate drug div ersion, misuse, or abuse, and the presence of an illegal drug might indicate addiction. An y nonprescribed opioid use ma y signal drug abuse or doctor shopping. Of course, pro viders using routine urine drug screening must remember that all diagnosis and treatment must be based on a careful assessment of the patient. UDS tools can deliv er false negativ es or false positiv es. Ideally , urine drug screening is part of the patient -prescriber agreement that is already in place. Clinicians should be a ware of the limitations of a vailable tests (such as their limited sensitivit y for man y opioids) and to order tests appropriately . For example, when a drug test is ordered, it is important to specif y that it include the opioid being prescribed. Test results that suggest opioid misuse should be discussed with the patient. It is helpful to approach such a discussion in a positiv e, supportiv e fashion, so as to strengthen the relationship between the patient and the clinician and encour age health y beha viors (as well as beha vioral change where that is needed). It is recommended that both the test results and subsequent discussion with the patient be documented in the medical record (WVBM, 2017). When Patient Care Is Ending Documentation Nurses ha ve an important role to pla y in k eeping medical records complete and accur ate. Patient medical records should remain current and be accessible for review , and should include the following: Copies of the signed informed consent and treatment agreement The patient 's medical history Results of the ph ysical examination and all labor atory tests Results of the risk assessment, including results of an y screening instruments usedA description of the treatments pro vided, including all medications prescribed or administered (including the date, t ype, dose, and quantit y) Instructions to the patient, including discussions of risks and benefits with the patient and an y significant others Results of ongoing monitoring of patient progress (or lack of progress) in terms of pain management and functional impro vement Notes on ev aluations b y and consultations with specialists Results of queries to the state PDMP Any other information used to support the initiation, continuation, revision, or termination of treatment and the steps tak en in response to any aberr ant medication use beha viors. These ma y include actual copies of , or references to , medical records of past hospitalizations or treatments by other pro viders Authorization for release of information to other treatment providers (FSMB , 2017) The medical record must include all prescription orders for opioid analgesics and other controlled substances, whether written or telephoned. In addition, written instructions for the use of all medications should be giv en to the patient and documented in the record. The name, telephone number , and address of the patient 's primary pharmacy should also be recorded to facilitate contact as needed. R ecords should be up to date and maintained in an accessible manner so as to be readily a vailable for review (FSMB , 2017). Referral to Pain Management Specialists Clinicians should be willing to refer patients to pain management specialists if they are uncertain about the pain diagnosis or the prescribing, monitoring, or discontinuing of opioid analgesics for patient pain. CDC guidelines recommend caution when prescribing 50 mg or more morphine equiv alents a da y and a voiding 90 mg or more (CDC, 2017b). R eferral of patients hitting these thresholds ma y be advisable because these thresholds indicate greater risk and ma y indicate a failure of opioids to achiev e functional goals. P atients who need a procedure or surgery ma y need a referr al to a pain specialist. Primary care and pain specialists should foster good communication. This encour ages collabor ation on what ma y be a challenging patient population. Collabor ation includes sharing medical records, jointly determining treatment plans, and care coordination (AAPM, 2016). Discontinuation of OpioidsIf the patient experiences a resolution of the underlying painful condition then opioid analgesics should be discontinued. Discontinuing opioid ther apy is also appropriate if there is a lack of ther apeutic effectiv eness or if risk increases. Also , if the patient reports continued sev ere pain despite a trial of sev eral different opioids, and experiences no functional impro vement, discontinuing the opioid ther apy by careful, safe tapering is indicated (FSMB , 2017). Another reason to taper is if the patient is experiencing unmanageable adv erse side effects, complications such as depressed mood, sleep apnea, sedation, or is displa ying aberr ant drug-related beha vior or signs of addiction, or fails to comply with the treatment agreement despite a reasonable dose. Clinicians must ex ercise the following precautions in tapering opioids: Tapering decisions must be made on an individual basis. Clear, written and v erbal instructions should be giv en to patients and their families to educate them about tapering and to minimiz e withdr awal symptoms. Be prepared to pro vide supportiv e counseling and frequent (weekly) follow -up visits. Ask about pain, withdr awal symptoms, and an y beneficial effects of the tapering, such as impro ved mood, energy lev el and alertness and decreased pain. Prepare a detailed tapering plan, including t ype of opioid, scheduled doses, and a frequent dispensing schedule. Switch to morphine if the patient is dependent on h ydromorphone or o xycodone. Use slow tapering for patients who ha ve cardio-respir atory conditions. Adjust dose up or down as necessary to reliev e withdr awal symptoms without inducing sedation. Refer patients with complicated withdr awal symptoms to a pain specialist or a medical center that specializ es in treating withdr awal. Refer patients with opioid addiction for substance abuse disorder treatment. Addiction is best managed b y opioid agonist treatment such ith State and Federal LawsTo prescribe, dispense, or administer controlled substances, the prescriber must be licensed in the State of W est Virginia and comply with all applicable state and feder al regulations. The Pr actitioner 's Manual of the U .S. Drug Enforcement Administr ation provides specific regulations go verning the medical use of controlled substances (DEA, 2006 [most recent]). Prescribers must register with and use the W est Virginia Controlled Substances Monitoring Progr am established in W est Virginia Code Chapter 60A, Article 9. Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) Clinicians should request a report of a patient 's medication history from the state' s PDMP before prescribing opioids. PDMPs tr ack controlled substances prescribed b y authoriz ed practitioners and dispensed b y pharmacies. PDMP progr ams emplo y electronic data transfer systems, under which prescription information is tr ansmitted from the dispensing pharmacy to a state agency , which collates and analyz es the information. PDMPs assist in patient care, pro vide early -warning signs of drug epidemics, and help to detecting drug diversion and insur ance fr aud. The Go vernment Accountabilit y Office (GAO) concluded that such progr ams ha ve the potential to help la w enforcement and regulatory agencies r apidly identif y and in vestigate activities that ma y involve illegal prescribing, dispensing, or consumption of controlled substances. PDMPs also can help to prev ent prescription drug misuse, o verdose, and diversion b y allowing clinicians to determine whether a patient is receiving prescriptions for controlled substances from other clinicians, as well as whether the patient has filled or refilled an order for an opioid the clinician has prescribed (FSMB , 2017). West Virginia' s Prescription Drug Monitoring Progr am, the Controlled Substance A utomated Prescription Progr am (CS APP), w as established in 1995 b y the State Board of Pharmacy for the monitoring of Schedule II -IV Controlled Substances. The goal of CS APP is to pro vide prescribers and dispensers with access to information that will help them mak e better prescribing decisions and positiv ely impact W est Virginia' s drug problem. Furthermore, CSAPP can help to identif y patients who ma y benefit from a substance abuse referr al (CSAPP, 2018). When Drug Diversion Is Suspected If a healthcare professional suspects that drug div ersion has occurred, he or she must document the suspicion and mak e a report to the following agencies: Local la w enforcement and local fr aud alert networks DEA (theft or loss of controlled substances) on the DEA Office of Div ersion Control website.https://www .deadiv ersion.usdoj.go or TTY 800 377 4950 or https://forms.oig.hhs.go v/hotlineoper ations/index.aspx Other resources for information and assistance (S AMHS A, 2016a) include: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services ation AMHS A) National Helpline: 800 662-HELP (4357) or TDD 800 487 4889 (for hearing impaired) Behavioral Health T reatment Locator: https://findtreatment.samhsa.go v to search b y address, cit y, or zip code Buprenorphine drug abuse necessitates the proper disposal of unused, unneeded, or expired medications. P atients must ha ve a secure and con venient w ay to dispose of controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Agency has strict regulations for drug tak e- back progr ams, including National Prescription Drug T ake Back Da ys. Healthcare pro viders should encour age patients to use such tak e-back disposal services when a vailable. If no tak e-back progr am is a vailable, patients should be w arned to tak e precautions that help prev ent en vironmental impact and drug div ersion, including mixing pharmaceuticals with undesir able substances such as coffee grounds or cat litter; sealing them in a bag, empty can, or other nonleaking container; and remo ving all personal information (name, phone number , prescription number) from product packaging and labels (FDA, 2018). The 14th National T ake Back Da y, which took place October 28, 2017, collected 912,305 pounds (456 tons) of prescription drugs nation wide. In W est Virginia 5,473 pounds of prescription drugs were collected (DEA, 2018b).DEA is committed to the citiz ens of W est Virginia. This [T ake Back] progr am allows citiz ens to empt y their medicine cabinets of un wanted or expired medications with no questions ask ed. DEA will then dispose of these medications in a safe manner . David Gourley , DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge U.S. Attorney' s Office, 2018 Treating Opioid Use Diso rder (OUD) Addiction is a chronic , treatable illness. T reating patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) requires continuing care r ather than an episodic, acute-care approach. P atients should have access to medical treatment, mental health services, addiction counseling, and other recovery support services. T reatment should be tailored to each patient 's needs and preferences (A SAM, 2015). In fact, there is no single best approach that works for all patients. A comprehensiv e approach to treatment is part of addressing the problem of drug diversion. R esearch shows that man y people in need of treatment for substance use disorder do not receiv e treatment: The 2016 National Surv ey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data indicate that 7.8%, or 21.0 million people, aged 12 or older needed substance use treatment in the past year (S AMHS A, 2017b). In 2016 an estimated 3.8 million people (1.4%) aged 12 or older who needed substance use treatment had receiv ed an y substance use treatment in the past y ear (SAMHS A, 2017b). In 2016, an estimated 2.2 million people aged 12 or older receiv ed substance use treatment at a specialt y facilit y in the past y ear. This number represents 10.6 percent of the 21.0 million people who needed treatment (S AMHS A, 2017b). Specialt y treatment refers to substance use treatment at a hospital (only as an inpatient), a drug or alcohol rehabilitation facilit y (as an inpatient or outpatient), or a mental health center . In a single-da y count in 2015, 10,099 individuals in W est Virginia were enrolled in substance use treatment \u2014a decrease from 10,711 individuals in 2011, but an increase from 9,596 individuals in 2012 and 10,057 individuals in 2013 (S AMHS A, 2017a). In a single-da y count in 2015, 3,120 individuals in W est Virginia were receiving methadone in opioid treatment progr ams as part of their substance use treatment \u2014a decrease from 4,699 individuals in 2011 (S AMHS A, 2017a).In a single-da y count in 2015, 2,072 individuals in W est Virginia were receiving buprenorphine as part of their substance use treatment \u2014an increase from 1,135 individuals in 2011 (S AMHS A, 2017a). The W orld Health Organization principles of good care for chronic illness can guide OUD care: Develop a treatment partnership with patients. Focus on patients' concerns and priorities. Support patients' self -management of illness. Use the fiv e A's at ev ery visit (assess, advise, agree, assist, arr ange). Organiz e proactiv e followup . Link patients to communit y resources/support. Work as a clinical team. Involve \"expert patients, \" peer educators, and support staff in the health facilit y. Ensure continuit y of care. (S AMHS A, 2016a) Medications The FDA has appro ved medications to treat OUD and impro ve patients' health and wellness. These medications are methadone, naltrex one, and buprenorphine. These medications can reduce or eliminate withdr awal symptoms (methadone, buprenorphine), blunt or block the effects of illicit opioids (methadone, naltrex one, buprenorphine), and reduce or eliminate to use opioids (methadone, naltrex one, and treatmentMedically supervised withdrawal, relapse to opioid dependence, following medically supervised withdrawalMedically Oral, intramuscular extended- respiratory depression, sedation, QT prolongation, sexual dysfunction, severe and syncope, misuse potential, neonatal abstinence syndromeNausea, anxiety precipitated opioid withdrawal, hepatotoxicity, vulnerability to opioid overdose, depression, suicidality, muscle cramps, dizziness or syncope, somnolence or sedation, anorexia, decreased appetite or other appetite disorders Intramuscular: Pain, swelling, induration (including some cases requiring surgical intervention)Constipation, nausea, precipitated opioid withdrawal, excessive sweating, insomnia, pain, peripheral edema, respiratory depression (particularly combined with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants), misuse potential neonatal abstinence syndrome Implant: Nerve damage during insertion/removal, accidental overdose or misuse if extruded, local migration or protrusion Subcutaneous: Injection site itching or pain, death from intravenous injection Regulations and availabilitySchedule II; only available at federally certified Opioid Treatment Programs and the acute inpatient hospital setting for OUD treatmentNot a scheduled medication; not included in OTP regulations; requires prescription; office-based treatment of specialty substance use treatment programs including OTPsSchedule III; requires waiver to prescribe outside of OTPs.

OUD medications reduce illicit opioid use, retain people in treatment, and reduce risk of opioid o verdose better than treatment with placebo or no medication. Medication can be taken on a short -term or long-term basis. P atients taking medication for OUD are considered to be in reco very. The science demonstr ating the effectiv eness of medication for OUD is strong. This doesn' t mean that remission and reco ver occur only through medication; some people achiev e remission without OUD medication. Medication for OUD should be successfully integr ated with outpatient and residential treatment. Patients treated with OUD medications can benefit from individualiz ed psy chosocial supports. Expanding access to FDA -appro ved medications is an important public health str ategy . Impro ving access is crucial to closing the wide gap between the need for treatment with OUD medications and the a vailabilit y of such treatment. (S AMHS A, 2018) People with OUD can benefit from medications for v arying lengths of time, including lifetime treatment. T reatment with OUD medication is link ed to better outcomes and retention than treatment without medications. Further , studies show that medication as part of treatment of OUD is cost effectiv e. The best results occur when a patient receiv es medication for as long as it pro vides a benefit. This is called maintenance treatment. OUD medications giv e patients time to mak e the life changes that are associated with long-term remission and reco very. Maintenance treatment minimiz es cravings and withdr awal symptoms. After time, patients ma y wish to stop opioid agonist ther apy for OUD through gr adually tapering doses of the medications. Outcomes depend on the length of their treatment, abstinence from illicit drugs, financial and social stabilit y, and motiv ation to discontinue the medication (S AMHS A, 2018). Healthcare pro viders need special tr aining and certification to prescribe medications to treat OUD . A patient taking FDA -appro ved medication for OUD can be considered to be in recovery. Clinicians should also be a ware that div ersion of medications for treating OUD do occur (A SAM, 2015; S AMHS A, 2018). Preventing Opioid nalo xone is administered in As a narcotic antagonist, naloxone displaces opiates from receptor in the br ain and rev erses respir atory depression that usually is the cause of o verdose deaths. Naloxone ma y cause dizziness, drowsiness, or fainting. These effects ma y be worse if it is taken with alcohol or certain medicines (S AMHS A, 2016a). In 2015 the FDA nalo also a pro vides v erbal instructions Increasing access to nalo xone is a priorit y for the U .S. Department of Health and Human Services, and research funded b y NIDA is dev eloping str ategies to identif y people at risk and ensure they ha ve access to nalo xone in the ev ent overdose deaths. Encour age pro viders, persons at high risk, family members, and others to learn how to prev ent and manage opioid overdose. Ensure access to treatment for individuals who are misusing or addicted to opioids or who ha ve other substance use disorders. Ensure ready access to nalo xone. Encour age the public to call 911. Encour age prescribers to use state Prescription Drug Monitoring Progr ams. (S AMHS A, 2016a) In the worst -case scenario put forth b y STAT's expert panel, that toll could spik e to 250 deaths a da y, if potent synthetic opioids lik e fentan yl and carfentanil continue to spread r apidly and the w aits for treatment continue to stretch weeks in hard-hit states lik e West Virginia and New Hampshire. If that prediction proves accur ate, the death toll o ver the next decade could top 650,000. Max Blau, 2017 Barriers to Treatment The primary problem with the opioid epidemic is simple: It is easier to get high than it is to get help. People who need substance use treatment sometimes do not ha ve access to treatment. Stigma surrounding substance use disorders remains high. A video series issued b y SAMHS A called \"Prev ention Con versations\" stresses the importance of breaking the stigma around drug use. SUD is a disease and not a mor al failing.SAMHS A suggests the following str ategies for reducing stigma: Do away with labels. A void stigmatizing labels such as \"addict, \" \"junkie, \" or \"drug user\" when referring to patients. Using the term \"clean\" for someone who is not currently using drugs implies that someone who is activ ely using is \"unclean\" or \"dirty.\" Use \"person first \" language. Using person first language, such as \"a person who uses drugs, \" demonstr ates that y ou aren't defining a person b y their drug use. Understand that drug use falls along a continuum. This continuum of substance use ranges from abstinence/low -risk use to chronic dependence and encompasses all stages in between. P eople may move back and forth along this continuum for a variety of reasons. Embr ace positiv e change. T reatment for substance use disorders has historically been viewed as binary , with addiction and abstinence as a person' s only two options. Beware of unintentional bias. P eople initiate and continue to use drugs for a v ariety of reasons. Without intending to , we ma y mak e value judgments about those reasons\u2014 deeming them \"good\" or \"bad,\" \"necessary\" or ev en considering people \"weak\" or \"strong\" based on their substance use beha viors. Reflect on y our own experiences. Man y of us have lived experience of substance misuse\u2014either our own or through a family member , loved one, co- worker, or neighbor . These experiences ma y be difficult, but they remind us that people who use drugs are first and foremost people\u2014 with strengths, passions, interests, and goals. Understand that substance misuse is often linked to tr auma. T rauma is a risk factor for almost all beha vioral health and substance use disorders. Understanding the relationship of tr auma to substance misuse and knowing how to engage with people who use drugs in w ays that prevent re-tr aumatization, will help y ou create a safe and supportiv e environment where ev eryone is encour aged to hear and be heard without judgment.
