UQ mythbusters Image: eldarnurkovic/Adobe Stock Image: eldarnurkovic/Adobe Stock From IV treatments to immunity bombs and ice baths, it seems our social media and newsfeeds are flooded with alternative treatments to boost our immune systems - often endorsed by celebrities and other influencers. But should we be placing our trust in these alternative treatments, and what impact are they actually having on our health? [Contact](https://alumni.uq.edu.au/contact-magazine) spoke to the [Frazer Institute](https://frazer.uq.edu.au/)'s Chair in Gabrielle Belz](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/25382), to learn more about alternative immunity-boosting treatments and to break down some common misunderstandings about how the immune system works. Image: Kaspars Grinvalds/Adobe Stock Image: Kaspars Grinvalds/Adobe Stock [IV treatments](https://harpersbazaar.com.au/what-do-iv-infusions-do/), the viral TikTok ['immunity bomb'](https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a42477638/immunity-boost-drinks/) recipe, [fermented foods and probiotics](https://www.india.com/health/heart-health-to-immunity-5-reasons-why-eating-fermented-food-is-the-new-health-trend-6077067/) and ice baths - have become popular, especially among social media influencers. Is there strong research evidence to support these popular alternative 'immunity boosters'? A: IV treatments refer to a multitude of components that could be [infused intravenously](https://stories.uq.edu.au/contact-magazine/2023/dont-listen-to-gwyneth-paltrow-ivs-are-not-a-shortcut-to-good-health/index.html), such as high doses of vitamin C. The major issue here is that there is very limited data or controlled studies, making claims very difficult to depend on. 'Fad' or 'booster' options may rely largely on placebo effects, unless individuals have specific deficiencies. The TikTok immunity bomb typically contains ingredients like turmeric, citrus fruits, and ginger, which are considered natural remedies and often have anti-inflammatory or anti-emetic value. While they do have value, as a mix there is insufficient evidence of their exact health benefits. Fermented foods and probiotics are known to contain beneficial bacteria that can positively influence gut health and restore good gut function, where this has become dysregulated. The notion that we could harness these attributes to use medicinally in specific ways is exciting. This is an active area of research, and it's important to determine the impact of different types of microbes so that we can understand which ones we should use - particularly in disease settings. Ice baths have been associated with anti-inflammatory responses but the direct impacts on the immune system have not been assessed. Impacts might primarily include positive psychological effects, but this remains unclear as there are few systematic studies to evaluate the outcomes. Image: sonyachny/Adobe Stock Image: sonyachny/Adobe Stock Q: What would you say are the most common misunderstandings about how the immune system works? A: The immune system delivers health without us having to think about it - a bit like breathing - and we only notice problems when it goes wrong. Here are some of the common misconceptions about the immune system I've heard. We can supercharge the immune system In a world of self-improvement, there is a notion now that we can simply 'supercharge' the immune system with high doses of vitamins or various extreme diets, without considering that balance is critical. Both too little and too much response are both highly detrimental. In general, the immune system works well when a healthy lifestyle is maintained. This includes nutrition, sleep and work, which all contribute to the workings of the immune system. Vitamin loading will not rectify poor, or too little, sleep. Immunity means someone is protected for life Vaccines are a good example of this. People often assume that once they have had an illness or a vaccine, they won't get infected or become ill from that pathogen again. Vaccination creates an 'armour' against infectious organisms, such as COVID-19. However, this needs to be 'topped up' from time to time as immunity can drop off over time if we haven't seen an organism for a while, due to the self-regulation of different immune cell types. Vaccines stop infection Vaccines boost the immune system and prepare it for pathogens we are likely to encounter, such as SARS-CoV2. However, vaccines don't usually prevent infection occurring. Instead, they rally the right types of cells to the body's surface so as to limit the replication of any bugs. This then reduces the severity of an infection, so it's often then very mild. Vaccine effectiveness can vary or be diminished, however, when new strains or mutations of pathogens (often referred to as variants) emerge. Vaccines help the body learn how to defend itself from disease without the dangers of a full-blown infection, and they can reduce transmission. Overly active immune responses are better It should also be noted that not all immune responses are helpful. Autoimmune responses can result from an overactive immune system. The immune system is quite complicated and the actions of all the cells are carefully balanced to ensure we are healthy. Excessive immune responses can often result from either overactive or misdirected immune responses, and result in various types of disease. In extreme circumstances, the immune system can attack the body's healthy cells or tissues. A balanced immune system is crucial. More is always better The immune system has a number of 'effector' responses. This refers to the weaponry that the immune system uses to eliminate harmful challenges, generating more 'killer' T cells and more antibodies. More does not always equate to a better response or outcome. The quality and specificity of a response is much more important in dictating that an 'appropriate' protective response is generated for immediate and long-term health. Image: Kaspars Grinvalds/Adobe Stock Image: Kaspars Grinvalds/Adobe Stock Q: What are the dangers of misinformation when it comes to immunity treatments? A: Misinformation commonly comes from the internet, via fake news stories or websites. We are in an era of 'crisis misinformation', which grew during the COVID-19 pandemic but had been developing over some years. False narratives have developed, and social media platforms have become inseparable elements of our lives. Fake news has repeatedly undermined efforts to protect people from the COVID-19 pandemic, and [studies have found that where people get their news can determine whether they believe misinformation](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/the-causes-and-consequences-of-covid-19-misperceptions-understanding-the-role-of-news-and-social-media/). For example, those who get their news predominantly from social media are more likely to believe COVID-19 falsehoods. The dangers of misinformation include using unproven treatments that could worsen a condition and a belief that we are protected from an illness when in fact we are not - which undermines trust in science and public health care, and leads to confusion among different demographics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a lot more discussion about the immune system, but not necessarily a lot more understanding. Negative responses to vaccines - particularly adverse events, which are incredibly rare - garner a lot of attention, distracting from the enormous global benefit of vaccines. It's estimated that vaccinations [prevented 14.4 million deaths from COVID-19 in 185](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309922003206?via%3Dihub) countries and territories between 8 December 2020 and 8 December 2021, and that about 20 million lives were saved between 2021 and 2022. A major issue with the COVID-19 pandemic has been the rapid spread of information - be that good or unsubstantiated. It's been difficult to keep up with the evolving knowledge and disseminate information appropriately, resulting in fear and uncertainty, and further fuelling false claims and misinformation about how the immune system works. It highlights the need for continued education, critical thinking, and communication with immunologists and other medical professionals.

A: Ensure you have had your vaccines. Wear masks in areas where you might be at risk of infection. If you're unwell, stay at home. Wash your hands regularly and maintain a balanced diet and lifestyle. It's also important to avoid smoking and second-hand smoke, as this can impair immune system function. Finally, minimise your attendance at settings that might expose you to infections, especially if you are a vulnerable member of the community. "}
