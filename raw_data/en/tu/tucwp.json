Email: jbilszta@unimelb.edu.au Abstract Objectives: This scoping review explores the extent to which undergraduate medical education have incorporated com- plementary and alternative medicine in their curricula and evaluates th e teaching, delivery and assessment approaches used. Methods: ERIC, Ovid Medline and Pubmed databases were searched with keywords related to \"complementary and al-ternative medicine\" and \"undergraduate medical education\" for relevant articles published un til August 2020. Data ex- traction included the presence/absence of complementary and alternative medicine integration, program duration, in-structor background, and assessment methods. Results: Of 1146 citations, 26 met the inclusion criteria. Complementary and alternative medicine teaching in under-graduate medical education was widely inconsistent and not well aligned with clearly identified aims and objectives. Var-ious complementary and alternative medicine disciplines were taught, demonstrated or observ ed, and several programs included teaching on evidence -based medicine. Educational outcomes mainly assessed student satisfaction and learning through self -evaluation and rarely assessed for effectiveness with regards to changing clinical practice or im- pacts on patient outcomes. Conclusions: Inconsistencies in complementary and alter- native medicine teaching and assessment in undergraduate medical education reflect the lack of defined graduate com-petencies. An evidence- based medicine component of an ed- ucati onal program is a potential solution to overcoming breadth and content challenges. Curriculum developers would be better guided with research that determines if com-plementary and alternative medicine program design, con-tent and assessment influence clinica l practice and/or patient outcomes. Keywords: Complementary and alternative medicine, undergraduate medical education, medical students, curric-ulum design, evidence -based medicine Introduction Medical educators encounter various challenges incorporat- ing complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) teach- ing into undergraduate medical education (UGME). The term CAM relates to the use of non -mainstream practi ces, either together with conventional medicine (complemen-tary), or in place of it (alternative). 1 Common complemen- tary health approaches include the broad descriptors of nat- ural products (herbs, vitamins, minerals, probiotics), and mind and body practices (yoga, chiropractic, osteopathic manipulation, meditation, acupuncture, breathing exer- cises). In addition to the enormous breadth of CAM, there exists a degree of uncertainty around the validity and efficacy of many widely used therapies. 2 Whereas convent ional western medicine defines 'best practice' based on empirical trials utilising large patient populations, many CAM thera- pies boast an individualised approach where the practitioner - patient interaction is therapeutic rather than the therapy it- self.2 This poses a considerable challenge for educators tasked with determining the necessary acquisition of CAM knowledge and skills in UGME. Despite a need to upskill medical students in CAM -re- lated knowledge and practice, there has not been an authori- tative consensus regarding the acquisition of CAM skills and knowledge in medical students at graduation or the optimal method to provide this education. This raises the question as to what evidence and scholarship can curriculum developers Int J Med Educ. 20 21;12:140- 149 141 draw upon to plan and implement CAM curricula for UGME students? A preliminary search of the literature, whilst fail- ing to identify any reviews which have systematically investi- gated CAM teaching in UGME curricula, did provide some insight into the challenges (and innovations) medical schools face in teaching and assessing student learning related to CAM practices. Stratton and Colleagues (2007) surveyed CAM educational programs funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). They found an arra y of curricula exist to provide health pro- fessions students with the necessary knowledge, attitudes, and skills to address CAM -related issues, and the approaches to evaluating curricular efforts were equally diverse; limiting the survey to only those that received NCCAM funding means it is difficult to generalise the findings. 3 The second at- tempted to systematically evaluate evidence of effective CAM educational interventions for both biomedical doctors and medical students. 4 This review only focused on des criptions of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomized controlled trials (non -RCTs), and before and after studies. Importantly, it did not specifically examine descriptions of integrating CAM materials in the broader context of UGME curricula, nor did it explore the variety of teaching, learning and assessment approaches UGME programs utilise. This latter issue is of particular interest as it is important to deter- mine if there is a correlation between changes in student's CAM -related attitudes, kno wledge, skills and the provision of patient care. We, therefore, conducted this scoping review of primary studies to evaluate the different approaches UGME programs have taken to incorporate CAM teaching into their curricula and identify directions for future research. The specific re- search questions we sought to answer were: 1. do UGME pro- grams teach students about CAM and, if so, which CAM dis-ciplines do UGME programs teach students? 2. what teaching and learning approaches do UGME use t o teach stu- dents about CAM? and; 3. how are UGME students assessed about their knowledge of CAM? In addition to these ques- tions, this review also evaluated the effectiveness of CAM teaching in the included studies, using the Kirkpatrick Hier- archy for Asses sing Educational Outcomes. 5-7 Methods This study adopted the \"Preferred Reporting Items for Sys- tematic reviews Search Strategy Electronic databases ERIC, Ovid Medline and PubMed were searched for full -text articles describing the delivery of CAM teaching in UGME (see Table 1). Addit ional papers were found through a hand search of the reference lists of articles identified through the online database search. Inclusion and E xclusion Criteria There was no limit on the publication date. Only full -text ar- ticles written in English were included. Articles were limited to those that looked exclusively at UGME, with medical stu-dents only. Articles exploring medical students' or facu lty members' attitudes regarding CAM were excluded. Articles that did not clearly describe the characteristics of CAM teaching within the UGME curricula (for example, topics taught in CAM programs, duration or frequency of teaching programs, methods used t o assess student learning, etc.) were also excluded, as were general articles about CAM in medical education, and proposals for CAM curricula without imple- mentation and opportunity for subsequent evaluation.

Data Extraction and C harting Data extraction was performed using a predetermined list, and included: Article details: first author and publication year Participant information: student cohort, institution, or country/city of institution Information gathering approach: questi onnaire, sur- vey, telephone interview Educational intervention: presence or absence of CAM integration, topics taught in CAM programs Duration or frequency: time spent delivering teach-ing within the program Instructors background: qualifications or title of edu-cators Outcome assessment: methods used to assess pro-gram aims, primarily students' qualitative and quan-titative course evaluation Educational outcome: assessed using Kirkpatrick's Hierarchy of Educational Outcomes, a well -recog- nised tool for the eval uation of the effectiveness of medical, educational outcomes.5-7 The bottom level Soliman & Bilszta CAM in undergraduate medical education 142 assesses learners' satisfaction with, or reaction to, the Intervention; the second level assesses modification of students' attitudes and perceptions and/or the knowledge and skills learned; the third level assesses changes in health professionals' behaviour or an in- stitution's practice, and; at the top of the hierarchy, changes in patient health care outcomes. In this re- view, Kirkpatrick's Hierarchy was used to a ssess edu- cational interventions as they relate to specific CAM programs taught within UGME curricula. Limitations: identified program limitations Synthesis of Results Each of the included studies was described by the author, year of publication, and the characteristics listed above. The-matic analysis was conducted to identify commonalities be-tween the included studies. No inferences were made about CAM teaching, learnin g, and assessment approaches if they were not explicitly stated. Literature searching, title and ab- stract screening, full- text review and data extraction and charting were undertaken by the first author (MS). Where there was any uncertainty regarding the aforementioned, these articles were reviewed independently by the 2nd author (JB) and then discussed until consensus was reached between both authors. The 2nd author also independently reviewed the data extraction and charting results once this process was completed by the first author. Results The primary search, which was conducted between July -Sep- tember 2020, yielded 1146 citations - 960 citations from Pub- Med, 32 from Medline and 154 from ERIC. After the removal of duplicate citations and those not written in English, 1127 remained. Following a review of titles and abstracts, 113 full- text articles remained, of which 26 met the inclusion criteria. See Figure 1 for the complete search and study selection strat- egy. A summary of the included studies is found in Table 2 and Table 3 . Two main categories of literature were identi- fied: 1. those reporting whether CAM was included in a med- ical school's UGME curricula, and; 2. those describing the teaching, learning and assessment approaches implemented in UGME. Is CAM Being Taught in UGME? Ten studies directly addressed the inclusion of CAM in UGME curricula (see Table 2 ). Seven studies9-15 utilised writ- ten questionnaires or surveys to collect program infor-mation, whilst two 16, 17 used a telephone interview, and o ne 18 used a combination of both. Sampson and Colleagues13 and Brokaw and Colleagues10 assessed CAM education in U.S. medical schools. Sampson and Colleagues reported 45% (56/125) of medical schools offered some form of CAM edu- cation. Brokaw and Colleagu es reported of 53 U.S medical schools surveyed, 75.3% (40/53) taught an elective CAM course, and 30.1% (16/53) taught a required course, with sev-eral schools (7/53) offering both. In neighbouring regions of North America, Ruedy and Colleagues 17 found of th e 16 Ca- nadian medical schools evaluated, 81% (13/16) reported the inclusion of CAM in their medical programs, and the re-maining 19% (3/16) were planning to include CAM teaching in the future. Rampes and Colleagues 12 survey of British medical schools repor ted only 3 of 24 schools (12.5%) offered CAM teaching, and none provided practical training. Smith14 found CAM was included in the curricula of all 18 responding UK medical schools (58% response rate), with 33.3% (6/18) indicating it was taught formally w ithin the UGME curriculum. In Europe, Brinkhaus and Colleagues 9 surveyed 487 de- partment directors at medical schools in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Of these, 34% (162/487) indicated CAM had been integrated into their medical schools' curricula. Ther e was noted inter -country variability with lower CAM integration in Switzerland (20%) compared to Austria (28%) and Germany (27%). Varga and Colleagues 15 surveyed 265 medical faculties in European medical schools, reporting that 40% of responding universi ties offer some form of CAM teaching. In Japan, Tsuruoka and Colleagues 18 reported CAM teaching was included in 16 of 80 (20%) schools, with 19 different teaching and learning approaches described. Kim and Colleagues (2012) reported CAM was taught at 85.4% (35/41) of participating Korean medical schools. 11 Chitindingu and Colleagues16 survey of seven South African schools reported one school was teaching both Traditional Medicine (T.M.) and CAM, five were teaching either T.M. or CAM, and one was teaching neither. T.M. relates to thera- peutic practices that incorporate plant, animal and mineral - based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises, often practiced in developing countries.19 Whilst TM is regarded as distinct from CAM, TM practices may be included within CAM.20 Data on what elements of CAM are taught in UGME was inconsistently reported. In general, of studies that looked at whether CAM was taught in UGME, acupuncture was the most frequently taught modality 11,12, 17,18 followed b y homeop- athy10-12,17 and manipulation or chiropractic therapies.10,12 In studies evaluating how implemented CAM programs are taught, the most commonly taught or demonstrated CAM disciplines were acupuncture21-25 manipulation/chiropractic 24,26, 27 and mass age.21-23 Less frequently taught cluded biofeedback21,26 nutrition21,28 analysis of medicinal plants24 homeopathy26,27 hypnosis26 and osteopathy.27 Several of the identified programs taught about the evidence base of CAM alongside the risks and benefits or offered an oppor- tunity for scientifically evaluating CAM efficacy.21,24,27, 29- 32 Int J Med Educ. 20 21;12:140- 149 143 Figure 1. PRISMA Diagram How is CAM Taught in UGME? Sixteen articles21-30,32- 37 described specific CAM teaching, learning, and assessment approaches in UGME curricula. A detailed breakdown of the different approaches used is de-scribed in Table 3. The structure of teaching modules varied greatly between programs. In a unique appr oach, Da Silva and Colleagues 22 reported a split teaching program, where students attended CAM classes in their third year, followed by clinical placements in their fifth year. Meanwhile, other programs included integrated CAM teaching across three 28 four 24, 34 five30 and six years25 of their UGME programs. Other programs adopted a block approach, where teaching was de- livered over a period of weeks to months.27-29, 31, 35, 36 Teaching time also varied greatly across institutions. Duration of time ranged from a relatively brief 5 hours21, to the longest of 90 hours.25 Several of the programs with inte- grated teaching across several y ears did not report on the to- tal teaching time, including Frenkel and Colleagues34 and Perlman and Stagnaro.24 The teaching modalities used in the delivery of CAM education varied widely. Only one pro-gram 24 used a solely didactic approach. Others used a di dactic approach in conjunction with some form of interactive teachings such as tutorials 24, 30 hands -on practice23 discus- sion-based learning -led presentations.35 In a commonly uti- lised approach, several programs included a clinical place- ment in combination with formal lectures or tutorials.22,25- 28,31 These placements varied in length from one day26 to four- af- ternoon sessions of unspecified duration22 to 30 hours.25 Bai- ley and Colleagues21 reported a unique approach involving a seminar followed by an Integrative Medicine fair where over 30 providers interacted with students through a series of stu- dent -selected workshops that introduced fields such as nutri- tion, massage, acupuncture, yoga and bi ofeedback. Similarly, the program described by Lehmann and Colleagues35 offered a unique one -day excursion to the European Library for Ho- meopathy (Kothen, Germany). Soliman & Bilszta CAM in undergraduate medical education 144 Table 2. Is CAM being taught in UGME? Reference Participants Information Gathering Approach Result / Conclusion Brinkhaus and Colleagues 20119 1,017 department directors at medical schools in Aus- tria, Germany, and Switzer- land. 487 Standardised questionnaire 162 resp ondents (34%) indicated that CAM therapies had already been integrated into the curriculum (treatment 26%, research 19% and education 18%) with no significant differences between the countries. Respondents of Switzerland indicated lower activity of CAM int egration (treatment 10% and research 10%) compared to Austria (28%, p = 0.016 and 28%, p = 0.016) and Germany (27%, p = 0.01 and 20%, p = 0.174). Brokaw and Colleagues 200210 123 CAM course directors at 74 U.S. medical schools. Questionnaires were returned by 73 course directors at 53 schools. Questionnaires mailed to course directors. The 2 page question-naire consisted of nine ques-tions with a check -box or fill -in- the-blank format, and one space at the end for written comments. 75.3% (40/53) taught an elective CAM course, and 30.1% (16/53) taught a required course. Topics most often being taught were acupuncture (76.7%), herbs and botanicals (69.9%), meditation and relaxation (65.8%), (57.5%), and nutrition and diets (50.7%). Amount of instructional time varied widely, but most received about two contact hours. The \"typical\" CAM course an elective, was most likely to be taught in the first or fourth year of medical school, and had fewer than 20 contact hours of instruction. Most of the courses (78.1%) were taught by practitioners or pres cribers of CAM thera- pies. Few of the courses (17.8%) emphasized a scientific approach to the evaluation of CAM effectiveness. Chitindinguand Colleagues 201416 Heads of School from seven South African medical schools Telephone survey One school was teaching both Traditional African Medicine (T.M.) and CAM, five were teaching either T.M. or CAM an d another was not teaching any aspect of TCAM. Conclusion: Medical schools have not responded to government policies or contextual realities by incorporating TCAM into the curriculum for their students. Kim and Colleagues 201211 Academic or curriculum deans and faculty at each of 41 Korean medical schools. Replies were received from all 41 schools. A mail survey was con ducted from 2007 to 2010. CAM was taught at 35 schools (85.4%). Most common courses were introduction to CAM or integrative medicine (88.6%), traditional Korean medicine (57.1%), homeopathy and naturopathy (31.4%), and acupuncture (28.6%). Rampes and Co lleagues 199712 24 of 26 Deans of British medical schools responded Questionnaire Of 24 medical schools, 3 were offering teaching, and none were providing practical training. Acupuncture is included in the curricula of all three of these schools, and hypnosis, homoeopathy, manipula- tion and therapeutic massage in two. Ruedy and Colleagues 199917 16 Canadian undergradu- ate medical schools deans or faculty members. Telephone interview lasting ap- proximately 30 minutes was conducted with most respo nd- ents. Most schools reported that they include CAM in their curricula (13/16), usually as part of a required course. Lectures constitute the most frequent method of information delivery, predominantly during the preclinical years. Acupuncture (in 10 schools) and homeopathic medicine (in 9 schools) were the interventions most often included. Only 2 schools reported that they provide instruction on the actual practice of one or more complementary therapies. Sampson 200113 Survey of 125 U.S. medical schools Questionnaire to learn of approaches to CAM in curricula. Of the 56 schools that had some form of relevant course offering, only nine had invited critical lecturers on occasion; their courses were otherwise generally supportive of CAM. Two course directors claimed to present inform ation \"neutrally,\" but did not teach critical methods or invite critical lecturers. Only four courses either presented a critical orientation or offered critical arguments in a way that significantly investigated advocacy arguments. Smith 201114 Deans of U.K. Undergradu- ate Medical Schools. The overall response ra te was 58.1% (18/31). Survey All respondents indicated that their curricula included CAM elements. However, the quantity of CAM within curricula varied widely between medical schools, as did the methods by which CAM education was delivered. General Medical Council requirements were the strongest factor influencing the inclusion of CAM, although medical student preferences were also important. Respondents were generally satisfied with the extent of CAM provision within their curricula, while a wide range of views on the appropriateness of CAM in the medical curriculum were held by faculty members. Tsuruoka and Colleagues 200118 80 Japanese medical schools for Western medicine. Response rate to the telephone survey and self-completed question- naire was 100 and 95%, respectively. 1. A telephone survey to curricu- lar office workers in September 1998 2. A self -completed question- naire to representatives of spon- soring departments Of 80 medical schools, CM was officially taught in 16 schools (20%). Of th ese 16 schools, there were 19 CM courses and the anesthesia department sponsored the most courses (six courses). All courses had oriental medicine titles such as acupuncture and Kampo except for one course. Varga and Colleagues 200615 265 medical faculties in E.U. countries were contacted via e -mail or regular post Questionnaire of 7 questions concerning CAM education in their establishments. Only 40% of the responding universities were offering some form of CAM training. Could not show any correlation between the public demand for CAM methods and the availability of CAM training in medical universities. Int J Med Educ. 20 21;12:140- 149 145 Generally, the instructors delivering CAM programs were ei- ther faculty members of the medical school or clinicians29,30,34- 36 external CAM practitioners only26,31 or both.21,24, 25,27,32 Several programs also included visiting experts and scholars from other universities.24,28 In some instances, faculty members were noted to have undergone advanced CAM training.24,32 Several programs involved qualified com- munity or student CAM providers and practitioners, includ- ing those with an element of clinical placement.21,23,26,27,31 Post course student evaluations were infrequently used to assess student experiences and overall course satisfaction. 26,31 Ob- jective assessment of knowledge and learning was not per- formed. Where knowledge ass essment was completed, it of- ten entailed subjective self -reporting using a Likert scale or other quantitative measure.22,23,27- 29,36 Few programs used ap- propriately coded and thematically interpreted qualitative measures.34,35 Several programs did not have formal evalua- tive or assessment processes in place24,25,30,37 or removed the evaluative process following a period of time.21 Assessment of Education and Learning Outcomes This review assessed the educational and learning outcomes of the aforementioned studies using Kirkpatrick's Hierarchy (Table 2).5-7 There was a clear trend toward Level 1 outcomes, where student reaction and satisfaction were measured in all programs, bar one 34 using a post -course evaluation. Likewise, a majority of programs achieve d Level 2 outcomes by consid- ering the achievement of learning outcomes by students who completed self -evaluations. 21,22,27- 29,32,34 -36 Only Frenkel and Colleagues34 achieved Level 3 outcomes, where students were asked if and how learned knowledge from the CAM program would change their behaviour. It should be noted behav- ioural changes were self -reported and not directly observed or analysed. Level 4 outcomes were not achieved by any of the UGME programs included in this review. Discussion This scoping review of CAM education in UGME demon- strates the emerging interest in this area. In view of the rising use of CAM and the potential for CAM -conventional therapy interactions, there is an increasing need for physicians to be- come familiar with common CAM therapi es.38 As reported, past and current inclusion of CAM teaching, even within schools located in the same country, is inconsistent. In cur-ricula that include CAM, teaching and learning vary widely, both in terms of content and delivery. It appears agreed state- ments on the expected skills and competencies of medical students at graduation related to CAM therapies are yet to emerge. In the absence of this consensus, it is difficult to identify clear aims and objectives of any CAM teaching pro-gram within a medical cour se. The following discussion amalgamates the key findings and addresses their implications, with the overall aim of aiding in the development of consistent and equitable medical education. Program Format and Design The duration of teaching is one of the greatest areas of incon- sistency amongst the included programs. Whilst a number had integrated CAM teaching across one or several years of their curriculum, the design of others was relatively brief, with few - or unspecified - dedicated teaching hours. 21,32,37 Meanwhile, several 'integrated' programs regarded the prac-tices of mindfulness and self -care for students as an element of their holistic CAM curriculum. 23,30 Other medical schools considered mentioning CAM in areas of relevance - such as drug intera ctions and clinical oncology - constituted suffi- cient CAM teaching.14 This could lead to a potentially in- flated and inaccurate measure of the duration of CAM teach- ing, particularly within these integrated approaches. In analysing the approach to teaching, it is clear experi- ential learning is favoured compared to a solely didactic ap- proach. Nearly all programs favoured delivery methods that would enhance student engagement. These included tutori-als, workshops and case discussions, alongside clinical place- ments with CAM practitioners. Whilst well received by stu- dents, most immersive methods only achieved Kirkpatrick's Level 1 and/or 2 outcomes, without an assessment of trans-latability to clinical practice and impacts on patient out- comes, which would require L evel 3 and 4 outcomes, respec- tively. Various programs included clinical placements with CAM practitioners, the longest being 30 hours . 25 However, in the absence of a student evaluation or objective assessment tool, the benefits of clinical placement canno t be commented on. Various programs focussed on specific CAM disciplines, the most common of which was acupuncture. 21-25 This re- flects the identified difficulties in establishing a discrete knowledge base, as CAM disciplines require constant updat- ing as new evidence and novel therapies emerge and gain traction within the general population.3 In what proved to be a popular approach21,24,27,29- 32 analysis of the evidence base surrounding CAM is one of the more common methods of teaching. In equi pping students with the skill set needed to critically appraise evidence, the plethora of CAM therapies need not be delved into individually. Rather, students can draw their own informed conclusions without the influence of potentially biased and unsubstan tiated claims. Despite this, not all programs included teaching on evidence -based medicine (EBM), rather focusing on specific CAM disci-plines. In designing a sustainable CAM program, curriculum developers should consider the need for constant review and critical appraisal as new evidence emerges. The EBM teach- ing model presents a potential solution to a rather over-whelming and resource intensive area of education, where learned knowledge and skills can be adapted for differing CAM modalities, and beyond.

Whilst many programs utilised community - based CAM practitioners 25,26,31,35 difficulties in repeatedly sourcing appropriately qual ified instructors were identi- fied.21 Where faculty staff were involved in teaching, several programs were sustainable for longer.21,22,30 Whilst both CAM practitioners and faculty staff could both introduce an ele-ment of bias, this could be overcome with clear learning out- comes and an evidence -based teaching approach. In view of sustainability, it may be more appropriate to deliver teaching through faculty staff, some of who receive further training in EBM. Curriculum developers should consider and account for the additional cost of incorporating CAM programs within UGME. Appropriate assessment and educational outcomes Few of the programs per formed formalised pre and/or post - course student assessment or evaluation as a measure of the change in knowledge. This reaffirmed findings from Stratton and Colleagues3 which reported the same observation in the programs receiving CAM education grants from the NCCAM. Instead, general qualitative statements were re- garded as a measure of overall student satisfaction and in-creased knowledge. 21,27,34 Student reactions and knowledge (Kirkpatrick's Level 1, 2a, 2b) were the most commonly achieved outcomes, with student knowledge measured sub-jectively through student questionnaires. 22,27- 29,31,32 Whilst Frenkel and Colleagues34 was successful in determining the willingness of learners to apply new knowledge and skills (Kirkpatrick's' Level 3 outcome), it was the o nly study to do so. Course designers within medical schools must create educational programs that aim to directly impact patient care, rather than increasing knowledge without a foreseeable change to clinical practice. This is an undoubtedly challeng- ing t ask, particularly since many widely taught CAM therapies have not yet been proven efficacious by scientific standards. For medical educators to educate appropriately, an evidence base for positive patient outcomes must first be established. Limitations Articles may have been omitted due to the adopted search strategy, inclusion criteria, and limit of English language ar- ticles only. Grey literature was not performed. Several pro- grams were incompletely reported, potentially influencing the outcomes reporte d in this review. Many medical school faculty and Deans who were approached did not participate, leading to potential selection bias. Studies incorporating face-to-face interviewing may also be subject to observation bias. A small sample size, apparent in several studies, could also reduce the power and, therefore, reliability of results. Post -evaluations using subjective qualitative Likert -based assessment do not provide an objective measure of program success, particularly where students' results cannot be compared to pre -program standards. As only the first three levels of Kirkpatrick's Hierarchy were reached, the patient implications of CAM in UGME could not be determined. No studies reported on the change in patient outcomes or healthcare delivery (K irkpatrick's Level 4). Longitudinal pro- spective studies would provide curriculum developers with insight to the real -world effects of CAM education, where pa- tient outcomes can be correlated to teaching interventions. Several studies did not report outcomes of interest, such as teaching duration, disciplines and teaching staff. 22, 27, 28, 31, 32, 37 Conclusion s The aim of this review was to evaluate the various approaches for teaching CAM in UGME. Despite various limitations, it is apparent CAM teaching is i nconsistently incorporated into medical schools at a multi -national level. The diversity in ap- proaches reflects the lack of defined graduate competencies as they relate to this specific area. With a breadth of CAM disciplines and an array of teaching and l earning approaches, there is no single recommended education program that has been demonstrated to produce positive patient outcomes. Although the concept of an EBM course appeals as a potential solution to overcoming the enormous breadth and content developments in CAM, ultimately there is a deficiency of evidence to demonstrate the real -life healthcare impact. Curriculum developers would be better guided with further research, aligning health outcomes with teaching, assessment and evaluation of propose d CAM programs.
