However, these invading units can be organised in a variety of ways, ranging from thin discontinuous strands to thick 'pushing' collectives. Here we employ an integrated experimental and computational approach to identify the factors that determine the mode of collective cancer cell invasion. We find that matrix proteolysis is linked to the formation of wide strands but has little effect on the maximum extent of invasion. Cell-cell junctions also favour wide strands, but our analysis also reveals a requirement for cell-cell junctions for efficient invasion in response to uniform directional cues. Unexpectedly, the ability to generate wide invasive strands is coupled to the ability to grow effectively when surrounded by extracellular matrix in three-dimensional assays. Combinatorial perturbation of both matrix proteolysis and cell-cell adhesion demonstrates that the most aggressive cancer behaviour, both in terms of invasion and growth, is achieved at high levels of cell-cell adhesion and high levels of proteolysis. Contrary to expectation, cells with canonical mesenchymal traits - no cell-cell junctions and high proteolysis - exhibit reduced growth and lymph node metastasis. Thus, we conclude that the ability of squamous cell carcinoma cells to invade effectively is also linked to their ability to generate space for proliferation in confined contexts. These data provide an explanation for the apparent advantage of retaining cell-cell junctions in squamous cell carcinomas. Editor's evaluation This article constitutes a carefully written and highly impactful study that agrees with recent paradigm-shifting studies (e.g., doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.abn7571 and doi: 10.1242/jcs.259275) suggesting that collective cell migration is the most efficacious way for epithelial cells to metastasize. The study uses mathematical modeling and experimental 3D approaches to demonstrate that cells necessitate space to both proliferate and invade as collective thick \"pushing\" strands. Importantly, extracellular matrix patterning provides uniform directional cues that harness adherens junctions and facilitate the collective thick strands of cells to 'push' and effectively travel through 3D microenvironmental settings. The study breaks new ground by incorporating cancer-associated fibroblasts and concludes that the pushing fronts are allied to extracellular matrix proteolysis and strong cancer cell-cell adherens junctions with diminished dependence on stromal cells (e.g., cancer-associated fibroblasts). [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76520.sa0](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76520.sa0) Introduction Tumours exhibit a variety of histological patterns that inform pathological diagnosis and that are frequently linked to prognosis ( [Dive et al., 2014](#bib20)). This link with outcome suggests that the mechanisms specifying histological pattern are related to tumour malignancy. This may be due to some coupling between how cancer cells invade and their ability to proliferate. Epithelial cancer cells, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), frequently invade in collective units and [Khalil et al., 2017](#bib41); [Wang et al., 2016](#bib68)). The importance of collective invasion is underscored by several recent studies showing that collective seeding of metastases is more efficient than single cell seeding [Cheung et al., al., 2017](#bib41); [Padmanaban et al., 2019](#bib52)). Despite the prevalence and importance of collective patterns of cancer cell invasion, it remains less well understood than single cell forms of invasion. Collectively invading cancer strands can be organised in a variety of different ways, from single file strands that characterise invasive lobular breast cancer and diffuse gastric cancer to broad cohesive units found in basal cell carcinoma ( [Boelens et al., 2012](#bib26); [Pandya et al., 2017](#bib54)). Histological analysis indicates that even within a single disease type there is considerable heterogeneity in the pattern of invasion; for example, both broad 'pushing' and strand-like infiltrative invasion can be observed in SCC ( [Dissanayaka et al., 2012](#bib19)). In this study, we set out to explore the key parameters that determine the pattern of collective invasion using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Several parameters might be expected to modulate tumour histology and, more specifically, collective cancer cell invasion. The ability of cancer cells to adhere to each other through cadherin-mediated junctions is linked to their organisation into tightly packed clusters. E-cadherin/CDH1 and, to a lesser extent, P-cadherin/CDH3 are the predominant cadherins in mucosal [Nieman et al., 1999](#bib48)) that typically do not undergo a clear epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). These cadherins are coupled to the actin cytoskeleton via a complex containing -catenin and -catenin al., 2013](#bib47)). Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is also critical for cell migration and invasion in many contexts ( [Cooper and Giancotti, 2019](#bib16); Ivaska, 2018](#bib34); [Janes SCC ( [Janes and Watt, 2006](#bib36)). The ECM presents a barrier to migration if the gaps between fibres are smaller than 3-5 m ( [Wolf The dermal ECM underlying SCC lesions is predominantly composed of type I collagen ( [Watt and Fujiwara, 2011](#bib70)), and numerous studies have demonstrated that MMP14/MT-1MMP is the critical protease for degrading this type of matrix ( [Castro-Castro et al., 2016](#bib12); [Gifford and Itoh, 2019](#bib30)). The ECM can also be physically moved by forces generated by the contractile cytoskeleton ( [Mohammadi and In many cases, stromal cells are the major source of both matrix proteolytic and force-mediated stromal fibroblasts) can promote the invasion of SCC by providing these functions and are frequently observed leading the migration of cancer cells that retain epithelial characteristics ( [Gaggioli et al., 2007](#bib27)). Understanding the relative contributions of the multiple parameters outlined above to cell invasion is a complex multi-dimensional problem with non-linear relationships between parameters and migratory capability. This complexity means that developing a holistic and predictive framework for collective cancer cell invasion using empirical methods only is challenging. For this reason, several studies have sought to utilise computational models. Many different types of model have been used including those based on evolutionary game theory ( [Basanta et 2017](#bib49); 2005](#bib3); [Anderson 2002](#bib67)) is a flexible approach that uses voxels to represent different parts of cells or their environment. Changes in the properties associated with each voxel are determined at each time step using principles of probabilistic energy minimisation. The behaviour of the model therefore emerges from iterative application of rules that describes the relative favourability of different events or changes. Here we combine a Potts modelling with extensive experimentation to unpick the determinants of the mode of collective cancer cell invasion and their linkage to cancer cell growth, both in vitro and in vivo. Results Diverse modes of collective invasion within individual SCC We began by surveying the diversity of invasive pattern in muSCC. [Figure 1a](#fig1) shows considerable diversity in the nature of collective invasion. Furthermore, it illustrates how initial invasion involves cells moving from the epithelial layer into the lamina propria (often termed epidermis and dermis, respectively, in cutaneous skin). Following the invasion into the dermis, cancer cells become surrounded on all sides by ECM. Interestingly, different patterns of invasion were observed in different regions of the same tumour ( [Figure 1a](#fig1)). These ranged from broad 'pushing' invasive masses of cells (box I), thinner strands of cells (box II), to single-cell width strands and apparently isolated single cells (box III - although this could not be definitively determined from single H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) sections). Quantitative analysis of the number of cell neighbours provided a more objective metric of invasion type, with high neighbour numbers (typically 4-7) indicating broad invasion patterns and low neighbour numbers (2 or 3) indicating thin strand-like invasion, respectively ( [Figure 1b](#fig1)). Similar patterns were observed in other muSCC biopsies with different strand thickness apparent ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a-f](/articles/76520/figures#fig1s1)). Analysis of neighbour number suggested that strand thickness does not fall into distinct categories, with neighbour number varying continuously between 1 and 9. [see all](/articles/76520/figures#fig1) To gain insight into the dynamics of SCC invasion, we performed time-lapse imaging of primary patient explants. Small pieces of tissue, roughly 1 mm3 in size, were embedded in a collagen-rich matrix and observed by time-lapse microscopy. Similar to the diversity observed in histological sections, this revealed a variety of behaviours, including single-cell 'follow the leader' migration through to large 'dome-like' multi-cellular invasion, even in samples from a single patient ( [Figure 1c](#fig1)). Cell tracking revealed that, in the larger invading structures, there was movement both in the direction of invasion and retrograde back to the main bulk of the explant. The diversity of collective invasion phenotype within a single tumour suggests that the type of collective invasion is not irreversibly determined by early events in the history of the tumour but can be influenced by variations in cell state that may occur later in tumorigenesis or local environmental differences. Generation of an agent-based model of collective cancer invasion To explore the possible variables responsible for the different collective invasive behaviours observed, we set up both experimental and computational models. Two different experimental settings were implemented. First, an 'organotypic' invasion assay in which the SCC cells are cultured as a layer on top of a collagen-rich matrix and exposed to a gas-liquid interface. This recapitulates the early invasion of disease from the epidermis into the dermis (as in the top region of [Figure 1a](#fig1)). Second, a 'spheroid' assay was used in which the SCC cells are encapsulated in a collagen-rich matrix, mimicking the more confined environment of disease that has already penetrated into the dermis (as in the bottom region of [Figure 1a](#fig1)). Alongside these two experimental contexts, we developed a cellular Potts model that incorporated both SCC cells and stromal fibroblasts. The interaction of cancer cells with ECM and fibroblasts during invasion has been extensively modelled recent 2019](#bib53); [Sfakianakis al., 2020](#bib60)). In our three-dimensional (3D) model, the voxel size was such that cells typically consisted of 400-800 (~83) voxels. Cell invasion could occur by a cell moving a voxel to a position that was previously occupied by matrix. To determine whether such a change might be favourable, the model included parameters that we anticipated would influence cancer cell invasion, including cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion, cancer motility, matrix displacement, and matrix proteolysis. The relative influence of these parameters on changes in the position of voxels that defined a cell between time-steps was determined along energy minimisation principles, with penalties of differing magnitudes for unfavourable changes in any single parameter Experimental analysis using A431 SCC cells demonstrated that effective invasion required the addition of CAFs and, in both cases, the invasion was almost entirely collective ( [Figure 2b](#fig2) panels iii and vi). Careful parameterisation was performed, including analysis of the relative adhesive properties of the different cells to each other and the collagen-rich matrix used in our assays and - table 1 in [Supplementary file 1](/articles/76520/figures#supp1)). This enabled the in silico replication of the fibroblast-dependent invasion observed in both organotypic and spheroid assays ( 2b](#fig2)). In experimental reports ( [Gaggioli et al., 2007](#bib27)), the extent of increased invasion scaled with the number of fibroblasts ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a](/articles/76520/figures#fig2s1)). In silico generation of diverse collective invasion behaviours Having established an in silico model, we then explored parameter space to investigate if different patterns of invasion could be generated by varying the combinations of input parameters. To quantitatively capture the range of invasive behaviours, a range of output metrics were collected, including total invasive extent, maximal invasion, number of cell neighbours, and cell proliferation ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b](/articles/76520/figures#fig2s1) and c). The tapering metric recorded how the number of immediately neighbouring cells varied with the position of the cells in the invasive strand (cells were considered invasive if they had moved beyond the starting position of the interface between cancer cells and the matrix), whereas the strand width simply reflected the average width. A uniformly low neighbour number would indicate a long thin strand ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1cI](/articles/76520/figures#fig2s1)), a decreasing number of neighbours with increasing invasion would indicate a tapering strand ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1cII](/articles/76520/figures#fig2s1)), while a higher number of neighbours would suggest a bulkier form of collective invasion ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1cIII](/articles/76520/figures#fig2s1)). A critical function of fibroblasts is to generate permissive tracks for cancer cells to subsequently utilise. To mimic this without the variability generated by the somewhat stochastic behaviour of fibroblasts, we additionally ran simulations with a narrow track that could be permissive for invasion but no fibroblasts. This confirmed that cancer cells were able to exploit permissive tracks in the ECM ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1d](/articles/76520/figures#fig2s1)). Invasion in this context, termed track invasion score, was quantified based on the extent of matrix remodelling by invading cancer cells with weighting for the distance invaded ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1e](/articles/76520/figures#fig2s1)). The outputs of the model in the presence of CAFs were analysed in two ways: using principal component analysis (PCA) and visual inspection ( [Figure 2c and d](#fig2)). PCA revealed a wide and continuous spread of invasion patterns, with the first two dimensions of the PCA accounting for 75% (organotypic) and 65% (spheroid) of the variation (Appendix 3 - table 1 in [Supplementary file 1](/articles/76520/figures#supp1)). Notably, there was no indication of discrete sub-classes of invasive pattern, suggesting a continuous spectrum of invasive behaviours. The continuous spectrum implied by PCA was in line with the range of invasive strand geometries observed in clinical muSCC samples ( [Figure 1](#fig1)). We additionally generated visual outputs of the model runs that lay at the edges of the PCA. This revealed diverse patterns of invasion, ranging from large rounded multicellular strands to single cells breaking off the main mass of tumour cells. The diversity in collective invasion observed in the presence of fibroblasts was in contrast to behaviours observed in the absence of CAFs. PCA analysis of the metrics generated from model runs without CAFs shows that the data reduces to a single dimension ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1f](/articles/76520/figures#fig2s1) and Appendix 3 - table 1 in [Supplementary file 1](/articles/76520/figures#supp1)), with remarkably similar behaviour in both organotypic and spheroid data. PCA combining runs with and without CAFs confirmed that fibroblasts boost invasion ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/76520/figures#fig2s1)). Matrix proteolysis drives strand widening but not the extent of invasion Having established that our model could generate diverse types of invasion, we undertook a more systematic analysis of parameter space to determine the contribution of specific parameters to both the extent and pattern of invasion. [Figure 3a](#fig3) shows the PCA plots overlaid with shading for the input variable of cancer cell proteolysis, with high levels of proteolysis, trending along the vector for number of neighbours in both organotypics and spheroids. Somewhat contrary to expectation, we found that increasing cancer cell proteolysis led to only modestly elevated invasion scores in organotypic contexts. Moreover, the maximum invasive depth did not correlate with matrix proteolysis ( [Figure 3b](#fig3)). Instead the width of the strands (neighbour numbers) increased as a function of proteolysis, especially in organotypic assays. In simulations with low proteolysis, the model predicted thin strands (low neighbour and low tapering scores). To measure the effect of proteolysis on the shape of the invading front of cell clusters, we ran simulations initiated with a cluster of cells and a uniform directional cue, either without the complicating factor of pre-existing tracks or a simple single permissive track. [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1c](/articles/76520/figures#fig3s1) shows that increasing proteolysis leads to reduced curvature and a 'pushing' front in the absence of a track. When a track was present, it was favoured for invasion and interfered with the generation of a pushing front most strikingly at intermediate levels of proteolysis. Inspired by previous studies ( [Ahmadzadeh et al., 2017](#bib1); [Park et al., 2020](#bib55); [Provenzano et al., 2006](#bib58)), we additionally considered the cases if the ECM had multiple tracks either oriented parallel to the direction of invasion - analogous to aligned matrix fibres - or had isotropic texture distributed as a chessboard - analogous to non-aligned matrix fibres. As might be expected, ECM fibres parallel to the direction of the invasive cue favoured invasion, but isotropic texture hindered invasion Analysis of spheroid contexts yielded a different picture, with reduced maximum invasion depth with increasing proteolysis values. Notably, the very highest matrix degradation value yielded significantly lower maximum invasion depth than the intermediate and lowest level. There was less difference in the overall invasion score as increasing proteolysis was linked to slightly wider strands, which counter-balanced the reduction in maximum invasion depth ( [Figure b](#fig3)). Both organotypic assays of invasion ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a](/articles/76520/figures#fig3s1) and b). Comparative plots of the metrics in simulations with and without CAFs confirm this (note the red colour) and indicate that fibroblasts favour narrower strands (note the blue colour in the neighbour and tapering rows). Overall, cancer cell proteolysis is primarily predicted to regulate strand width in both organotypic and spheroid contexts. The relationship between matrix proteolysis and strand width was maintained even if cancer cell proliferation was reduced ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1e](/articles/76520/figures#fig3s1)), although the cell neighbour values were lower when proliferation was halved. We tested the predictions that cancer cell matrix protease function was linked to width of invasion strands by generating A431 cancer cells that either over-expressed MMP14, the major collagen protease, or had it deleted via Crispr/Cas9 editing methods ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1f](/articles/76520/figures#fig3s1)). In line with expectation, MMP14 over-expression increased the proteolysis of collagen, while MMP14 deletion (as d](#fig3) shows that experimentation confirmed the major predictions of our model. In particular, the maximum invasion depth in the organotypic context did not simply increase with MMP14 levels, with strand lengths similar between MMP14 KO and over-expressing cells. In contrast, the strand width was notably affected by MMP14 levels in both organotypic and spheroid assays (yellow lines in [Figure 3c](#fig3) indicate strand width), with KO cells generating thin strands and over-expressing cells generating thick strands. The positive relationship between ECM proteolysis and strand width was [Figure 3c and d](#fig3)). Of note, matrix proteolysis promoted wide strands even if cancer cell proliferation was prevented by pre-treatment with mitomycin C ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1h](/articles/76520/figures#fig3s1)). These results are highly concordant with the model predictions and confirm that MMP14 is a major determinant of the mode of collective cancer cell invasion but plays little role in determining the maximum distance invaded. Cancer cell-cell adhesion promotes wide invasive strands We turned our attention to investigate how cancer cell adhesion to either other cancer cells or the matrix influenced the mode of collective invasion. [Figure 4a](#fig4) shows PCA plots of invasion characteristics with the strength of cancer cell-matrix adhesion overlaid in green shading. There was no consistent association between cancer cell-matrix adhesion and invasive pattern in the organotypic context, with high adhesion values distributed across the PCA plot. The relationship between cell-matrix adhesion and invasion score was relatively flat, with only very high cell-matrix adhesion values boosting invasion. This prediction is supported by the lack of effect of ITGB1 deletion on cancer invasion in the experimental organotypic model [Figure 4c and d](#fig4) 1b](/articles/76520/figures#fig4s1) and c confirm that ITGB1 KO cells are defective in collagen I and Matrigel adhesion). In the spheroid context, there was a somewhat stronger association between matrix adhesion and invasion. Minimal invasion was observed in the absence of fibroblasts ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a](/articles/76520/figures#fig4s1)). Intriguingly, the strongest correlation was with the tapering metric that reflects whether strands have a uniform breadth or taper as they invade deeper ( [Figure 4b](#fig4) - row 4). Experiments using ITGB1 KO A431 cells provided support for this prediction. To rule out a compensatory role for ITGB3 in ITGB1 KO cells, we combined targeting of both ITGB1 and ITGB3. [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1d-f](/articles/76520/figures#fig4s1) shows that these cells were still able to invade. Greater tapering observed in ITGB1 KO spheroids ( [Figure 4c and d](#fig4)). Interestingly, and in line with model predictions, this was not observed in organotypic assays ( [Figure 4b-d](#fig4)). [see all](/articles/76520/figures#fig4) between cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion and invasion when fibroblasts were present ( [Figure 5a](#fig5)). These analyses yielded several predictions that caught our attention. First, reducing cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion reduced the total invasion score in organotypic assays across relatively large ranges of parameter space ( [Figure 5a and b](#fig5) - note the association of increasing magenta intensity and invasion score vectors in the PCA plot). This is counter to the widely held view that EMT and increased single cell characteristics promote invasion. Specifically, in organotypic contexts, lower cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion resulted in shorter invasive strands that thinned rapidly as they invaded (this is reflected in the Max. Invasion, Mean Neighbour, and Tapering rows in [Figure 5b](#fig5)). Once again, little invasion was observed in the of fibroblasts ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a](/articles/76520/figures#fig5s1)). plots the change in strand width as a function of depth for varying cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion. The simpler context of cell invasion into a thin permissive gap further supported the prediction that cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion is linked to wider invading strands ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1d](/articles/76520/figures#fig5s1)). The situation in spheroid assays was more subtle, with increases in invasion only predicted at very high values 2 WT ( [Figure 5b](#fig5)). Of note, the Neighbour and Tapering metrics did not vary much depending on cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion. To test these predictions, we generated A431 cells defective in cell-cell adhesion as a result deletion of -catenin/CTNNA1 ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1f](/articles/76520/figures#fig3s1)). Strikingly, and, in line with the model predictions, these cells lacking adherens junctions were significantly less invasive, both in terms of strand length and strand did not affect strand length and had only a modest effect on strand width (~20% reduction compared to a 60% reduction in width in organotypic assays). [see all](/articles/76520/figures#fig5) The pro-invasive role of cell-cell junctions depends on a uniform directional cue and supra-cellular coordination of the actomyosin cytoskeleton The data described above establish an intriguing context-dependent role for cell-cell junctions in collective invasion - with a positive relationship between cell-cell adhesion and invasion in organotypic contexts but not in spheroid contexts. To rule out that the location of CAFs drive invasive pattern, we mixed CAFs with SCCs in organotypic simulations ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1e](/articles/76520/figures#fig5s1)). The results were highly consistent with the results of CAFs mixed in with ECM, with only minor differences in the number of fractured objections and tapering. These analyses rule out CAF location as a dominant driver of invasive pattern. One key difference between these two contexts is that cancer cells in the organotypic context are subject to a uniform gradient of chemotactic cues, whereas in the spheroid context, the cancer cells are subject to a radial chemotactic cue. We used our model to test if switching to a uniform chemotactic gradient in the spheroid context would generate a positive relationship between cell-cell adhesion and invasion. [Figure 5e](#fig5) quantifies track invasion score in simulations of spheroids with either uniform or radial chemotactic cues. These analyses indicate that cancer cell junctions are favourable for invasion when cells are subject to a uniform directional cue. The importance of junctions only when there is a uniform directional cue suggests that it may not be cell-cell adhesion per se that is important but some linkage between cell-cell adhesions and coordination of collective invasion. Consistent with this idea, cadherin-mediated coordination of actin and myosin dynamics is important for effective collective migration of neural crest cells during cranio-facial development and for border cell migration in the Drosophila egg chamber ( [Geisbrecht and Montell, 2002](#bib28); [Shellard et al., 2018](#bib61)). We hypothesised that a similar mechanism might also underlie the context-dependent importance of adherens junctions in cancer cell invasion. Previous work revealed that collectively invading cancer cells have a supra-cellular actomyosin network that enables the coordinated migration of cell groups. [Figure 6a](#fig6) confirms control A431 cells exhibit supra-cellular organisation of their actomyosin network ( [Hidalgo-Carcedo et al., 2011](#bib35)). Furthermore, knockout of of a supra-cellular actomyosin - As expected, CTNNB1 failed to CTNNA1 KO 6a](#fig6)). experimentally disrupt supra-cellular actomyosin network while retaining cell-cell junctions, we utilised two experimental tools, ROCK:ER (a fusion of the ROCK2 kinase domain to the regulatory domain of the oestrogen receptor) and ROCK kinase inhibition. In the presence of 4OHT, ROCK:ER ( [Croft et al., 2004](#bib17)), and the latter the activity of the supra-cellular actomyosin belt. [Figure 6b and c](#fig6) shows that these manipulations have the desired effect on active actomyosin, as determined by pS19-MLC staining ( [Figure 6\u2014figure supplement and c confirms these observations with staining for MYH9). We next tested the effect of these perturbations on A431 MMP14 over-expressing cells that generate wide invasive strands. [Figure 6d and e](#fig6) shows that both manipulations reduce the width of invading strands, demonstrating that disrupting actomyosin coordination mechanisms phenocopy loss of adherens junctions with respect to the width of invading strands (note: for this experiment we used ECM pre-conditioned by fibroblasts in the absence of drug and then added cancer cells in the presence of the indicated perturbations). Furthermore, the data support a model in which adherens junctions influence invasive pattern by enabling supra-cellular coordination of actomyosin, and not simply determining whether cancer cells are able to maintain contact with one another. Consistent with this view, we observed supra-cellular organisation of actomyosin and the retention of adherens in all but the thinnest invading strands in human SCC. [see all](/articles/76520/figures#fig6) Protease-driven strand widening requires cell-cell junctions The analyses above investigate the relationship between individual cancer cell parameters and invasion; we additionally explored how combinations of parameter variations influenced invasive pattern and extent. The data described above argue that, by virtue of their role in coordinating supra-cellular actomyosin, cell-cell junctions would be required for high levels of proteolysis to generate wide invasive tracks. We, therefore, explored the interplay between cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion and proteolysis in determining SCC invasion using both modelling and experimental strategies. Potts modelling predicted that the high neighbour number observed when matrix proteolysis is high would depend upon cell-cell junctions in organotypic assays (note the higher values in the top right regions on the plots in [Figure 7ai](#fig7)). Interestingly, this cooperative interaction between proteolysis and cell-cell adhesion was not predicted to influence the extent of maximum invasion, which was dominated by cell-cell adhesion alone ( [Figure 7aii](#fig7)). These predictions were supported by experimentation: deletion of CTTNA1 prevented the formation of wide invasive strands by MMP14 over-expressing A431 cells in the organotypic invasion assays ( [Figure 7a, d, and and b indicates that CAFs favour narrower invasive strands; therefore, to more fully explore how ECM proteolysis and cell-cell adhesion co-ordinately determine the geometry of collective invasion, we revisited simulations, without CAFs, designed to monitor the curvature of the invading cell ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1d](/articles/76520/figures#fig3s1)). [Figure 7\u2014figure if both ECM proteolysis and cell-cell adhesion are high then a broad, virtually flat, invasive front is generated. Reducing either proteolysis or cell-cell adhesion leads to increased curvature. Together, these analyses establish that a broad 'pushing' front of invasion requires both high proteolysis and high cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion. [see all](/articles/76520/figures#fig7) Strand widening is coupled to cancer cell growth While the focus of our analysis has been the pattern of invasion, the widening of tracks might also represent a mechanism for generating additional space for cell growth in confined environments. As proliferation is a feature of our model, we additionally investigated whether cancer cell growth might be impacted as a result of change in cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion and proteolysis. Interestingly, the vectors reflecting cell growth and neighbour number in the PCA analysis were closely aligned ( [Figure 2c and d](#fig2)). EdU staining revealed ( [Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1a and b](/articles/76520/figures#fig8s1)). Moreover, there was a positive association between the proportion of EdU positive cells in invading strands and the strand width. The modelling indicated that the linkage between strand widening and growth was particularly pronounced in the spheroid simulations lacking fibroblasts ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1f](/articles/76520/figures#fig2s1)). Given that we have established matrix proteolysis and cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion as the major determinants of neighbour number and strand width, we therefore investigated the relationship between these parameters and cell growth. Neither was predicted to have a strong effect on cell growth in organotypic assays, either in the presence or absence of CAFs ( [Figure 8a](#fig8)). In contrast, a strong positive relationship between proteolysis and growth was predicted in the context of spheroids lacking CAFs ( [Figure 8a](#fig8)). Cancer cell-cancer cell adhesions were also predicted to make a positive contribution to growth, albeit smaller than the effect of proteolysis ( [Figure 8a](#fig8)). We proceeded to test these predictions experimentally. Manipulation of MMP14 and CTTNA1 had minimal effect on cell growth in proteolysis and cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion are required for effective cell growth in 3D collagen matrices. Moreover, the positive effect of boosting proteolysis disrupts cytoskeletal cohesion in cell clusters, also reduced growth in 3D collagen ( [Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1d](/articles/76520/figures#fig8s1) and e). Together, these data suggested that the supra-cellular actomyosin network, invasive strand width, and cancer cell growth might be linked. [see all](/articles/76520/figures#fig8) The linkage between strand widening and growth might be due to the ability of cells to generate space when surrounded by ECM. This could be the result of proteolysis, which would explain the effect of MMP14 manipulation, but it is less clear why this might require adherens junctions. We hypothesised that cell-cell junctions and the supra-cellular coordination of the actomyosin network might enable cancer cells to physically remodel the ECM ( [Figure 8d-f](#fig8)). Similar to previous work with single cells [Wyckoff et al., 2006](#bib75), we observed that clusters of control cancer cells displaced the ECM. This was observed directly in time-lapse movies and as the formation and compaction of ECM fibres at the cancer cell-ECM interface (note arrows in [Figure 8e and f](#fig8)). These analyses also revealed highly dynamic membrane blebs and filopodia at the cancer cell-ECM interface. ECM compaction was absent when CTNNA1 KO cells were used. MMP over-expression reduced ECM compaction and led to the formation of gaps in the ECM adjacent to the cancer cells with reduced numbers of membrane blebs ( [Figure 8f](#fig8)). These analyses provide a direct demonstration of the 'pushing' term used in the computational modelling and are consistent with a role for the supra-cellular actomyosin cable in generating the pushing force. Protease-driven tumour growth and lymph node metastasis require cell-cell junctions Finally, we sought to test whether key findings of our integrated in silico and in vitro analysis also applied in an in vivo context with a heterogeneous environment including a greater diversity of stromal cell types not included in our model. A431 cells engineered to have different levels of MMP14 and CTTNA levels were injected into the dermal space within the ears of mice. This anatomical location was chosen because the dermis represents the first tissue that SCC invades into, and cells can spread from the dermis to local lymph nodes, which reflects the clinical spread of the disease. This environment is spatially confined with some fibroblasts in addition to thin layers of fat, cartilage, and muscle. It was not possible to include all these additional factors with appropriately controlled parameterisation. Therefore, we concentrated on validating the relationship between matrix proteolysis, cancer cell-cell adhesion, and invasive spread in vivo. In addition, if stromal support, such as that provided by fibroblasts, is limited then the mechanisms that promote wide invasive strands also favour growth. To test these ideas, we injected A431 cells with combinations of MMP14 and -catenin manipulations into the intradermal space of mouse ears. This environment is spatially restrictive with lymphatic drainage to local lymph nodes. Of note, MMP over-expressing cells generated tumours with particularly wide, bulging, margins ( [Figure 9a](#fig9)). Strikingly, there was a strong correlation between the levels of MMP14 and tumour growth ( [Figure 9b](#fig9)). Histological analysis revealed clusters of SCC cells in the ear distant from the main tumour. In MMP14 over-expressing tumours, these clusters were larger, rounder (as judged by aspect ratio), and further from the tumour ( [Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1a](/articles/76520/figures#fig9s1) and b). Metastatic spread to lymph nodes also correlated with MMP14 levels, which are in line with previous reports ( [Bartolom\u00e9 et al., 2009](#bib6); [Devy et al., 2009](#bib18); [Wang et al., 2021](#bib69)). Notably, and in contrast to the prevailing dogma, reducing cancer cell-cancer cell adhesion did not lead to a more aggressive tumour phenotype but reduced both tumour growth, and very few mice were observed to have lymph node metastases ( [Figure 9c](#fig9)). This could be partly compensated by over-expression of MMP14, suggesting that a defect in 'space' generation might underpin the defect in the CTNNA1 KO cells. However, the growth and lymph node metastasis of MMP14 o.e./CTNNA1 KO cells were reduced compared to the MMP14 o.e. cells ( [Figure 9c](#fig9)), indicating that the tumour effect of elevated MMP14 levels depends on cell-cell adhesion. Together, these analyses demonstrate that MMP14-driven matrix proteolysis promotes invasion in wide collective units and tumour growth in spatially confined contexts. Furthermore, the widening of invasive units, tumour growth, and lymph node metastases depends upon adherens junction-mediated supra-cellular coordination of the actomyosin network. [see all](/articles/76520/figures#fig9) Discussion The combined computational and experimental analysis of collective cancer cell invasion presented here raises several findings that warrant further consideration. Although, matrix proteolysis was broadly associated with higher levels of invasion ( [Castro-Castro et al., 2016](#bib12); [Egeblad and Werb, 2002](#bib21)), a simple linear relationship ( [Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1d](/articles/76520/figures#fig8s1)). Most notably, high proteolysis reduces the maximal extent of invasion but increases the strand width in both the model and experiments. The ability of cells with high levels of proteolysis to generate space means that there is less pressure to constrict cells into longer thinner strands. The importance of space limitation for effective invasion is underscored by the reduced invasion observed when spheroids have a 'choice' between invasion and spreading over an unimpeded matrix layer. High proteolysis essentially reduces the space limitation. This is also linked with high levels of proliferative capacity in 3D environments. Our analysis demonstrated that this growth effect was clearly observed in vivo. MMP14 over-expressing tumours grew and metastasised aggressively. This argues that SCC cells invading in thick strands are efficient at metastasis. Crucially, the aggressive behaviour of MMP14 over-expressing cells is reduced by depletion of -catenin. This argues strongly against a single cell form of migration being optimal for lymph node metastasis of SCC cells. The importance of adherens junctions for efficient metastasis is increasingly appreciated, this work suggests that one advantage of both adherens junctions and matrix proteases in collective migration is that the cells remain in a state capable of generating the space required for growth. In silico analysis revealed that reducing cancer cell-ECM adhesion had a minor effect on determining the mode of invasion. Experimentation using ITGB1 knock-out cells supported this analysis and notably confirmed the relationship between strand tapering and cancer cell-ECM adhesion. Moreover, unless cancer cell-ECM adhesion was very strong, the relationship between this variable and extent of invasion was rather weak in both organotypic and spheroid assays. Broadly, these data are consistent with the integrin independence of amoeboid forms of migration in 3D and hint at a role for either adhesion forces mediated by the glycocalyx or a role for outward forces that enable a 'chimneying' type of migration. In the future, it will be interesting to explore feedback loops between ECM properties, including density and stiffness, cell-matrix adhesion, cell behaviour, and low-affinity ECM adhesion mechanisms. A more sophisticated framework covering cell-ECM adhesion might also enable explanation of the experimental observation of thinner strands when ITGB1 is deleted ( [Figure 4](#fig4)). Cancer cell-cell adhesions exert a greater cell-ECM adhesions ( [Figure 8\u2014figure of cancer cell-cell adhesions was most pronounced in simulations with a uniform chemotactic gradient. We propose that this reflects a crucial role of cell-cell adhesions in coordinating a supra-cellular actomyosin cytoskeleton in collectively invading clusters. This is likely to involve coordination of cell polarity complexes at sites of cell-cell contact. Interestingly, loss of cell-cell junctions was not sufficient to promote a clear switch to single cell invasion. This is likely due to the lack of available space in 3D contexts. This observation is consistent with CDH1-deficient tumours, such as invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast and some gastric cancers, typically showing thin strand-like patterns of invasion. Intriguingly, we observed transitions to single cell behaviour upon combined manipulation of CTNNA1 and MMP14 - either over-expression or knockout. The reasons for this are not immediately apparent, but the MMP14 knockout phenotype and the increase in single cell migration when ITGB1 and ITGB3 are depleted are consistent with protease- and amoeboid cell migration 2013](#bib66); [Wolf et al., 2003](#bib72)). Our modelling framework is not set up to consider amoeboid migration; hence, the transitions to single cell migration are not efficiently predicted. In future work, it will be interesting to integrate modelling frameworks for collective and amoeboid forms of migration. To conclude, our integrated in silico and experimental approach reveals some of the key determinants of the mode of collective cancer invasion. Broad pushing fronts are associated with high matrix proteolysis and strong cancer cell-cell junctions and a lower dependence on CAFs. Reducing either proteolysis or cancer cell-cell adhesions leads to thinner invasive strands, with cell-matrix adhesions tuning strand tapering. We observe and experimentally demonstrate an unexpected linkage between the mechanisms that promote the widening of invasive strands and ability of cancer cells to grow when surrounded by ECM.

Frozen sections were stained as described previously ( et al., 2011](#bib35) [Calvo et al., 2013](#bib10)). Patient-derived SCC tissues were chopped into small pieces (roughly 1 mm3) and embedded in Collagen I/ Matrigel. Time-lapse images were taken by microscope every 10 min. Spheroid invasion assay [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap76520?item=s4-1-5) A431 and CAF cells were detached from the cell culture dishes with trypsin and re-suspended in sterile 0.25% methylcellulose solution in DMEM. The cellulose solution contained a 1:1 ratio of A431 and CAF cells at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/ml. Twenty microlitre droplets were plated onto the underside of a 10-cm culture dish and allowed to form spheroids in a 37\u00b0C incubator overnight (hanging drop method). The spheroids were then embedded in a collagen I/Matrigel gel mix at a concentration of approximately 4 mg/ml collagen I and 2 mg/ml Matrigel (BD Bioscience) glass-bottomed cell culture plates on a 37\u00b0C hot block. The gel was incubated for at least 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The gel was covered with DMEM media containing 10% FCS. Sixty hours later, the spheroids embedded in the gel were washed with PBS and then fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde. The spheroids were then imaged with an inverted at a magnification of \u00d710, \u00d720, and \u00d763.

After the gel had been left to set at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr, mixture of 5 \u00d7 105 A431 cells and 5 \u00d7 105 vulval CAFs (VCAFs) were plated on the top in complete medium. Twenty-four hours later, the gel was then mounted on a metal bridge and fed from underneath with complete medium (changed daily). After 6 days, the cultures were fixed with 4% PFA plus 0.25% glutaraldehyde in PBS and imaged at magnification of \u00d710 and \u00d720. Z-stack images spanning 100-150 m were collected, and image stacks were processed by ZEN software to yield maximum-intensity projections. For organotypic killing assay, the gels containing 5 \u00d7 105 VCAFs were set without cancer cells and incubated for 5 days in complete media. Then the gels were incubated with the media with puromycin (5 \u00b5g ml-1) for 48 hr to kill the fibroblasts and then washed three times with complete media (30 min per wash). 5 \u00d7 105 cancer cells were then plated on top, and the assays proceeded as usual. For quantification of the images, strand length and width were measured using Fiji software.

Immunostaining [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap76520?item=s4-1-11) Cells were fixed 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilised in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were blocked in 1% BSA for 1 hr before incubation with primary antibodies 3 at 4\u00b0C overnight. After incubation, the appropriate fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr, cells were washed with PBS. Images were acquired with an inverted Zeiss LSM780 at a magnification of \u00d720 and \u00d763. For quantification of the pMLC staining, regions of interest were drawn around equal numbers of 'free boundary zones' of A431 cells in clusters and cell-cell contact zones, and the mean fluorescent intensity was measured. The values were then normalised to the mean of all the boundary and contact zones for WT A431 cells. Staining of frozen human tissue sections was performed in a similar manner, except that fixation and permeabilisation times were doubled, and 5% BSA was used as a block. In vivo tumour growth [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap76520?item=s4-1-12) Cells were detached from culture flask and resuspended in 4 mg/ml Matrigel/PBS at a concentration of 2.5 \u00d7 107. Twenty microlitre of cell suspension was injected into ear intradermis of athymic nude mouse using 31 G needle (BD). The tumour size was measured every 3-4 days using caliper until it reached 0.6 mm in diameter. At the end point, mice were sacrificed, and the tumour samples were fixed with 4% PFA overnight and processed by standard methods for haematoxylin and eosin staining. Cervical lymph node was taken out and analysed for metastatic seeding. Computational Cellular Potts model [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap76520?item=s4-2-1) Detailed information on mathematical background and C++ coding implementation for each cellular mechanism within the model can be found in Appendix 1 in [Supplementary file 1](/articles/76520/figures#supp1) and at detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap76520?item=s4-2-2) MATLAB functions quantifying invasion metrics can be found at the GitHub repository listed above. For each simulation outcome of interest (e.g. each combination of parameter values), 10 CC3D simulations were run to generate invasion metrics. All invasion metrics were calculated in MATLAB (version 2019a). Unless stated, all invasion metrics were recorded at day 4. Invading cells are classed as all cells beyond the tumour interface at day 0. Maximum invasion is given by the maximum distance of any invasive SCC centroid to the initial tumour interface. Invasion score is equal to the total number of invasive SCCs multiplied by the mean distance of invasive centroids to the initial tumour interface. For mean number of SCC neighbours, tapering and number of fractured objects in the bulk tumour mass at day 4 are found. The mean number of SCC neighbours is calculated for all cells in the bulk tumour mass that is invading. For these cells, the gradient of line of best fit between the number of neighbours and distance from initial tumour interface is calculated to give the tapering metric. Fractured objects are defined as objects unconnected to the bulk tumour mass and containing at least one SCC. The number of these distinct objects is counted for the fractured object metric. For cell growth, the total number of SCCs versus time is recorded, and an exponential fitted to the resulting curve. For the combination of very large SCC-degradation (eight WT), SCC-SCC adhesion (two WT), the presence of CAFs, spheroids can become hollow and break apart. In such circumstances, there is no bulk tumour mass resulting in a mean number of neighbours of zero for the main tumour mass and a large number of fractured objects. There are four instances of this, and these data have been removed (leaving six simulations for this region of parameter space) prior to PCA analysis and heatmap generation. The track invasion score is taken at day 5. It is calculated by finding all points around a permissive track, beyond the initial tumour boundary where the ECM density is 0.75 or below (initial condition set to 1). These points are then weighted according to their distance from the boundary and then summed. For the spheroid permissive track simulations, both sides of the initial tumour mass are quantified. Track width is calculated as the maximum width of the invading strand. Strands that are either non-invasive or where the entire tumour mass has invaded uniformly do not record track width values. Curvature is quantified on day 7. The leading invasive edge is reduced to two one-dimensional signals in x-z and y-z for mid-points of y and x, respectively. Each one-dimensional signal is then smoothed with a smoothing window of 50 pixels. The LineCurvature2D 2D Line Curvature Central File Exchange. Retrieved 9 November 2021.

For all heatmaps, for each box the x-axis represents the percentiles from 0.5 to 99.5 (left to right) of all 10 simulations for that outcome of interest.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"Interplay of adherens junctions and matrix proteolysis determines the invasive pattern and growth of squamous cell carcinoma\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Johanna Ivaska (Reviewer #1); Jaye C. Gardiner (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: This study addresses several gaps that are evident with regards to cancer cell invasion in tissue. The approaches taken by this group encompassing mathematical modeling and experimental procedures are for the most part rigorous. The study, if some minimal remaining points are to be addressed, is deemed as highly impactful. The central points in need to be addressed are, (i) considering proliferation when interpreting invasion data, (ii) fully demonstrating cell-cell and cell-matrix dependent outcomes, (iii) considering ECM architecture, (iv) adding selected orthogonal approaches, and (v) addressing some predicaments concerning beta1-integrin deficient cells. Regarding the last listed point, in order to reach an assertive conclusion about beta1-integrin function and avoid the potential avb3-integrin compensation that is evident in beta1-null cells, beta1 loss needs to be rescued with WT vs the b1-integrin tryptophan mutant (doi: 10.1074/jbc.M300879200). Further, compensating experiments using specific integrin inhibitors and activator drugs (e.g. antibodies) might be of assistance to support the authors' interpretations. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): This is a very interesting study addressing many aspects of the complicated regulation of cancer invasion in tissue. I am not an expert in computational modelling so I will focus my recommendation primarily on experimental validation. 1) The authors investigate many different parameters in their computational model. However, it seems that proliferation is not considered in the models. In particular, the organotypic assay is rather long (6 days) and strongly altered proliferation would be expected perhaps to influence the modeling outcome. 2) The authors conclude that proliferation is playing a key role in their system, however, proliferation is analysed with a methodology that is not matching with the invasion systems. It would be important to score cell proliferation in detail in the organotypic (for example by including Ki67 staining) and in the spheroid models. Where are the proliferating cells? Does the spatial distribution of the proliferation explain some of the patterns observed? Can this be modelled? On a related note, the fibroblasts employed in the organotypic assays are likely to secrete also ECM-tethered growth factors. Is the increased proliferation of the MMP14OE cells linked also to increased availability of stromal growth factors and not only to reduced confinement as suggested by the authors? 3) The authors should provide more detailed evidence on the disruption of the cell-cell adhesions/junctions in their aCatKO cells. Currently, these are lacking. What is the effect on b-catenin signaling. What happens to the cell-cell contacts? In Figure 6a they seem to be rather tightly clustered. 4) The authors have a nice structure in their study by addressing the contribution of different parameters one by one and providing modelling and experimental data to report the outcome. However, it is not clear why only some of the invasion parameters are provided for the experimental data in some cases. For example, in Figure 3 only strand length and width are provided, in Figure 4 only tapering and strand length and so on. For example in 4c it seems that strand width is rather different in the wt and b1KO cells. 5) Details of generating the b1KO cells are missing and there are no data provided validating their KO or addressing if there is compensation by other integrins. It is common in many cells types to have compensatory upregulation of ITGB3 upon b1KO. Similar to my comments related to the aCAT KO, the authors should demonstrate that the B1KO cells have reduced cell adhesion (to the matrixes used in their experimental setups) to validate their conclusion on adhesion strength and invasion. 6) would it be possible to provide quantification of the microscopy from several experiments to support the claims in Figure 6 a-c, which are currently based on representative micrographs or a limited number of cells? Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): For the experiments in Figure 4, a western blot confirming 1 integrin deletion is absent. The 1 integrin knockout invasive phenotypes are not intuitive, particularly the different modes of collective invasion across their two in vitro models and the apparent decrease in cell-cell adhesion (neighbors) in the organotypic model. A greater analysis and discussion of these phenotypes in the context of their proposed model would strengthen the work. The presence of Matrigel and other fibroblast-derived ECM could promote 1-independent cell-ECM adhesion strategies. A general perturbation analogous to deletion of -catenin, such as deletion of talin, would more convincingly abrogate cell-ECM adhesion. In line with the previous comment, there are several references to \"pushing\" or extensile forces driving the invasive growth of large collectives, supporting a diminished role for cell-ECM adhesion. These behaviors should be demonstrated in context, optically with either fiduciary markers (beads) or matrix displacements, to support key driving mechanisms. The case for supracellular actomyosin coordination would be strengthened by quantitative immunostaining within invading collectives with different phenotypes (compared to the small cell islands in 2D/3D? experimental details are not clear in Figure 6). In Figure 7, it is a bit difficult to appreciate from the images, but the authors should discuss how invasion in confined -catenin knockout spheroids can be increased by loss or gain of MMP14 levels. This is at odds with predictions from the Potts model in Figure 7a. In Figure 8b, proliferation should be decoupled from any differences in cell size, morphology, or organization that might affect spheroid morphology by immunostaining and quantifying proliferative markers. The phenotypic results from the xenograft experiments are difficult to interpret and more description should be provided. For instance, are CATKO, MMP14KO tumors invading with a wide front? Given the expected heterogeneity, phenotypes of tumor invasive fronts in Figure 8d should be quantified. A summary schematic that contextualizes core findings and their specificity to each model should be added to aid comprehension. Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors): When commenting on suggestions to increase the impact of the work, I have divided my comments into 3 sections: (1) suggested experiments/analyses, (2) points for consideration, and (3) questions for clarity. I hope the authors find my comments helpful. i. Suggested experiments/analyses As I have no expertise in computational modeling, I cannot fairly provide critiques or suggestions on the methodologies used. As such, all of my commentary is focused on the experimental aspects of this paper. 1. Other parameters that would be interesting to model/test in this system that have been noted to affect invasion elsewhere would be the stiffness of the ECM as well as its alignment. See and Provenzano 2006 (PMID: 17190588). Ahmadzadeh et. al may be of interest to the authors all as it also includes some computational modeling in this topic. 2. It's interesting that both increasing and decreasing MMP14 cell levels affected invasion strand length. This may suggest that some ECM is necessary for invasion while too much can be inhibitory. While the authors largely focused on the effects on invasive strand width, I believe that there is some unique biology to uncover with regards to the strand length that the author's system is well poised to interrogate. Therefore, I believe that modeling matrix alignment and stiffness would be a great addition to this work. 3. There was a remarkable difference between the organotypic vs. spheroid models with regards to the effects of MMP14 manipulation. Later in the text the authors noted and explored the distribution of chemotactic signals as a potential difference. Could another possibility (though not mutually exclusive to the authors' hypothesis) be the placement of the fibroblasts underneath the cancer cells as opposed to intercalated within? Computation modeling would be sufficient for this question or at the very least be an interesting point to add to the discussion. 4. A useful control experiment would be to demonstrate that knockout and overexpression of MMP14 affects the amount of matrix present as expected. Indirect immunofluorescence of the collagen substrate used should be sufficient. This would not change the concept of the paper but further strengthen the authors' arguments. 5. Were the number of invasive strands different between wild type and ITGB1 KO in the organotypic model? From the representative image in Figure 4C it seems like there are more strands in the ITGB1 KO condition. While ITGB1 KO may have had no effect on strand length or tapering, it may have had an effect on other parameters. It would be useful for the authors to either include the graphs as supplementary data or to comment on it in the text. 6. The authors should include details about the ROCK:ER system (including how it was generated, why Tamoxifen (4OHT) was used, etc.) in the methods section. 7. Figure 6a - it would be helpful for the authors to include a nuclei stain (especially for the WT condition, but show it for both), to demonstrate that multiple cells are present but the pMLC is forming a supra-cellular structure as opposed to what's observed in the CTNNA1 KO samples. Would also suggest keeping the CTNNA1 KO nomenclature the same within the body of the figure and figure legend/text. 8. At the beginning of the text (line 161), the authors note fibroblast-matrix adhesions as one of the parameters to be tested but I am unclear of which set of experiments directly address this question. To my understanding, the ITGB1 KO experiments (and all genetic manipulations) were conducted in the A431 SCC cells as opposed to the fibroblasts. I suggest the authors either remove this parameter in the opening text or add text clarifying/specifying which experiments address this goal if the experiments were already performed. ii. Points for consideration 1. Is ITGB1 highly expressed in normal tissue as compared to SCC? That is to say, is the high expression of ITGB1 in SCC biologically relevant to the tumor or the happenstance of a tumor forming in this cell type? 2. Are CAF-SCC heterotypic interactions necessary for migration? 3. Figure 1a box I - Could the broad \"pushing\" invasive masses of cells be a result of cells that break free from an invading strand and then grow separately? 4. While the authors found no consistent association between cancer cell and matrix adhesions (line 263 and figure 4a) could the importance of the matrix (as suggested by their MMP14 manipulation data) come from CAF-matrix adhesions? As the authors noted that invasion was boosted due to fibroblasts (line 210-211; sup. Figure 2f), this connection could have important ramifications on SCC ability to invade. 5. In Figure 6d, were fibroblasts present? It does not seem obvious from the images included. Additionally, though the authors were focusing on the effects of strand width and MMP14, there were also effects in strand length (Figure 3d). How does treatment with the ROCK inhibitor in MMP14 OE cells affect strand length? 6. Discussion of whether the in vitro organotypic or spheroid models better recapitulates what occurs in vivo would be beneficial. iii. Questions for clarity 1. For a point of clarity - is \"matrix displacement\" referring to the alignment of the fibers? If yes, it would be beneficial to discuss this parameter in this context as alignment has been suggested to affect metastases and would help connect the authors' work to the broader literature. If no, it would be helpful for the authors to clarify what \"displacement\" means. 2. For clarity - are 'tapering' and 'strand width' similar measurements? If yes, I would suggest keeping the nomenclature the same between figures (figure 3d vs figure 4d). If no, it would be useful to clarify in the text what the difference in the measurement is and why the authors are focusing on this measurement over the other. Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation. On the whole, the text was very well written and easy to understand. The only section that could use some more clarity would be lines 238 to 241, but this may have been my difficulty with the associated figure as opposed to the text itself. Otherwise, my only other suggestion would be to keep the nomenclature of your cell lines consistent between the text, figure, and figure legend (for example, the -catenin KO cells were described as KO, CATKO, and CTNNA1 KO). [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76520.sa1](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76520.sa1) Author response Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): This is a very interesting study addressing many aspects of the complicated regulation of cancer invasion in tissue. I am not an expert in computational modelling so I will focus my recommendation primarily on experimental validation. We are pleased that the reviewer describes our study as very interesting. 1) The authors investigate many different parameters in their computational model. However, it seems that proliferation is not considered in the models. In particular, the organotypic assay is rather long (6 days) and strongly altered proliferation would be expected perhaps to influence the modeling outcome. The reviewer raises a good point. We have now reduced the proliferation rate by 50% in the model and find that the central findings of proteolysis and adherens junctions favouring wider strands are not altered. The data regarding proteolysis are now presented in Supp. Figure 3e, and the data regarding cancer cell - cancer cell adhesion are presented in [Author response image 1](#sa2fig1). An additional, perhaps unsurprising, nuance to the analysis is that reduced proliferation is predicted to reduce strand width in spheroid assays - effectively, to have many neighbours you need to have cell proliferation. To test these predictions experimentally, we pre-treated cancer cells with mitomycin C to stop proliferation prior to setting up the spheroid assay. Supp. Figure 3h. Gratifyingly, this confirms the prediction that proteolysis increases strand width even when proliferation is absent. It additionally confirms that strands are narrower in the absence of proliferation. 2) The authors conclude that proliferation is playing a key role in their system, however, proliferation is analysed with a methodology that is not matching with the invasion systems. It would be important to score cell proliferation in detail in the organotypic (for example by including Ki67 staining) and in the spheroid models. Where are the proliferating cells? Does the spatial distribution of the proliferation explain some of the patterns observed? Can this be modelled? On a related note, the fibroblasts employed in the organotypic assays are likely to secrete also ECM-tethered growth factors. Is the increased proliferation of the MMP14OE cells linked also to increased availability of stromal growth factors and not only to reduced confinement as suggested by the authors? As mentioned above, the issue of proliferation is important and interesting. We have addressed both computationally and experimentally. As suggested by the reviewer, we have also explored the location of proliferating cells in our model (shown in blue in [Author response image 2](#sa2fig2)). In the example shown, we varied the proteolysis term in cancer cell only spheroids, which has a strong effect on growth (shown in Figure 8). As expected, more proliferating cells are observed when proteolysis is high. Moreover, they are fairly uniformly distributed. We have also performed experimental analysis of the location of proliferating cells. Ki67 staining unexpectedly labelled almost all cells; therefore, we turned to EdU labelling, which provides a more definitive labelling of cells replicating their DNA. This reveals that proliferating cells are observed in both invading and non-invading cells, which is consistent with the modelling. These new data are shown in Supp. Figure 8a. Quantification of proliferating cells in invading strands further supports the association between strand widening. These new data are shown in Supp. Figure 8b. To address the issue of whether proliferation is a cause or consequence of invasive pattern we have performed new experiments using mitomycin to block the proliferation of cancer cells (Supp. Figure 3h). This reveals that proteolysis still influences invasive strand width in the absence of cancer cell proliferation. Crucially, this indicates that differences in proliferation are a consequence of invasive pattern. Given the already extensive scope of the manuscript and its length, we feel that including a thorough consideration of the location of proliferating cells in both the experiments and modelling is beyond the scope of the work, and have prioritised presenting the experimental analysis. Nonetheless, we thank the reviewer for this suggestion and hope that they are suitably re-assured about the consistency between the model and experiments. The question of possible growth factor processing by MMP14 over-expression is very interesting. Our data argue that growth factor processing cannot be the dominant mechanism at play because CTNNA1 KO reduces the effect of MMP14 over-expression when it would not be expected to have any effect of growth factor processing. 3) The authors should provide more detailed evidence on the disruption of the cell-cell adhesions/junctions in their aCatKO cells. Currently, these are lacking. What is the effect on b-catenin signaling. What happens to the cell-cell contacts? In Figure 6a they seem to be rather tightly clustered. We now provide analysis of adherens junctions and -catenin/CTNNB1. CTNNA1 KO leads to a clear loss of -catenin staining at sites of cell-cell contact (Figure 6a), with only small puncta remaining. The reviewer is correct that the cells do retain some tendency to cluster. However, we should also point out that for the images showing the disruption of supra-cellular actomyosin, we deliberately showed CTNNA1 cells that are somewhat clustered, to make that point that even if these cells do contact each other they are unable to coordinate their cytoskeleton. The staining also shows that loss of CTNNA1 does not lead to nuclear accumulation of -catenin (Figure 6a). This argues against a Wnt-driven transcriptional response - presumably because CTNNA1 is not sufficient to promote the other factors required for -catenin to drive transcription, such as inhibition of GSK3-mediated phosphorylation. We also present analysis of Wnt/-catenin target genes and for a known -catenin target gene - Axin2 - from an RNA sequencing experiment comparing WT and CTNNA1 KO cells. This shows little consistent difference in between WT and KO cells, with a roughly equal number of target genes up- and down-regulated and p-value of 0.22. Moreover, AXIN2 mRNA levels are not changed. These data are consistent with the lack of nuclear accumulation observed by in the immunostaining. 4) The authors have a nice structure in their study by addressing the contribution of different parameters one by one and providing modelling and experimental data to report the outcome. However, it is not clear why only some of the invasion parameters are provided for the experimental data in some cases. For example, in Figure 3 only strand length and width are provided, in Figure 4 only tapering and strand length and so on. For example in 4c it seems that strand width is rather different in the wt and b1KO cells. We now provide the additional quantification in Figures 3d, 4d, and 5d. It was not included in the original submission as we were attempting (erroneously) to streamline the presentation for ease of reading. This quantification confirms the reviewer's comment that ITGB1 KO cells have thinner strands. Interestingly, this is not predicted by our model and we do not have a definitive explanation for the result. A more sophisticated handling of cell-ECM interactions in future iterations of the model may address this. For example, we speculate that it might reflect a role for ITGB1 in cancer cell - cancer cell cohesion, possibly mediated by binding to ECM molecules located between cells. We and others have previously observed this in cancer cell models (Vial et al., Cancer Cell 2003 - Figure 4F). We now include a sentence in the discussion relating to the narrower strands in ITGB1 KO cells. 5) Details of generating the b1KO cells are missing and there are no data provided validating their KO or addressing if there is compensation by other integrins. It is common in many cells types to have compensatory upregulation of ITGB3 upon b1KO. Similar to my comments related to the aCAT KO, the authors should demonstrate that the B1KO cells have reduced cell adhesion (to the matrixes used in their experimental setups) to validate their conclusion on adhesion strength and invasion. We apologise for this omission. We now include data showing that ITGB1 KO have a 90% reduction in their ability to bind to collagen I (Supp. Figure 4b). We also show that ITGB3 levels are not affected (Supp. Figure 4d and e). Moreover, combined targeting of ITGB1 and ITGB3 does not reduce invasion (Supp. Figure 4f). 6) would it be possible to provide quantification of the microscopy from several experiments to support the claims in Figure 6 a-c, which are currently based on representative micrographs or a limited number of cells? The reviewer makes a good suggestion - similar to one made by reviewer #2. We have now included quantification of the relative level of pMLC at the edge of the cell cluster vs the sites of cell-cell contact. This provides numeric support for our assertion that loss of CTNNA1 or ectopic ROCK2 activation disrupts the supra-cellular actomyosin network. new analyses are in Supp. Figure 6a. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): For the experiments in Figure 4, a western blot confirming 1 integrin deletion is absent. The 1 integrin knockout invasive phenotypes are not intuitive, particularly the different modes of collective invasion across their two in vitro models and the apparent decrease in cell-cell adhesion (neighbors) in the organotypic model. A greater analysis and discussion of these phenotypes in the context of their proposed model would strengthen the work. The presence of Matrigel and other fibroblast-derived ECM could promote 1-independent cell-ECM adhesion strategies. A general perturbation analogous to deletion of -catenin, such as deletion of talin, would more convincingly abrogate cell-ECM adhesion. The reviewer makes a valid point. We now include data showing that ITGB1 KO have a 90% reduction in their ability to bind to collagen I (Supp. Figure 4c). We also show that ITGB3 levels are not affected. Moreover, combined targeting of ITGB1 and ITGB3 does not reduce invasion (Supp. Figure 4d-f) As suggested by the reviewer, we attempted talin depletion but found that either depletion was not very effective or detrimental to cell viability (data not shown). Given that ITGB1 KO alone reduces cell-ECM adhesion by ~90%, we are confident that combined ITGB1 and ITGB3 targeting will lead to an almost complete block of cell-ECM adhesion in our assays. Interestingly, we note a transition to single cell invasion when ITGB1 and ITGB3 deletion/depletion are combined. This is potentially consistent with the integrin-independence of amoeboid cancer cell migration (now discussed on page 16, lines 525-528). We now also include discussion of the caveat that we cannot exclude integrin-independent adhesion mechanisms. Nonetheless, we would like to re-iterate that the main emphasis and conclusions of this study relate to the interplay of proteolysis and adherens junctions. In line with the previous comment, there are several references to \"pushing\" or extensile forces driving the invasive growth of large collectives, supporting a diminished role for cell-ECM adhesion. These behaviors should be demonstrated in context, optically with either fiduciary markers (beads) or matrix displacements, to support key driving mechanisms. We thank the reviewer for this excellent, and somewhat challenging, suggestion. The measurement of pushing/compressive forces in 3D is not a 'routine' technique. Nonetheless, after some optimisation, we have now imaged the collagen surrounding small clusters of cancer cells with different junctional and protease functionality. These new data are presented in Figure 8. In brief, we observe some compaction of collagen fibres surrounding the clusters of control A431 cells. This is not observed in CTNNA1 KO cells. In addition, MMP14 over-expression also alters the interface between the cell cluster and the collagen fibres. The compaction of collagen is lost when MMP14 expression is elevated and there is additionally a reduction in membrane blebs at the interface - this later point was already visible in the original phase contrast images in Figure 8b. The loss of compaction can be explained by the fact that the collagen is removed via degradation in this context, and not pushing forces. Furthermore, several studies have established that membrane blebbing is a response to compression from the surrounding environment. We therefore interpret the presence of blebbing in the control and CTNNA1 KO to indicate that the clusters are compressed, but that matrix proteolysis can relieve this compression. The case for supracellular actomyosin coordination would be strengthened by quantitative immunostaining within invading collectives with different phenotypes (compared to the small cell islands in 2D/3D? experimental details are not clear in Figure 6). The reviewer makes a good suggestion - similar to one made by reviewer #1. We have now included quantification of the relative level of pMLC at the edge of the cell cluster vs the sites of cell-cell contact. This provides numeric support for our assertion that loss of CTNNA1 or ectopic ROCK2 activation disrupts the supra-cellular actomyosin network. These new analyses are in Supp. Figure 6c. Regarding evidence for the supracellular actomyosin coordination in 3D contexts: we have added staining of human SCC that shows supracellular coordination of MYH9/MHCIIA (Supp. Figure 6d). We have also shown supracellular coordination of MYL9/MLC2 in 3D models of invasion Gaggioli et al., (Nature Cell Biology 2007). In Figure 7, it is a bit difficult to appreciate from the images, but the authors should discuss how invasion in confined -catenin knockout spheroids can be increased by loss or gain of MMP14 levels. This is at odds with predictions from the Potts model in Figure 7a. The reviewer makes an astute point: the model does not predict that CTNNA1 KO will increase the invasion distance when proteolysis is high. We do not have definitive explanation for this, but we believe it relates to the experiments starting to transition to single cell modes of invasion, which the Potts model is not set up for. Two observations support this: (1) we observe single invading cells in the MMP14 o.e. CTNNA1 KO setting (2) the Potts model predicts increased fragmentation in the context of high proteolysis. This is now discussed on page 16, lines 523-531. In Figure 8b, proliferation should be decoupled from any differences in cell size, morphology, or organization that might affect spheroid morphology by immunostaining and quantifying proliferative markers. The reviewer raises an interesting point about the relationship between size, morphology, organisation and proliferation. We respond in several ways. First, the magnitude of the effect of sphere volume by day 8 spans over one order of magnitude, which cannot be explained by some variation in cell size or how the spheres are packed. Second, we now investigate differences in cell size at day 4 of these assays (shown in [Author response image 4](#sa2fig4)), when the differences in sphere volume are small. This confirms that there are no differences in the average cross-sectional area of the cells or their nuclei. As documented in response to reviewer #2 point #2, there are some differences in the organisation of the cluster-matrix interface. However, the presence or absence of blebs that are typically 1-4 microns in size cannot not explain the differences in the volume of spheres that are up to 200 microns across. Lastly, as discussed in response to reviewer #1 point #1 we can exclude changes in proliferation being the cause of differences in invasive pattern through the use of mitomycin C. The phenotypic results from the xenograft experiments are difficult to interpret and more description should be provided. For instance, are CATKO, MMP14KO tumors invading with a wide front? Given the expected heterogeneity, phenotypes of tumor invasive fronts in Figure 8d should be quantified. We agree that quantification will strengthen the manuscript and now provide it in Supp. Figure 9b. These data show that the greatest invasion (as scored by the product of the distance invaded and the number of cells) is associated with high proteolysis - MMP14OE. Moreover, the cells clusters have a low aspect ratio (indicating that they are round). CATKO leads to many fewer invading clusters, with lower invasion scores, and higher aspect ratios. Analysis of MMP14KO tumours was hampered by the rarity of invading cell clusters. Taken together, these data are consistent with the main themes of our study. A summary schematic that contextualizes core findings and their specificity to each model should be added to aid comprehension. We have updated our schematic to improve its comprehensibility - Supp. Figure 9c Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors): When commenting on suggestions to increase the impact of the work, I have divided my comments into 3 sections: (1) suggested experiments/analyses, (2) points for consideration, and (3) questions for clarity. I hope the authors find my comments helpful. i. Suggested experiments/analyses As I have no expertise in computational modeling, I cannot fairly provide critiques or suggestions on the methodologies used. As such, all of my commentary is focused on the experimental aspects of this paper. 1. Other parameters that would be interesting to model/test in this system that have been noted to affect invasion elsewhere would be the stiffness of the ECM as well as its alignment. See and Provenzano 2006 (PMID: 17190588). Ahmadzadeh et. al may be of interest to the authors all as it also includes some computational modeling in this topic. We thank the reviewer for raising these interesting points. In the revised manuscript, we now present analysis of the effect of alignment (Supp. Figure 3d). As implied by the simulations of cancer cells following a narrow track, invasion in the direction of aligned ECM tracks is favoured with matrix aligned with direction of invasion increasing the invasion score and maximum invasion in organotypic simulations compared to chessboard distributed fibres. This is also observed experimentally as shown in [Author response image 5](#sa2fig5). Regarding stiffness: this is not explicitly modelled in our simulations and it is not possible to change the stiffness of our experimental matrices without also changing other factors such as matrix density or crosslinking. Nonetheless, matrix stiffness can be considered in terms of the resistance to the pushing force that cells generate. Thus, we can mimic stiff matrix by reducing the effect/magnitude of the pushing force in the model. This leads to shorter strands and lower overall invasion scores. In the context of the organotypic models, there is a slight increase in tapering (shown in [Author response image 6](#sa2fig6)). Our model lacks signalling or feedback from cell-ECM adhesions, thus it is not well-suited to studying some of the more interesting aspects of the interplay between matrix stiffness and cell behaviours. Although it would be fascinating to implement this, it would be best done using other modelling frameworks, such as, and represent a new project in its own right. This is now discussed on page 15, lines 509-513. 2. It's interesting that both increasing and decreasing MMP14 cell levels affected invasion strand length. This may suggest that some ECM is necessary for invasion while too much can be inhibitory. While the authors largely focused on the effects on invasive strand width, I believe that there is some unique biology to uncover with regards to the strand length that the author's system is well poised to interrogate. Therefore, I believe that modeling matrix alignment and stiffness would be a great addition to this work. We agree with the sentiment of this comment and now included consideration of matrix alignment in Supp. Figure 3d (discussed above). 3. There was a remarkable difference between the organotypic vs. spheroid models with regards to the effects of MMP14 manipulation. Later in the text the authors noted and explored the distribution of chemotactic signals as a potential difference. Could another possibility (though not mutually exclusive to the authors' hypothesis) be the placement of the fibroblasts underneath the cancer cells as opposed to intercalated within? Computation modeling would be sufficient for this question or at the very least be an interesting point to add to the discussion. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now included fibroblasts mixed in with the cancer cells in the organotypic assays in silico. These data are now presented in Supp. Figure 5e. In brief, the requirement for proteolysis and cancer cell - cancer cell adhesion for maximal strand width is still observed if fibroblasts are mixed with the cancer cells. These analyses exclude different fibroblast starting positions being the critical difference between the organotypic and spheroid assays. 4. A useful control experiment would be to demonstrate that knockout and overexpression of MMP14 affects the amount of matrix present as expected. Indirect immunofluorescence of the collagen substrate used should be sufficient. This would not change the concept of the paper but further strengthen the authors' arguments. We agree. We have now included experiments using DQ collagen I, which exhibits increased fluorescence upon cleavage. These are presented in Supp. Figure 3g and confirm that the MMP14 KO and over-expression have the expected consequences on collagen proteolysis. We have also added reflectance imaging of the collagen fibres to Supp. Figure 8. 5. Were the number of invasive strands different between wild type and ITGB1 KO in the organotypic model? From the representative image in Figure 4C it seems like there are more strands in the ITGB1 KO condition. While ITGB1 KO may have had no effect on strand length or tapering, it may have had an effect on other parameters. It would be useful for the authors to either include the graphs as supplementary data or to comment on it in the text. We have now included additional quantification in Figure 4c - specifically strand width. As the reviewer perhaps alludes to, there is a difference in the strand width parameter in the ITGB1KO setting. Interestingly, this is not predicted by our model and we do not have a definitive explanation for the result. 6. The authors should include details about the ROCK:ER system (including how it was generated, why Tamoxifen (4OHT) was used, etc.) in the methods section. We apologise for this omission and have included more information as requested (page 11, lines 355-356). In brief, the regulatory regions of ROCK2 are replaced with the hormone binding domain of the oestrogen receptor. This has the consequence of rendering ROCK2 responsive to oestrogen like compounds, such as 4 hydroxy-tamoxifen. We cite Croft et al., Cancer Research 2004 in which the ROCK:ER system was first characterised. 7. Figure 6a - it would be helpful for the authors to include a nuclei stain (especially for the WT condition, but show it for both), to demonstrate that multiple cells are present but the pMLC is forming a supra-cellular structure as opposed to what's observed in the CTNNA1 KO samples. Would also suggest keeping the CTNNA1 KO nomenclature the same within the body of the figure and figure legend/text. We agree and now include a nuclear staining and have changed the nomenclature to CTNNA1 throughout Figures 5, 6, and 8. 8. At the beginning of the text (line 161), the authors note fibroblast-matrix adhesions as one of the parameters to be tested but I am unclear of which set of experiments directly address this question. To my understanding, the ITGB1 KO experiments (and all genetic manipulations) were conducted in the A431 SCC cells as opposed to the fibroblasts. I suggest the authors either remove this parameter in the opening text or add text clarifying/specifying which experiments address this goal if the experiments were already performed. We apologise for the lack of clarity. Fibroblast-matrix adhesions are included as a necessary feature of the model - fibroblasts bind to the ECM. However, it is not one that we varying computationally or experimentally in this study as our focus in on cancer cell determinants of invasive pattern. In the course of developing the model, we did alter fibroblast-matrix adhesion. If this is reduced, then invasion is reduced, which is consistent with the data for integrin depletion in fibroblasts that we published previously (Gaggioli et al., 2007 and Hooper et al., 2010). ii. Points for consideration 1. Is ITGB1 highly expressed in normal tissue as compared to SCC? That is to say, is the high expression of ITGB1 in SCC biologically relevant to the tumor or the happenstance of a tumor forming in this cell type? In normal mucosal tissue, ITGB1 expression is restricted to the proliferative basal layer of cells. In mucosal SCC it is expressed in the majority of cells and therefore the overall level of expression in cancerous tissue is higher. In addition, the expression in cancer cells is often higher than in the adjacent basal cells in non-transformed tissue. This is documented in Brockbank et al., BJC 2005. We should also point out that ITGB1 expression is higher in stromal fibroblasts. 2. Are CAF-SCC heterotypic interactions necessary for migration? This is a good question. In our computational model, heterotypic interactions are important when cancer cell-matrix adhesion is low, especially in spheroids (shown in [Author response image 7](#sa2fig7)). In experimental analysis, we have previously reported that CAF-SCC interactions are required for the efficient invasion of spheroids (Labernadie et al., 2017). Thus, there is good concordance between experiments and modelling regarding the importance of cancer cell - fibroblast adhesion on invasion. 3. Figure 1a box I - Could the broad \"pushing\" invasive masses of cells be a result of cells that break free from an invading strand and then grow separately? This is a good question and perfectly plausible. Unfortunately, we have no way of determining this in patient tissue as we lack dynamic information. In our model systems, we do not observe single cell invasion followed by proliferation to generate an invading mass. 4. While the authors found no consistent association between cancer cell and matrix adhesions (line 263 and figure 4a) could the importance of the matrix (as suggested by their MMP14 manipulation data) come from CAF-matrix adhesions? As the authors noted that invasion was boosted due to fibroblasts (line 210-211; sup. Figure 2f), this connection could have important ramifications on SCC ability to invade. The reviewer is correct that fibroblast-ECM interaction is important to boost invasion. We have previously reported this in Gaggioli et al., Nature Cell 2007 and Hooper et al., British Journal of Cancer 2010. 5. In Figure 6d, were fibroblasts present? It does not seem obvious from the images included. Additionally, though the authors were focusing on the effects of strand width and MMP14, there were also effects in strand length (Figure 3d). How does treatment with the ROCK inhibitor in MMP14 OE cells affect strand length? The reviewer makes an astute observation. The experiment in Figure 6d is a slight variation on the normal organotypic assay. To avoid treating the fibroblasts with the ROCK inhibitor and therefore confounding the analysis (we previously published that ROCK inhibition prevents fibroblasts from promoting cancer invasion - Gaggioli et al., 2007), we used an experimental set up in which fibroblasts are allowed to remodel the ECM prior to the addition of cancer cells and in the absence of any drugs. The fibroblasts are then removed (using detergent and thoroughly washing), and then cancer cells are added with or without the ROCK inhibitor or 4OHT. Thus, fibroblasts are used to promote the invasion of cancer cells, but are not present at the end of the assay. This explains the lack of magenta signal. We have now edited the text on page 11, lines 363-365 to make this clear. 6. Discussion of whether the in vitro organotypic or spheroid models better recapitulates what occurs in vivo would be beneficial. This is discussed on page 6, lines 147-151 - now highlighted in green text. In brief, our view is that the organotypic assay better mimics the first stages of invasion when the tissue is layer with underlying dermis. The spheroid assay is probably a better recapitulation of the situation when cancer cells have already invaded into the deeper dermis and surrounded by tissue on all sides. iii. Questions for clarity 1. For a point of clarity - is \"matrix displacement\" referring to the alignment of the fibers? If yes, it would be beneficial to discuss this parameter in this context as alignment has been suggested to affect metastases and would help connect the authors' work to the broader literature. If no, it would be helpful for the authors to clarify what \"displacement\" means. Matrix displacement is the transfer of matrix from one voxel to another. For example, if a cancer cell reduces the matrix 'concentration' in a neighbouring voxel and there is a corresponding increase in an adjacent matrix voxel, then this is displacement. If a cancer cell reduces the matrix 'concentration' in a neighbouring voxel and there is no increase in surrounding voxels, then this is degradation. In the case of persistently moving cell, matrix displacement could generate a track lined with high matrix density, which would be similar to alignment, but displacement is not the same as alignment. 2. For clarity - are 'tapering' and 'strand width' similar measurements? If yes, I would suggest keeping the nomenclature the same between figures (figure 3d vs figure 4d). If no, it would be useful to clarify in the text what the difference in the measurement is and why the authors are focusing on this measurement over the other. They are not the same. Strand width is the average width of the strand, whereas tapering captures if the width of the strand reduces as it extends away from the main tumour mass. We have clarified this in the text relating to Supp. Figure 2b on pages 6&7 that describes the metrics we use.

Here, we found that FOXP2 is overexpressed in human prostate cancer cells and prostate tumors, but its expression is absent in normal prostate epithelial cells and low in benign prostatic hyperplasia. FOXP2 is a FOX transcription factor family member and tightly associated with vocal development. To date, little is known regarding the link of FOXP2 to prostate cancer. We observed that high FOXP2 expression and frequent amplification are significantly associated with high Gleason score. Ectopic expression of FOXP2 induces malignant transformation of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human prostate epithelial cell RWPE-1. Conversely, FOXP2 knockdown suppresses the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Transgenic overexpression of FOXP2 in the mouse the FOXP2-induced oncogenic phenotype. CUT&Tag assay identified FOXP2-binding sites located in MET and its associated gene HGF. Additionally, the novel recurrent FOXP2-CPED1 fusion identified in prostate tumors results in high expression of truncated FOXP2, which exhibit a similar capacity for malignant transformation. Together, our data indicate that FOXP2 is involved in tumorigenicity of prostate. "}
