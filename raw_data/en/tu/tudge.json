This cycle begins with menstruation and ends with menopause. Aging is a natural phenomenon that affects all humans, and it is associated with a decrease in the overall function of the organism. In women, aging is related with and starts with menopause. Also, during menopause and postmenopausal period, the risk of various age-related diseases and complaints is higher. For this reason, researchers were pushed to find effective remedies that could promote healthy aging and extended lifespan. Apitherapy is a type of alternative medicine that uses natural products from honeybees, such as honey, propolis, royal jelly, etc. Royal jelly is a natural yellowish-white substance, secreted by both hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of nurse bees, usually used to feed the queen bees and young worker larvae. Over the centuries, this natural product was considered a gold mine for traditional and natural medicine, due to its miraculous effects. Royal jelly has been used for a long time in commercial medical products. It has been demonstrated to possess a wide range of functional properties, such as: antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatative, hypotensive, anticancer, estrogen-like, antihypercholesterolemic, and antioxidant activities. This product is usually used to supplement various diseases such as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, sexual dysfunctions, diabetes or cancer. The main objective of this study is to highlight the effectiveness of royal jelly supplementation in relieving menopause symptoms and aging-related diseases. We also aimed to review the most recent research advances regarding the composition of royal jelly for a better understanding of the effects on human health promotion.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-07-20", "cleaned_text": "Royal Jelly\u2014A Traditional and Natural Remedy for Postmenopausal Symptoms and Aging-Related Pathologies [https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25143291](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25143291) )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-molecules-25-03291)]. Menopausal symptoms usually have a significant negative impact on the overall quality of life and become a psychosocial impairment. The majority of these symptoms are a consequence of estrogen withdrawal or a prolonged estrogen deficiency [ [2](#B2-molecules-25-03291)]. Post-menopausal women are at increased risk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular events, diabetes, mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats) osteoporosis and vaginal atrophy [ [3](#B3-molecules-25-03291)]. Conventionally, these problems are treated with hormonal replacement therapy but the risk of undesirable adverse effects such as breast cancer, abnormal uterine bleeding or breast tenderness sometimes outweighs the benefits, which is why more natural alternatives tend to be used [ [4](#B4-molecules-25-03291), [5](#B5-molecules-25-03291)]. Natural therapies for menopausal-related symptoms and complaints include phytoestrogens, which are natural molecules similar to human estrogens, considered to prevent postmenopausal symptoms. Soybeans and red clover are the most well-known natural alternatives to conventional hormone replacement therapy, but their efficiency is still highly debated [ [6](#B6-molecules-25-03291)]. [7](#B7-molecules-25-03291)]. These products also demonstrated their usefulness for the treatment of postmenopausal complaints. Royal jelly, known as \"superfood\", is a creamy substance secreted by the mandibular and hypopharyngeal glands of nurse bees, used to feed the queen bees throughout their lifetime and worker bees during the stage of larvae [ [8](#B8-molecules-25-03291)]. The consumption of this magical liquid by the queen bees generate many advantages such as their size, which is double in comparison to worker bees, a longer lifespan and a better function of their reproductive system [ [9](#B9-molecules-25-03291)]. In the last years, the production of royal jelly in China considerably increased because beekeepers developed a genetic selection of high-producing royal jelly Italian bees [ [10](#B10-molecules-25-03291)]. China became the largest producer of royal jelly, and nowadays it possesses almost 90% of all world production. Annually, more than 4000 tons of royal jelly are produced and exported from China to the United States or Europe [ [11](#B11-molecules-25-03291), [12](#B12-molecules-25-03291)]. [13](#B13-molecules-25-03291)]. In the last years, royal jelly was reported as a valuable medicinal agent [ [7](#B7-molecules-25-03291), [14](#B14-molecules-25-03291)] for healthy aging and longevity [ [15](#B15-molecules-25-03291)]. [Figure 1](#molecules-25-03291-f001)illustrates the main biological effects of royal jelly. 2. Chemical Composition of Royal Jelly [16](#B16-molecules-25-03291)], and the seasonal conditions of feeding. The water content of royal jelly represents 60-70% from the final composition. Royal jelly is an acid liquid and its pH ranges between 3.6 and 4.2 [ [17](#B17-molecules-25-03291)]. 2.1. Proteins and Peptides [18](#B18-molecules-25-03291)]. MRJPs represent a family of nine major proteins, with molecular weights ranging between 49 and 87 kDa. They are termed MRJP1-MRJP9 and are encoded by nine different genes [ [19](#B19-molecules-25-03291)]. [20](#B20-molecules-25-03291)]. [21](#B21-molecules-25-03291), [22](#B22-molecules-25-03291)]. MRJPs family is not the only proteic compound of royal jelly. It contains in small amounts peptides such as aspimin, royalisine and jelleines (jelleines-I to royalisine and jelleines exert antimicrobial effects and enhance the efficiency of the immune response to common infections. 2.2. Amino Acids [24](#B24-molecules-25-03291)]. The most expressed free amino acid from royal jelly is lysine (62.43 mg/100 g). This is followed by various quantities of cysteine, proline, and aspartic acid. Recent research [ [25](#B25-molecules-25-03291)] showed that long-term dietary supplementation of leucine, isoleucine and valine extracted from royal jelly, enhances the expression of sirtuin 1, mitochondrial biogenesis and reduces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the skeletal muscles and myocardium. In these conditions, royal jelly administration as a dietary supplement can alleviate age-related muscle dysfunctions. 2.3. Sugars [26](#B26-molecules-25-03291)]. The main sugars are glucose and fructose, and together represent almost 90% of the final composition. Depending on the beekeeping foods, botanical origin, season, and bee species, glucose may reach almost 50-70% of the total sugars, while sucrose only accounts for 0.8-3.6%. Other small amounts of as erlose, trehalose, ribose, raffinose, gentiobiose or melibose may be found royal jelly composition [ [27](#B27-molecules-25-03291)]. 2.4. Lipids and Fatty Acids [28](#B28-molecules-25-03291)]. The most common fatty acids from royal jelly are 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10H2DA), sebacic acid (SA) and 10-hydroxydecanoic acid (10-HDA). 10-HDA represents 3,5% of freeze-dried royal jelly composition and it is the most stable compound [ [29](#B29-molecules-25-03291)]. Moreover, it acts like a potent antibacterial agent that protects bee larvae against bacterial infections from the bee hives [ [30](#B30-molecules-25-03291)]. [31](#B31-molecules-25-03291)] reported that several lipidic compounds isolated from royal jelly (trans-2-decenoic acid, 10-hydroxy-trans-2-decenoic acid, 10-HDA, and 24-methylenecholesterol) inhibited the binding of 17-estradiol to ER. However, they exerted no effect on the binding to ER. These findings provide strong evidence concerning the estrogenic effect of royal jelly compounds. 2.5. Other Constituents: Vitamins, Minerals, Acetylcholine, Polyphenols [17](#B17-molecules-25-03291)]. The major minerals are K, Ca, Na, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn, in this descending order. Royal jelly also contains trace elements such as Co, Hb, Ba, W, Cr, Ni, V, Pb, Mo, whose concentrations are highly constant [ [32](#B32-molecules-25-03291)]. [33](#B33-molecules-25-03291), [34](#B34-molecules-25-03291)], which demonstrated its neurogenic effects and its tropism for the central nervous system. It stimulates neurite outgrowth by inducing PC12 cells differentiation into neural cells [ [34](#B34-molecules-25-03291)] and contribute to a normal neuronal development [ [33](#B33-molecules-25-03291)]. Acetylcholine, which is known as a neurotransmitter, can also be found in royal jelly composition (1 mg/g dry weight). Its consumption may prevent the development of neurogenerative dysfunctions, such as Alzheimer's disease [ [35](#B35-molecules-25-03291)]. [36](#B36-molecules-25-03291)]. [Figure 2](#molecules-25-03291-f002)illustrates a schematical representation of the royal jelly composition and the main functional activities of its compounds. 3. Studies of Royal Jelly as a Beneficial Therapeutic Agent for Postmenopausal Symptoms and Aging-Related Diseases [44](#B44-molecules-25-03291)]. [45](#B45-molecules-25-03291)] is used by postmenopausal women for the improvement and treatment of menopause-related complications and aging-related pathologies. The effects of royal jelly during menopause represent an actual subject and many studies were conducted on this topic. Unfortunately, there is only a small amount of human clinical trials and the main majority of the investigations were realized on ovariectomized animal models. 3.1. Estrogen-like Activity [46](#B46-molecules-25-03291)]. Besides, a recent study [ [47](#B47-molecules-25-03291)] showed that royal jelly administration, in conjunction with exogenous progesterone, similarly increased the pregnancy rate and the estrogenic response in Awassi ewes. [48](#B48-molecules-25-03291)]. [45](#B45-molecules-25-03291)]. [49](#B49-molecules-25-03291)]. In addition, during menopause and in the postmenopausal period, royal jelly improves genito-urinary syndrome, which is one of the most common complaints of women during these periods [ [50](#B50-molecules-25-03291)]. [51](#B51-molecules-25-03291)] carried out a study using a cohort of 200 women aged between 45 and 60 years old. Each subject received either capsules of royal jelly (1 g daily) or placebo, during a period of 2 months and the results were compared. The investigators observed that after 8 weeks of royal jelly intake, the menopausal score recorded a significant decrease in comparison with the placebo group. Therefore, royal jelly can alleviate postmenopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, and other menopause-related complaints, but the research results on this topic are still inconsistent. [50](#B50-molecules-25-03291)]. After this period, the vaginal cytology was evaluated among with the quality of life score. The results showed an improvement in the quality of life score of the first group, which received vaginal royal jelly cream. Regarding the vaginal cytology, the Pap smear test showed better results in the group treated with topic estrogens, in comparison with the other two cohorts. [52](#B52-molecules-25-03291)]. After this period, both anxiety score and backache score in royal jelly group were significantly decreased compared to placebo group. Moreover, no side effects were reported during the administration of enzyme-treated royal jelly. 3.2. Anticancer Activity [53](#B53-molecules-25-03291)], up to 50% of cancer patients experience cancer-related fatigue, and the administration of both royal jelly and processed honey can alleviate the symptomatology. They administered 5mL of royal jelly and processed honey twice daily to 26 patients, and compared the results with those obtained by 26 patients, which received only 5 mL of honey, under the same scheme, for one month. The conclusion of this clinical trial was that the supplementation of honey intake with royal jelly is more effective for the amelioration of cancer-related fatigue. [54](#B54-molecules-25-03291)]. In these conditions, BPA is a risk factor for breast cancer in a time-depending and dose-depending manner. Nakaya et al. [ [55](#B55-molecules-25-03291)] reported that royal jelly inhibited the growth-promoting effect of BPA in vitro, using MCF-7 cell lines. In the absence of BPA, royal jelly did not affect cellular proliferation. [56](#B56-molecules-25-03291)]. Shirzad et al. [ [57](#B57-molecules-25-03291)] inoculated tumor cells in 28 male Balb/c mice and after the inoculation, animals orally received various doses of royal jelly (100, 200 or 300 mg/kg). The tumor size was measured every 2 days from the fifth day, and the investigators observed a significant decrease in tumor size. 3.3. Hypocholesterolaemiant Effects [43](#B43-molecules-25-03291)]. MRJP1 interacts with bile acids and enhances the excretion of fecal bile acids. It also induces an increased tendency for fecal excretion of the cholesterol. This major protein of royal jelly also enhances the hepatic cholesterol catabolism. Another hypocholesterolaemiant mechanism of royal jelly consists of the increase of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene expression. This molecule regulates the cholesterol incorporation into the liver. Furthermore, royal jelly decreased gene expression of squalene epoxidase and sterol regulatory element-binding protein in mice, which are the key factors for cholesterol biosynthesis [ [58](#B58-molecules-25-03291)]. [59](#B59-molecules-25-03291)] included 36 postmenopausal individuals in a prospective study and analyzed their circulating cardiovascular risk markers and bone turnover parameters after three months of daily administration of 150 mg royal jelly. No significant changes were recorded in the bone turnover parameters or in the circulating cardiovascular risk markers (protein S, protein C, antithrombin-III and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1). However, significant changes were recorded in terms of the lipid profile. After daily intake of royal jelly, the values of (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) HDL-C increased, while (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) LDL-C and total cholesterol (TC) significantly decreased. Therefore, royal jelly supplementation may offer a valuable alternative method of balancing menopause-related dyslipidemic disorders. [60](#B60-molecules-25-03291)]. A recent meta-analysis [ [61](#B61-molecules-25-03291)] reported that royal jelly reduced TC and increased HDL-C serum levels in studies with a long-term follow-up period. The same study mentioned that TG and LDL-C levels were not significantly improved. 3.4. Anti-Hypertensive Effects [62](#B62-molecules-25-03291)]. [63](#B63-molecules-25-03291)]. Royal jelly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increased NO levels in vivo. Furthermore, royal jelly produced vasodilation in isolated rabbit aorta rings. In addition, royal jelly increased the production of nitric oxide (NO)TC and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in the aortic rings. In conclusion, anti-hypertensive effects of royal jelly are linked by NO production, and vasodilation is secondary to muscarinic receptor agonists action via NO/cGMP pathway. 3.5. Effects on Bone Metabolism [64](#B64-molecules-25-03291)]. Royal jelly is a natural alternative used for the prevention of osteoporosis and for the improvement of bone strength and several studies on this topic were realized using animal models. [65](#B65-molecules-25-03291)]. After this period, it was reported that femur bone mineral density was not significantly improved. However, the femur stiffness was higher in the study group in comparison to the control group, suggesting that royal jelly cannot prevent the apparition of menopause-related osteoporosis, but it can improve the strength of the bone. [66](#B66-molecules-25-03291)] sustained that both enzyme-treated royal jelly and royal jelly may prevent osteoporosis. The explanation consists of the enhancing of intestinal calcium absorption. Hidaka et al. administered 17-estradiol or royal jelly to ovariectomized rats. Their findings showed that royal jelly is almost as effective as hormone replacement therapy in preventing osteoporosis. Furthermore, using a mouse marrow culture model, it was highlighted the inability of royal jelly to inhibit calcium loss induced by the parathyroid hormone and the development of osteoclast-like cells, induced by the same hormone. 3.6. Anti-Aging Effects [67](#B67-molecules-25-03291)]. Proteins and lipids from royal jelly can extend the lifespan of various species, such as honeybees, nematodes, crickets or mice. Xin et al. [ [68](#B68-molecules-25-03291)] reported that MRJPs increased the longevity of Drosophila melanogaster through the promotion of the pathway mediated by the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor. Moreover, royalactin exerted the same effects on Caenorhabditis elegans, by promoting EGF (epidermal growth factor) and growth factor receptor) signaling pathways [ [69](#B69-molecules-25-03291)]. [70](#B70-molecules-25-03291)]. In addition, the physical performance of the treated animals was better in comparison to the control group: makers of muscle stem cells increased and muscular atrophy was lowered [ [70](#B70-molecules-25-03291)]. Furthermore, royal jelly could significantly delay age-related motor functions [ [67](#B67-molecules-25-03291)]. [15](#B15-molecules-25-03291)]. 10-HDA is the primary lipid compound of royal jelly, and it has been shown to increase the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans by dietary restriction signaling and TOR components [ [71](#B71-molecules-25-03291)]. An interesting question is whether the effects of royal jelly observed on animal model organisms can be extended to humans. Despite there is a small number of studies in this field, the results indicated that anti-aging activity of royal jelly and its compounds on human cell lines, supports previous results reported for model organisms. It has been demonstrated that royal jelly and its special lipidic compound 10-HDA can decrease cellular senescence, and can stimulate the production of procollagen type I and transforming growth factor-1 (TGF- 1) [ [72](#B72-molecules-25-03291), [73](#B73-molecules-25-03291)]. Moreover, a recent study [ [74](#B74-molecules-25-03291)] using human fibroblast cells showed that MRJPs induce higher cellular proliferation, longer telomeres and decreased senescence. [75](#B75-molecules-25-03291)]. Royal jelly has been reported as a protective agent against skin aging that acts by enhancing collagen production in ovariectomized rats [ [76](#B76-molecules-25-03291)]. It was reported that after the administration of royal jelly 1% to estrogen-deprived females of Sprague-Dawley rats, the level of procollagen type I protein increased in the skin of the animals. Furthermore, the level of recovered collagen was very close to the normal amounts. In conclusion, royal jelly can be considered a valuable and effective dietary supplement against the natural aging process of the skin in postmenopausal period, but future clinical trials on humans are definitely required. 3.7. Neuroprotective Effects [77](#B77-molecules-25-03291)]. Anxiety, depression, or spatial memory loss are some of the most frequent complaints of postmenopausal women. In order to investigate the effects of royal jelly on neurologic disorders, several studies were conducted on animal models. [78](#B78-molecules-25-03291)]. Furthermore, this natural product stimulates neurite outgrowth, induces the regeneration of hippocampal granule cells, and protects the central nervous system against oxidative injuries [ [33](#B33-molecules-25-03291), [79](#B79-molecules-25-03291)]. [34](#B34-molecules-25-03291)]. Zhang et al. [ [80](#B80-molecules-25-03291)] showed that purified royal jelly peptides might inhibit -amyloid 40 and 42 through the regulation of beta-secretase, being useful in ameliorating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, royal jelly improved the structural image of the brain and behavioral dysfunctions in cholesterol feed rabbits. It actioned through the decrease of body weight, lipid, beta-amyloid and acetyl-cholinesterase levels, associated with the increase of choline acetyltransferase into the brain [ [80](#B80-molecules-25-03291)]. [81](#B81-molecules-25-03291)] showed that Greek royal jelly was able to improve the memory performance in aged Wistar rats. They administered to the animals 50 or 100 mg of royal jelly powder/kg twice daily, by gastric gavage, for 8 weeks. After this period, a significant improvement in the memory performance was observed in rats treated with 50 mg powder/kg in comparison to controls. Another study [ [82](#B82-molecules-25-03291)] evaluated spatial memory and depression-like behaviors in ovariectomized rats after 82 days of royal jelly ingestion. This natural product improved memory performances and depression-like behaviors. Beside, brain weight and myelin galactolipids slightly increased after royal jelly intake, in comparison to hormone replacement therapy. 3.8. Anti-Diabetic Effects [83](#B83-molecules-25-03291)]. [84](#B84-molecules-25-03291)] recently performed a study on obese KK-Ay mice, with type 2 diabetes. 10 mg/kg of royal jelly were administered by oral gavage. Insulin levels, body weight and plasma glucose were analyzed after 4 weeks of daily treatment. The results indicated a partially suppressed body weight associated with decreased glycemia in the study group. However, insulin resistance was not improved. The explanation consists of the suppression of gluconeogenesis by royal jelly, through the decrease of glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA expression. Furthermore, this natural product induced the expression of adiponectin receptor-1, adiponectin, and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase, which suppression of glucose-6-phosphatase, an essential enzyme for gluconeogenesis. Unlike the results obtained by Yoshida et al. [ [84](#B84-molecules-25-03291)], who do not mention the decrease in insulin resistance among the effects of royal jelly, Zamami et al. [ [85](#B85-molecules-25-03291)] suggested that this dietary supplement could be very effective to prevent insulin resistance. After 8 weeks of daily administration in doses of 100 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg, plasmatic levels of TG and insulin significantly decreased, and systolic blood pressure tended to decrease in ovariectomized rats. [86](#B86-molecules-25-03291)]. After six weeks, the urinary levels of urea, creatinine, uric acid, albumin, and histopathological findings of kidneys and liver tissues were significantly improved. Moreover, royal jelly significantly improved the levels of TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, VLDL-C, total cholesterol and ApoA-1 in diabetic the glycemic balance [ [87](#B87-molecules-25-03291)]. [Table 1](#molecules-25-03291-t001)and [Table 2](#molecules-25-03291-t002), we separately summarized the studies conducted on humans and animals/cells cultures in the last 20 years, in order to investigate the efficiency of royal jelly as a remedy for postmenopausal problems and complications. [Figure 3](#molecules-25-03291-f003)is a schematic representation of the royal jelly's beneficial effects in relieving menopause symptoms and aging-related diseases. 4. Side Effects of Royal Jelly [100](#B100-molecules-25-03291)], and these are common with honeybee venom allergens. MRJPs can cause several allergic reactions such as asthma, skin rashes, eczemas, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, hemorrhagic colitis [ [101](#B101-molecules-25-03291)], or even anaphylactic shock and death, in some situations [ [102](#B102-molecules-25-03291)]. A positive diagnosis of royal jelly anaphylaxis is established based on a positive prick test and systemic clinical symptoms. Oral allergy syndrome secondary to royal jelly intake has also been mentioned in the literature [ [103](#B103-molecules-25-03291)]. [104](#B104-molecules-25-03291)] presented the case of an 87-years-old man with long-term warfarin therapy, supplemented with royal jelly capsules. He referred to the hospital for hematuria, and the most probable explanation for his symptoms was a possible interaction between warfarin and royal jelly. For this reason, clinicians should repeatedly inform their patients regarding potential drug interactions with dietary supplements. 5.
