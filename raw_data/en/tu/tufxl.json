About a month before, [we had discussed the issue here on this blog](https://edzardernst.com/2020/12/covid-19-and-the-tyranny-predicted-by-rudolf-steiner-as-early-as-1909/). The GUARDIAN article prompted the following press release, dated 12/1/2021, by the 'International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations' (oddly abbreviated IVAA): IVAA welcomes the [reporting](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/10/ginger-root-and-meteorite-dust-the-steiner-covid-cures-offered-in-germany) by The Observer, a sister paper of The Guardian, on the care of Covid-19 patients in German anthroposophic hospitals, including critically ill patients in the intensive care ward. The article rightly highlights how these treatments are provided in addition to state-of-the-art conventional treatments, how anthroposophic medicine is fully integrated into the German health care system and how anthroposophy \"enjoys a high level of social acceptance and institutional support in German-speaking countries\". The World Health Organization's [Traditional Medicine Strategy](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/92455) has indeed set integration of traditional and complementary medicine into health care systems as one of its strategic goals. While the article is generally biased against anthroposophic medicine and only quotes two known opponents of anthroposophy, it nevertheless provides welcome reporting on integrative medicine that is highly popular with patients in Europe. There are many [peer-reviewed studies](https://medsektion-goetheanum.org/en/research/) on anthroposophic medicine and anthroposophic medications have been in use for decades, showing an [excellent safety profile](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40801-017-0118-5). The Observer's critique that patients should provide consent for such treatments does not hold because the treatments are not experimental, are provided in addition to standard care, based on long clinical experience and in hospitals openly publicizing their integrative medicine approach. As the article reports, German insurance companies pay flat-rate payments for hospital treatment of coronavirus patients; the additional anthroposophic treatments are thus financed out of hospital budgets and are cost-neutral for insurance companies. Unfortunately, and as correctly reported by The Observer, individual supporters of anthroposophic medicine have sided with demonstrations against corona measures; this does in no way reflect the official position of anthroposophic medicine and IVAA member organizations have clearly [distanced](https://www.damid.de/presse/pressmitteilungen/825-diskutieren-ja-aber-nicht-mit-rechtsextremen.html) themselves. END OF PRESS RELEASE One does not need to be a champion in critical thinking to realize that this press release deserves a few comments. - The claim that anthroposophic medicine (AM) is 'fully integrated into the German healthcare system' is misleading. In Germany, AM belongs to the special therapeutic measures ('besondere Therapierichtungen') which indicates almost the opposite of 'fully integrated'. - Similarly, AM is not 'highly accepted' but belongs to the fringe of so-called alternative medicine ( [SCAM](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SCAM-So-Called-Alternative-Medicine-Societas/dp/1845409701/ref=pd_rhf_dp_p_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=449PJJDXNTY60Y418S5J)). There are only very few anthroposophic hospitals in Germany, and most Germans would not even know what AM is. - The press release claims that 'there are many [peer-reviewed studies](https://medsektion-goetheanum.org/en/research/)on anthroposophic medicine'. The link it provides leads to an AM organization's list of references.

The truth is that [there is no good evidence to support AM](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18540325/). - The mention that AM remedies have been used for decades is a fallacy ( [appeal to tradition](https://fallacyinlogic.com/appeal-to-tradition-fallacy-definition-and-examples/#:~:text=The%20appeal%20to%20tradition%20fallacy%20occurs%20when%20someone,is%20necessarily%20the%20right%20way%20of%20doing%20it.)). - Yes, AM remedies are safe - mainly because they, like homeopathic remedies, usually contain no active ingredients. - Patients should provide consent for such treatments to ALL treatments, experimental or not. - Clinicians practicing AM have long been known to hold an [anti-vax attitude which has also caused problems in the past.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22028293/) My conclusion: this press release was written in true anthroposophic style and spirit: ill-informed, in disregard of medical ethics, based on wishful thinking and aimed at misleading the public.
