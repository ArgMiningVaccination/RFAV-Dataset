The exposed surface of the eye is protected from pathogens by the innate immunesystem whose components include defensins, naturally occurring peptides with antimicrobial properties, and the physical barrier formed by the outer epithelial layer of the cornea. The pro- teomic approach has revealed that tear levels of defensins are correlated with the course of heal-ing of an experimental corneal wound. Tears were collected from New Zealand White rabbitsprior to (day 0) and daily for 5 days (days 1-5) following a standard unilateral 6 mm diametercorneal epithelial abrasion. Tear protein profiles obtained from wounded and contra-lateral con-trol eyes were compared using SELDI ProteinChip technology. Peptides and proteins of interestwere purified by RP-HPLC and characterized by nanoESI-MS/MS. Mass spectra of tears on post-wound day 1, revealed 13 peaks whose level decreased and five that increased. During woundhealing the tear protein profile correlated with wound closure. An important finding was that thelevels of rabbit defensins (NP-1 and NP-2), which were elevated after wounding returned to nor-mal levels by the time the corneal abrasion healed. Relative quantification of NP-2 in tear fluid prior to (day 0) and after corneal wounding (days 1- 3) was determined using iTRAQ technology. A corneal wound eliminates the barrier function of innate immunity and puts the cornea at riskfrom microbial attack until the epithelial cells restore the surface barrier. The increased avail-ability of defensins in the tears during healing suggests that these peptides could protect thecornea from microbial attack during a period of increased vulnerability.

Therefore, protection of theintegrity of this transparent tissue is critical for good visionand survival of the organism. Mucosal surfaces are fluidenvironments as represented by the surface of the eye,Correspondence: Roger W. Beuerman, Singapore Eye Research Institute, 11 Third Hospital Avenue, Singapore 168751, Singapore 3195 mouth, and airways which are protected from microbial invasion by mechanisms collectively referred to as innate immunity [1]. The innate immune system is comprised ofboth structural elements such as the barrier provided by anintact surface epithelium which limits pathogen entry andbiochemical components such as the defensins, which havea cellular origin. Defensins, are small cationic peptides, andin the eye they are found in the tears where they can interactand potentially kill environmentally borne pathogens. A cor-neal wound breaches the important structural moiety of theinnate immune system, but upregulation of the biochemicalcomponent, the defensins, may have a protective function at that time [1-3]. Other studies have shown that re-epitheliali- zation of the wound is the first step to restoring the physicalbarrier component of innate immunity as well as the opticalproperties of the cornea and occurs in three phases [2, 3]:(i) the early neurogenic inflammatory phase which is char-acterized by reflex tearing, breakdown of the blood-ocularbarrier, and release of polymorphonuclear leukocytes intothe tears, and attachment sites between epithelial cells andbasement membrane are broken; (ii) cell migration phase:corneal epithelial cells develop filopodia and lamellipodiaand start to migrate across the stromal surface covering thewound area; (iii) cell proliferation phase: activation of limbal stem cells to completely regenerate the epithelial cellularity and organization. After a breach of the epithelial surface, biogenic mole- cules in tear fluid become accessible to the extracellularspace of the cornea. Copious tears are easily accessible foranalysis of changes in peptide levels. Tears are a complexprotein mixture and while changes in some peptides havebeen found, the fate of most of the more than one hundredtear proteins remains unknown during corneal woundhealing. This is important as tear proteins have roles inregulating epithelial migration, proliferation and differ- entiation, cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions, stroma- extracellular matrix production, scar forma-tion, as well as protection against pathogens. Previousstudies have identified some tear proteins that may partici-pate in or mediate the corneal wound-healing cascadementioned above. For example, fibronectin [4], a glycopro-tein present in plasma and the extracellular matrix, has arole in epithelial cell migration and is a temporary substratefor cells migrating on the corneal surface. Other extra-cellular matrix related proteins released in tear fluids suchas MMP-14) [9], also have a suggested role in the wound healing process.Neuropeptides such as substance P (SP) [10,11] and calcito-nin gene-related peptide (CGRP) [12] are important mole-cules for their role in the neurogenic phase of a wound re-sponse, which results in the break-down of the blood-ocularbarrier and access of large numbers of neutrophils into thetears [13]. A number of (EGF) [23] have been found in tears and may modulate wound healing bystimulating epithelial growth, whereas others may triggerepithelial cell apoptosis. Despite recent advances in understanding cellular be- havior during corneal wound healing, much work remains tobe done to identify tear borne cell-signaling componentsactive in the wound-healing cascade. In an earlier study, the mass spectrum of rabbit tears several days after a corneal wound did reveal changes in a peak; however, the peptidecomponents of that peak were not identified [24]. Previouslyit was found that the levels of human defensins were differ-entially changed after a surgical wound of the conjunctiva;however, due to the limitations in access to human tearsamples, precise correlation with the healing process couldnot be made [25]. The rabbit model of corneal wound healingused here allows the wound healing process to be closelymonitored so that the tear proteomics of wound healing canbe easily correlated with healing. This study also shows thatthe upregulation of defensins occurs after a sterile wound to cornea. SELDI-TOF-MS ProteinChip [26, 27] was used to screen for peptides related to the healing process. This technologyutilizes affinity-modified surfaces to retain proteins based ontheir physical or chemical characteristics coupled with directanalysis by TOF-MS. Advantages of SELDI are the through-put and small sample volumes (2-3 mL). Previous work demonstrated that SELDI-TOF-MS ProteinChip technologyis useful for profiling human tear proteins [25, 28-30]. Thissystem has enabled detection of protein biomarkers directlyfrom crude mixtures with minimal preprocessing. However, SELDI only provides mass/charge ratio ( m/z), which makes it difficult to identify specific proteins of interest. In the present study, levels of rabbit defensins were compared from tear protein profiles prior to (day 0) and afteran experimental corneal wound (days 1-5) using SELDI-TOF-MS technology. Proteins/peptides of interest were sub-sequently purified using RP-HPLC and identified with nano-LC-nano-ESI-MS/MS. The quantitative results were inde-pendently verified using differential labeled tag technology(iTRAQ) [31-34]. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals HPLC grade ACN and methanol were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Formic acid, TFA,acetic acid, ammonium bicarbonate, CHCA, DTT andiodoacetamide were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, obtained from Roche et al. Proteomics 2007, 7,3194-3206 chemicals (Indianapolis, IN, USA). Water used in the mobile phase was either HPLC grade purchased from Fisher Scien- tific or Milli-Q grade (Millipore, MA, USA). 2.2 Experimental corneal wound All animals were treated in accordance with the ARVO State- ment for the use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Re-search. Tears from New Zealand White rabbits (2 kg, female,n= 16) were used for SELDI, HPLC purification, and protein identification experiments. An additional group of three rab-bits was used for the iTRAQ experiment. The corneal wound(right eye only) was made as in a previous study by lightlyimpressing a 6 mm diameter trephine onto the corneal sur-face followed by removal of the epithelium with a spatulawithin the demarcated area to the level of the basal lamina [35]. The area of the wound was visualized by application of an innocuous disclosing dye, fluorescein, which is used in theophthalmology clinic for wound disclosure on the ocular sur-face, in conjunction with a slit-lamp equipped with a cobalt-blue filter in the optical path for visualizing the stimulatedlight [35]. Measurements of the residual wound area weremade over the time course of re-epithelialization [35]. 2.3 Tear collection Tears were collected from the inferior cul-de-sac using fire- polished 10 mL calibrated glass microcapillary tubes with care taken to avoid touching the ocular surface. Tears werecollected 1 day prior to the wounding procedure (day 0) and at every day after wounding for 5 days (days 1-5) from both eyes (typically left eyes used as a control group and right eyesused as an experimental group). After collection, tear sam-ples were immediately spun at 8000 rpm to remove cells andfrozen at 2807C until analysis. Biosystems were used in this study. Foranalysis the RP surfaces of the ProteinChip arrays were pre-treated with 30% ACN for 5 min. For detection, 2 mL of rabbit tears was applied onto each array spot and the array allowedto air dry. Each target was washed three times with 5 mLo f 30% ACN containing 0.1% TFA for RP arrays and three washes of 5 mL of deionized water for normal-phase arrays prior to air drying. An energy absorbing molecule (EAM)-saturated CHCA dissolved in 50% ACN containing 0.5% TFAwas added (0.8 mL, 26) and allowed to dry. All ProteinChip Arrays were analyzed in a ProteinChip Reader (PBS-II,Ciphergen) according to an automatic data collection protocolwith the following setting for the acquisition of data: highmass 200 kDa; digitizer rate 250 MHz; laser intensity 215,245; sensitivity 10. The instrument was operated in positiveion mode with a source and detector voltage of 1.8 kV . Eachspectrum was an average of at least 60 laser shots and exter-nally calibrated with a mixture of seven known interpretation was analyzed by the use ofthe ProteinChip Software (version 3.0). 2.5 RP-HPLC purification A Waters 2695 HPLC (Waters Associates, Milford, MA, USA) was used with an auto-sampler and photodiode array detec-tor. The analytical column was a Delta PAK C18 (5 mm parti- cle size, 300 \u00c5 pore size, 150 mm 63.9 mm, Waters Associ- ates). Gradient elution started at a B (elution buffer TFA 0.1% acetic acid in ACN). The proportion of elution buffer B was increased lin-early from 20 to 30% in 10 min, from 30 to 50% in 60 min,from 50 to 90% in 10 min, and from 90 to 98% in 20 min.The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min. 2.6 Tryptic digestion The digestion protocol was used according to the methods in a previously published study [25]. Briefly, the collected LCfraction was concentrated to 10 mL, reduced with 200 mM DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with tryp-sin. The resulting solution was concentrated to 10 mLb y freeze-drying for further characterization. 2.7 Protein identification by nano-LC-nano- ESI-MS/MS The peptides were analyzed using TOF-MS and microcapillary LC column was self-packed using PicoFrit(New Objectives, Woburn, MA). This column had an inte-grated spray tip which was directly coupled with the nano-spray interface (Protana, Odense, Denmark) into ABI's Q-TOF mass spectrometer. was LunaC18, 3 mM, 100 \u00c5 (Phenomenex Torrance, CA). Samples were loaded onto a trapping cartridge (C18, 0.3 mm 65 mm, ACN/water (2:98 20 to 95% over34 min at flow rate of ,300 nL/min was used to analyze the tryptic digests. Data was acquired using information-de-pendent acquisition pre-extracted from the NCBI nonredundant (National Center for Biotechnology Information) proteindatabase and used for protein ID searching using MASCOTsoftware (Matrix Science, UK). The mass tolerances were60.30 Da for parent ions (MS) and 60.15 Da for fragment ions (MS/MS). Variable modifications of carbamidomethyla-tion of cysteine and oxidation methionine, together with amaximum of one missed tryptic site were used. 2.8 Peptide quantitation with iTRAQ Aliquots (5 mL) of rabbit tears taken prior to day 0 and after corneal wounding at days 1-3 were reduced, cysteinesblocked (using methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS)) as described in the iTRAQ protocol(Applied Biosystems). Tear samples taken prior to cornealwounding were labeled with iTRAQ reagent 114 and tearsamples from post-wounding days 1-3 were labeled withiTRAQ reagents 115, 116, and 117, respectively. These foursamples were then combined and analyzed by 2-D nano-LC-nano-ESI-MS/MS. 2-D nano-LC coupled with nano-ESI-MS/ MS was used for the analysis. The first dimension was a SCX column (300 mMi d610 cm porosity 10 S SCX, DIONEX, LC Packings) with ten steps of salt plug (20 mL injection) elu- tions (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 mMammonium acetate) all at a flow rate of 30 mL/min and using a loading solvent of 0.1% formic acid/ACN (95:5 v/v). Thesecond dimension of the RP separation was the same as thatdescribed above, but with an 85 min elution time. Parame-ters for the nanospray and other instrumentation were set asfollows: ionspray voltage (IS) = 2200 V, curtain gas(CUR) = 20, declustering potential (DP) = 60 V, focusingpotential (FP) = 265 V, collision gas setting (CAD) = 5 for nitrogen gas, DP2 = 15. All data were acquired using IDA mode with Analyst QS software (Applied Biosystems). ForTOF-MS survey scan parameters: 1 s TOF-MS survery scanin the mass range of 300-1200 Da followed by two production scans of 3 s each in the mass range of 100-1500 Da. The\"enhance all\" function was used in the IDA experiments.Switching criteria were set to ions greater than m/z= 350 and smaller than m/z= 1200 with charge state of 2-4 and an abundance threshold of .20 counts/s. Former target ions were excluded for 60 s. IDA collision energy (CE) parameterscript was used for automatically controlling the CE. 2.9 iTRAQ data analysis Data analysis for the iTRAQ experiments was performed using ProQUANT 1.1 software, together with ProGroupViewer 1.0 (Applied Biosystems) and searched against NCBIprotein database. The mass tolerance settings for peptideidentification in ProQUANT searches were 0.15 Da for MSand 0.15 Da for MS/MS, respectively. The cut off for theconfidence settings was at 75.For the quantitative results, Pro Group reports ratios ( e.g., 115/114) and error factors (EF). The EF expresses the 95% uncertainty range for a reported ratio. The true protein ratiois expected to be found between the (reported ratio)/(EF) andthe (reported ratio) 6(EF) 95% of the time. To obtain an average of ratios for a particular protein from three sets ofiTRAQ data, we used a weighted average calculation using1/log EF as the weight. First, we converted the ratios to logspace [log (ratio)], converted the EFs to log EFs and used theinverse of the EF as the weight. The weighted average in logspace was calculated using the following formula: Weighted average (log space) = Sum [log(ratio) 6 weight]/Sum (weight), where weight = 1/log EF. The weighted average of the ratios were obtained after converting them out of the log space. Weighted SDs werealso calculated to indicate the variation of the observations(see Supporting Information for more detail). 3 Results and discussion Rabbit tear protein profiles prior to (day 0) and after cornealwounding (days 1-5) were mapped using SELDI-TOF-MS.Figure 1 depicts the comparison of SELDI-TOF-MS profilesof rabbit tears over the low mass range ( ,20 000 Da) using NP-20 (hydrophilic surface) and H4 (hydrophobic surface).The tear protein profiles are very similar between these twodifferent chip surfaces. The only noticeable difference in thislow mass region (3000-20 000 Da) is that H4 chip has an Figure 1. Typical SELDI-TOF mass spectra of normal rabbit tears on NP-20 hydrophilic surface and H4 hydrophobic sur- face. Many tear protein/peptide components were detected inthe mass range of 3000-20 000 Da including some major tearproteins such as lipocalin and lipophilin around 16-19 [61, 62], 17.2 kDa peak and 18.8 kDa peak in the SELDImass spectra are most likely rabbit lipophilin CL and form al.

(A-F) A series of SELDI-TOF mass spectra (on NP-20 surface) in the range of 3000-4000 Da show the rabbit tear protein profile prior to day 0 and after corneal wounding (days 1-5). In each figure, the upper mass spectra represent fellow control eyes and lower massspectra correspond to wounded eye. The corneal wound healing process was evaluated by staining the cornea with fluorescein and pho- tographs were taken to document the wound healing process. additional peak cluster around 4 kDa. However, tear protein profiles were quite different among ion exchange surface,hydrophobic, and Cu affinity binding surface [28, 30]. a series of zoom-in SELDI-TOF-MS mass spec-tra (in the mass range of 3000-4000 Da) of rabbit tears fromthe fellow control eye and the experimental eye. Two pep-tides with the molecular sizes of 3850.0 60.4 Da and 3892.260.6 Da were significantly elevated in tears from the experimental eye on days 2-3 after wounding. The tearlevels of these two peptides returned to baseline on post-wounding day 5. Tears from contra-lateral, control eyesshowed no appreciable change in the amounts of these peptides over the 5-day period (Fig. 2A-F, upper trace). Apreliminary database search based on only the molecularweight revealed that the mass weight of these two peptidesare very close to those of two rabbit defensins, NP-1 andNP-2. Both hydrophobic (H4) and hydrophilic (NP-20) chipswere used to profile rabbit tears. The results of a previousstudy from our laboratory showed that hydrophilic NP-20chips were found to have strong binding to defensin mole-cules [25]. This finding is also supported The application of an innocuous dye, fluorescein, which is used clinically to reveal cellular breaks in the structure of the corneal epithelium, revealed the progress of epithelialhealing when viewed and photographed with a slit-lampequipped with a cobalt blue filter. From the fluoresceinstained photos, it was seen that the wound area (6 mm di-ameter) was revealed by fluorescein after the wound wascreated and that the staining area gradually decreased as thecorneal epithelium gradually healed and regained the struc-tural barrier property. Thus, the application of fluoresceindemonstrated the reconstitution of the structural componentof the innate immune system. This barrier is formed by junctional complexes around the outer surface cells of the cornea and is largely responsible for limiting corneal accessof substances and pathogens from the tears. At day 5 afterwounding, healing of the wound by the migrating epithelialcells was essentially complete as evidenced by a lack ofstaining (Fig. 2F). In total 29 peaks were observed in the mass range of 3000-20 000 Da (on NP-20 surface). Changes in tear proteinprofiles following a corneal wound could be categorized intoseveral different patterns (Fig. 3A-D). (A) For peaks atm/z3436.2, 3448.2, 3850.0, 3892.2, and 11 368.4, the levels of these five proteins were elevated after corneal wound (day 1), reached peak values at day 2 or 3 and returned to baseline at day 4 or 5. Proteins with the molecular weight ( m/z) 3850.0 and 3892.2 were the two most obvious changes (alsosee Fig. 2) and were chosen for detailed identification. 329.4, the levels of these 13 proteins were decreasedafter corneal wounding (days 1-3) and returned to baselinevalues by day 4 when wound healing was almost complete.Increased tear secretion and subsequent dilution of sometear proteins could underlie some of the loss in the levels of these peptides, but this would be more likely to occur early after wounding. This represented the most common patternof changes in the tear protein profiles after corneal wound-ing. (C) For peaks at m/z4201.7, 4692.3, 4747.1, 10 206.8, 11 14 647.2, the levels of theseeight proteins fluctuated during wound healing. (D) Forpeaks at m/z4222.2, 17 203.6, 18 829.8, the levels of these three proteins were fairly constant throughout the process.The levels of 15 out of 29 tear proteins returned to baselinewhen corneal wound healing was complete at day 5. To identify peptides which were putatively considered to be rabbit defensins, an LC separation method based on a RP C18 column was developed. In an earlier study of rabbit tearproteins, an RP HPLC with a C4 analytical column was usedto profile the tear proteins [24]. Figure 4 shows an HPLC-UVchromatogram of the rabbit tear protein profile 2 days aftercorneal wounding. Mass spectra from LC-MS chromato-grams suggested a cluster of defensin-related peptides at aretention time at 19.2 min (mass spectra not shown). In order to further characterize the peak as a defensin cluster, we collected the fraction under this peak and injectedit into a nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS to obtain a high resolution TOF-MS mass spectra (Fig. 5). Four possible rabbit defensin peptides were suggested from the those of rabbit defensins, NP-1, NP-2,NP-3B, and NP-5. The differences between experimental dataand theoretical values are around 0.1-0.3 Da (Fig. 5). For confirmation of the protein, the concentrated sample under the peak of Rt = 19.2 min was reduced, alkylated, anddigested by trypsin. The resulting digests were further con- centrated and analyzed by nano-LC-nano-ESI-MS/MS. A unique peptide fragment ion at m/z365.20 (doubly charged ion) was selected by IDA for further fragmentation by MS/MS and the resulting spectrum is seen in Fig. 6A. The MS/MS signals matched y-ions, two b-ions, to form carbamidomethyl-cysteine).A search of the NCBI protein database showed that the onlymatch was with rabbit defensin NP-1. Another peptide frag-ment ion at m/z552.76 (doubly charged ion) was also selected by IDA for further MS/MS fragmentation (Fig. 6B).The MS/MS signals matched seven out of seven y-ions, four b-ions of a peptide fragment, ALC*LPLER modified MMTS, the iTRAQ label added144 Da to the N-terminal residue of the peptide). A MASCOT search against rabbit protein database showed that the rabbitdefensin NP-2 was the only match. The amino acid sequences of NP-1 and NP-2 are very similar (Table 1). The only difference between NP-1 and NP-2 is at residue position 13, where Arg is found for NP-1 andLeu and NP-2. The sequence cover-age for NP-1 and NP-2 was 39 and 45%, respectively (high-lighted in Table 1). The MS/MS spectrum of one unique peptide fragment (GFLC*GSGER, m/z= C* represents cysteine modified MMTS, the iTRAQ label added 144 Da to theN-terminal residue of the peptide) that originated from NP-5 was also observed (Fig. 6C). However, it was not possible toobtain MS/MS signals for NP-3B and this was probably due to either low sensitivity or poor fragmentation. Defensin levels in tear fluid prior to and after corneal wounding were also determined with iTRAQ experiments.iTRAQ technology is a relatively new protein quantificationmethod which allows the analysis of four samples to beobtained simultaneously. The quantification was based onone unique peptide fragment (ALCLPLER), which originatedfrom rabbit NP-2. The relative quantification that can be car-ried out with iTRAQ method is demonstrated in Fig. 6B bycomparison of the peak area of 114 (prior to \u00a92007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH et al.

Those data without error bars are associated with peaks that were only observed in one sample.

For comparison, theexpression level of an abundant tear protein, lipophilin AL isalso reported here (Table 2): 0.87 (115/114 ratio, day 1 afterwounding, weighted average from three rabbit samples,weighted SD: 1.09), 0.93 (116/114 ratio, day 2 after wound-ing, weighted average from three rabbit samples, weightedSD: 1.08), and 1.02 (117/114 ratio, day 3 after wounding,weighted average from three rabbit samples, weighted SD:1.03). These results support previous observations that showed lipophilin tear levels to be statistically unchanged after wounding when compared to the levels prior towounding [24]. The NP-2 levels measured by iTRAQ (Fig. 6B,insert) correlated well with those obtained by SELDI (Fig. 2).We did not report NP-1 levels by iTRAQ here because we didnot detect the unique peptide fragment signal of NP-1(ALC*LPR) in some of the samples, whereas NP-2 signalswere consistently captured in each sample. The reason couldbe that the unique peptide fragment of NP-1 (ALC*LPR) ismore difficult to capture than that of NP-2 (ALC*LPLER). Figure 5.

Although more work is required to validate the concept defensins levels may be a useful peptide to monitor to determine if the corneal barrier function is intact. The experimental corneal wound used in this study has similarity to the refractive surgical procedure, photo-refractive keratectomy, in that the epithelium is removed andmust heal over the denuded corneal surface [53]. Moreover,wound healing in general has common pathways which areactivated upon injury whether it is by accidental trauma orfrom a planned surgery [2]. The normal cornea is an avascular and transparent tis- sue. Following injury, the neurogenic component of the re- sponse is rapidly deployed resulting in the release of PMNs onto the ocular surface where they would have the opportu-nity to release their granules containing defensins into thetears [13]. PMN infiltration onto the ocular surface usuallyoccurs within a few hours following a corneal wound [54, 55].However, considerable numbers of PMNs still can be foundin the stroma even after re-epithelialization is complete [54,56]. In a very recent study of neutrophil emigration in re-sponse to corneal epithelial abrasion in a mouse model by Liet al. [56], they reported that re-epithelialization was typically complete at 24 h but the neutrophil emigration returned to baseline at 48 h. However, the present study found that defensin levels in the tears dropped to baseline level aftercorneal re-epithelialization is complete. It is suggested thatsome of the tear defensins may have been from PMNs in thestroma and after the epithelium covered the stroma the pro-teins no longer had free access to the tears. The barrierfunction of the epithelial cells exclude proteins from entryinto the cornea/stroma from the tears and very likely restrictthe movement of peptides from the stroma into the tears. We observed a similar temporal correlation of the levels of tear defensins and wound healing in our previous study[25] on human a-defensin levels (HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3) after ocular surface surgery; however, due to the con- straints associated with human studies it was not possible to make a tight temporal correlation between healing anddefensin levels in the tears. In that study, the concentrationsof HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3 reached more than ,10mMa t days 2-3 after surgery. By comparing the SELDI signalintensity of rabbit NP-1 and NP-2 after an experimental cor-neal wound with those of human HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3 after an ocular surgery, the amount of rabbit defensins NP-1 and NP-2 could be estimated to be in a similar concentra-tion range ( ,10mM). In this study, the structural component of innate immu- nity was compromised by removing the epithelial barrier function. However, with the breakdown of the physical bar-rier of the cornea, the eye becomes vulnerable to entry andinfections from pathogens. Redundant naturally occurringbiochemical systems attempt to provide protection in thesesituations with the presence of lactoferrin, and lysozyme(one of the most abundant proteins in human tears, but verylow expression in rabbit tear fluids), and with augmentationby defensins. In contrast to NP-2, the expression of rabbitlysozyme in tears increases only transiently after an experi-mental corneal wound [24]. Therefore, after a corneal wound,the introduction of defensins ( i.e., NP-1 and NP-2 in rabbit) on the ocular surface will provide a more robust level of responsiveness of the local innate immune response. Syner-gistic effects with other antibiotic-like peptides and other tearanti-bacterial proteins such as lysozyme has been suggested[57]. Moreover, in addition to their antimicrobial activity,defensins may also promote wound healing by stimulationof cell proliferation and participate in mediating cytokineexpression and chemoattraction of immune cells [44]. Theexact mechanisms of action in these situations is not yetclear. However, a recent study from our lab showed that hu-man defensins HNP-1 and HBD-2 have an important role in the biosynthetic and tissue remodeling responses of con- junctival fibroblasts [58]. It may be beneficial to introducesynthetic defensins [59, 60] during wound healing because asthere is a high risk of infections when the epithelium is stillnot yet completely healed and in fact defensins may be usefulto augment conventional antibiotics, which slow woundhealing. 4 Concluding remarks In this paper, we have shown that rabbit tear protein profileschanged dramatically after corneal wounding. Rabbit neu-trophil defensins NP-1 and NP-2 were upregulated in thetears an experimental cornealwound. The levels of NP-1 and NP-2 in the tears correlatedwith the course of wound closure reaching peak values atdays 2-3 after wounding and returning to normal levelswhen the wound was re-epithelialized. The results of thisstudy and our recent study in humans suggests that upreg-ulation of defensins occurs after a sterile injury of the \u00a92007 Verlag or the broadens the concept of the function of defensins. Defensins could have an important role in pro- tecting the cornea from microbial attack and may also mod-ulate wound healing processes as well. Defensins may alsobe useful to monitor the function of the corneal barrier. Thisstudy also demonstrated that iTRAQ technology can beapplied for quantitative proteomics of the tears in a time-course study. 5 References [1] Hazlett, L. D., Ocul.
