I know that you're super excited to read about poop, but I will try to keep the details less like \"New York Ripper\" and more like \"Justin Bieber's Live Tour\". I know both are pretty nauseating, but one is definitely more gory than the other. (That quip was for for my niece. She better be reading this.) {snickers} - Aid in digestion - Brighten complexion - Relieve gas and bloating - Better sleep - More energy - Detox from pollutants, heavy metals and toxins The ingredients are prickly ash bark, juniper berry, burdock root, slippery elm and uva ursi leaves. You take one pill twice a day. This tea cleans your body of impurities (heavy metals, pollutants, toxins, chemicals, your own excess cellular waste) which you either pee or poop out. It's made of the following 8 herbs: burdock root, sheep sorrel herb, slippery elm, watercress herb, root, kelp, blessed thistle herb, and red clover blossom. (They try to source these as organic, but it is not always possible, but it is non-GMO rated). You take 1 oz of the tea in warm water twice a day before a meal. Store the tea in the fridge after you open it. It lacks preservatives so it's only good for 3 weeks. Do NOT put the tea in the microwave to warm it-- it will destroy the effectiveness of the tea and then you'll be sad that you spent money on something that doesn't work. [The dry mix is my least favorite part of this cleanse, but it actually has to do more with texture than taste. Can you imagine drinking a cup of really thin oatmeal? Yeah, it's pretty much exactly like that.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eL-vKai4OlU/UuVv7_JAnHI/AAAAAAAAJzA/jzkpAaB8TT8/s1600/P1000954.jpg) It consists of organic flax seed, psyllium husks, and oat bran. You take this 3 times a day for a week. There are 4g of fiber per serving (12g/day) which is over half of the daily recommended fiber for a 2000 calorie diet. Since it has so much fiber, it is supposed to help detox and cleanse the bowel while also \"scrubbing\" the intestines free of any gunk that may have deposited to the gut's walls. I'm perfectly aware how gross that sounds, but I did warn you. If you like horror movies then search google images for \"plaque intestines\". Warning: it's gross.

Literally. The crap. Did you see the picture? That stuff. Gross. If you don't drink a lot of water you can get quite sick-- so drink! Plus since you'll be peeing like a race horse (what does that even mean-- do race horses pee more than regular horses?) you need to keep hydrated. Your urine should be pale yellow and if you get any lower back pain/soreness that's your kidneys literally crying out for water. Plus peeing more will help you get rid of the toxins faster! Bonus!! If you need some tips on how to get enough water into your diet you can read this post: [5 Ways to Drink More Water and Why You Should Do It!](http://www.overthrowmartha.com/2014/01/5-ways-to-drink-more-water-and-why-you.html#.UuM39P30AzU) Detox Symptoms If you're cleaning all that bad stuff out of your cells it has to go somewhere, right? If it starts to build up you may have some detox symptoms such as the following: - Headaches - Nausea - Fatigue (Eeoyre) or extreme energy (Tiger) - Body aches - Nasal or sinus congestion - Sore throat - Constipation - Diarrhea - Cold Sores - Skin rashes - Insomnia - Increased or decreased sex drive - Flu-like symptoms Day three: More pee and another gloriously large poo. But now the detox symptoms have begun! I have a slight headache and I'm so tired! My intestinal movements became... well, noticeable. Do you remember that commercial with the lady sleeping on the couch and the Satan baby trying to escape from her pregnant belly? It's kind of like that. Except it's poo. Day four: Ughhh... Don't. Feel. Good. The Satan poop has escaped... twice. Now that the belly has settled down, I'm having a horrible frontal headache with sinus pressure. Detox symptoms-- ugh! Must. Take. Nap. Day five-seven: Headache improved, energy increased slightly, but two pounds-- gone! Pretty sure it's pounds of poop because I pooped THREE times every one of those days, but whatever. My stomach looks smaller. My jeans fit better. Success!! And beyond: Overall, I have felt a slight increase in energy, I'm sleeping better, and I do not feel as bloated (and this is a couple weeks post cleanse). I had no poops for 2 days after I stopped the mega dose of fiber, so you maaayyyy want to taper off the fiber slowly instead of just stopping after day 7. However, my GI system has adapted and I'm happily back to my old routine. I even got complimented on losing weight. :) So You Wanna Clean Your Gut, too?

You don't need increased toxins from unhealthy food sources floating around in your system during the cleanse!

I'd drink lemon water all day, but repeat the clay at night if I felt like I needed it. - Warm water and lemon-- you simply warm 8 oz of water and add the juice of half a lemon. This is amazing for boosting liver function and decreasing inflammation because it's so high in Vitamin C. My aunt and uncle say it helps them sleep better, too and they drink a cup every night before bed. - Clay water-- this is a great heavy metal and toxin cleanse. I use 1 tsp of Redmond dry clay in 8 oz of water (warm or room temp).
