My body rests on a table, and the only thing I can hear is a quiet voice accompanied by a soft melody. I don't feel my hands. The voice guides me through a forest and imagined gardens taking me to the top of a hill. It asks me to visualize a powerful light entering my body, healing it. I feel a tickly sensation in my head and shoulders while the rays of light flow through my body. Relaxed, I open my eyes. My first reiki session has just concluded. Over the past few years, reiki therapies have become a popular alternative to traditional Western medicine for people looking for emotional and physical healing. \"Once you become knowledgeable about reiki and have been exposed to it, you fall in love with it,\" said Martha Meredith, the reiki practitioner who performed my session. Reiki is a Japanese healing practice based on the idea that a person can be cured by balancing his or her body's energy. It is a process in which negative energy - the result of illness and feelings such as anger or hate - becomes positive, resulting in well-being and health. According to reiki philosophy, this is possible by using the master's hands to \"raise the vibratory level of the energy field in and around the physical body where the negative thoughts and feelings are attached,\" according to the Web site reiki.org. \"This causes the negative energy to break apart and fall away. In so doing, reiki clears, straightens and heals the energy pathways, thus allowing the life force to flow in a healthy and natural way.\" \"I refer to reiki as a healing method using universal energy,\" said Meredith, who lives on the State Road 200 corridor and has been a practitioner for the past five years. \"The master is a channel used by the universe to heal.\" Reiki is practiced in sessions that can last up to an hour and a half. During therapy, the reiki master guides the client to a state of relaxation through breath and visualization exercises. Then the therapists' hands move over - but generally do not touch - areas of the body that could be affected by negative energy to help distribute the flow of \"universal energy,\" also called positive energy. Reiki is frequently sought for relief of muscular pain, depression, sadness and anxiety. \"Reiki is a perfect healing energy because it gets to the most affected area,\" said Meredith. \"It is more than a form of physical healing; it is a form of spiritual healing.\" She says she has seen positive results in the majority of her patients. \"Probably one person out of 20 will not see results ... mainly because that individual does not want to change,\" she said. \"Reiki expects you to become available. It's not just saying, 'Yes, I want to heal,' and hope someone else does the job for you.\" Reiki requires the active involvement of the patient. Without it, the therapy will not have a healing effect. Meredith said that some precautions must be taken prior to being exposed to reiki. For example, people with metal implants or peacemakers in their bodies should alert their practitioners because the changes in energy can affect their functions.
