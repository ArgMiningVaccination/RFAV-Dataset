Peroxidase conjugated theimmobilized peroxidase consequently that produced acolour change thatwas measured photometrically; the optical density produced isproportionate totheamount of antibody present. Astandard curve was below 27arbitrary units (AU) were considered negative (not protective against disease) while Rubella titers below 10IU/mL were considered negative. \"\u00b0\"! Titers thatwere not high enough to beconsidered protective against disease orlowenough to be considered notprotective against disease wereclassified asindeterminate. Statistical Analysis Efficacy Infant pain response asdetermined byMBPS during immunization was theprimary end point forthestudy; theVAS andNFCS were used assecondary pain outcome measures. Pain scores were analyzed using the Student's t-test or theMann-Whitney test where appropriate. Patient demographics and duration of crywere compared between thetwo armsof thestudy byChi-square and Student's t-tests where appropriate. The significance level (probability) was set at 0.05 forall tests. 49 Sample size calculation Asample size of48subjects pergroup wascalculated using data from a with5%lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) \"1.this would show a50% difference inpain scores with astandard deviation that was twofold this difference (i.e. effect size of0.5). The standard error protection for type |and type Ilerrors were used: a=0.05 and 8 =0.20. Safety Outcome The secondary outcome for thestudy was determination titer titers considered protective against disease. Antibody titers were examined using theChi-square test. The significance level (probability) was set at0.05. RESULTS The number ofparticipants recruited forthestudy was greater than thatofthe calculated sample due tothehighly invasive nature oftheblood work ahigh attrition ratewas expected fortheantibody portion ofthestudy. One hundred and twenty patients participated inthevaccination portion ofthestudy; 60 participants were also followed upforassessment ofantibody titers. Demographic data arepresented inTable 5.Nosignificant differences were found between thetreatment groups. When previous painful experiences were analyzed with regards togender, itwas foundthat significantly more boysin the amethocaine group had previous painful experiences than girls (p<0.001); no such difference existed intheplacebo group (p=0.089). Nodifference was found between the groups interms and not circumcised (p=0.112) 50 Table5:PatientDemographics51 (70%circumcision) (80%circumcision) Eee Gender Female 0.713 >50%affixed 2 1 <50%affixed 0 0 0%affixed 0 0 Discomfort upon removalofdressing None 30 29 0.611 Slight 17 24 Severe 6 4 n/a 2 2 (%positive) Baseline None 33 9 < 0.001* Mild 25 27 Moderate 4 23 Severe 0 2 Pallor None 43 32 Mild 13 10 0.014* Moderate 3 18 Severe 0 1 Edema None 55 34 Mild 3 7 <0.001* Moderate 1 17 Severe 0 3 7 Withdrew fromtheblood collection partofthestudy 0 2 Losttofollow-up 24 17 59 (dys) Measles Immune 20 22 0.272 NotImmune 3 6 Indeterminate 7 2 Mumps Immune 29 28 0.789 NotImmune 0 1 Indeterminate 1 1 Rubella Immune 30 28 0.551 NotImmune 0 1 Indeterminate 0 1 Geometric mean bytheMBPSisusedasanindicator ofpainreduction, however itshouldbenotedthatthistypeofcalculation isatthe epidermal junction while thevaccine isadministered subcutaneously below this region. Nonetheless measurements of antibody titers were conducted toensure the integrity ofvaccination. The collection ofblood samples formedical and diagnostic purposes can beachallenging and arduous taskin adults and even more soin children; this task becomes moredifficult whenit thatmay beexplained byparental attitudes that reflected reservations regarding having unnecessary blood work done on their healthy infants, despite initially agreeing totheprocedure. Anexploration of thedemographic data between the treatments groups in termsof participants that did and didnothave blood work donedid notreveal any differences among these groups. Inthis study, there were nodifferences between theamethocaine and the placebo groups in termsof theproportion ofsubjects that developed IgG antibody titers that were considered protective against measles, rubella.

Many studies reported thegeometric means of the antibody titers, however, comparisons can only be madewith regards to the rubella titers asthetiters formeasles andmumps were reported indifferent units from study. The geometric meanisastatistical measure that isoften used toreport levels ofantibody titers. The geometric mean isameasure ofcentral tendency uses rather than addition tosummarize data points; itisoften used forhighly skewed data. The geometric mean reported bythevarious studies that measured antibody titers forrubella using the Priorix titers inthis study were compared between the amethocaine and placebo groups, both groups were found todevelop antibody levels considered protective against their respective diseases. Itshould benoted however, that despite thegroup means being large enough to confer protection 69 some ofthe individual participants didhave levels that were below thelevel that wasconsidered protective. The topical application ofamethocaine does toaffect theimmunogenicity ofthe Priorix MMR vaccine. Adverse effects Noadverse effects were reported after topical exposures toamethocaine; however local skin reactions were observed insome participants. Local skin reactions were assessed bythe attending physician after removal ofthestudy cream. Reactions including erythema, pallor andedema were reported more often intheamethocaine group than theplacebo group. The presence of these reactions areconsistent with otherreports from topical amethocaine use.2)9): 85]Erythema isthemost commonly reported local skin reaction; this reaction is transient. Amethocaine has vasodilatory properties that account for the characteristic erythema whenit isused forcutaneous anaesthesia. Pallor and edema reactions that arereported less commonly. The rates atwhich these reactions occur arenotwell documented, however, inour study therates ofthese local skin reactions seem tobehigher would beexpected.

The impact ofmother-child interactions during painful procedures should also beassessed todetermine the impact itmay have oninfant's pain response and howthis information could be further exploited toreduce infant pain. Visual analogue scales are routinely used toassess acute pain due to their ease ofadministration; these scales are routinely completed atthetime of the painful procedure. Determining ifadifference exists between thescores obtained when these scales are completed in real time andwhen they are completed from video recordings oftheprocedure may help determine how to getthe bestutility from these scales. CONCLUSION Childhood vaccinations have allowed once fatal diseases tobecontrolled ofthese diseases. These procedures, however are associated with pain and distress particularly inpediatric populations. latrogenic pain isanimportant phenomenon that must notbe ignored, particularly when safe and effective interventions areavailable to manage it.
