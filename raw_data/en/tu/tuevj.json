Passero, DC and Arnold E. Cianciulli, DC The NCMIC Insurance Company recently underwent a strategic reorganization in its corporate structure. According to Mr. Larry Rister, EVP, \"The corporate diversification was necessary to insure the survival of a company that is 52 years old and was virtually unchanged in structure, goals, objectives, and vision.\" The new structure, according to Mr. Rister, will insure NCMIC's continued growth and provide the proper strategy to permit the necessary adaptability to meet the future demands of the company and the profession it serves. The Executive Committee and governing board of the newly formed NCMIC Group is committed to providing the \"leadership tools\" necessary for the chiropractic profession to truly take an objective, dispassionate look at where chiropractic might be 15 years from now, what will be required to get there, and what trends and changes will be essential for the profession to recognize in order to be prepared. The Executive Committee outlined several fundamental requirements for a proposed study. One prerequisite was to find an independent professional organization that specialized in projects demanding expertise in futures research. We searched for a group possessing a sterling reputation among its peers, a history of diverse clients, exceptional proficiency in health care forecasting, and unassailable credibility. That institution was identified as the Institute for Alternative Futures (IAF). The background of this firm included the right mix of knowledge and intuitive insight. With clients ranging from government to military, from the Fortune 500 to companies not yet on the stock exchange, IAF was the right choice to undertake this project. Two reports would be generated by IAF, one entitled The Future of Chiropractic: Optimizing Health Gains and the second report entitled The Future of Complementary and Alternative Approaches (CAAs) in US Health Care . The reports address questions of where the chiropractic profession will be in the year 2010. A series of meetings was required to insure that the research would be conducted with outstanding attention to detail. The nuances and rich history of chiropractic, coupled with the social and professional controversies surrounding the profession were essential to discuss in order to acquaint IAF with the current issues confronting the profession. The aim was to create a document that could serve as a \"future planning map\" for the collective profession to use in beginning to build and create a \"shared vision\" for tomorrow. Above all, however, the integrity of the research needed to be guaranteed in order to protect the independence and objectivity of the final reports. IAF's high standards demanded tenacious and uncompromising attention to process, program, and methodology. Scrupulous attention to every detail was essential in order to disti nguish these reports from others which may have tangentially opined on the subject of the future of chiropractic without adequately researching the issue. vNCMIC is very pleased with the thoroughness of these reports. They present a set of current facts, and outline scenarios for the future which will ultimately be \"self-directed and self-selected\" by the profession. These reports identify the challenges for the profession in an adroit, clear and concise fashion. They provide action steps that can be used as is, modified, and/or redefined by the profession. The reports attempt to set the stage for questions answerable only by the profession itself: How does chiropractic define its vision? Will the profession attempt to coalesce the many disparate views into one \"shared vision\" for the future? What will the profession do with the blueprints provided by the scenarios in these documents? Will the profession seek the common ground necessary to insure future survival and growth? These \"tools\" for consideration are prepared in a \"scenario\" format designed to help generate a \"shared vision,\" composed of survival mechanisms to carry chiropractic to a prominent position in health care by the year 2010. NCMIC fully recognizes that this document is not the end, but rather the beginning\u2014the start of a process for the chiropractic community to unite behind a single \"shared vision\" which will identify, to those within the profession and those outside the profession, our message. The chiropractic profession needs to define and refine the vision, and ultimately to determine how the vision is achieved. NCMIC has, thus, we hope, been a catalyst in bringing creative ideas, concepts, and optimism for the future to the chiropractic community. These reports are the thoughts and views not of a few selected DCs, but rather of a wonderful blend of past, present, and future thinkers from many professions who have provided a rich, thoughtful beginning for a process which will be never-ending. It is imperative that the chiroprac tic profession remain dynamic, viable, united, hopeful, and futuristic in its decisions for tomorrow. The future direction of the profession will be achieved either by active direct involvement or total default, by complete participation or benign neglect. Only the profession can create its own \"shared vision,\" and NCMIC is proud to have been a part of helping to focus on the future. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I I took the one less traveled by, And that has made the difference The Road Not Taken (Robert Frost) NCMIC is confident the chiropractic profession is ready for the new challenges, which will take this profession from obscurity to dominance, from conflict to coalescence, and from discord to harmony. A \"shared vision\" will be the first step in our journey.

Despite significant opposition over the years by allopa thic or conventional medicine, chiropractic has grown. There are 55,000 chiropractors in the United States today and that figure is expected to nearly double to 103,000 by 2010. Chiropractic is the most widespread of the complementary and alternative approache s (CAAs) to health and medicine used in the United States. What will chiropractic practice be like in 2010? How will chiropractors relate to managed care, primary care and health promotion? What should chiropractors do to provide their Executive Summary The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures EX-2greatest contribution to health gains? Thes e are among the questions that the National Chiropractic Mutual Insuranc e Company (NCMIC) asked the Institute for Alternative Futures (IAF) to explore in this report. To answer these questions, IAF sought the expertise of leading practitioners and experts in health care and chiropractic; conducted focus groups with consumers, chiropractors and health care executives; and made use of IAF's ongoing knowledge bases on the future of health and health care. It is important to keep in mind the relative im portance of medical care in health. Roughly 90% of the variance in premat ure death is related to fact ors other than medical care\u2014 lifestyle, genes and the environment. Health ca re is moving from its focus on medical care to factors affecting this 90%, particula rly lifestyle. This new focus will increasingly favor prevention and treatment approaches, wit h certain core components: nutritional, physical, psychological and spiritual. One reason for the growing interest in CAAs is that they, more often than conventional health care, include or reinforce these components of care. Chiropractic has its own unique co mbination of physical manipulation of the spine, nutrition and other approaches, depending on th e practice style of the individual chiropractor. The potential to \"optimize health gains,\" to make individuals and communities healthier, will requ ire an even broader approach. This report begins (in Chapter 1) by arguing that thinki ng about the future requires certain specific steps in order to be effectiv e, steps we take in this report by exploring trends and forecasts, putting these together into scenarios (alternative stories about what might occur\u2014plausible futures) and cons idering the vision of chiropractic. Chapter 1 also notes that as consumers become more interested in health care and particularly in CAAs, they have many to choose from. In the area of back problems, chiropractic competes not only with more familiar CAAs such as massage and osteopathy, but also with yoga, rolfing, shiatsu, acupuncture and ac upressure. In addition to considering the challenges and opportunities in managed care, chiropractors will need to consider how these CAAs will affect them and how to use CAAs in their practices. Chapters 2 and 3 describe the broader trends in health care, particularly in demographics, evolving paradigms, therapeut ic and preventive advances, the health professions, managed care and the pursuit of wellness beyond conventional health care. Chapter 4 considers trends in chiroprac tic itself, while Chapter 5 presents four divergent scenarios for chiropractic. Chapter 6 provides IAF's reflections on this exploration of the future of health care and chiropractic, in the form of insights and recommendations. HEALTH CARE TRENDS Health care, including the use of chiropracti c and other CAAs, is evolving rapidly thanks to several overarching trends. The Future of Chiropractic Executive Summary Institute for Alternative Futures EX-3 Demographics Racial and cultural diversity, generational and value differences will challenge health care and reinforce the growth of CAAs. Ag ing and its needs will become a major focus of health care. As new generations (particu larly the Baby Boomers) become dominant and then retire, policies that strengthen individual freedoms and responsibilities will become more prominent. These demographic tr ends will favor the growth of self-care, prevention and wellness. It is possible that we can \"compress morbid ity,\" particularly among the elderly, leading to fewer years of disabling disease late r in life. Simultaneously, among the fastest- growing conditions will be those related to \"d iseases of meaning,\" including depression, certain accidents, substance abuse and violence. Evolving Paradigms The mental models that enable us to make s ense of the world are radically changing in multiple arenas including health care. Our interpretations of health and illness, accountability of care provi ders, humans' biological capacit y for self-healing, clinical trials and the very product of health ca re\u2014all are moving beyond current paradigms. We will increasingly \"move upstream\" in heal th care toward addressing major risk factors. A host of visible environmental risks, not the least of which is global warming\u2014 is joined by less visible threats such as the endocrine-disrupt ing pollutants that contribute to a range of health problems, incl uding lower male fertility. Simultaneously, there is a growing recognition that poverty is the greatest risk factor for ill health in the United States. Health care will become creative in dealing with these issues. Chiropractors, individually and as a pr ofession, will be challenged to do the same. Health care is being held more accountable for what it does and does not do. Outcome measures, supported by health data and publicly communicated in state and local report cards on health care providers, are coming into play. The Internet will hasten this trend. As a result, outcomes\u2014the combination of efficacy, cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction\u2014will drive the evolution of therapeutics, both conventional and CAAs. Chiropractic tends to have high satisfacti on among its users and growing evidence of positive and cost-effective treatment outco mes. Chiropractors will be challenged to accelerate their collection of health data to define outcomes. Outcomes themselves are a moving target; in the years ahead we wi ll broaden our outcome measures as we broaden what health means to us as a society. The World Health Organization's vision of \"Health For All\" is likely to become a global standard for judging whether our pursuit of health is meeting larger val ues such as social equity. Conventional clinical trials and the appr oaches we take to identifying the appropriateness of therapies will be fundamentally chal lenged because of their technique of \"massifying\" results into averag e success rates for medi cines or therapies, Executive Summary The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures EX-4rather than seeking cust omized results for specific types of individuals. Likewise, current approaches to clinical testing often disca rd important heali ng opportunities in \"controlling\" their studies. Even more challenging to conventional care will be the multiple scientific paradigm s that accompany CAAs, and the attendant lack of any \"transparadigm science\" t hat might be used to eval uate one approach against another. What will be the science that confirms the existence of the \"innate healing force\" and chiropractic's capacity to posit ively influence health through it? The basic framework of health care is c hanging to the \"Forecast, Prevent and Manage\" paradigm\u2014from treatment that was unmeasured, to t he measurable prevention and optimal treatment of disease over a person' s lifetime. The likelihood of experiencing specific diseases will be forecast for each individual based on gen etic proclivity and current health conditions, allowing early-prevent ion strategies tailored to that individual's biochemistry, learning style and interest level. Genetic knowledge and advanced therapeutics will deal far better with those diseas es that do occur. In addition to this enhanced focus on individual outcomes over a person's life, health care will increasingly focus on population health and the creation of healthy communities. Consumers will increasingly have very effect ive self-care tools (e.g., biomonitors, diagnostic expert agents and personal electr onic health coaches) enabling them to handle most of their health care themselves, in their homes. Therapeutic and Preventive Advances Today's conventional view of health care will see dramatic advances. Cancer and heart disease will be detected far earlier and prevent ed or definitively treated by 2010. This will result from dramatic pharmacologic advan ces, full use of the information revolution and integration of CAAs, including chiropractic, into mainstream health care. Integrated therapies, which synthesize body/mind/spirit approaches with convent ional modalities, such as the work of Dr. Dean Ornish, ar e already showing among the highest outcomes for treating heart disease. These are likely to be used for other diseases. Chiropractors need to understand how manipulation will be int egrated into these, and how, in their own treatment modalities, chiropractors likewise can integrat e other appropriate modalities. We will customize or personalize health care , integrating several approaches based on the unique needs of each person. Genomics will identify what genes and what physical or behavioral characteristics (genotypes and phenotypes) are most relevant for determining how to treat a given condition wit h given modalities. T he customization of approaches and the tailoring (or withholding) of medicines will improve efficacy and reduce side effects. Health care will disco ver how unique each of us is, and learn to address those differences. Ironically, CAAs such as Oriental medicine, homeopathy and Ayurveda have always used customized treat ments, based on the extensive knowledge of individual difference built into their diagnostic and therapeutic systems. Chiropractic will need to consider how these genotypes and phenotypes affect the nature and outcomes of manipulation as well as chiroprac tic's contribution to discovering clinically The Future of Chiropractic Executive Summary Institute for Alternative Futures EX-5 relevant phenotypes. The capacity to fore cast, based particularly on genotypes and phenotypes, will require all health care provider s, including chiropractors, to understand how to provide the appropriate counseling ( genetic and lifestyle) which this knowledge will necessitate. In addition to important learning about behavioral differences from CAAs such as Oriental medicine or Ayurv eda, parallel psychologic al preferences and related tests like the Myers-Briggs Type Indi cator (MBTI) will become clinically relevant. This is an area where conventional medi cine and CAAs will both challenge and learn from each other. Customization will hasten the existi ng trend among insurers and managed care organizations to meet consumer interest by providing access to a wide range of CAAs. It also raises ethical and public policy iss ues regarding how to take advantage of this genomic knowledge without unfairl y discriminating against indi viduals because of their genes or other characteristics. Nanotechnology\u2014the ability to create and move objects at the molecular level, and the resulting nanomedicine\u2014is a wildcard. We could create almost anything with nanotechnology\u2014for example, a backup i mmune system for each person. Although the full potential of nanotechology will still be largel y speculative in 2010, aspects of this powerful technology will be on their way, with important applications in health care. As with the other advances mentioned here, but particularly with nanotechnology, the potential for misuse will also increase dramatically. The Health Professions There is dramatic growth among the comple mentary and alternative health providers. Health care professionals (including many physicians) trained to do acupuncture will swell from 10,000 to 24,000 by 2010. The number of chiropractors will nearly double from 55,000 to 103,000 by 2010. Yet this ex pansion comes at a time when experts are forecasting massive surpluses of conventio nal health care providers (surpluses of 100,000 or more physicians, 200,000 or more nurses and 40,000 pharmacists by 2010). CAA providers could face tremendous incr eased competition from these provider populations, as well as from expert systems that will decentralize health care knowledge to other health professionals and directly to consumers for self-care. Chiropractors have an advantage in that spinal manipulation, particularly the ability to safely and reliably move the spine in the paraphysiological r ange of motion, will be among the last to be \"roboticized.\" However, many conventional health care providers may be trained in and offer spinal manipulation as par t of their range of services. In this environment, all health care professi onals will face significant challenges. The opportunities to function as a healer will expand dramatically. The ability to be financially successful will be more challenging. Outcom e measures applied to local health care providers and appearing in local report cards will be available in most regions by 2010. It is likely that \"winning\" health care prov iders will be those who include CAAs in their practices. Likewise, for certain indicati ons these report cards will steer consumers toward specialists. For example, now so me 40% of those with back problems utilize Executive Summary The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures EX-6chiropractors; to the extent that report cards show them as more helpful for back problems than others, chiropracto rs' share of this niche market will grow. This will be a test of the competitive abilit y of chiropractic to cost-effectively generate positive outcomes. Education and training for the health professi ons will evolve, incorporating greater use of technology and \"virtual learning environment s,\" resulting in faster and more effective individual learning. A critical question is whether the CAA schools, including chiropractic colleges, will \"overshoot\" and produce surpluses, as medical, nursing and pharmacy schools are thought to be doing now. Licensure will evolve. Professi onals will attempt to maintain and protect their turf, but ultimately the boundaries of the professions ar e likely to blur. The right to continue to practice with a license will be based on one's out comes. Even more important, as local marketplaces become \"smarter,\" consumers will regulate the market by rewarding better practitioners. Local \"report cards\" and related mechanism s to rate providers' performance with individual patients will be im portant, as well as the health care providers' contribution to community health gains. Managed Care 2010 Combined, these trends will lead to managed care in 2010 that is far more effective, prevention-oriented and custom ized. It will utilize health care professionals far more effectively. Cures or definit ive prevention will be availabl e for many conditions. There will always be more health care options that could be utilized for most individuals than available resources permit, so by 2010 state or national policies pr obably will identify minimum packages of coverage. As in the st ate of Oregon, the public is likely to take part in determining what is included in thos e minimum packages. Subscribers to various plans that include more than the minimum pa ckage will also take part in determining health service priorities above those minimu ms. Most systems will allow individuals to \"buy up\" to additional uncovered services. There are dramatically differ ent forecasts for managed care by 2010. Most people think of a revolt against the curr ent cost-management mistakes of managed care\u2014returning to something closer to more familiar fee-for-service appr oaches which somehow become more effective. A diffe rent, more likely alternativ e, however, is one of \"self- managed care\" which by 2010 will be a major source of competition for managed care. The same information tools that enable ma naged care to become more effective, prevention-oriented and custom ized will be available to i ndividuals and families; some individuals and families will choose to manage their own care, using only high- deductible catastrophic insurance as backup. Many of these people will also be wise buyers of wellness services. The Future of Chiropractic Executive Summary Institute for Alternative Futures EX-7 Wellness and Chiropractic Consumers seeking prevention and wellnes s often go beyond what medical care or medical coverage provides. They do this now, fo r example, by joining fitness clubs. This sort of \"wellness demand\" now accounts for a significant part of so me CAAs' workloads. For chiropractors, an estimated 14% to 35% of all current visits ar e routine maintenance or wellness visits not related to a specific problem. Forecasting the future demand for wellness visits to chiropractors will be an im portant task for the field. There will be issues of appropriateness of purchase of t hese chiropractic (and other CAA wellness) services. And local report cards are ultimately likely to include these in their ratings. However, the consumer calculus and wi llingness to spend out-of-pocket for these services transcends the appropriate efforts to limit health care services to what is most cost-effective within the budget constraints of insurers or health care systems. CHIROPRACTIC TRENDS In the United States, 55,000 chiropractors see nearly 27 million patients each year for roughly 340 million visits. In terms of supply, an estimated 15% of current chiropractors are underemployed. The supply is forecast to grow to 103,000 by 2010. Demand forecasts range all the way from a 50% decline because of managed care and related factors to a tripling because of greater coverage of ba ck problems (chiropractors annually treat only an estimated 40% of those Americans who experience back problems), expansion of chir opractic treatment for other indications and expansion of the currently estimated 14% to 35% of cu rrent visits to chiropractors devoted to \"wellness\" or preventive care not related to specific complain ts. (Specific demand forecasts are included in the detail for the chiropractic scenarios given in Appendix B.) Positive outcome data for chiropractic in treating low back pain has led the federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Res earch (AHCPR) to endorse chiropractic manipulation in that area. T he efficacy of chiropractic trea tment for other conditions is actively being researched. All chiropracto rs will need to use their practices to systematically gather data in order to track their outcomes. What about the future of effi cacy and utilization for chiropra ctic? For this report we explored certain conditions for which chirop ractic, as well as Oriental medicine and homeopathy, might be used as a primary or as a complem entary approach. There is great diversity in the depth and quality of data available on t he effectiveness of each of these three now, yet each enjoys some level of reliable data supporting efficacy. Based on our interviews and reviews of the current dat a, a preliminary forecast for their use by 2010, for selected major indications, is given in the table below. Executive Summary The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures EX-8 A Speculative Forecast for 2010 for the Use of Chiropractic, Oriental Medicine and Homeopathy for Selected Conditions Selected Condition Chiropractic Oriental Medicine Homeopathy AIDS C C C/P* Alzheimer's C C C Arthritis C/P P C/P* Back Pain/Problems P P/C C Cancer C C Chronic Pain C/P C/P C/P Diabetes C C/P Heart C KEY: P=Primary therapy C=Complementary use *P = Primary therapy in early stages of condition, along with other approaches This table is a speculative forecast, based on our interpretation of information provided by the experts we interviewed and the liter ature we reviewed. This input was not in agreement, and alternative forecasts could be dev eloped. But we are comfortable that it is a plausible forecast, and relevant as a st arting point. By 2010 we will also know much about which subgroups in the popul ation will get the most benef it from each of these, separately or in combination\u2014for exampl e, depending on a person' s stage of disease and their genotype or phenotype. Thus we will be ab le to target for whom chiropractic should be considered primary or complementary. This will include the calculations of relative cost-effectiveness which health care providers, or insure rs, or the consumers themselves (if they are paying out-of-po cket) will need to make about which of the multiple options deemed appropriate should be pursued. Managed Care and Chiropractic \u2014Managed care has already begun to affect chiropractors by reducing their access to pat ients, the scope of se rvices paid for, the number of visits and the amount for those visits where payment is provided. Yet, managed care consumers are increasingly inte rested in CAAs, including chiropractic. Where that occurs, such as in the case of Oxford Health Pl ans, possibilities for chiropractors will grow. Again, outcomes to ju stify treatment are es sential, along with efforts to provide chiropractic equival ents to managed care. As more progressive managed care organizations enter into the marketplace, the amount and scope of services covered, particularly those offered by CAA providers, will also likely increase. A major question for chiropractors and managed care is whether chiropractors should serve as the primary care physicians rat her than simply as back specialists. The Future of Chiropractic Executive Summary Institute for Alternative Futures EX-9 Primary Care and Chiropractic \u2014Some 90% of chiropractors see themselves as primary care providers, yet the public and he alth care executives do not agree. For chiropractors, primary care is associated with serving as the first-c ontact provider, able to treat without being referred to, but with the ability to refer patients on to others. In conventional health care, the definition of prim ary care is evolving to one of integrated care by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of the patient's personal health needs, based on a partnership with the patient and practicing in the context of family and community. The dile mma for the chiropractor is the time- effectiveness of manipulation. A chiropractor/ patient encounter typically takes 5 to 15 minutes after the first encount er, but primary care often involves greater time in diagnosis, treatment, information transfer an d behavioral coaching. Some chiropractors do this, but most focus on manipulation as thei r prime tool. There are other obstacles to chiropractors becoming primary care provider s: public perception of chiropractors as back specialists; negative attitudes towa rd chiropractors among non-users of chiropractic services; philosophic differences within the profession; the rise in non- physicians (particularly nurses, nurse prac titioners and physicians assistants) who are providing primary care; the anti-vaccination position of so me chiropractors; and the influx of specialist physicians who will reprogram their careers to become generalists/primary care providers as demand in their specialty drops. Yet it is possible for chiropractors to adjus t their practices to operate effectively as primary care providers. Information technolog y can make this more feasible, backing up the chiropractor with appropriate information and maximizing the patient's time in the office. But the basic question is one of co mmitment on the part of chiropractors. For those who commit to manage a broader range of patient concerns, enhance their training where necessary and prove their co st-effectiveness in this role, there are opportunities. Health Promotion and Chiropractic \u2014An estimated 14% to 35% of chiropractic visits are for \"wellness,\" or routine maintenance no t related to any specific problem. Some experts feel that these visits represent 25% of most established, successful practices, while others believe it is much higher. In fac t, some chiropractors have built their entire practice around monthly or quarterly maintenanc e or wellness visits, most often paid for out-of-pocket. While the data for such visits is sketchy, their estimated number is impressive. They represent a consumer decision that manipu lation does provide important rebalancing. Beyond the use of manipulation for health pr omotion, chiropract ors are challenged by the rise of health promotion to enlarge their tools for behavioral coaching as well as for community health enhancement. Executive Summary The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures EX-10SCENARIOS FOR CHIROPRACTIC 2010 Health Care Scenarios for the United States \u2014As noted, by 2010 managed care will be providing significant advances in per sonal and community health outcomes. And information systems, therapeutics, policy changes and consumer assertiveness will have led some families to re-appropriate the direction and risk of their health care with \"self-managed care.\" These two forecasts and ot hers intersect to portray four different scenarios for US health care: Business as Usual includes many advances and more expense; Hard Times/Government Leadership leads to very frugal universal coverage with managed care; the Buyer's Market allows more freedom of choice and smarter markets; and in Health Gains and Healing, health systems and providers join with their communities to provide a diverse set of health services with positive results for individuals and communities. (See Chapter 1 for more details.) Chiropractic Scenarios \u2014Given these US health care scenarios and the various trends explored in Chapters 2, 3 and 4, Chapter 5 presents four scena rios for chiropractic in 2010. Briefly, these are: Scenario 1 \u2014More and Better Health Care: Managed care, outcomes and consumers drive health care. Chiropractic care is proven cost-effective for low back pain, headaches, neck pain, arthritis, scoliosis, as thma and repetitive stress injuries, and as supplementary therapy for cancer and other conditions where the disease or treatment involves significant pain. Wal-Mart creates \"the back center\" in it s stores and expands access to low cost chiropractic care. There are 103,000 chiropr actors, with average visits per week holding at about 120, with back conditions representing 50% of visits and wellness another 20%. Undere mployment among chiropractors holds at about 15%. Scenario 2\u2014 Hard Times, Frugal Health Care : Chiropractic is drastically affected by frugal universal coverage through managed care ; outcomes limit manipulation to back problems. And 50% of spinal manipulation in 2010 is delivered by physicians, nurses and other health professionals. Chiropractic co lleges close, as only 68,000 chiropractors are needed in 2010. Many of those still practi cing are forced to sell \"the $10 treatment.\" Wellness and underemployment Scenario 3\u2014 Self-Care Rules: Very effective self-care, including advanced home health systems and universal catastrophic coverage, make health care a buyer's market. Individuals and families can do most of their care very effectively at home, lowering the need for all types of provider s. Surplus providers exceed the 450,000 number forecast in the 1990s by the Pew Co mmission. Health care professionals who provide \"touch\" are in high dem and but competition is fierce. Chiropractors are able to increase demand significantly by ensuring they provide care to 60% of those Americans with back problems (rather than 40% as in the 1990s). Chiropractors also expand the indications they can treat with proven efficacy as well as provide evidence that for many people wellness visits are appropriate. The su ccess of chiropractors leads to 85,000 chiropractors in 2010 (about 20,000 fewer th an anticipated in 1997), but they are doing well. The Future of Chiropractic Executive Summary Institute for Alternative Futures EX-11 Scenario 4\u2014 The Transformation: Chiropractors' clarified and expanded vision for the profession leads them to expand their contri bution to health outcomes for their patients and their communities. Wellness and self-healin g resulting from enabling the body to function effectively (the innate healing force) become much sought-after contributions of chiropractic manipulation\u2014so sought-after that 50% of manipul ation in 2010 is performed by non-chiropractors. Chiropracto rs broaden what they do with and for their patients and their communities. For their pati ents they combine intelligent information systems with high touch and assertive coaching. The wellness emphasis of health care and the success of chiropractors in treatme nt and wellness leads to 108,000 in 2010 with 10% of these chiropractors empl oyed in non-clinical roles and only 6% underemployed. INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Challenges and Opportunities Major challenges face the chiropractic pr ofession\u2014increased co mpetition within the profession; declining dem and from managed care; divisions and a lack of common vision within the profession; and growi ng surpluses among physicians and nurses. Along with these challenges comes an equal se t of opportunities\u2014true recognition of the healing outcomes of chiropractic; demand for regular \"wellness\" visits; capturing the 60% of people with back problems who do not currently receive chiropractic care; developing chiropractic's contribution to health care teams; transforming chiropractors' practices into learning and outcomes resear ch sites; and broadening chiropractors' role in health promotion and CAAs. We began the study with five hypotheses based on IAF's extensive work in this arena. Here are the hypotheses and what we found: \u00be Hypothesis #1\u2014Complementary and Altern ative Approaches (CAAs), including chiropractic, will be integrated into conventio nal medical protocols, displacing some portion of conventional medicine - Yes to both integration and displacement. \u00be Hypothesis #2\u2014Chiropractic and other CAAs will become major tools for health promotion and prevention - Yes, both through wellness visits for manipulation and by chiropractors broadening their focus on lifestyle and community health issues. \u00be Hypothesis #3\u2014Chiropractors and other CAA providers will become recognized as primary care providers and will be funded by the dominant health care systems - Yes to funding by dominant health care systems; potentially chiropractors will be recognized as primary care providers. Executive Summary The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures EX-12\u00be Hypothesis #4\u2014The use of chiropracti c manipulation and other CAAs by conventional providers, \"automated\" pr oviders and consumers themselves will increase - Yes, conventional providers have already begun to use alternative therapies and this will grow, including manipulation; \"automated\" or robotic chiropractic is possible but is not likel y to be as significant as, for example, the use of expert systems to provide homeopathic treatment. \u00be Hypothesis #5\u2014Chiropractors, other CAA providers and conventional health care providers who take a significant role in creating healthy communities will gain a competitive advantage - A qualified yes, hopefully. Conventional health care providers have begun moving in this direction. Some chiropractors have as well, though most stay focu sed on their patients. Our fo recast for growth here is as much a statement of hope as a forecast. Recommendations Aspire: Clarify Chiropractic's Identity and Vision Consider the coherence of chiropractic's vision. The profession has a history of visionaries and of conflicts from inside and outs ide of the field. The field and individual chiropractors need a shared vision of the prof ession, in the contex t of creating optimal health gains. The leading national chiropractic organi zations should cooperate to develop a unified vision for the profession that helps it unite around the highest shared values. This process should touch as many chiropr actors in the United States as possible and be done in association with state and local vision development processes. Determine Chiropractic's Role in Primary Care Organizations should: Help individual chiropractors determine if they are willing to take on the additional challenges of being more broadly responsible fo r the health of more of their patients, including maintaining an effective personal relationship and taking responsibility for lowering preventable morbidity. Fund outcome studies with large enough gr oups to determine the efficacy and cost- effectiveness of chiropractors as primary care providers in comparison with other primary care providers. Accelerate the development and availability of tools that chiropractors can use to deliver effective primary care in the most time-effective ways. \u00be Prepare chiropractors to tr eat the wide range of primary care complaints and to refer effectively as appropriate. For those chiropractors who choose not to pursue primary care, celebrate the fact that many chiropractors will remain neuros keletal specialists providing worthy services, without taking on the broader responsibilities of primary care. The Future of Chiropractic Executive Summary Institute for Alternative Futures EX-13 Engage Managed Care Accelerate the development of outcome me asures to show the cost-effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation for t he traditional indications chir opractors treat as well as for the emerging indications listed in this report. Prepare chiropractors to compete in very cost-constrained settings. Prepare chiropractors to work effectively as members of various types of health care teams. Enhance and operate effectively the chir opractic equivalents of managed care. Encourage patients to dem and chiropractic care from managed care plans; and equip them with the evidence of chiropractic's efficacy. Enhance and document chiropractic's relevance to the Medicare business\u2014as more of Medicare comes under managed care, chir opractic's ability to treat geriatric conditions and manage pain should be promoted. Prepare chiropractors to play a gatekeeper role, effectively managing their patients' access to proven CAAs effectively, for managed care. Take optimum advantage of third-party studi es favorable to chiropractic, such as AHCPR's, for publicity and leverage them into winning managed care coverage. Prepare chiropractors to thrive with emergi ng provider systems, such as retailers who enter the delivery market (\"Wal-Mart Back Center\" type of option). Champion Health Promotion Enable chiropractors to provide health promotion services more easily and cost- effectively. Improve chiropractors' outcomes as health coaches who affect behavior positively. Explore and document the effectiveness of r outine \"wellness visits\" to chiropractors. Accelerate the development of appropria te in-office and in-home tools for patient self-use that automate appropriate parts of the health promotion process. Individual chiropractors and local and stat e chiropractic associations should commit to community health initiatives. Be creative in attacking the largest causes of illness\u2014environmental, social, financial, etc.\u2014 regardless of their im pact on chiropractic demand; and seek out high-leverage situations where appropria te chiropractic treatment can make significant health gains. Be a personal model of health promotion. Provide \"performance enhancement\" and proac tive wellness services and monitor their outcomes. Enable the Chiropractor to Practice More Broadly Encourage the development of softwar e and other tools for choosing among and accessing various CAAs. Enable chiropractors to deal with the information that genomi cs will produce on the proclivity to various diseases, as well as the impacts it is likely to have on Executive Summary The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures EX-14chiropractors' patient base and choice of therapies. Foster appropriate research on the role of genotype and phenotype, from a chiropractic perspective, and the appr opriate chiropractic response. Identify additional customization appr oaches (in addition to genotype, the phenotypes suggested, for example, by homeopathic, Oriental or Ayurvedic medicine) that would affect the rele vance or efficacy of manipulation. Move beyond professional bias in order to accelerate the ability to work with and refer to physicians and other health care providers. Explore the contribution that chiropract ors can make to public health, policymaking and research through roles ot her than as clinicians. Assist individual chiropractors and st udents to provide important contributions beyond clinical services. Monitor: Define, Collect and Share Outcomes Aggressively promote data collection in chiropractic pr actices. Ensure that this data can be used to aggregate information across prac tices, in order to show community and nationwide patterns and to support local report cards on providers. Develop the outcomes that justify chiropractic care fo r indications beyond treatment for lower back pain. Develop the outcomes that ju stify routine wellness visits. Develop the outcomes that enable chiropracto rs to optimize their use of multiple approaches by determining what CAAs or conventional approaches are best used with manipulation. Communicate Work to overcome chiropractic's negativ e image among many consumers and health care executives by focusing on the outcome s that chiropractors can provide and the wide range of individuals who use chiropractors. Develop a communications plan that make s use of both existi ng and emerging media to reach the wider public. Seek out celebrity users of chir opractic to endorse the field. Self-Police the Profession Provide standards of conduct, codes of et hics, mechanisms for hearing complaints against DCs and the capacity to sanction wayward DCs. Develop the ability to identify and constrai n or remove chiropractors who overtreat, have high numbers of adverse reactions or misrepresent themselves and the field. Provide active support for local marketpl ace report cards and other devices whereby outcomes, including consumer satisfac tion, and adverse events are recorded and made available to consum ers and large purchasers. The Future of Chiropractic Executive Summary Institute for Alternative Futures EX-15 Don't Produce Surplus Chiropractors Prevent chiropractic colleges from needlessly overproducing. Provide appropriate research to foreca st potential surplus chiropractors, and to monitor current underemployment and unemployment among chiropractors. Ensure that students are given the tools to forecast demand for their services and the level and nature of health professional competition wh ile in school and beyond. Encourage appropriate non-clinical contri butions and employment of students in training to become DCs. Promote Health Equity Promote greater equity for consumers, in health services and health outcomes. Encourage individual chiropractors to contri bute their services for community health activities. Support policies and local actions that w ould increase access to appropriate health care and efforts, beyond health care , to improve community health. Stimulate Frontiers of R&D Encourage research on chiropractic as used in conjunction with other CAAs. Continually monitor leading-edge resear ch (such as neurosciences, biosensors and nanotechnologies) and assess its im plications for chiropractic. Encourage research on customizat ion by phenotype and genotype and its implications for chiropractic. Investigate research by phenotype gr oupings suggested by CAAs such as homeopathy, Oriental and Ayurvedic medicine. CONCLUSION Success (or failure) for chiropractic is in the hands of chiropractors themselves\u2014 visionaries, leaders in the field and indi vidual practitioners. Chiropractors make important contributions now. The future will enable and require chiropractors to do even better\u2014to generate optimal health gains. The tr ends and scenarios defined in this report outline challenges in the environment for indivi dual chiropractors, as well as choices for the profession itself. IAF has added our in sights and recommendations. It is up to chiropractic to choose its preferred futu re and, while addressing the challenges and opportunities defined in this report, to create chiropractic's preferred future.

The field and its members have survived very difficult times and prospered. In fact, \"chiropractic is now recognized as the prin cipal source of one of the few treatments recommended by national evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of low back pain, spinal manipulation.\" 1 There are now approximately 55,000 chiropractors in the United States serving an estimated 27 million patients. Chiropractors are the third largest group of doctoral level health professionals in America.2 The profession can point proudly to its growing numbers of students, practitioners and patients. Gi ven the number of colleges of chiropractic and the trends in enrollm ent, by 2010 there may be over 100,000 chiropractors in the United States.3 This report argues, however, that the future offers no guarantees that there will be adequate demand for this many chiropractors. In fact, in the midst of today's growth, it is essential that chiropractors thoughtfully and systematically consider the long-te rm future of the profession. Many key questions are considered in this report. What changes will transpire in health care in 2010? What roles might chiroprac tors play? How will chiropractic and its practitioners change? How can chiropractors optimize their contribution to health outcomes or health gains? In exploring thes e questions with chiropractic leaders, with experts in health care and managed care, and with consumers, IAF was guided to significant insights that are the basis for the recommendations made to the chiropractic profession at the end of this report. Chapter 1: Chiropractic, The Future and Health Care The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 1-2 ORIGINS AND PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT This report to the Foundation for Chiroprac tic Education and Research (FCER) and the National Chiropractic Mutual Insurance Com pany (NCMIC) presents an exploration of future opportunities and threats. It looks at specific trends and forecasts as well as broader scenarios. And it provides recommendat ions from the Institute for Alternative Futures (IAF) for the chiropractic profession. IAF produced The Future of Chiropractic: Optimizing Health Gains to help prepare the profession for a successful 21 st century. NCMIC and FCER commissioned IAF to develop a parallel report describing the future of complementary and alternative approaches (CAAs) in US health care. Chapters 2 and 3 of this report contain the same trend information as that CAA report, along with a discussion of implications for chiropractic. The objectives of this report are: to explore the likely futures of health care , including the role of chiropractic, through the year 2010; to explore possible roles for chiropracti c health care and chiropractors in primary care, health promotion and managed care; and to provide insights and recommendations on how chiropractors can optimize their contributions to cost-effective health gains in the 21 st century. FUTURES TOOLS AND THIS REPORT This exploration of the future of chiropr actic and its environment grows out of IAF's 20 years of experience in aiding organizations , communities and professions to be more effective in creating the futures they prefer . To accomplish the report's objectives, IAF focused on four important \"futures tools\": trends, scenarios, vision and strategies . Trends Trends are forces that are apparent in today's environment and will have an impact on the future. It is important to identify and st udy a broad set of trends and speculate on possible results. Further, it is essential to seek out divergent opinions and paradigms, solicit knowledge from experts and begin to organize disparate thoughts about the look and feel of the future. In this report, we will explore trends that are shaping health care (Chapters 2 and 3) and trends within the chiropractic field (Chapter 4). The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 1: Chiropractic, The Future and Health Care Institute for Alternative Futures 1-3Scenarios Futurists start with the premis e that there is no single, ce rtain future. Where trend data and forecasts are available, like those in this report, they are often moving in conflicting directions. Scenarios, or stories, about t he future explore alternative integrated pathways in which a field, such as chir opractic, and its environment might travel. Scenarios bound the uncertainty of the future and provide learning tools that let us examine our assumptions and explore the im plications of different futures. IAF uses an \"archetypal\" approach to scenario development. Typically the first scenario assumes a continuation of the major dim ensions of the present, based on currently visible trends. This is a \"best guess extrapolat ion\" scenario, sometimes called \"business as usual\" \"the official future.\" The se cond scenario explores \"what could go wrong,\" helping readers explore items t hat are often ignored because of the threats they pose. The third and fourth scenarios present challenging sets of forecasts that are \"structurally different\" from the current environment; they are both geared to press the thinking of the user of the scenarios. One or both of these structurally diffe rent scenarios is \"visionary,\" exploring what would emerge if leaders in the field worked effectively to create the \"best that could be.\" Four Futures for US Health Care Using this \"archetypal\" approach, following are brief descriptions of a set of scenarios for US health care in 2010. Scenarios for chiropractic in 2010, also based on IAF's archetypal model and building on the health care and chiropractic trends explored in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 and the scenarios below, will be detailed in Chapter 5 (and were briefly highlighted in the Executive Summary). Note: italicized text is written from t he point of view of an observer in 2010. Scenario 1\u2014Business as Usual: National health care reform was sent back to the states, resulting in great diversit y. Expensive technology and therapeutics, including function-enhancing bionics, help pus h health care's share of the gross national product to 17% by 2005. Health ca re providers shift to forecasting and then managing illness far earlier and more successfully. Poverty and lack of access to health care persist. Scenario 2\u2014Hard Times/Government Leadership: Recurrent hard times and a political revolt against the health care system lead to a frugal, Canadian-like system. Most states follow Oregon in consciously setting priorities. Heroic measures for terminal patients decline and a more frugal yet successful approach to innovation is adopted. Health care's percentage of the gross national product is reduced to 11% by 2001. Thirty percent of Americans \"buy up\" to affluent, higher-tech care, and two parallel systems of health care emerge. Scenario 3\u2014Buyer's Market: Many thought the 1980s would be the decade of health care's entry into the marketplace\u2014 that competition would lead to better, Chapter 1: Chiropractic, The Future and Health Care The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 1-4less expensive service. What failed during the 1980s began to work in the 1990s and really became significant after 2000. Markets, including health care, now do a much better job of giving consumers a range of high-quality services, delivered in convenient ways at relatively low cost over the long term, while maintaining a high degree of innovation. These amazing changes are coupled with better social policies to blunt the inequities and lack of access that accompany the stronger market approach. Scenario 4\u2014Health Gains and Healing: The 15 years up to 2010 were a time of vision and design for health care. Heal th care organizations, their customers and the communities they serve join to develop and pursue powerful shared visions. These generally lead to health gains, through a variety of paths. This noble activity is reinforced by \"smarter markets\" that allow consumers and large purchasers to understand the outcomes of health care providers both for individuals and for communities . Vision Vision is a desired future state that individual s are committed to creating. It is the noble purpose of an organization or profession. There is no more powerful tool for an organization or a profession than a shared visi on of the \"best that could be.\" A vision defines how an organization, company or community can make its maximum contribution to society and play a leadership ro le in creating a positive future. In this report we explore how health care visions are evolving and the impacts these visions are having on primary care and on outcome measures for health care. Among chiropractors, there always have been powerful vi sions, but there is no single vision that now unites the profession. Strategies Strategies provide guidance for high-level actions or approaches to achieve the vision that an organization or community is committ ed to creating. Strategies can position an organization or community to anticipate the threats posed by changes in the future and turn them into opportunities. IAF's reco mmendations in Chapter 7 include some key strategies for the chiropractic field. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 1: Chiropractic, The Future and Health Care Institute for Alternative Futures 1-5FUTURES RESEARCH APPROACH TO THIS REPORT IAF combined a variety of approaches in pr eparing this report, including use of our previous studies, additional bibliographic re search, interviews with experts and focus groups with providers and consumer s. This report explores the future of chiropractic both as a treatment modality and as a community of practitioners. We were able to use IAF's extensive work on the futures of the health professions. The Institute has previously worked on the future of physicians,4 nurses,5 pharmacists6 and allied health providers.7 In addition, IAF has worked with health care system administrators, particularly in hospitals and managed care, and with health technology standards professionals. 8 Early in the Institute's work in heal th care we recognized the importance of complementary and alternative approaches.9 This study continues our commitment to using the tools and approaches of the futures field to help healing professionals make their optimum contribution to health gains. IAF sought input from a variety of exper ts in health and chiropractic. Appendix A provides a complete list of individuals interv iewed for this project. As we assured each interviewee anonymity, they will not be quoted in the report. We also conducted extensive literature and on-li ne searches on chiropractic, alternative therapies and health care as well as consulting our own internal knowledge bases, research and reports. References to these publicly available sources, where relevant, will appear throughout the report. Because of the wide range of topics addre ssed in this report, and the need to have more interactive input, we conducted ten focus groups with health care providers and consumers (six with consumers, two wit h chiropractors and two with leaders of managed care). Five of these were held in the San Francisco area, where alternative remedies are relatively advanced in their use. The other five were held in the Minneapolis area, where managed care composes a very large share of the health care marketplace. Thus this report mixes a variety of s ources. Where we are citing from published material, generally a specific reference is gi ven. Where we are citing from our expert interviews, we refer to \"experts\" or \"ex perts interviewed\" without providing names. Where the insight came from the focus groups , reference is made to consumers in our focus groups, chiropractors in our focus groups or managed care executives in our focus groups. Choosing Among Health Care Approaches Today Before presenting our scope and hypotheses for this report, it is relevant to consider how broad a selection consumers now have in choosing their therapeutics, particularly in relation to the indications for which consum ers seek chiropractic care. This is relevant because chiropractic faces competition not only from allopathic or conventional medicine but also from a wide range of CAAs. Health care providers increasingly have numerous modalities at their disposal, if t hey are willing to use them. Equally important, Chapter 1: Chiropractic, The Future and Health Care The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 1-6individuals\u2014as consumers and managers of t heir self-care\u2014likewise have many choices for health promotion and treatment. And the tools for consumer choice are growing rapidly. To begin exploring chiropr actic care and its environment, we reviewed what various popular, primarily consumer-o riented, guides identify as relevant and effective therapies. Later we will consider the degree of evidence supporting many of these. For the moment, it is relevant to simply consider what leading consumer guides suggest as the range of options. Table 1-1 i dentifies a broad range of health conditions and the equally broad range of moda lities that consumers can consider using for those conditions. Table 1-1: Comparison of CAAs Identified as Me riting Consideration for Selected Conditions Acupunc- VA: 1996): \"The goal of this volume is to provide a solid base of knowledge to help in the [decision- making] process, so that you can make informed\u2014and thus more confident\u2014choices about healthcare in the end. The best decision w ill be one you make in conjunction with your healthcare practitioner.\" (p. 13) BG Burton Goldberg Group, Alternative Medicine (Puyallup, WA: Future Medicine Publishing, 1993) : \"These should not be substituted for the advice and treatment of a physician or ot her licensed health professionals, but rather should be used in conjunction with professional car e.\" (p. 36) JM James E. Marti, The Alternative Health Medicine Encyclopedia (Nashville, TN: Knoxville Press, 1995): \"R ecommended as potential approaches for these conditions.\" (p. 64) SE Study Experts\u2014Those experts, primarily ch iropractors but non-chiropractors as well, interviewed for this report regarding th e indications for which chiropractic is thought to be relevant, eit her as a primary application or in a s upportive (e.g. pain management) role; see App endix A for a list of all experts interviewed for this study. JJ Jennifer Jacobs, Consulting Editor, The Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine (Boston, MA: Journey Editions, 1996) : These approaches are \"for reference purposes only\" and should \"serve to point (t he patient) in the right direction so (t he patient) can make further inquiries abou t specific therapies and forms of treatment.\" (p 15) The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures Chapter 1: Chiropractic, The Future and Health Care 1-7Chapter 1: Chiropractic, The Future and Health Care The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 1-8If we focus more closely on those indicati ons most often associated with chiropractic treatment\u2014back or musculoskeletal problem s\u2014which CAAs might consumers choose? Table 1-2 reviews these choices, noting t hat there is a wide range of modalities for classically chiropractic indications such as back problems, disk problems, lumbago and entrapped nerves. By 2010, we will have very effe ctive data on most, if not all, of these modalities used to treat back-related indica tions. We will know what works, for what type of individual, for any particular indication. In the interim, it is relevant for chiroprac tors to be aware of typical ranges of options being suggested to consumers. As an exampl e, from a chiropractic point of view, chiropractors would consider themselves capable of treating osteoporosis. However, according to Table 1-2, chiropractic is not one of the potential options suggested for osteoporosis. This example of differing percept ions of chiropractic's scope of treatment highlights some of the difficulties chiroprac tic has in gaining a broader acceptance for treatment of conditions beyond low back pain. Interestingly, some of the options mentioned on Table 1-2 are already part of t he chiropractic armamentarium, such as diet therapies or nutrition, and other s could well be added. (More detail on the approaches beyond chiropractic is given in IAF's parallel report, The Future of Complementary and Alternative Approaches (CAAs) in US Health Care). The point for chiropractic is that as the prof ession acts on its opportunities to move into mainstream health care and self-care, chiropr actors face a broad range of competition. David Eisenberg's classic article in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993 noted that one-third of all Americans use some form of alternative remedy. He noted that most physicians do not know what their patient s are using, and would not be able to handle the information if the patient gave it to them. 10 We encountered no data about the degree to which patients of chiropractors ar e using some form of alternative remedy other than chiropractic, but it is probably higher than the general population. Chiropractors will need to have a sense of how to integrate other modalities with their practices, whether initiated by the consumer or prescribed by another provider or health care professional.

In using the term Complementary and Alternative A pproaches (CAA), we recognize that any definition is a moving target. Just as many insurers and health care systems now cover or provide chiropractic and acupuncture treat ments, by 2010 a broader range of what we now call CAAs will be part of \"conventional\" treatment. Based on preliminary discussions and longst anding experience in health futures, IAF developed an initial set of hypotheses to test in this project, for both the CAA report and this report on the future of chiropractic. The Insights and Recommendations presented in Chapter 6 grow out of our exploration of these hypotheses. Chiropractic, CAAs and Health Care in 2010: Study Hypotheses 1. Complementary and alternative approaches , including chiropractic, will be integrated into conventional medical protocols, displa cing some portion of conventional medicine. 2. Chiropractic and other CAAs will become major tools for health promotion and prevention. 3. Chiropractors and other CAA provider s will become recognized as primary care providers and will be funded by the dom inant health care systems. 4. The use of manipulation and other alternat ive therapies by conventional providers and \"automated\" provi ders will increase. 5. Chiropractors, other alternative health care providers and conventional care providers who take a significant role in creating healthy communities will gain a competitive advantage. 1-11 As the illustration below depicts, the organizati on of this report provides a structure for thinking about the future.

Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-2 INTRODUCTION Health care today is being altered by majo r trends\u2014some highly visible, some barely in sight. Many factors will converge to make health care in 2010 radically different: \"smarter\" consumer markets, new demographi c realities, genomics, the information revolution, the movement for accountabi lity and outcome measures, revamping of training and licensure, incorporation of soci al and environmental factors in health\u2014and, not least, the integration of CAAs, including ch iropractic, into conventional health care. This chapter and the next will review these key trends bas ed on IAF's ongoing futures research as well as on the expert inte rviews, focus group sessions and secondary research conducted for this report. EVOLVING DEMANDS Growing dissatisfaction with the exis ting health care syst em among American consumers\u2014the most educated a nd informed in history\u2014is cr eating \"smarter markets.\" Smarter markets are in turn placing new demands on the health care system. In the decades leading up to the 1990s, Americans ess entially wanted affordable health care when they got sick\u2014demands that seem simple compared with today's complex marketplace. Now and in the future, people will want a system or iented to prevention and wellness as much as to tr eatment. As a steadily growing body of research confirms that psychological, social and spiritual fa ctors contribute significantly to health, consumers are responding by seeking a holisti c approach to their h ealth care. People want to live in safe, healthy communities. M any want to assume more responsibility for their health and to understand their options for prevention and self-care. When treatment is necessary, they want to play an active role in guiding it, armed with the knowledge they need to make informed choices from the available me nu of modalities, providers and treatments. They are moving to a \"patient-led\" model of care, in which the physician or other care provider acts as a consultant and the patient is in charge. Admittedly there are also many passive healt h care patients, comfortable to let others decide. This will persist; yet the nature and qua lity of the care these passive patients receive will be shaped by the growi ng ranks of more active patients. In addition to these sea changes in atti tude, demand is being affected by changing demographics, changes in disease and morbid ity and the extension of healthy lifespans. This section explains how these trends ar e reshaping demand, including the demand for chiropractic and other comple mentary and alternative appr oaches to health care (generally referred to in this report as CAAs). The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-3 Changing Demographics Diversity By 2010, demographic shifts will trigger dram atic changes, quantitat ive and qualitative, in US health care. Quantitatively, a generally lower birth rate and generally higher life expectancy, along with immigration and higher birth rates in so me minority populations, will shift attention to the growing proportions of elderly and minority Americans. In 2011, the oldest members of the Baby Boom gene ration will turn 65. The lar gest proportion of CAA users typically is middle-aged or older: in 1990, 38% of users of CAAs were 25-49 years of age; by 2010, these same users will be age 45 and older. 1 Though a growing percentage of America's elderly will be healthy later in life, another large percentage will not. Thus, aging markets mean that health care providers, both conventional and CAA, will need to target their servic es to patients with limited inco mes as well as a spectrum of geriatric health problems. The racial composition of society also will change markedly, with particularly high growth among Hispanic groups. CAA practiti oners, including conv entional physicians using CAAs, will see increasingly diverse populat ions of consumers. They will need to be even more sensitive to physical, social, mental, emotional and economic distinctions among their patients. And, as health care moves toward prevention and self-care, they will need to devise customized health maint enance and treatment protocols for these diverse populations, versus favoring one ge neralized treatment for most patients. Generations Qualitative population changes will be perhaps even more significant, due to the passage of one dominant generat ional cohort and the rise of the next. Psychographic research has identified a set of \"generational personalities\" that characterize successive cohorts of Americans, with one type following the next in a fixed, continuous cycle. While there is certainly great diversity within each cohort, as a whole each tends to exhibit a central behavior pattern, a modal se t of preferences, as the cohort passes through successive phases of life. Each of these generation-wide \"per sonalities\" reacts in characteristic ways to the opportunities and challenges of youth, middle age and old age.2 The age cohort now entering its 70s and 80s is the \"GI Generation. \" This generation has been one of the most assertive in American history. In its heyday, its members' strong civic spirit led them to in vent and strengthen large institut ions\u2014and to look for support from these institutions in return. After winni ng World War II, this cohort built hospitals, strengthened medical author ity and, in Medicare, legisl ated a funding structure to support them in their old age. The civic dispos ition of this generation is visible today in Chapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-4 the many ways its members continue to ban d together, in groups from the American Association of Retired Persons to the sprawli ng retirement communities of the Sun Belt. The old-age patterns of this generation will not carry into the next, however. The cohort currently in its 50s and 60s\u2014the \"Silent Generation\"\u2014is far less assertive. Its psychographic personality is char acterized by compromise, sandwiched as it is between two more powerful generational personalities. History show s that generations with these attributes typically have many great legisl ators, but few presiden ts. This less-dominant group will continue to benefit fr om the tremendous resources institutionalized by the GI'ers for supporting the final decades of lif e. In response to the demands for change coming from the other direction\u2014an incr easingly dominant \"Baby Boomer\" generation\u2014 they may modify these institutions, but will refrain from radical reconstruction. The 77-million-strong Baby Bo omer cohort now taking politic al power is characterized as idealist in its desire to place individuals ov er institutions. Thus, it is no surprise that the first Baby Boomer US president would seek to reform health care, or that his generation will drive c ontinued change in health care. The trend is likely to lead to a weakening of institutional pow er, since Baby Boomers belie ve in individuals assuming greater responsibility for their health and financ ing more of their ca re during illness. According to this \"generations analysis,\" the dominant trend among Boomers would be to support the gradual reducti on of programs like Medicare and bureaucracies like the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). The \"Generation X\" cohort following on the heels of the Baby Boomers is less dominant and more pragmatic. This generation already has suffered from the weakening of institutions. Its members were born into a time, for example, when the institution of marriage was weakened by rising divorce rates and schools were weakened by tax revolts. This cohort has come to expect that opportunities and benefits given to previous generations will not be open to them . The Generation Xers tend to look very realistically at such issues as careers, Social Secu rity and Medicare. They are also likely to acquiesce to current Baby Boomer reforms ai med at shifting resources from the elderly to children. 3 Given this ongoing dynamic between generational cohorts, the trends for health care between now and 2010 are likely to include a se ries of Baby Boome r-instituted reforms that weaken institutional roles and str engthen individual freedoms and responsibilities. The powerful financing, research and health ca re delivery organizations that dominated the second half of the 20 th century will be subject to increasing challenge in the years ahead. Public spending for the elderly will probably decline for two to three decades, beginning about the time the Boomers enter reti rement. And, as noted before, a health care paradigm emphasizing se lf-care, prevention and welln ess will join and to some extent supplant today's treatment-focused model. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-5 Demographics and Use of CAAs David Eisenberg's landmark study on unconv entional medicine, published in 1993, found that the use of CAAs was signific antly more common among people who are 25 to 49 years old, college-educated, have rela tively higher incomes and live in the West.4 Paul Ray, in a study for the Institute for No etic Sciences four years later, made similar findings regarding values and interest in holis tic health. Ray identified three subsets of American culture that are influencing the demand for health services, 5 summarized in Table 2-1 below. Ray's research suggests a growing number of Am ericans, a group he labeled \"Cultural Creatives,\" have non-traditi onal values that require a different paradigm of health. These consumers believe in holistic health: body/mind/spirit are unified. And they ar e willing to try a variety of approaches. While fairly healthy, members of this group have been described as the \"worried well.\" They are more prevention-oriented than the ot her two groups Ray identifi ed (see Table 2-1). As the size of the Cultural Creativ es group increases and comes to the forefront in American culture, its members could push for incr eased coverage and reimbursement for CAAs and increased number of available CAAs. Th ey are also more likely to be able and willing to purchase complementar y and alternative services as \"wellness\" expenditures, out of their own pockets, beyond the limits of health care cost reimbursements. Table 2-1: American Sub-Groups Group Interests & Traits Number of Adults: 1996-2010 Heartlanders: preserve traditional or \"rural\" values, resist change, are middle- to lower-income and isolationist Currently 29% of US population; in 2010 they will be 20% of the US population Cultural Moderns: mainstream, all income categories Currently 48% of US population; in 2010 they will be 45% of US population Cultural Creatives: upper income levels, leaders of cultural change, view a desirable future, growing in numbers Currently 23% of US population; in 2010 they will be 35% of US population Source: P. Ray. The Integral Culture Survey (Sausalito, CA: Institute for Noetic Sciences, 1996). Ray found that 37% of Americans were using alternative health care at the time of his 1994 survey a figure, he notes, which is up 4% from the 33% cited by Eisenberg in his 1990 survey. Among his sub-groups, 52% of Heartlanders were using alternative health care. Non-Users of CAAs Focus group participants in this study sugges ted there is a fine line between users and non-users of CAAs. Most non-users appear to be less aware of different CAAs, e.g., aromatherapy, naturopathy and homeopathy, but are not opposed to using them, particularly if they are scientifically pr oven. However some non-users had a strongly Chapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-6 negative view toward some CAAs, for exampl e chiropractic. Other factors that may determine use of CAAs include: Preference for self-reliance versus pref erence for reliance on external authority, such as a physician; and Cost-effectiveness. Focus group participants re sponded very positively to a future in which CAAs are scientifically proven and are reasonably priced. Ray's survey points out that many lower-inc ome persons are \"at least as excluded from alternative health care as from regular health care: they can't afford it.\" 6 CHANGES IN DISEASE AND MORBIDITY The pattern of diseases is changing in developed and developing countries. Based on the work of the World H ealth Organization (WHO)'s Global Burden of Disease study, Table 2-2 presents the leading causes of DALYs\u2014Disability Adjusted Life Years\u2014a major measure of disease burden for est ablished market economies, including the United States. Table 2-2: Disability-Adjusted Li fe Years (DALYs, in thousands): Established Market Economies, 1990 and 2020 19907 2020 Projection8 Cause # in thousands Cause # in thousands Ischaemic heart disease 9362 Ischaemic heart disease 9119 Cerebrovascular heart disease 4974 Unipolar major depression 6642 Dementia 3989 Cerebrovascular heart disease 4761 Road traffic Trachea, bronchus and lung cancer 4480 Trachea, bronchus and lung cancer 3070 Alcohol use 4344 use 2822 Dementia 4296 Congenital abnormalities 2356 Osteoarthritis 3432 Self-inflicted injuries 2217 Thus, from 1990 to 2020 unipolar major depression rises in the ranks to number two. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-7 Shifting from the developed market economies to the world as a whole, Table 2-3 below notes that infectious diseases will lose their 1990 places in the top three to be replaced in 2020 by: Ischaemic heart disease (acute myocar dial congestive heart failure); Unipolar depression; Road traffic accidents (long-term episodes incl uding fractured femur, fractured skull, spinal cord injury and intracranial injury; short-term episodes including intracranial injury). Table 2-3 Generally, the current trend of non-communicabl e diseases, such as heart disease and many cancers, displacing traditional enem ies such as infectious diseases and malnutrition will continue worl dwide through 2020. This is partly a function of aging: as birth rates go down and average life span increases, the ratio of adults to children\u2014and hence of adult diseases to childhood ones\u2014increases likewise. As reflected in the WHO figures above, globa lly the rate of injury (both intentional and unintentional) is rising. By 2020 it will rival infectious disease as a chief source of ill health. According to the same WHO study, tobacco use will cause more premature death and disability than any other single risk factor \u2014up to 9% of the adult disease burden by 2020. 9 Rank Cause % total 1 Lower respiratory infections 8.2 2 Diarrhoeal disease 7.23 Perinatel conditions 6.7 4 Unipolar major depression 3.7 5 Ischaemic heart disease 3.4 6 Cerebrovascular disease 2.8 7 Tuberculosis 2.88 Measles 2.7 9 Road traffic accidents 2.5 10 Congenital abnormalities 2.4Rank Cause % total 1 Ischaemic heart disease 5.9 2 Unipolar major depression 5.73 Road traffic accidents 5.1 4 Cerebrovascular disease 4.4 5 Chronic pulmonary disease 4.2 6 Lower respiratory infections 3.1 7 Tuberculosis 3.08 War 3.0 9 Diarrhoeal diseases 2.7 10 HIV 2.6Estimate 1990 Projection 2020Global Disease Burden Measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYS) Source: WHO website: http://www.who.ch/programmes/mnh/mnh/ems/dalys/intro.htmChapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-8 Finally, the WHO forecasts suggest an important sh ift that is relevant for all health care providers, conventional or alternative: t he growing presence of \"diseases of meaning.\" Globally, diseases such as depression, whic h in many cases are related to larger questions of personal meaning and coherence of worldview, are among the fastest- growing. Depression does hav e both genetic and physiologic components, but in many cases a person's unsatisfactory social c ontext and sense of personal meaning are major factors. These problems are also likely to be shown as contributing to the growth of some violence, road accidents and risky sexu al behavior. And there is some concern regarding the bio-ethical imp lications. \"Meaning\" in this context is more of an epiphenomenon, following from bi omedical and environmental c auses, than a disease. To focus on diseases of meaning could l ead to holding health care providers partly responsible for outcomes beyond their control. However, the parallel issue is already being raised regarding those close to death: some medical experts argue that people in the last stages of life, w ho are asking to end their lives, are suffering from depression and therefore \"giving up.\" Treat ing the depression will become an important objective in these cases. The challenge for chiropractors and other prov iders is to identify patients whose \"crisis of meaning\" can be prevented or ameliorated through clinical intervention. Many CAAs offer important tools for such interventi ons, both by improving general physical and emotional well-being and by tr eating short-term symptoms. This trend also may lead to chiropractors being called upon by their communities to assume larger roles in more public health or iented issues. As recognition of the growth and causes of diseases of meaning becomes more prevalent, health care providers will be looked to for their diagnoses and prescriptions. They will be challenged to be more effective both with their patients indivi dually and with problem solving to help communities enhance overall health including the sense of personal coherence and meaning experienced by me mbers of the community. CHANGING THE DISEASE CURVE: COMPRESSING MORBIDITY The WHO forecasts cited above extrapolate tr ends based on past experience. But some forward-thinking providers submit that mo rbidity can be lowered well below extrapolated levels, particularly for the elderly. James Fr ies, Professor of M edicine at Stanford University Medical School, created a theory on the \"compression of morbidity\" which went from being heresy in t he early 1980s to being the accepted target for \"successful aging\" by the end of that decade.10 Fries argues that appropriate lifestyle changes can sustain health and delay the onset of disease in late life, thus \"compressing morbidity\" into the last year or last few months of lif e rather than having it dominate the last few years. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-9 Fries reminds us that we can go well beyon d current norms to cr eate greater health, with dramatic social and financial effect s. He notes that demand management for medical services, combined with social policie s (such as seatbelt laws), can yield better health for fewer dollars. Fries forecasts that health care costs will actually be reduced by 20% using currently availa ble techniques, particularly in capitated systems.11 His work stands in striking contrast to the extrapolat ed forecasts that show an aging population pushing morbidity and health care costs skyward. For chiropractic, an import ant implication is that the demographic and disease burden forecasts (such as the steep rise in road tr affic accidents) show a growing number of patients requiring more musculoskeletal care due to injury, as well as arthritis, back strain and degenerative conditions. A more visi onary opportunity is for chiropractors to play a major role in actually \"compressi ng morbidity\" among thei r elderly patients, through greater lifestyle coaching and reinfo rcement of healthy lifestyles both during and before the retirement years. EVOLVING PARADIGMS Health Care in the United States: A Short History of Paradigms Waiting to Change The paradigms that defined US health care for most of this century are now vanishing into history along with it. H ealth care \"took off\" in th is country in the early 20th century. Hospitals saw dramatic growth, fueled by im provements in surgery and infection control. In the 1920s state governments established licensure laws, some of which made it illegal to practice various alternative modalit ies, or even to re fer patients to such practitioners. By the second half of the 20th century, most physici ans were barely aware that they were \"allopaths.\" Employer-pro vided health insurance plans grew rapidly during World War II (wages were frozen, but benefits such as health insurance were not) and became the norm thereaf ter. Insurance companies did not require proof of efficacy before they paid for procedures; ra ther, they would pay the customary fees without question for anything an (allopathic) physician pr escribed. By the 1980s, business groups, which were then paying a significant percentage of their total expenditures for health care, claimed that about 40% of all health care was either unnecessary or ineffectively delivered. Meanwhile, medical schools expanded their production of doctors, especially of specialists who, often, were trained to rely on expensive high-tech procedures. The paradigms framing this evolving system were fundamentally reductionist, both in terms of medical science and in terms of thei r orientation to specialty practice. These characteristics have bred some extraordinaril y positive results: in terms of medical science, for example, the focus on discrete, discoverable physica l aspects of bodily Chapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-10 functioning has created genomics. But it also has led to ignoring the roles of mind and spirit in human health, and to ignoring various categories of side effects. By 1980 this system had overproduced specialist physicians; skewed its focus to hospital-based care; neglected prevention; and often utilized therapies whose cost- effectiveness had never been proven. As insurers and health care systems began to change their behavior, inpatient utilization of hospitals on a per capita basis actually dropped by 50% between 1980 and 1990, yet costs soared during this period. By the mi d-1990s health care was consuming 15% of the US GNP. Nevertheless, it was deliver ing lower outcomes to fewer people than did the health care systems of many European countries at a relative cost 30-50% greater than those of the European systems. The system was ready for change. In the 1980s large employers began to complain about the growing cost and uncertain results. Employer groups and federal policy tried to encourage more of a real \"marketpl ace\" in health care in the 1980s. Managed care, in this context of overspending, represented \"atonement for the sins\" of fee-for-service medicine. Yet managed ca re has often carried on the reductionist paradigm, narrowly focusing on cost management. In the process it has inadvertently fostered the backlash against many of its co st-cutting efforts, such as limiting the hospital stays of new mo thers after delivery. US health care is beginning to change. Majo r trends are underway. Some might yet be reversed, but it is much more likely that they will gain momentum to the point that, by 2010, a number of interlocking \"paradigm sh ifts\" will have redefined health care. In the new paradigm: Disease and risk will be defined much more broadly; Providers will be held more accountabl e for a broader range of outcomes; and Health care systems will change their basic service, using the \"Forecast, Prevent and Manage\" paradigm, to minimize illness ov er the lifecourse, ra ther than waiting for acute problems to materialize. Each of these shifts will present both thr eats and opportunities for chiropractors by 2010. The table below summarizes these choices. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-11 Table 2-4: Implications of Chang es in Health Care for Chiropractic Chiropractors' ability to enhance their contribution to individuals Threat Opportunity From disease treatment to forecast, prevent and manage Overall there will be fewer patients to treat because more disease is prevented Effectively provide prevention and wellness, including manipulation Outcomes-driven care Chiropractic will not be able to document outcomes and will fall behind other conventional and alternative providers Provide competitive outcomes and measure these in office practice; generate sophisticated outcome data Social and environmental components of health for individuals and consumers As providers to individuals, chiropractors will have little to offer by way of public/community health Broaden the DC's focus and area of contribution; visibly support policies to achieve health gains Source: IAF, 1997 Broader Interpretations of Health and Illness In the future, health care providers will not onl y treat the direct, localized physical or biochemical effects of a diseas e; they will increasingly take into account the effects of a disease on the patient's other body systems and mental state and vice versa. A growing body of research show s, for example, that psychol ogical status correlates with morbidity and mortality.12 Chiropractors and other prov iders will view disease as a dynamic element affecting and being affe cted by multiple concentric systems from genetic to cellular to organ to body to mind-b ody-spirit to individual-family to family- community-health to global. By 2010, a \"syste ms view\" will constitute the overarching paradigm for addressing health and disease. Many chiropractors already operate with a systems view. James Gordon, an MD who uses alternative approaches, including manipul ation, in his practice, believes illness should be viewed as an opportunity to exam ine and improve our lives. Disease can be a catalyst to explore what it means to be truly health y and in harmony with our surroundings, he suggests. Table 2-5 illustrates how these broader aspects of disease will be viewed in the future. The example of a breast cancer patient is used to show the wide range of bio-psycho- social manifestations that might be addre ssed by the health care system in 2010, as well as some of the steps t hat might be taken at the soci etal or community level to \"design out\" such illnesses. Chapter 2.

CAA practitioners likewise will seek to detec t conditions before symptoms arise, through in-depth analysis of the constellation of factor s predisposing a patient to ill health. Some practitioners of the leading CA As, particularly chiropracti c, Oriental medicine and homeopathy, already do this. However, all prac titioners of these th ree and other CAAs (as well as of conventional health care) are likely to interpret the bio-psycho-social manifestations of disease more effectivel y and recommend different treatment regimens by 2010. In a health delivery system driven by out comes, reimbursements will expand beyond treatments for the bio-chemical aspects of disease to include services aimed at bio- psycho-social manifestations. In the table above, the patient would be reimbursed for her chemotherapy and mastectomy as well as for proven treatments she received for depression, back pain and loss of sex drive. Some insurance and managed care plans do this now. How much this practice will ex pand is unclear, but t he opportunity exists and will be propelled by com petition to achieve these broader health gains. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-13 Syndromes of Risk As health care moves \"upstream\" to address t he causes of illness and prevention, it will increasingly consider the \"sy ndromes of risk\" associated with various diseases. This shift has clearly begun, with factors such as diet and lifestyle playing a greater role in approaches to health. The shift toward viewing syndr omes of risk, like poverty and environmental decline, as intimately linked to health creates a challe nge for chiropractors, for other types of providers and for the general public. As cons idered in more detail later, in our focus group sessions for this study, chiropractors were not viewed by the typical consumer who has never been treated by a chiropractor as having a significant role in health promotion. Of course, many ch iropractors do view themselves in a health promotion role, and many chiropractic patients visit thei r chiropractors for \"wellness visits\" after their initial course of treatm ent. This expertise is not well-known to the public, however. Beyond addressing health promotion for indivi duals, chiropractors will find it even more challenging to decide what role they shoul d play in addressing environmental and social ills, and how to persuade the public of their own relevance to such issues. As Michael Lerner, Director of Commonweal, a health and environmental research institute in Bolinas, California, has pointed out, the role of environmental factors in cancer means that \"any truly visionary discu ssion of the future of canc er care would need to assume that a global dialogue on the health impacts of the structure of industrial civilization would be a primary advocacy concern of l eaders\" in efforts to combat cancer. 13 Lerner's comment is an example of t he type of health challenges t hat chiropractors will need to face. Dealing with entrenched risk syndromes like pover ty is no small challenge. By 2010 it is likely that visionary chiroprac tors and other types of health care providers, pursuing cost-effective outcomes, will have taken action against some of them, including environmental decline, poverty and crime. 14 Today, however, no clear set of strategies exists among chiropractors (or most other heal th care providers) for taking such action. Around the United States, effo rts like the Belmont Vision Project have stimulated national and local dialogues to develop shar ed visions. The resulting commitments often move in the direction of attacking broader risk factors.15 Environmental Issues Over the past decade, the envir onment has emerged as a majo r concern in health care. Water quality, for example, has become a heal th issue in some parts of the United States and is a critical health issue in developing nations throughout Asia and elsewhere. Environmental threats to health are gro wing on a global scale, despite significant progress in some areas. Both outdoor and indoor air pollution contribute to respiratory diseases. Even in the richest nations, poor areas often bear heavy burdens of pollution Chapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-14 and toxic-waste exposure. Deforestation and habi tat destruction in the tropics are major factors in the emergence of new diseases. Depl etion of the stratospheric ozone layer is causing a rise in the incidence of skin cancer s worldwide, but especially in parts of the Southern Hemisphere. Michael Lerner, as noted, urges a global di alogue on industrializat ion's environmental impacts. As a wide-ranging example of th ese impacts, Lerner points to endocrine- disrupting chemicals, 16 which are implicated in hypospadias,17 testicular cancer, reported declines in male sperm counts in industrial nations, endometriosis and learning and behavior disorders in children.18 Global warming threatens to bring tropical diseases into northern latitudes and may cause more weather extremes, with storms and flooding leading to injuries and other health problems. Global warming is also likel y to enlarge the \"hot zones\" which produce new strains of disease. Meanwhile, worsening problems of soil erosion, water scarcity and over-fishing could undermine the nutritional status of hundreds of millions of people in the decades ahead. Environmental problem s can also contribute to economic problems and outbreaks of conflict, which in turn pose threats to health. As health increasingly becomes the focus of health care, health care providers whether conventional, comp lementary or alternative ultimately will see their work judged in relation to these broader issues. M any will seek to discover and invent ways in which they can make a contribution, through their patients and beyond, to environmental issues. Poverty Poverty increasingly is being recognized as t he largest risk factor for ill health in the United States. Poor living conditions, high-stress envir onments, poor nutrition and limited access to preventive health care all in crease the risk of disease. For example, the health status of residents in parts of Washi ngton, DC, is as poor as that in Haiti, with an overall life expectancy akin to that of the former Soviet republic of Turkmenistan\u2014 due primarily to negative social, economic an d environmental health stresses like those mentioned above. Furthermore, in fant mortality among poorer populations in cities like Washington, DC, is far higher t han in most developing countries.19 The health care system, in seeking outcomes, ultimately will need to confront both t hese disparities and the poverty that is a major cause of them. Medicaid combines federal and state funds to subsidize health care costs for the poor (along with disabled people and those in nursing homes who ar e not private-pay patients). Over recent decades most primary health care for the poor has come from physicians who accept Medicaid, as well as from community clinic s staffed by public health workers and emergency rooms. Overus e of expensive emer gency rooms, rising costs, few prevention program s and poor health outcomes fo r Medicaid recipients have led many states to move their Medicaid populations into managed care systems. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-15 Some health care delivery systems are also working to provide poor communities with working models that improve health. For ex ample, three HMOs in the Minneapolis region have joined to open a clinic in the loca l school of a poor region of the city, where they cover most of the students and their families as Medicaid recipients. Some of these experiments in providing care for the poor also provide access to CAAs. One outstanding example is the King County Natu ral Medicine Clinic in Kent, Washington, where poor and uninsured people can receiv e integrated conventional and CAA services. (See Appendix C for details.) As the poor are moved into systems of in tegrated care driven by outcomes, these systems are more likely to target poverty as an overarching s ource of ill health. Traditionally, CAAs have been excluded fr om Medicaid coverage. Now their practitioners need to become aware of syndromes like poverty and consider contributions they could ma ke to alleviating them. One approach, suggested by futurist Leland Ka iser, who is coaching a number of health care systems around the country, is for managed care systems to give 10% of their net income to the community for health promot ion efforts, including efforts to reduce poverty. And public health leaders, often wit h the participation and sometimes with the funding of their local health care provi ders, have created \"health y community\" programs around the country to demonstrat e that better health can be achieved in populations beset by poverty. (See \"Population Health and the Healthy Cities/ Communities Movement,\" below.) Violence Both homicide and suicide have increased in recent decades, making violence a significant cause of early death and disabi lity. The link between economic status and violence is strong: poor populations are more likely to have higher rates of homicide, while wealthier groups have higher rates of suicide. 20 The rise in violence has leveled off in the mid-1990s, however. Some experts consider this phenomenon temporary and forecast new in creases in youth violence and a wave of \"superpredators.\" Alternatively violence coul d moderate as political attention turns to society's failure to support at-risk child ren. This awareness has begun to move resources back toward youth. Violence prevention programs, in particular, have demonstrated that both homicide and suic ide rates can be lowered in at-risk populations; these programs are likely to expand over the coming years. Likewise, KiddieCare-Child Health Insurance Programs, federally and state-funded programs to provide health care coverage for poor or uninsured children, are growing in certain states. The states may ex pand funding of these program s or develop their own new programs. Chapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-16 Accountability/Outcomes/Efficacy Another important shift is t he trend to hold health care pr actitioners accountable for the care they provide, and the us e of outcome measures to ac hieve this. By 2010, outcome measures, we believe, will be applied to heal th care systems, modalities, individual providers and, ultimately, health care provider teams. In turn, the movement for outcome measur es is spurring a broadening view of how we define and measure \"health.\" Ultim ately, we believe, WHO's vi sion of \"Health For All\" will be adopted by many health care stakehol ders as the \"gold standard\" for global, optimal health. In WHO's ambitious definit ion, equity, solidarit y, sustainability and gender sensitivity are considered critical precursors to true health (see \"The Future of Outcomes: WHO's 'Health For All,'\" below). For most of this century, and particularly dur ing the dramatic growth of the US health care system since World War II, health care providers have had few incentives to measure their outcomes clearly, since buyers did not require it. This situation is changing dramatically. The demand for outcome measures, mainly from large buyers, has spawned several national efforts to develop and apply them. Perhaps the most prominent is the federal gov ernment's Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), which Congress began with great fanfare in 1989. Political constraints and funding cuts in recent years have serious ly curbed the scope of federal outcomes research, however. Instead, private efforts have come to the fore. Three projects are worth noting. First is the National Committee for Quality Assur ance (NCQA), which has been accrediting managed care organizations since 1991. T he NCQA accreditati on program is a voluntary process. Accreditation reflects a managed care organization's ability to satisfy NCQA standards based on the NCQA's Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS). HEDIS 3.0 is a standardized set of 71 performance indicators that include measures related to cancer, heart disease, asthma and other pres sing health concerns. A second private quality-and-outcomes initiative is that of the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Health Care Organiza tions. The nation's oldest health care accreditation organization, the Joint Commission has expanded its focus beyond hospitals and now evaluates and accredits health care networks and plans, home care organizations, long-term care facilities, ambulatory care providers and clinical laboratories. In February 1997, the Joint Commission launched ORYX, its initiative to integrate outcomes and performance measures into its accreditation process. Full implementation of ORYX wi ll be phased in through 1998. A third significant quality initiative is t he Foundation for Accountability, Inc. (FACT). FACT was founded by Paul Ellwood, one of the originators of managed care and the \"HMO\" concept, after he concluded that health maintenance organizations, which he once championed, would not produce healthy outcomes on their own. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-17 Smaller initiatives are blossoming too. \"B est practices,\" or algorithms for disease management, are being developed throughout biomedicine. In many cases these combine best-practice guidelines with adv anced office- or clinic-based information systems so providers can instantly choos e whether and how to incorporate best practices in real-time care. The effects of these systematic effo rts to identify best practices and build them into the care setting will be profound by 2010. In its current manifestation, outcomes resear ch has a strong political dimension. Myriad approaches and methodologies fall under the r ubric of outcomes assessment, including cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit studies t hat look at both clinical and economic measures. Given that there is no single accepted standard under which to organize this research, the key question to ask when revie wing these studies is \"Whose perspective dominates the research\"? 21 Some studies emphasize the consumer or patient point of view, using questionnaires such as Short Form 36 (SF-36) to quantify subjective responses over potentially long periods of time. SF-36 is a standar dized patient self- assessment of health and quality of life. Other s take more of a provider perspective, focusing on quality of process and evaluati ng shorter periods of time. As outcomes studies grow in number and use, practiti oners and patients will learn to recognize and select the studies that are most valuable for the context at hand. The politics of outcomes studies will bec ome increasingly ferocious, because the research will influence the flow of dollars to compet ing systems, therapies and professional providers. The evolution to smarter markets, as mentioned above, means that the winners will be those who most effe ctively and convincingly take the consumer point of view. This evolution will be power ed in part by research tools and techniques that collect data on quality of life and create objective methods for evaluating subjective responses. Report Cards on Providers Chiropractors, like other health care providers, will be held accountable for their outcomes as consumers become more knowledgeable. Consumers will be able to vote with their pocketbook and choose providers with the best outcomes, highest patient satisfaction and best prices. Although the current trend in managed care is to restrict patient choice in favor of lowering costs, managed care executives in our focus groups stated they would be amenable to greater patient choice if that was what the market demanded and it could be justified in terms of cost-effectiveness. Performance- or outcome-r eporting systems are being develo ped in many local areas. Preliminary versions of these repor t cards have been produced by the Midwest Business Coalition for physicians in the Minneapolis area and by Washington Consumer Checkbook for greater Washington, DC (rating physicians, HMOs, emergency rooms and hospitals). Health Pages now publishes comparativ e information on competing plans in a number of cities across the country. And consumer guides have been published by state agencies for example, a Satisfaction Survey in Utah, Consumer Chapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-18 Guides in Maryland, Performance Reports in New Jersey and a rating of cardiac surgeons by Pennsylvania. Report cards also could support the rating of providers against more sophisticated value screens. Increasingly, consumers will more c onsciously link their values to their expenditures. Environmental ra tings or \"Green Seals\" of co mpanies are only the first of many categories of \"goodness\" by wh ich consumers incr easingly will judge companies. 22 Consumer groups of various pers uasions will use the Internet to accelerate the polling currently done on paper. There will be enhanced consumer reports, nationally as well as locally, rating a wide variety of services and products.23 Manufacturers and service providers will no doubt use this ongoing feedback as part of their continuous quality improvement processes.24 Information Advances and the Web Will Affect Outcome Measuring The infrastructure for developing and disse minating outcome measures is quickly being put into place. In the year s ahead, the capacity to track out comes will be significantly enhanced as electronic medical records, i nexpensive personal biomonitoring, home use of the Internet, expansion of private intranets and greater interest on the part of patient/advocacy groups in testing, all come into play. Already, entrepreneurs are attracting vent ure capital to develop computer-based decision tools that organize data on health plans and providers so consumers can choose the quality measures they find most appealing. Ultimately they will consider which local health care professionals mi ght be the best match for their values, personality, genetics, behav ior and environment. For example, Health Magic, a Denver-based spin-off of the Adventist Health System, and its Celebration Health, a $111 million m edical complex designed to serve Disney's new town of Celebration, Florida, are working with both health care providers and consumers to develop health information tool s. One result of this effort is HealthCompass, a state-of-the- art, Internet-accessible com puter service which allows patients to gather their electronic health re cords into a single source and update it throughout their lives. HealthCompass also enables consumers and their families to better manage their interactions with health care providers, by giving ready access to test results, diagnoses and treatment advice. HealthCompass includes access to Direct Medical Knowledge (a spin-off of the ve ry successful Planetree system, which has enabled hospitals to provide consumer acce ss to leading medical knowledge), a self- help interactive software for stress managem ent developed by psychiatrist and expert system software developer Roger Gould. Other services wil l be offered through or in conjunction with this tool. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-19 Lack of a Transparadigm Science and the Collapse of Diagnostic Categories The fast-approaching confluence of diverse knowledge paradigms networked data, genomics, CAAs, etc. is transforming diagnostics, t oo. \"Normal\" statistical approaches parametric statistics based on normal distribution curves massify medical knowledge by considerin g a large number of individ uals in relation to a single variable. Such statistics will increasingly prove unreliable and ineffective as guides to regulation, formulary devel opment or reimbursement. They are designed to calculate the \"odds-ratio\" effect how likely it is that something will occur. However, in clinical practice a clinician must calc ulate the likely magnitude of an effect as well as its odds ratio. Clinical trials at this time seldom prov e helpful with this higher level of complexity. Genomics, CAAs and distribut ed databases comprised of longitudinal data from individuals' medical records are three wildly different phenomena whose potential impacts on conventional medical science are remarkably similar. Together, they are helping to usher in a highly customized t herapeutic paradigm in which diagnostics will address an individual's unique status from the cellular to the societal and environmental. Data and approaches from public health, and mo re complex probabilistic models using genomics, will come into play at one end of the spectrum, while in dividuals will be able to closely monitor and record their own he alth conditions and establish their uniquely \"normal\" patterns of health indicators, at the other. Consequently, both diagnostic categories and outcomes measures will probably be very different by 2010. Genomics will enable us to determine individuals' proclivities to diseases and co-morbidity factors. Cancers will no longer be defined only by organ or body site e.g., \"breast cancer\" or \"lung cancer\" but instead will integrate those genotypes and phenotypes that have been shown to be significant for how cancers in these sites continue to grow or are stopped. CAAs, too, will provide new diagnostic categories based on their observations of phenotypic differences. Homeopathy, for instance, finds relevance in how certain things taste to an individual, as well as in some behavioral and morphological characteristics. Oriental medicine keys many diagnoses off differences in the person's pulse. As fact ors like these prove usef ul, their frameworks and results will be integrated into diagnostic categories. In fact, \"proving useful\" will be the standard by which health care outcomes move forward at the margin, in the absence of a transparadigm science and in the face of altered diagnostic categories. And \"proving us eful\" itself will be more complex as it is modulated by patient preferences. Clinical Trials and Therapeutic Development Meanwhile, the conventions and practices t hat have defined clinical development are being undermined by these new insights. Economic incentives will make new knowledge irresistible despite opposition from entrenched inte rests. IAF forecasts that Chapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-20 new methods for developing and ev aluating therapies will come strongly to the fore over the next decade. Currently, the \"gold standard\" for evaluati on of new therapies is the double-blind, controlled clinical trial. This 50-year-old me thod, which was devised to study antibiotics, is now seen by critics as a useful but limited approach. It has serious flaws in many contextsfor example, when addressing treat ment of chronic diseases. These severe limitations include cost, t he application of \"average\" responses to individuals and the \"designing out \" of subjective factors. The cost problem is most visible in the pharmaceutical industry, w here getting a new drug to market can cost $500 million. These escalating costs hav e created a bottleneck that stifles the introduction of new products and narrows the range of therapeutic options. The second weakness, reliance on massified clinical data, is quickly being rendered obsolete by scientific advances. Genomics in tandem with enhanc ed personal biodata and environmental data is beginning to replace \"massi fying\" methodologies with a highly granular look at individuals. The massifying me thods on which current drug testing is based are designed to test the average response of an artificially selected population to an intervention over a short dur ation. This approach will be put aside, allowing far more effective clinical j udgments, as we combine a knowledge of genotype/phenotype with assessments of gi ven, relevant factors within large populations over long periods of time (m eanwhile controlling for co-morbidities and other relevant factors). This enhanced knowl edge will be applied to acute as well as chronic diseases. Self-Healing Capacity and the \"Placebo Effect\" The third criticism of clinical trials is far older: their designing-out of subjective factors which may, it is becoming evident, be invalu able in healing. To objectively evaluate a particular intervention, clinical trials \"b lind\" participants and prov iders to knowledge of whether a subject is receiving a real medica tion or an inert substitute. This makes the \"placebo effect\" the measurable healing response oft en found in patients who believe they have been given an appropriate medication a constant rather than a variable. The placebo effect may, in fact, be highly signif icant for healing. It ma y represent a capacity to self-heal, or it may trigger the self-limiting nat ure of many diseases. But by making its effect a constant, clinical tria ls override its potential benefits. The placebo effect and its role in healing ar e well documented in the scientific literature. In double-blind, well-controlled p harmaceutical research trials that use placebos (rather than the current \"standard of ca re\" medication) as the contro l, placebo response rates of 30% are common. Some researchers argue that 40-70% of the su ccess of all patient care can be attributed to the placebo respon se and, therefore, t hat it should be harnessed as a therapeutic tool. Her bert Benson, a Boston physician and author , supports the higher end of this range, arguing that the placebo response is twice as The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-21 common as previously believed. Benson al so proposes that we rename the placebo effect \"remembered wellness,\" and that practitioners use it consciously and concertedly to augment treatment. Benson estimates that evoking the remembered-wellness response, such as through relaxation and cognitive-behavioral techniques, would dramatically reduce psychosomatic problems and result in savings of over $50 billion per year.25 These savings would come from a si gnificant decrease in patient visits and/or the number of treatm ent visits required. If correct, the implications of Benson's argument for all modalities, conventional and complementary, are significant. Under this model, any approach that doesn't stimulate a person's innate healing system would be suspect. Prayer, personality and belief systems ar e other mind/body phenomena whose well- documented powers can confound the assumptions built into clinical trials, but whose clinical benefit should be in vestigated and put to use. The 80% Rule: Consideration of self-healing harks back to the discussion about the difficulty of holding chiropractic and other CAAs to standard outcome measures. The striking fact is that leading practitioners in many CAA disciplines have been shown to be effective with their regular patients about 80% of the time regardless of which CAA they employ. This implies that in these situations the placebo response, or \"remembered wellness,\" is a powerful factor , nurtured by the provider's healing skills and warm relationship with the patient. This phenomenon is one explanation of why preliminary studies showing the efficacy of a CAA sometimes cannot be replicated. To the extent this subtle dynamic between provider and patient becomes a conscious focus of both research and practice, all health care providers, CAA and conventional, will enhance their healing skills. Bias in the Use of Therapies Finally, beyond the sometimes inherent unsuitabi lity of the clinical -trial paradigm for some CAAs, clinical researchers have been accused of bias in their application of clinical development standards to CAAs. Some CAAs have been subjected to very rigorous testing by their own communities (al beit using non-conventional, non-allopathic assumptions). Yet conventional medical res earchers often exhibit prejudice against these approaches. The tension can sometimes amount to a \"holy war\" of scientific ideologies, at the expense of empirical learning, and ca n delay the therapeutic adoption of modalities that have been shown to be useful. Three Components of Remembered Wellness 1. Belief and expectancy on the part of the patient; 2. Belief and expectancy on the part of the caregiver; 3. Belief and expectancy generated by a relationship between the patient and the caregiver. Source: Benson, Herbert (1996) Timeless Healing (New York: Scribner), p. 32 . Chapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-22 Thus, some experts argue that CAAs are ca sualties of a double standard. In studying cancer treatments, for exampl e, medical writer Henry Dre her notes that psychosocial interventions have been shown to enhance quality of life for cancer patients and, in three studies with a total of 250 patients, hav e been linked to longer survival or reduced mortality rates. Dreher concluded that t hese psychosocial interventions should be instituted as complementary approaches imm ediately, across the board, in cancer treatments. But conventional researchers count ered that research norms require trials on 2,000 patients, rather t han 250, before such a broad-bas ed therapeutic change can be accepted. While Dreher concurs that 2,000 is sometimes the accepted baseline for adopting a new primary therapy, he notes that adj ustments to standard therapies e.g., designating a new drug within an existi ng class as the tr eatment of choice are often based on trials involving fewer than 200. Dreher writes: \"the bias against non- pharmacologic therapies has no basis in scienc e or biomedical ethics. With evidence of quality-of-life and of life- extending potential, bi omedicine's lack of an initiative is nothing short of a scandal.\"26 In the face of all these forces mitigating agai nst incorporation of CAAs into mainstream health care, it is perhaps understandable that many CAA providers insist that today's standard outcomes cannot or should not be applied to them. The diagnosis and the clinical endpoints for a chiropractic treat ment or homeopathic remedy may be very different from their allopathic c ounterparts. This issue is likely to be sorted out on the basis of more data on large numbers of user s of these therapies; it is likely that standard diagnostic categories, e. g. ICD-10, may look very different because of the challenges of CAAs. There most likely w ill be another revision to ICD-11 by 2010. Also, different endpoints, process measures and clinical outcome indicators may be appropriate when a modality is used to a ttack a syndrome rather than a specific condition. In either case, however, consum er satisfaction, cost-effectiveness and appropriate clinical efficacy will provide the bas is for competition in the smarter markets of the 21 st century. The Forecast, Prevent and Manage Paradigm Arising from the confluence (or the clash) of the health care currents detailed above is a fundamental shift in the paradigm underlying heal th care: a move from treating disease after the fact to prev enting disease before it starts. As noted, this \"Forecast, Prevent and Manage\" paradigm moves practitioners away from treating symptoms of disease to anticipating changes in health status, prev enting morbidity wherever possible and proactively managing morbidity when it does occur. 27 This shift in the paradigm of treatment will entail a concurrent paradigm shift in institutional practice and investment. The entire health care community, from practitioners to policy makers, will need to expa nd its focus to encompass all aspects of lifestyle. This shift will be supported by t he development of information systems that support prevention and self-care; the devel opment of approaches designed to prevent The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-23 potential health problem s from manifesting; the use of new biomonitoring techniques; and other advances such as a new generation of DNA vaccines. Together these tactics will allow: Early detection of illness and abnormal functioning; More accurate diagnosis of genetical ly defined subtypes of disease; Customized care in which therapeutic selection is more precisely tailored to individual biochemistry (more on this below); Disease management using a wide range of therapeutic tools, including lifestyle change, new generations of antibiotics, new forms of immunotherapy including CAAs that enlist and bolster the immune system and a dramatic increase in the number of available ther apeutic agents/services; \"Designing out\" disease in some case s by gene therapy interventions in the underlying malfunctions in protein production; and \"Designing out\" disease by attacking the social and environmental risk factors in communities. The Future of Health Outcomes: WHO's \"Health For All\" From our perspective at IAF and our for-profit consulting s ubsidiary Alternative Futures Associates, the most advanced and ambitious realization of the Forecast, Prevent and Manage concept is found in WHO's vision of \"Heal th For All.\" We believe Health For All represents an emerging \"gold st andard,\" not for clinical trials, but for defining health, and one which increasingly will guide outcomes. Health For All is, in itself, a moving target; WHO recognizes this and has revised and revitalized the vision in the last two years. But fundamentally, it represents a broad global pe rspective on \"goodness\" in health, and a blueprint for achieving that visi on. Under Health For All, health includes conventional status measures but also social values which WHO argues are essential to achieving health, including equity, solidarity, ethics, gender and human rights.28 Thus, our essential point in this section is that the definition of \"health\" is likely to broaden and that WHO's vision of Health For All is IAF's candidate for a \"North Star\" or compass for considering the broader contribut ions or outcomes of health care systems. To the extent this forecast proves accura te, the tools for measuring health outcomes, such as HEDIS for health system measur es or SF-36 for measuring consumer satisfaction, will come to include measures of these broader values. And health care providers will be held accountabl e to this broader standard. Population Health and the Healthy Cities/Communities Movement The Forecast, Prevent and Manage paradigm will be applied primarily to individuals, but parallel approaches will be used at the comm unity level. A worldwide movement for \"healthy communities\" is emerging to addr ess poverty, crime, environmental damage and other social ills. The healthy communities movement is one of the most significant social inventions of the last 15 years, and the next 15 years will see an intensification of these redesign efforts.29 Chapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-24 In the United States, many regional and local health care systems have begun using healthy-community approaches. The American Ho spital Association, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Catholic Health Asso ciation have united in a $6 million effort to recognize and reward community-based health effo rts. At the state le vel, the Colorado Trust has for several years been operating a statewide program of community-based health promotion. In addition, the local chapters of many national associations are encouraging their members to take part in these efforts.30 And a national coalition of healthy-community efforts has been form ed\u2014Coalition for Healthier Cities and Communities (USA).31 Many experts feel we can design health ca re systems that produce dramatic health gains for all Americans at two-thirds or less of the cost of our current system. This, for example, was part of the original vision fo r the health care system in Celebration, Florida, developed by Walt Disney Co. and Fl orida Hospital. This approach leads to larger design questions. Leland Kaiser, for exam ple, argues that as we design our \"life spaces,\" we can \"design out\" the elements in our communities that contribute to ill health. In the process, he argues, we will recogni ze that the \"redesign of America is our primary social agenda for the next 100 years.\" 32 Health care providers, including chiropractors , will have to work at two levels to promote community health. At the individual leve l, many will have to develop additional treatments or resources to help consumers address the sources of ill health (e.g., strengthening a person's emotional coping skills or developing a referral network to help consumers address these factors). In those communities with the will and capacity to redesign their health care delivery systems, practitioners will need to become part of the \"design team\" in the process moving their own pr actices from a competitive to a collaborative model. Also, health care approac hes may need to include family members or groups. Outcomes-Driven Winners The shifts described above, culminating in a Forecast, Prev ent and Manage paradigm, will \"shake out\" the market for chiropractors as well as all other providers, conventional and CAA. For chiropractors, this shift has th e potential to be the be st or the worst of worlds. If the outcomes for chir opractic health care, discuss ed below, continue to show effectiveness for complaints such as heada ches, digestive problems and asthma, for example, its patient base will expand. On the other hand, if efficacy studies show that chiropractic is not competitively cost-effe ctive, an outcomes-driven health care system will have little room for the pr ofession. Optimizing health gains should become the focus of chiropractors, both to best apply spinal m anipulation, but also to deploy the other approaches, such as lifestyle and behavio ral coaching, most effectively. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-25 Beyond Health Care: Wellness Visits Chiropractic (along with certain other C AAs, like homeopathy and Chinese medicine) has high potential for enhancing prevention and \"wellness,\" and hence for out-of-pocket purchases not tied directly to outcomes or, for that matter, to medical need. Rather, these services are sought as a repeat purc hase of something the consumer has found to be valuable. Part of the demand for such wellness services is related to the \"high- touch\" nature of chiropractic and the degree of positive relationship between patient and provider. Allopathic providers, too, are showing a growing in terest in providing wellness visits. Prominent news storie s of physicians changing their practice to provide more CAAs and more \"high-touch,\" out-of- pocket care, reinforce this trend.33 Many people view chiropractic or massage services as they would the services of a spa, gym or fitness club. As noted in Chapter 4 below, it is estimated that between 14% and 35% of current demand for chiropractic serv ices are routine maintenance or wellness visits, not related to an immediate complaint. This is a very different model than the one focused on \"appropriate services\" from a health care system. By analogy, the calculus a consumer uses to decide whether to buy a membership in a health or fitness club (anot her \"wellness\" decision) is different from the outcome measures used to rate health care. The capacity of consumers to make wise choices will improve in either case, but their calculus for \"wellness visits\" will remain fundamentally separate from t hat for their treatment choices. For many chiropractors in 2010, wellness servic es will constitute a significant portion of their business. The questions that determi ne \"appropriateness\" in the managed care context should not be applied here. Yes, c onsumers should be protected from fraud, and they should know who the best providers are. But they should be able to spend their discretionary resources on wellness servic es of their choice, much as they choose to spend their discretionary income on health clubs. The trends toward smarter markets noted above will mean that c onsumers will be able to buy with greater assurance and will pay more attention to wellness. The \"repo rt cards\" available to consumers will help them choose among local providers. Significantly, level of demand for wellness se rvices will be a key determinant of whether chiropractors face an oversupply in 2010 (see Chapters 4 and 6). CONSUMER HEALTH CARE AND SELF-CARE Above, we discussed the paradigm shifts shaki ng up health care. In this section we will focus on equally profound shifts in how co nsumers pursue health and health care. As with the overarching syst emic changes, consumer trends present both threats and opportunities for chiropractors. Table 2-6 summarizes these. Chapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-26 Table 2-6: Implications of C onsumer Trends for Chiropractic Threat Opportunity Smarter markets: proof of efficacy; broader demands Findings of low efficacy of chiropractic for conditions beyond lower back pain decrease demand for services Proves competitive for a broad variety of conditions; providers leverage satisfied patient base as part of demonstrating efficacy Dissatisfaction with all health care providers Loss of business due to narrow view of chiropractic scope of treatment and negative image of profession Consumers turn to chiropractic high-touch approach Evolving demands Chiropractors remain limited in scope of practice Chiropractors meet wellness, public and community health needs Changing demographic: aging population Chiropractors are not viewed as contributing to aging Chiropractors serve as primary care health coaches for the elderly Source: IAF, 1997 Smarter Markets Health care is a marketplace, but it has seldom operated very efficiently. Consumers are less informed or powerful than is organi zed health care. Consumers often find it difficult to make informed choi ces attuned to their values. This will change. We are entering an era of \"smarter markets,\" in which consumers will be able to make very intelligent choices that accord with their values. As noted in the outcomes discussion above, broader values, su ch as equity, will be applied to the outcomes of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. And \"report cards\" on local providers will enable consumers to know both the \"batting average\" of each provider in treating disease, as well as the provider's values in relating to his or her community, environment and employees. This shift to smarter markets is being accele rated by numerous factors. The long era of \"doctor as unquestioned authority\" is coming to an end. Dissatisfaction with providers, concerns over access to managed care and innovations in health and information technology are shaping a new breed of health care consumer. Health care information and education are becoming so prevalent that lay people can educate themselves quickly and easily and conduct informed \"c omparison shopping\" of treatments and providers. Increasingly, this information is becoming available on-line and/or through The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 2: Trends: Health Care Demand, Institute for Alternative Futures Financing and Delivery 2-27 expert systems designed to bring medical ex pertise to consumers in their homes. By 2010, the nationwide movement for be tter accountability and outcome measures originally impelled by large health care buyers will have raised consumer awareness and knowledge by another order of magnitude. Consumers in our focus groups shared a high level of dissatisfaction with allopathic medicine. They viewed allopathic physi cians as too expensive, having uncertain outcomes, neglecting the patient 's overall health and well-bei ng and having a low-touch, impersonal approach. HMO organizations es pecially were characterized as too impersonal and their doctors as failing to spend enough time wit h patients. HMOs' assembly-line approach to medicine is one of the chief reasons many Americans\u2014 roughly one-third in 1990\u2014are using some form of CAA approach and have begun looking at alternative providers for their health needs. 34 From Consumer to Prosumer: Managed Self-Care At least four trends are convergi ng in favor of self-care: Consumers' own willingness to take charge of their health; Growing desire among providers to encourage self-car e (so-called demand management); Political pressure from managed care or ganizations in support of self-care; and Growing, effective tools that enable su ccessful self-care, e.g. books, telephone support, expert systems. As a result, more and more consumers are providing their own care\u2014becoming, as futurist Alvin Toffler terms it, \"prosume rs\": providers and consumers simultaneously. 35 The largest proportion of health care always has been self-care, but with the proliferation of knowledge and knowledge tools, consumer s are closing in on the knowledge and sophistication of professionals. Within the pr ovider community as well, expertise is moving from specialist physician s to general practitioners to nurses and other health care providers. These tr ends will have enormous consequences for health care by 2010. Thus, that category of people who in the past we re called \"patients\" will in the future be recognized as sophisticated health care consumer s. The culmination of this model is the \"patient as healer\" concept, in which the pati ent directs her/his rela tionship with health care professionals. Physicians, including DC s, will need to learn to see the doctor- patient relationship as one element in a spec trum of resources used by the patient, and be ready to assist with coordinat ion among providers and approaches. Chapter 2. Trends: Health Care Demand, The Future of Chiropractic Financing and Delivery Institute for Alternative Futures 2-28 Information Technology and Self-Care By 2010 the information revolution will have permeated homes and workplaces even more than today. Home/self-care will be dr amatically enhanced by electronic systems and devices provided to consumers by thei r health care practitioners. Likewise, companies such as Health Magic, descri bed above, will sell packages of health care services, often tailored based on the data in the patient's lifelong health record and coordinated with his or her health care provider. The implications of these converging forces are discussed in the forecast Self-Managed Care 2010, below in Chapter 3. So far, information systems have made limited inroads into the practice of CAAs. CD- ROM databases for chiropractors, homeopaths and acupuncturists exist, but their use is limited. Most practitioners are in the early st ages of computerizing their practices. This trend will advance considerably in the next ten y ears, reshaping delivery of professional services as well as self-care behavior. H ealthCompass, Health Magic's product for lifelong health record keeping and related services, augurs this advancement. As noted, HealthCompass includes access to interact ive software for stress management for use by health care providers. Once these systems are market-tested, versions for consumers will follow. The expert systems designed to aid consumer s with self-care will also link them to services that help select from among myri ad CAAs. As with other aspects of health care, these home-based expert systems will a llow consumers to customize the software to their genetic profile, personal prefer ences, health conditions and treatment experience.

This chapter continues the discussion of trends , beginning with a consideration of how advances in genomics, nanotechnology and high- tech information systems are radically altering conventional health care (in some ca ses, bringing it into line with time-honored CAA techniques for customizing pr eventive and therapeutic approaches). Ultimately, we conclude, the future belongs to \"integrated therapeutics,\" combining new technologies, conventional medicine and CAAs , including chiropractic, in regimens custom-fashioned to the individual. We also consider managed care and its dynamic relationship with chiropractic and other CAAs. This leads into a discussion of trends affe cting health care professionals, conventional and chiropractic, including changes in training and credentialing and, we posit, the danger of overproduction of chiropractors by 2010. Finally, we consider the important role of chiropractic beyond treating illness or health problems\u2014as a form of wellness service, paid for by consumers largely out-of-pocket. In the next chapter, we discuss the implicat ions of the trends considered in Chapters 2 and 3 for the chiropractic profession. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES FROM THE CONVENTIONAL VIEW By 2010, therapeutic and preventive practices w ill be dramatically different from today's. In this section we review five of the most significant advances in therapeutics and prevention: genomics, nanotechnology, the info rmation revolution in health care, the customization or personalization of health ca re and, finally, where chiropractic and other CAAs merge most visibly with conventional therapies in integrated therapeutics. As with the other trends discussed in this report, technological advances carry both threats and opportunities for chir opractors. See Table 3-1. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-3 Table 3-1: Implications of Selected Technological Advan ces for Chiropractic Threat Opportunity Genomics Health care becomes even more high-technology focused and reinforces the dominance of allopathic care Musculoskeletal uniqueness can be proven, with implications for customizing manipulation; chiropractors are involved in identifying this and integrate its information into their practice Information Revolution Consumers have greater self-care capacity; this may reinforce CAAs that compete with manipulation; non-chiropractors (and DCs) can use virtual reality to learn manipulation more quickly; expert systems become effective \"back health\" coaches for consumers Chiropractors can spend more time and cost- effectively expand their offerings beyond manipulation using expert systems; DCs use info technology to collect and to improve their outcomes; expert systems may be designed to alert patients to when they have a subluxation or other problem that would benefit from a visit to a chiropractor Automated spinal manipulation Technology evolves to the point where machines can accomplish spinal manipulation more cheaply than visiting the chiropractor Spinal manipulation, including the value of the DC's touch, cannot be done by a machine Integrated Therapeutics, such as Dean Ornish's program Manipulation is less favored in the integrated packages; or it is co-opted by other, non-DC, providers Manipulation is proven an important component, and DCs can prove they provide higher outcomes from their manipulation Source: IAF, 1997 Genomics Just as evolving health care markets and t he expanding definition of health will present certain threats and opportunities to all health care providers, so innovations in biomedical knowledge, technology and telecommunications will change therapeutics and prevention. Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-4 The mapping of the human genome by 2005 or sooner will profoundly affect health care. Genomics\u2014the study of genetics and it s application to health care\u2014has crucial implications for both conventional health ca re and CAAs. It will allow us to understand the genetic proclivities to many diseases, as well as how various genetic proclivities interact with a person's curr ent condition and environment. Simultaneously, technology will make these advances far more accessible to individuals and their health care providers. For ex ample, \"gene chips\"\u2014computer chips that instantly analyze the distinctive pattern of genes active in a given disease or condition based on a small sample of blood or saliva\u2014will come into play. The related learning process will sweep asid e traditional disease categories, replacing the old taxonomy with a far more powerful , complex one consisting of families of genetically defined subtypes of disease. The first gene chips, designed to analyze ce rtain cancers, will become available over the next several years. Soon individuals will be able to put a few of their cells on a gene chip scanner and quickly test for scores of different diseases. Looking ahead 20 or 30 years, it may be possible to build a \"human model on a chip\"\u2014that is, a chip with DNA representing all of the appr oximately 100,000 human genes, al lowing characterization of a broad spectrum of diseases. 1 This analysis will be complicated by our deeper understanding of the relationship between the \"coding regions\" which have been determined to carry the genetic instructions , the \"control regions\" which affect the expression of the coding regions and the \"sil ent regions\" of the gene, whose role has not yet been determined. Gene chips will make individual genetic profil ing, or genotyping, possible at reasonable cost. This will allow individuals to know, with some level of statistica l precision, if they are predisposed to certain diseases. Several predispositional tests for individual diseases will become available over the next few years and our \"DNA profile\" or \"genetic profile\" will become an integral part of medical records within a decade. 2 Between now and 2020, health care will evolve to a higher stage of customized care in which therapeutic selection will be precisely tailored to individual biochemistry. Today, for example, many physicians advise all pat ients with hypertension to go onto low-salt diets, even though this helps only a minority of patients. Myriad Genetics is currently evaluating a test for mutants of the AGT gene, which codes for a protein that regulates salt retention. If hypertension patients with AGT mutants are helped by a low-salt diet, physicians will be able to use Myriad's AGT test to identify people who will actually benefit from salt restriction.3 The drug discovery and development process also will be accelerated and fundamentally redesigned over the decade ahead in response to progress in genomics (see Chapter 2 on Clinical Development). There will be a dramatic increase in the number of effective therapeutic agents.4 In fact, genomics will produce new generations The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-5 of antibiotics, potentially stemming a global h ealth crisis caused by the proliferation of bacteria resistant to conventional antibiotics.5 Genomics will open up a new field of immunotherapy, based on novel methods for fighting diseases by enlisting the cells of the body's own immune system. For example, in February 1997 Professor David Wallack and his colleagues at the Membrane Research and Biophysics Department of the Weizmann Institute in Israel reported in Nature the discovery of a gene, called NIK, that helps remove a \"molecular brake\" that keeps the immune response in check. Walla ck's team believes the discovery will lead to drugs that enhance and regulate the immune response. 6 DNA vaccines will begin to be available over the next five to ten years and are likely to be universally adopted before 2020. They will be far superior to traditional vaccines: safer; more effective at conferring both hum oral and cellular immunity; effective against a broader spectrum of pathogens and able to c onfer long-term immunity with a single dose. It will be possible to inject genes from multiple pathogens at the same time, creating new kinds of broad-spectrum vaccines. 7 Some chiropractors and other critics charge that vaccines are already overus ed and effectively require people to put themselves and their children at risk, against t heir will. As with other therapies each will increasingly be forced to show cost-effectiv e outcomes in order to be used. Assuming these vaccines are cost-effective, the side- effects question may also be able to be dealt with. Genomics will enable us to identify, for many drugs and procedures, who is most susceptible to particular side effects of medications. Another emerging therapy that will be us eful in the treatment and prevention of infectious disease is called \"antisense.\" Essentially, antisense t herapies are compounds designed to block selected gene functions by genetically engineering proteins that are opposite to the proteins needed for cell division. Antisense is anticipated to come into common use to attack bacterial, viral, cancer and other diseases driven by cells that replicate. 8 Gene therapy will emerge between now and 2020 as one of the truly revolutionary developments in the history of medicine, com parable in its impacts to the introduction of microscopy, anesthesia, vaccination or antibio tics. The first concrete results are likely within the next few years, in the area of gene-based cancer immunotherapies.9 In all cases, these biotech-related advances will have to stand the tests of efficacy and cost- effectiveness. Advances in genetics will create new in teractions between chiropractors and conventional medicine. For example, chiropr actors will need to discover how to utilize the information that a patient is predisposed to certain diseases, and how to work with other health care providers as well as thei r patients to maximize the new opportunities. Research on how herbs, biologicals and dietary supplements affect gene function and vice versa has already begun and is being used by some practitioners. The \"Customization\" section below considers some of these implications, including those areas where conventional health care will learn from CAAs. Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-6 Nanotechnology: A Wild Card in Health Care In considering the future of health care, one of the biggest \"wild cards\" is the potential development of nanotechnology\u2014ultra-tiny te chnology on the scale of nanometers, or billionths of a meter. If viable nanotec hnology emerges over the decades ahead, its impacts on health care would be greater than any past technological development in the history of medicine.10 Nanomedicine applications are likely to begin outside the body. Nonintrusive diagnostics, for example, is an area where n anotechnology is likely to be put to early use. A biosensor using a nano-scale ion channel as a transduction device has recently been developed in Australia; hand-held testing devices using this technology may be on the market by the year 2000. This could al low easy screening of body fluids such as blood for a variety of elements, similar to that now done in hospital labs. Another important early medical use of nanotechnology might be to radically increase the quality and cut the cost of pharmaceutical manufacturing. While the earliest medical uses of nanotec hnology will be outside the body, the most powerful uses will be within it. Nanodevices coul d give us very precise levels of control in interactions with tissues and even with individual cells. Immune machines are one of the most important potential applications . These nanodevices would travel through the bloodstream and supplement the natural immune system, finding and disabling unwanted bacteria and viruses. Imagine machines smaller than blood cells that have computer power comparable to today's main frames, huge databases of a billion bits or more, instrumentation to identify biologica l surfaces and devices for destroying the undesired viruses, bacteria or other forei gn material they encounter. Unlike natural immune systems, which have to be exposed to invaders to develop defenses against them, nanotech immune machines could be programmed to protect against any viruses or diseases that have been identified in world medicine. Another kind of device, cell herding ma chines, could be used to stimulate and supplement the body's own tissue construc tion and repair mechanisms. Cooperating teams of cell herding machines could prom ote rapid healing of wounds, ensuring that cells form healthy patterns and surround themselves with the proper intercellular-matrix materials. Nanodevices could be designed to clean out and reinforce the structure of blood vessels, or to repair joints, strengt hen bones, remove scar tissue or fill tooth cavities with natural dentin and enamel. It is conceivable that nanotechnologies could produce fundamental cures for many of the diseases currently facing conventional and CAA providers. As nanotechnology advances, nanomedicine will mo ve from tissue repair to operating in the interior of cells. Cell repair machines much smaller than a cell could work as \"nanosurgeons,\" sensing and repairing damaged parts of cells, closing them up and moving on to others. We would gain the ability to kill viruses, like AIDS, which attach to the genetic material within cells and remain dormant for long periods. We could repair The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-7 cellular damage caused by chemicals or r adiation. Genetic surgery would become a simple procedure, possibly accomplished by swallowing a tiny pill. Any forecast of the time when nanotechnologi es will be effectively operating inside the body is at best an informed guess. The strongest proponents of nanotechnology believe it is about 20 years away, give or take 10 years. The strongest critics dismiss it as several generations away and perhaps an impossi ble dream. If the optimists turn out to be correct, nanomedicine could be changing every aspect of health care between 2010 and 2020. And, as other observers point out , nanotechnology is virtually certain to generate significant unintended consequences or side effects. There are also serious negative potentials from nanotechnology used as a weapon in the hands of terrorists. 11 If nanomedicine were possible, it is likely t hat some forms of reprogramming spinal problems could be developed. But such possi bilities from nanotechnology, or from genomics for that matter, are questioned by some. For example, some readers familiar with CAAs may feel that acupuncture, chiropractic , homeopathic remedies or \"remembered wellness\" have a similar, if less breathless, role in stimulating the immune system or repairing damage, and that thes e modalities already have decades or centuries of experience from which to evaluat e side effects. This observation raises an appropriate question about where priorities should be placed in health care innovation. Genomics and nanotechnology will be pursued and will need to be tested simultaneously and in parallel with CAAs an d other avenues of innovation. Marketplace and government policy mechanisms do not yet effectively focus on the most encouraging and cost-effective approaches, though as the market becomes more focused on outcomes this is likely to change. However, as noted above in the discussion of outcomes, we will also increasingly judge health innovations in relation to broader outcomes, such as their ability to provide the greatest health gains in sustainable ways and to generate both greater health and greater health equity. Information Revolution in Health Care The \"Information Revolution\" is transforming our society and inevitably will have a major impact on the health care system. For exam ple, as noted above, emerging information technologies will vastly improve the maint enance and dissemination of medical records, allow treatment outcomes to be evaluated systematically, enable new kinds of health information systems to support prevention and self-care in homes and help customize care to an individual's biochemical uniqueness. A major new field of health informatics is developing to realize these possibilities. Health services suitable to be performed in or delivered to homes or local health centers include: Information for prevention, self-diagnosis and self-care; Personalized \"health coaching\"; Body function monitoring; Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-8 \"Electronic house calls\" for consulta tion between health care professionals and patients; Sophisticated management of chronic diseases; Support for convalescence from acute care; Support groups for patients with similar conditions; Supervision and training for home care workers; and Consumer information services rating healt h care providers, doctors and treatments. Note that many of these services are al ready available. All will become commonly available for effective home use between 2000 and 2010. The development of expert systems, ex tensive and easy-to-use knowledge bases, video interfacing and the Internet have already begun to impact health care. 12 Soon the Internet will allow medical records to be shared worldwide by authorized parties; better health information to be made accessible to more people; sophisticated expert systems to aid in diagnosing disease and ma naging health; and enhanced recruitment of volunteers locally and globally. Electr onic search agents (\"knowbots\") will be programmed to prowl the Net seeking specific information and continually updating their users on health topics of interest.13 Already companies such as Epic Systems Corporation of Madison, Wisconsin, offer In ternet-accessible medical records. Health Magic, as noted, offers its HealthCompass service, which links an electronic medical record to a variety of other health servic es and information\u2014creating a lifelong personal health record. Consumers in the focus groups for this st udy expressed strong concern about privacy issues stemming from the application of info rmation technology to health care. This is an instance in which technology could advance faster than society's ability to deal with the changes it spawns. Protecting confidentia lity is a key concern for developers of these systems and most are confident of the technical capacity to maintain privacy and security. Consumers, meanwhile, would prefer to err on the side of caution in this arena. And there has been some discussion in Washington about slowing down the availability of the \"gene chip\" tests described above unt il legislative protections can be enacted to ensure that genetic information will not be us ed to discriminate against individuals. Expert Systems Expert systems are software programs that, backed by databases, simulate the judgment of experts. They will play an in creasing role in both synthesizing and decentralizing information for health care prof essionals, e.g., from specialist physicians to general practitioners or nurses. For cons umers, expert systems will take the best medical knowledge and make it available for hom e use. Ultimately, they will customize and personalize the material they present to fit the learning style, interest and knowledge levels of each user. Furthermore , the software will be linked to personal biomonitoring devices as well as the consum er's own medical records, including alert systems that kick in when the biodata sugge sts something needs attention. Consumer and professional training and learning, too, will be accelerated.14 The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-9 Automated Electronic Health Coaches As mentioned above, expert systems will make it possible for anyone with a computer to have a virtual \"health coach.\" These expe rt systems could be programmed with a \"personality\" that suits the individual user . For example, a family's health coach could speak and interact differently with each mem ber of the family depending on his or her age, level of understanding and personal pref erences. These coaches will monitor users' health status and help keep them on tr ack with their specified health goals (such as training for a marathon or losing ten pounds). Health coaches could be designed to interact with other electronic functions in a smart house\u2014for example, with the ingredient information on a person's grocery purchases, checking to make sure it is consistent with the buyer's tastes, health preferences and diet plan. They could also provide more immediate coaching for example, cautioning a dieter if he or she opens the freezer and starts to remove an ice cream bar!15 Biosensors/Biodata In two to five years, inexpensive hand-hel d biosensors will go into commercial production. These will allow simple detection of a wide range of diseases, within minutes, from a small sample, even a drop, of blood or saliva.16 The devices will proliferate rapidly in all health care settings and be used for a wide variety of applications, including cell typing and the detection of viruses, antibodies, large proteins, electrolytes, drugs, pesticides and other environmental contaminants. Hand- held biosensors will permit sophisticated analytical measurements to be undertaken at decentralized locations, from the hospital beds ide or the physician's office to the home. Within five to ten years, minimally invasive biosensors that do not require blood samples or IV insertion, combined with the use of hand-held sensors, will significantly impact the design and operation of hospitals and other health care facilities. Biosensors will eliminate the need for large laboratories, transporting samples within facilities or sending samples out for analysis. By 2010, a variety of inconspicuous, wearabl e biomonitoring tools will be available, such as wristwatch devices that monitor body functioning and communicate those data to local or remote data storage systems. The Defense Department's Advanced Research and Projects Agency (DARPA) has already devel oped prototypes of th is kind of device, which they call a Personal Status Monitor (PSM), for monitoring the location and physical status of troops on t he battlefield. The ability to perform complex biomedical analyses, administer appropriate medications and monitor responses will eventually turn PSMs into virtual \"Hospitals-on-the-Wris t.\" As portable biomonitoring devices become more sophisticated and reliable and are integrated with electronic medical records and expert systems, HMOs and other providers are likely to routinely provide them to their patients. Sophisticated monitoring devices will gener ate interesting challenges for some CAA modalities that do not rely on conventiona l biochemical markers in understanding body Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-10 function, or that disagree with the treatm ent protocols suggested by these devices. At minimum, CAA practitioners will need to le arn how to interpret the information generated by these devices or when to cons ult a practitioner who works with this technology. As noted in the \"Customization\" discussion below, the lessons on phenotyping which some CAAs have developed over the centuries are likely to be utilized in interpreting the results of this biomonitoring. Telemedicine Telemedicine is the application of informatio n technology to the practice of medicine, eliminating the barriers of distance. Applicatio ns include remote surgery, where a doctor performs surgery via a robotic arm that is controlled by a computer, and distance diagnosis. Remote chiropractic using robotic arms is not out of the question. Distance diagnosis will enable chiropractors and ot her doctors to confer with patients via interactive video screens. The doctor will not onl y have access to the patient's electronic medical records, but will be able to talk to the patient in real-time no matter where that patient may be. In the years ahead, \"virtual medical cent ers\" may use telemedicine to deliver sophisticated medical services to persons in re mote areas. It will also become feasible, using \"data gloves,\" for a physical exam or, in theory, a spinal manipulation to be conducted remotely. Telemedicine provides significant opportuni ties\u2014although part of the backlash against managed care stems from the insufficient personal contact it affords between health care providers and patients. The rising us e of CAAs is partly due to the enhanced personal, hands-on, contact consumers re ceive from chiropractors and other CAA providers. Thus, telemedicine will compete w here it is most effective, and hands-on and face-to-face care will do likewise. Consider the analogy of ATM machines: some people still miss seeing the bank teller or don't tr ust the machines, but for most people ATMs have become the first stop for cash. Customization of Health Care A major trend within conventional health care springs from the concurrent arrival of genomics, longitudinal data banks and in tegrated health care\u2014namely, the customization of care to subgroups in the population and, ultimately, personalization to each person's unique biochemistry. Over the years, medical science has had scattered and incomplete awareness of the great physical difference between one human being and another. Roger Williams, a professor of chem istry and Director of the Biochemical Institute at the University of Texas, w ho coined the phrase \"biochemical uniqueness,\" spent 40 years\u2014before the adv ent of genomics\u2014studying individuals' responses to nutrients and medications. 17 Williams discovered that multiple factors shape a person's response, including diet, previous illnesses and even where he or she grew up. Williams' work led to the observation that eac h of us has a \"chemical factory\" in our The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-11 body whose operation is as unique as our fin gerprints. Yet most conventional practice of medicine uses relatively little of th is information for personalized care. Now we are adding genomics to this search for the causes and patterns of uniqueness. And medical science is beginning to discover how genetic variations can play a role in therapeutics. For example, t he p450 gene regulates enzyme production, which in turn affects how pharmaceuticals are metabo lized and made available through the bloodstream. As these variations become know n, therapeutics, particularly drug dosing, will be guided more precisely. Why might this be important? The answer is two-fold: to increase the chance that therapeutics will work and to reduce the chanc e that they will harm. The potential for harm is commonplace in the current system of medication use in the United States, according to several leading researchers: 18 Four times as many Americans die eac h year from medication-related problems (over- and under-dosing of prescribed medications, adverse reactions, non-compliance, etc.) than die in automobile accidents; For every dollar spent on medications for am bulatory patients, an additional dollar is spent in treating preventable medication-related problems; On average, 10 of every 100 hospitalized patients at any given moment are there because of medication-related problems; and For every dollar spent on medications for patients in nursing homes, $1.33 in additional resources is consumed in tr eating medication-related problems. Some portion of these costs can be traced to our current inability to forecast for whom medications are most likely to work and for whom they are likely to generate side effects. Williams discovered fr om his observations that we are biochemically unique. Genomics will help us better understand these differences. And companies are preparing to take advantage of this learni ng\u2014major new sectors of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are growi ng up around the insights afforded by genomics. 19 The new customization and personalizati on will be based on genotype and phenotype. \"Genotype\" refers to one's particular gene sequence. \"Phenotype,\" meanwhile, refers to physical, biochemical or behavioral characteri stics, as they are determined genetically and environmentally. Thus, genotype describes whether an individual or group has a specific gene or set of genes, while phenoty pe describes the expression of genes through the process of interaction with the environment. As customization and personalization evolve, it is important to identify their potential and limitations vis-\u00e0-vis other approaches. As T able 3-2 demonstrates, \"customization\" can refer to the blending of multiple therapeutic (or preventive) approaches into a combination tailored to the needs of a particula r individual. But the term can also refer to the development of a new remedy or drug. In the years ahead we may see \"designer Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-12 gene machines\" which allow individual drugs to be easily created for individual patients. This form of customization\u2014of specific products or drugs\u2014will appear much further down the road than the custom ization of a package of therapeutic approaches to an individual, using existing components. T hus, \"customization\" could also be called individualizing, personalizing or tailoring. As indicated in Table 3-2, each of these three terms could also be applied to the use of exis ting remedies or drugs in ways which are more sensitive to the individual than is ty pical in therapeutics based on \"normal\" or parametric statistics. Table 3-2: Terms for Developing More Individually Focused Preventive and Therapeutic Approaches Developing personally focused combinations of approaches Tailoring the nature, dose of an existing service or remedy Creating a new unique remedy or pill Customize x x Personalize Individualize Tailor x x Customization and personalizat ion will be driven by ever-growing knowledge banks of the clinically relevant differences among us (genes, behavior, physical or biochemical manifestations). This knowledge growth w ill be aided by the incorporation of time- honored CAA techniques for personalizing or individualizing therapies. Customization and CAAs The growing interest in customization by conventional medicine stems in part from its own tradition as a primarily empirical science\u2014focusing on specific and measurable dimensions of the human body an d its reactions to internal and external stimuli. This focus led to, among other things, the discovery of DNA and the rise of genomics with its implications for treating individuals. In certain CAAs, by contrast, the ability to customize diagnostics and care to individuals or groups of individuals has been a long-term, systematic focus. In fact, some CAAs have studied the diagnostic and therapeutic si gnificance of phenotypic differences for, not centuries, but millennia! Most leadi ng CAAs have developed elaborate \"phenotypic\" approaches for differentiating among indivi duals. These represent evidence-based observations over long periods of time: in Or iental medicine, for ex ample, as much as 2,500 years. Ayurvedic approaches, most common in India, use the \"dosha\" system to characterize individuals. Doshas can be thought of as beginning with body types (ectomorph, endomorph and mesomorph) and adding layers of information about emotional tendencies, intellectual styles and spiritual inclinations.20 Likewise, Oriental medicine Comment: Does chiropractic offer any system of customized diagnostics or therapeutics? If not, perhaps delete most of this section. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-13 and homeopathy have complex approaches to sub-grouping individuals phenotypically, apart from their specific disease diagnos is. Homeopathy considers persons having similar syndromes, e.g., migraine headaches, not as having the same disease, but as having similar symptoms pointing to deeper condi tions that might be radically different. Those deeper conditions usually cannot be treated by suppressing the symptoms, according to homeopathy. Thus, homeopathy inco rporates individualization of care by, for example, tailoring the migraine remedy to various phenotypic characteristics of the individuals being treated.21 Insights from mind/body approaches will also c ontribute to customization. One of the most popular discriminators, or phenotypic groupings, the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), is based on Carl Jung's observation t hat we all have different \"gifts\" in the way we process information and come to decisions. Some people focus on details, others on larger patterns; some operate analyt ically while others are more influenced by their values and beliefs; some tend to make judgments swiftly while others \"perceive,\" often waiting for more information before comi ng to a decision. The resulting differences have been shown to be important in how individuals operate at work and in their relationships. They are also likely to be s hown to have clinical relevance in a range of diseases or health conditions. The bottom line? Conventional health care increasingly will use \"customization\" or personalization of preventive or ther apeutic approaches, based on genotype and phenotype, to win the greatest benefit and cause t he least harm. Research into clinically relevant differences is likely to include appr oaches already present in CAAs. This will raise the complexity of our understanding, and challenge current regulatory approaches. For example, how should drug regulation change if we can identify various factors, say from the phenotypic categories of Oriental m edicine, that consist ently predict if a medication will be successful? How do you c onduct clinical trials where the population universe of a given genotype or phenotype, thoug ht to be relevant for that trial, is relatively small? It will also make the development of outcome measures even more complex. Integrated Therapeutics: Dean Ornish and Heart Disease More will be said on CAAs and their growing role in health care below, but before we leave this section on therapeutics in conventional health care it is essential to note that by 2010 effective therapeutics will integrate conventional modalities and CAAs for both treatment and prevention. \"Integrated ther apeutics,\" melding the most appropriate techniques of conventional medicine and CAAs , will be well on their way to becoming the norm. In the 1990s this trend is already visible. For example, in the area of heart disease, one of the most important advances in conventional medicine is the growing acceptance of \"integrated therapeutics\" through the work of physicians such as Dean Ornish, a physician and professor at the University of California at San Francisco. Ornish has developed a program for reversing heart diseas e which integrates diet and lifestyle, Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-14 including personal growth or spirituality. The program is not anti-pharmaceutical, but generally uses few or none.22 Ornish argues that his program can reverse cancer, although this possibility is not yet confirmed. Many CAAs include a range of diet, exercise and mental or spiritual work similar to Ornish's. Ornish's program is a likely future paradigm for treating and preventing heart disease and, if his expectati ons are borne out, cancer. His success is likely to spur the advancement of integrated ther apeutics. Awareness of his ap proach in the health press, and even the popular press, is growing: Ornish was featured on the cover of Newsweek in February 1998. He is bringing out a line of foods consistent with his low-fat dietary recommendations. As with most therapies, some aspects of Ornish's program may not work for everyone and side effects are possible. A recent NEJM \"Clinical Debate\" documents the current level of disagreement regarding low-fat diet s, for instance. While most researchers agree that reducing saturated fat intake is wise, some disagree over whether the decrease in saturated fat intake should be replaced by a parallel increase in other fats or by an increase in non-fats such as car bohydrates. Scientists disagree on the impacts of these types of diets on the blood level of LDL cholesterol.23 In the end, it is likely that genotype and phenotype revelations will help us understand who is most likely to benefit from therapies like these, and for w hom they might be useless or even harmful. Customization and Integrated Therapeutics Meanwhile, experiments in integrated and customized therapeutics are expanding. Nutritional expert Jeffrey Bland, founder and CEO of HealthComm International in Gig Harbor, Washington, has developed a produc t for nutritional modulation of liver detoxification. Interacting with each us er's \"biochemical uniqueness,\" the product contains macro-, micro- and accessory nut rients that support th e restoration of functional detoxification capabilities in each user.24 In the cancer arena, Keith Block, a Ch icago-area MD, has created a program that enables him to better individualize treatment regimens for his patients. Before developing a treatment program, Block creates a biomedical profile, psychosocial profile Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease The Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company made Dr. Dean Ornish's program for reversing heart disease a reimbursable benefit for patients with coronary disease covered under its major medical policy in 1993. The program uses diet, meditation, exercise and support groups to reverse heart di sease. Fifty percent of patients who have been through the program have avoided bypass surgery altogether. Mutual of Omaha is currently funding a three-year, $500,000 study of the outcomes of the program to determine its cost-effectiveness.

The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-15 (including a patient-needs profile, attitudinal profile, stress level profile and learning profile), biochemical profile and biomec hanical profile. Based upon the outcomes of these detailed studies of his patient, Block individualizes a nutritional program including diet change and nutritional supplements. Acco rding to Michael Lerner, Block's approach is a \"model that could fit easily into the mainstream practice of hematology-oncology.\"25 By 2010 we will be much farther along in un derstanding how to integrate CAAs with conventional medicine and to customize and per sonalize the resulting mixtures to the individual. COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES IN US HEALTHCARE Many HMOs are changing the definition of \"traditional\" providers to include CAA providers, including chiropractors, acupunc turists and homeopaths. As these so-called alternative therapies and professionals becom e more mainstream, they will in turn broaden and change the conventional definition of health care. In medical education, 34 of the nation's 125 medical schools currently offer programs in alternative therapies; 23% of all family medicine programs have courses in alternative therapies.26 In 1997 over $10 million in research funds was available for interdisciplinary studies on alternative therapies from the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) at the National Institutes of Health. Insurers, Managed Care and CAAs Insurance companies are seeking to meet consumers' interest in CAAs. A recent assessment of the status of managed care and insurance coverage of CAAs, and the integration of such services at hospitals, found a majority of the insurers offering coverage for one or more of the following m odalities: chiropractic, nutrition counseling, biofeedback, psychotherapy, acupuncture, preventive medicine, osteopathy and physical therapy. Some of the insurers indi cated that market demand was a major factor in their decision to provide this coverage. But continuation of the coverage depends on the cost-effectiveness of these therapies based on consumer interest, demonstrable efficacy and state mandates. Some hospitals are also responding to cons umer interest in CAAs, although they can only offer those therapies for which local, licensed practitioners are available. Among the most common obstacles listed to incorpor ating CAAs into mainstream health care were lack of research on efficacy, ec onomics, ignorance about CAAs, provider competition and divisiveness and, finally, la ck of standards and practice guidelines. The authors of this recent assessment, l ed by Kenneth Pelletier, concluded that outcomes (for both allopathic and CAA t herapies) \"are needed to help create a health Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-16 care system based upon treatments that work, whether they are mainstream, complementary or alternative.27\" Managed care programs are providing access to more CAAs, as consumer choice becomes a driving force in that industry.28 For example, United Health Care, which insures 5% of the US population and controls over 20% of the managed care market, recently announced the launching of a pilot program to offer limited acupuncture benefits and a cafeteria-style approach to chiropractic care. United is striving to integrate CAAs into their benefit offeri ng via limited clinical integration and the development of alternative medical procedure codes.29 Oxford Health Plans has likely made a major commitment to including CAAs, based on the demands of their customers. Purchasers/Employers and CAAs Health care purchasers, particularly employ ers, will continue to focus on ensuring that appropriate care is delivered to the individual in a cost-effective manner. Benefits managers will compare outcomes across differ ent health plans and include those plans that offer the services and practitioners their employees are demanding, and which have appropriate outcomes and costs. Many employers are already demanding that plans cover acupuncture and chiropractic care. According to health care experts, enactme nt of the Kennedy-Kassebaum Bill of 1997 might change how some employers approach em ployee health benefits. The portability of health coverage may force providers to be even more responsive to consumer demands and may allow employers to offer a broader array of health benefit packages. Integrating Insurance Coverage Chiropractors could be strongly affected by t he integration of medical, occupational and auto accident insurance, which some experts believe will be a reality by 2010. Currently, injury from an auto accident or a job-related accident relevant to worker's compensation is handled differently than injuries that occur in other venues. In reality these injuries are not different; they are just treated differently , in part because of the different insurance coverage for each. In an integrated model , the insurance company (or managed care provider) would assume payment for treatment of any injury regardless of where or when it occurred.30 Given the role of auto and occupational injuries in chiropractic patient load, this could have a negative effect on the demand for chir opractic services. Alternatively, if chiropractic can demonstrate its cost-effectiveness, it has an opportunity to maintain or enlarge its work in these areas. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-17 PRIMARY CARE A recurring question facing chiropractors, along with certain other CAA providers, is whether they should be considered primar y care providers, by health insurers and managed care organizations as well as by pati ents. Primary care has multiple meanings and is itself evolving. It is important to cons ider where the concept of primary care is headed. A good place to start is the 1994 definition of primary care developed by the Institute of Medicine (IOM): Primary care is the provision of integr ated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing a large majority of personal health needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients and practicing in the contex t of family and community. 31 Several components of this definition repr esent change in conventional health care, which has strong implications for the ro le of chiropractors in primary care: Use of the term clinicians , rather than physicians\u2014This recognizes the relevance of non-physician providers and the need for all prov iders to be able and willing to work as a team. Accountable\u2014 Primary care providers will be res ponsible for addressing the majority of the individual's health needs, and their outcomes will be monitored. Developing sustained partnerships with patients \u2014The nature of partnerships between patients and their health care providers has received much greater attention in recent years, not only in this IOM definition but also in the work of the Fetzer Institute and the Pew Commissi on on the Health Professions. The Pew Commission's reports, Health Professions Education and Relationship-Centered Care , note that the practitioner/patient rela tionship should reinforce the patient's sense of coherence, including the understanding of how illness fits into the patient's life story. These reports provide guides fo r enabling relationships with both patients and the community. 32 This discussion includes a concern for inequalities in knowledge; for example, Daniel Redwood, a chiropractor, notes that in the chiropractic context doctors should offer \" patients opportunities for empowerment so that the inequality created by their specialized knowledge is not generalized to all aspects of their relations with patients.\" 33 Practicing in the context of family and community\u2014 The World Health Organization (WHO) and the movement in the United States to recognize community-oriented primary care (COPC) are reflected here. WHO launched \"Health For All\" in 1978, in a call that soon after was translated into a broad definition of primary care. As noted in the discussion of outcomes in C hapter 2, since 1995 WHO has undertaken a fundamental revision and revitalization of Heal th For All. As such, it is the most significant global health vision. The visi on now includes explicit commitments to social values such as equity, solidarity, ethics, gender and human rights. In terms of Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-18 Health For All, primary care includes a c oncern with the patterns of health status for the individual and the community, the st ate of the community's health services system and the delivery of appropriate services. With these broader definitions of primary ca re provided by IOM and WHO, chiropractors are challenged to incorporate epidemiologica l knowledge and approaches as they work on their individual patients, and to address the patient's family health and community health. The usual discussion about chiropractors an d primary care has revolved around the legitimate issues of whether consumers, through their insurance plans, should have direct access to chiropractors, and whether chiropractors are able and willing to handle the range of complaints that typically characte rize ambulatory, primary care visits. Many chiropractors already do consider themselves primary care providers, a perception that is shared by many of their patients. However, non-users of chiropractors focus on them as back specialists and the practice style of most chiropractors reinforces this. Chiropractors could make a concerted bid to be recognized as primary care providers, but would first need to ensure that they could deal with a broad range of patient complaints and were capable of and comfortable in referring patients to specialists as needed. As we look toward the 21 st century, primary care will also be affected by the shift to a \"Forecast, Prevent and Manage\" paradigm in health care. This paradigm poses a challenge to broaden the outcomes of prim ary care to encompass family and community, to minimize costs and to oper ate in an enriched information environment that enables customized and personalized therapeutic approaches and dramatically enhanced self-care. Enhanced informatic capacity alone will give certain providers the chance to operate effectively as primary care providers, with appropriate expert system backup allowing better knowledge of how to deal with typical primary care conditions and when and how to refer patients to others. Simultaneously, consumers will be able to\u2014and many will\u2014have this advanced informatic capacity at home. Many consum ers who do their taxes or financial planning on their home computers, by comparison, hav e changed their relationship with their tax preparer and financial planning consultant. Cons umers like these often seek a long-term coaching and review relationship with exper ts. In health care, as consumers become better-equipped, many will likely seek the same type of long-term relationship with their health care providers. Under our more positive long-term forecast s (see \"Health Care 2010,\" below), primary care providers will share accountability for the broad social outcomes envisioned in WHO's Health For All and IOM's definition of primary care. In the meantime there will be significant competition\u2014in the near ter m, often on the basis of cost alone. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-19 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS Momentous career issues face chiropractors today, especially how to face up to and contend with a looming oversupply of chiropr actors, and the decision of whether to more purposefully and clearly position themselves as primary care providers. Development of a shared vision, and preparing for changes in licensure and credentialing and the impingement of both conventionally trained MDs and non-MDs into spinal manipulation services, are other critical challenges. Potential Oversupply\u2014Physicians, Nurses, Pharmacists All health care professionals will face in creased competition for patients and clients in the future. The evolution of smarter mark ets, empowered health care consumers and surpluses in key medical professions (e.g., MDs, nurses) will all contribute to this increased competition. Briefly, the size of any health profession is driven by the combinatio n of student interest and demand (based on the attractiveness of the profession to students), and the size of the academic pipeline leading into the profe ssion. Both attractiveness and the size of the pipeline have grown to the point wher e the United States faces major potential surpluses of physicians, nurses and pharmacists. The Pew Commission Report on the Health Professions forecasts, by 2010, \"[over] supply of physicians of 100,000 to 150,000 as the demand for specialty care shrinks; nurses\u2014200,000 to 300,000 as hospitals close; and pharmacists\u201440,000 as the dispensing function of drugs is automated and centralized.\" 34 Current trends in medical school enrollments suggest that by 2010, the supply of physicians will rise 16% , contributing to the surplus of physicians forecast by the Pew Commission. Furthermo re, during the same period the number of alternative clinicians (chiropractors, naturop aths and doctors of Oriental medicine) will grow 88%. (Incidentally, as these shifts occur the ratio of alternative clinicians to total physician supply will increase from 11% to 17%.)35 Potential Oversupply of Chiropractors The oversupply of other types of providers, both conventional and CAA, is very relevant for chiropractors because many of these m edical professionals are choosing to study and offer spinal manipulation, either as a standalone service or to add a competitive edge to their repertoire of services. Chiropractic itself is expected to grow from 55,000 to 103,000 DCs in the United States by 2010. Demand for chiropractic services is likely to rise too, as evidence of its efficacy and cost-effectiveness accumulates and, beyond the health care model, as demand for \"wellness visits\" (already a significant percentage of visits to chiropractors) grows. Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-20 But managed care could slow this demand or ev en reduce it from current levels, at the same time that it expands access. To avoid an oversupply and absorb the projec ted rise in new chiropractors, demand for chiropractic will need to double by 2010. C an this occur? Some scenarios say yes; others no. Thus, the profession faces the serious possi bility that, by 2010, DCs may experience underemployment or unemployment. If the fi gures given above are supported by other estimates, the chiropractic profession might be well advised to reduce the number of new graduates, and soon. Dentistry and gas troenterology are two health professions that have consciously and, to some extent, successfully self-regulated their numbers in the face of oversupply, by discouraging new enrollments. Education and Training In most professions, surplu ses result from overproduction by schools, colleges and universities and are exacerbated by slowing growth or even declines in demand in the marketplace. Medical and health profession al schools seek to sell more of their \"services\"\u2014i.e., months or years in school both by producing more graduates and by requiring more training or schooling before the person begins practice. Degree inflation has occurred in fields such as pharmacy and nursing. While the complexity of pharmacists' and nurses' roles certainly has grown, there is no evidence that a pharmacist with four years (BS degree), five years (for many RPh degrees) or six years (PharmD degrees) of training is made any more effective by more years of schooling. Problems of surplus are exacerbated by federal support for Graduate Medical Education. And \"official\" analyses often ignore the issue of potential surpluses. Federal and some state policies support training for the health professions (though seldom for CAAs). It is appropriate and fair that schools of chiropractic and other CAAs produce appropriate numbers of graduates. Schools should give their graduates an accurate picture of the career landscape awaiting t hem. In order both to instill an academic awareness of the potential for surpluses, an d to give students a better sense of the future demands on their profession, health professional schools should routinely forecast key aspects of their environment and alternative scenarios for their profession. Equally important, according to IAF's expe rience with the health professions, they should commit to using these forecasts and scenarios both in coursework and in strategic planning for the institution and the profession. 36 Students should be aware of the most likely fu tures or scenarios for their profession for a period roughly equivalent to one professi onal lifetime: 20-50 years. Students and schools should have the capacity to monitor these forecasts in an ongoing way. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-21 Changes in Approaches to Learning In addition to forecasting change in the health professions themselves, education and training approaches for health professionals will evolve. In the future, learning increasingly will be structured around the needs of the individual student. Also, a shift to problem-based learning is occurring in different types of health professional schools, including several CAA colleges. This style of learning focuses on the knowledge needed to perform specific functions or solve spec ific problems, relaying theoretical knowledge in the context of its use. Problem-based l earning often involves teamwork, reinforcing students' capacity later to work in teams. By 2010, learning will make significant use of interactive simulation technologies. Health professionals of all types will be able to \"p ractice\" their craft in very realistic simulations. 37 Surgeons, chiropractors, psychologists and homeopaths all will have the opportunity to learn and practice as effectivel y as pilots now do in flight simulators. New learning technologies such as distanc e education, simulation and problem-based learning also can be used to prepare provid ers who traditionally have practiced solo like chiropractors to work in teams. Alternatively, information technology may allow solo practitioners to operate as part of \"vir tual groups,\" reducing their overhead. These training technologies and related practice tools will make it easier for CAA and conventional practitioners to know when and how to access a wide range of approaches. Licensure, Certification and Credentialing Each state has elaborate systems for licensi ng its health professionals. Licensure of physicians became common in the 1920s, in the 20 years after Abraham Flexner issued his report on US medical schools. Flexner argued, and the states agreed, that there were enough poor-quality schools of va rious modalities producing poor-quality physicians that the states should allow onl y students trained at medical schools of the more rigorously scientific type (such as Johns Hopkins) to take state licensure tests. Since the 1920s, licensure has evolved for many fields into a form of \"guild protection.\" In each state, practice acts typically def ine a specific range of services that each provider group can legally perform. Licensed providers can use the state to prevent others from performing those designated serv ices. The National Association of State Attorneys General (NASAG) has argued agains t this tradition in both the legal and medical professions. It is likel y that the questioning of licens ure procedures will increase and that other approaches to ensuring qualit y in health providers will emerge. High-tech and low-tech training and testing tool s that simulate real practice experiences will continue to evolve and be used in tr aining and education programs. In \"standardized patient\" programs now in use at several m edical and other health professional schools, Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-22 for example, paid individuals are trained to act as if they have a particular medical condition and to present that condition in a standard manner. This eliminates communication biases or other variables that can temper the patient encounter experience, allowing the students to be evalua ted purely on their skills. Beyond these human simulators, sophisticated virtual reality tools for teaching and testing health care providers will probably become a reality within 10 to 15 years. Simulations and simulators are likely to be used for state gover nment testing for licensure, as well, in the years ahead. Licensure and certification also will be affected by the \"smarter markets\" that will evolve in most communities. \"Report cards\" on providers will provide an additional quality check. In addition to marketplace report ca rds, some associations may attempt to provide more visible certification, im pacting which providers consumers choose. Report card preparation will be aided by the fact that once a chiropractor or other health care provider begins practicing, their outcomes will be rated in an ongoing way. Electronic medical record-keeping and increased linking of medical databases will enable wider access to these outcome measures . States may tie the continued right to practice to appropriate outcomes. Alternativ ely, as the market becomes smarter, a provider's professional success or even su rvival will depend on her or his performance against a range of sophisticated outcome meas ures, including consumer satisfaction. As noted earlier, consumer groups already are rating doctors, hospitals, HMOs and specific medical procedures. 38 Training in and Use of CAA s by Conventional Health Care Providers As the popularity of chiropractic grows, so will the number of conventional health care professionals who provide it. While earning a DC degree requires two to four years of advanced education, it could be that li mited spinal manipulation techniques39 could be mastered in just three to four weeks with the help of expert systems and possibly of special equipment. Co-option by other kinds of practitioners is a very real forecast that will affect all CAA providers, not just chiropractors. Some physicians have made manipulation an in tegral part of their practice for some time. James Gordon, a physician, author and CAA practitioner, acts as a primary care physician for his patients. He integrates a range of approaches, including manipulation, Oriental pulse diagnosis, acupuncture, Oriental herbal remedies and nutritional therapies. Gordon begins each patient visit with a long conversation to try to determine what non-physical problems are contributing to health conditions. He then tailors the course of treatment to the individual's s pecific needs and circumstances. A psychiatrist by training, Gordon has become a leader with in the CAA community and is president of the Center for Mind/Body Medicine and author of Manifesto for a New Medicine , among other books. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-23 Nearly a third of medical schools now offer courses on CAAs. Gordon has been teaching such a course at Georgetown Univer sity Medical School for several years. His course addresses the ways in which CAAs, and the worldviews on which they are based, can be integrated into medical care. Gordon also provides a training course for established physicians and other health care providers. Called \"The Spirit of Self- Regulation,\" this course seeks to train heal th and mental health professionals in mind/body skills both for supporting optimal wellness and for aiding people living with chronic illness. After an intensive week of introduction and basic training, participants return to their practices for six months to consider and begin applying what they learned, then return for a final four days at Georgetown. As surpluses of physicians and nurses increase and demand for CAAs also increases, many conventional health care provider s will learn CAA tools and techniques and add them to their basket of therapeutic offerings . Those CAAs that prove most efficacious will be the first to attract the interest of conventional providers. Thus, while many CAA providers may feel they have a monopoly on their particular treatment approach, they should be aware that conventional physicians will become less conventional. Co-option is a very real forecast that will affect all health providers. Those providers who can provide the kind of treatment in the kind of setting that shows the best efficacy and the highest levels of consumer satisfaction wi ll be the winners in the next century. Outside the United States, c onventional physician groups are already dealing with CAA integration by their members. The larges t physician self-regulatory body in Canada, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Onta rio (CPSO), recently issued a report arguing that its members can appropriately pr actice CAAs but should recognize that these modalities have \"estab lished a historical and respected role in healing, and require arduous training and evaluation. Assu ming that they have obtained such training and expertise... physicians practicing in this area should regard and maintain the standards of those disciplines.\" 40 And, significantly, even when physicians do not learn these techniques themselves, the CPSO report advised physicians to learn enough about them to be able to help their patients recognize the risks of mixing CAAs with conventional therapies. Table 3-3, below, illustrates the range of time it can take for a physician to master various CAAs, as well as the amenability of each approach to consumer self-care. Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-24 Table 3-3: Physician Training Time and Self-Care Capability for Selected CAAs Estimated time for a physician to be trained to provide a CAA Self-care capability Chiropractic care (manipulation plus full range of approaches) 2 to 4 years N/A Spinal manipulation (limited)41 3 to 4 weeks With the help of expert systems, by 2010, possibly with the aid of equipment Oriental medicine (full range of approaches) 2 to 4 years Some aspects now; many by 2010 Acupuncture (limited) 10 to 20 weeks History and pulse diagnosis; some acupuncture by 2010 Homeopathy (full, customized treatment, deep- acting remedies) 1 to 2 years Possible expert system assistance in the future Homeopathy (specific remedies for specific conditions) Several weeks and/or use of available guides, expert systems Available now from books, CD-ROMs; some remedies indistinguishable from non- prescription pharmaceuticals in their availability and use Source: IAF, 1998 Models for CAA Health Ca re Provider Practices Chiropractors increasingly are working with both conventional and other CAA providers. The chief practice models include42: The Real Estate or \"Corridor\" Model A group of practitioners is clustered in one building and patients decide whom they want to see. There is some internal refe rral but practitioners mainly compete rather than cooperate. This model is problematic for patients if they are unclear on which practitioner they should visit. Also, pati ents may not receive coordinated care. The Conference Table Model The patient meets with, or is discussed at, a practitioner conference to determine which therapies might be most useful. Mo re expensive than the other models, this requires practitioners to develop basic te mplates for each practice and how to approach each case. In this model, CAA (and conventional) practitioners work together closely and patients could receive more integrated care. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-25 The Health Guide Model The patient first sees a \"health guide\" who counsels the patient on his or her health options and coordinates the intake proce ss. The model is patient-centered rather than practitioner-based and has a heavy emphasis on health education versus medical care. The Integrative Solo Practitioner A clinician, either an allopath or a CAA pr ovider (but at this point often a broadly trained physician), consistently uses a r ange of CAAs in his or her practice, and frequently refers the patient out for conv entional or complementary services from other providers. Appendix C identifies additional settings in which CAAs are being applied or have become the focus of public and group education, in addition to the CAA provider models listed here and the evolving mix of conventional health care models. Health Care Professionals: Vision and Value-Added It is the best of times and the worst of ti mes to be a health care professional. The opportunities to be a healer are growing. T he opportunity to provide consumer-friendly services that optimize health gains is grow ing. The definition of health is likely to broaden to include community as well as i ndividual health, opening up new avenues for contribution. Yet cost pressures are maki ng it difficult, especially for allopathic physicians, to provide as much personal contact as their patients want. For chiropractors, meanwhile, demand is growing in most regions but perhaps not quickly enough to keep up with the looming oversupply of practitioners. And will the economics of health care allow chiropractors to retain the high level of integrity most have brought to their practice? We will explore these prospects in more detail in Chapter 4. However, given the forecasts for expert systems and other tool s, and the pressures of managed care for better cost-effectiveness, it is safe to say that some health professionals will likely be replaced by less-expensive providers. For example, 60-70% of primary care contacts can be handled more cost-effectively by a nurse or nurse practitioner than by a physician. In the years ahead, expert system s will let nurses or nurse practitioners handle an even greater percentage of primary care visits, as well as provide some services now performed by specialists. 43 In this setting, many physicians will need to continually reinvent their \"value-added\" role. It takes vision and courage to imagine and to create enhanced roles. It also takes vision and a strong identity for a professional to be able to accept as appropriate the displacement of some of his or her functi ons by a less-trained person or a computer. There were probably many bank tellers whose employers could not discover new \"value-added\" roles for them when ATMs perv aded America. Many lost their jobs or Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-26 suffered from depression. Today many physi cians are similarly depressed about the environment they find themselves in. Physic ians are taking disability in higher numbers than ever before, arguably because of lower levels of satisfaction with their jobs.44 Physicians need to explore their opportunities to provide value in relation to their personal visions. Chiropractors will face parallel challenges . Generally those who choose to become chiropractors were committed strongly enou gh to the chiropractic approach to healing that they could face the attendant difficu lties. It will be even more important for chiropractors to have a clear and strong vision for their role in the larger health care system. Vision is an important personal and organiza tional tool that establishes both personal and organizational identity. Vision is a s hared commitment to creating a preferred future. Vision is also a powerful way to identify one's value-added contribution, and it gives the owners of the vision the courage to let go of roles that are no longer defensible. Vision has been used in many industries to determine where the contribution of an organization or the field should head. Vi sion is both a skill and a shared commitment. Table 3-4 identifies trends in value-added visi ons across sectors as diverse as major local newspapers, quality consulting, health care and military medicine. Table 3-4 is drawn from IAF's work in these fields and reveals consistent patterns of adding value. The implications are that health care will increasingly pursue larger outcomes\u2014 ultimately, syndrome prevention, health des ign and social values such as equity. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-27 Table 3-4: Trends in Value Added Wisdom, Co-Creation, Vision: Trends in Value Added/Visionary Directions Value- Added Journalism Corporate Activities Electronic Messaging Quality Consulting Health Care Military Medicine Civic journalism Visioning, co-creation Wisdom Vision Syndrome prevention, design, equity Anti-war, health/ sustainability Providing what is significant Knowledge Community health Community health Providing what is news Community services, collaboration Information Strategies Disease prevention Personal prevention, fitness Accurate facts Profits, efficiency operations Data Operations Disease treatment Disease and combat casualty treatment Source: IAF, 1997 In terms of marketplace challenges for chir opractors, the situation is likely to be riskiest where core aspects of their work are amenable to incorporation into an expert system (e.g., some of the diagnostics). Where touch is necessary, as in manipulation, expert systems will be less of a threat. The point is that each health care professi onal needs to have a strong vision, a \"North Star,\" so to speak, to serve as guidance. Each health profession needs to do the same. Professional groups could inadvertently turn their guns on themselves by neglecting to forge a shared set of goals. Health professi onal groups that become self-serving (as, many would argue, the American Medical Asso ciation did in the past in the name of \"protecting\" physicians) can fail to rouse their members to threats or even more important to opportunities for enhanced service and moving up the value-added ladder. In either case, in the absence of st rong shared vision the organization leaves its members more vulnerable to becoming \"v ictims\" of their circumstances and environment. As chiropractic develops and pursues a shared vision, its practitioners should start by studying the influential health care visions al ready on the table: WHO's Health For All; visions for US health care like the Belmont Vision Project; and the localized visions developed by communities and health care providers around the United States. From Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-28 visions like these, they can both draw insp iration and creatively explore the value added the profession can provide.45 MANAGED CARE Health care plans large and small are integr ating CAAs into their offerings. Many are adding chiropractors, acupuncturists and homeopaths to their definition of \"traditional\" providers; in a member survey of the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA), 8.8% (or 72) of the 815 respondents report ed their group has an arrangement with an alternative provider. Descriptions of some of these plans are found in Appendix C: Examples of CAA Integration into Health Care in 1997. Growth of Managed Care Managed care picked up steam in the 1980s and became a juggernaut in the 1990s. The table below shows the growth in t he number of managed care plans and in the enrolled population. Note that the Nove mber 1997 figure represents 150 million enrolled Americans out of the total US population of 269 million, or 56% of the whole population. Table 3-5: Number of Americans Using Managed Care Year Enrolled Population Number of Plans 1970 3 million 33 Plans 1980 9.1 million 236 Plans 1985 20 million 350 Plans May 1996 100 million 1,200 Plans* May 1997 140 million 1,000 Plans* November 1997 150 million 1,000 Plans* * These are the number of plans claimed as members by AAHP Sources: HCFA and the American Association of Health Plans (AAHP) and Michael L. Millenson, Demanding Medical Excellence (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997). Managed care is evolving into numerous fo rms. In the classic \"staff model\" HMO, physicians are employees of the HMO. In group and network models the physicians own the organization or have a loose a rrangement among themselves. \"Point of service\" (POS) models allow consumers to choose, at the point of service, between providers who are in the network and deliver ca re at a fixed fee (which represents either no additional cost or a set low cost to the consumer), or physicians who are outside the network, in which case the consumer may get some or none of their expenses covered by the HMO. As many consumers express a strong preference for controlling their own The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-29 access to specialists, many HMOs ar e abandoning \"gatekeeper\" models, in which a general practitioner decides whether to refer a pat ient to a specialist, in favor of point of service models. Finally, Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) allow providers to be designated by an insurer as \"preferred providers\"; the provider in turn agrees to the insurer's fee schedule. As consumer demand for chiropractic and ot her CAAs increases, MCOs are moving quickly to include coverage for them in or der to be competitive. For MCOs, the key question is whether CAA services and provider s can lead to more cost-effective, higher- quality health care and better health outcomes. In setting up our forecasts for managed care in relation to CAAs, it is relevant to keep in mind three prominent features of managed care regardless of its form: It is capitated (for a set fee per mont h or year per person, the managed care organization takes financial responsibility that appropriate care will be delivered). It seeks to manage (by trying to bring efficiency and efficacy to each encounter\u2014 eliminating whatever is unnecessary and ensuring appropriate delivery of what is necessary). In this respect, managed care can be said to represent \"atonement for the sins\" of fee-for-service care, particu larly its excesses in the 1970s and 1980s. It is evolving along a spectrum from managing cost to managing care to managing health. By 2010, many experts forecast, managed care will take over 80-90% of the insured health care market in the United States. This is a base forecast; other scenarios include a much lower percentage of managed care penetration due to either consumer dissatisfaction with managed care, dramatically enhanced self-care, and/or the ability of independent providers and groups to de liver better care and prevention less expensively. However, given the constellation of trends discussed in Chapter 2 and this chapter, regardless of its percent of penetration into US health care, managed care will look very different in 2010. CAAs, including chiropractic, will be integrated into managed care and CAA providers will continue to provide care outside of the managed care system to both insured patients and out-of-pocket customers. FORECAST FOR MANA GED CARE AND SELF- MANAGED CARE Putting the trends in these two chapters t ogether, and relating them to the scenarios for US health care identified in C hapter 1, what are plausible forecasts for managed care in 2010? If vision and value-added planning are used, we could see something like the Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-30 first forecast below: Healthy Managed Care 2010 (which corresponds roughly to Scenario 4\u2014Healing and Health Care, described in Chapter 1). A second image, which we call Managed Self-C are 2010, explores the growth of sophisticated self-care and t he capacity for consumers them selves to better manage the professional care they purchase\u2014in effe ct moving the risk management aspect of health care back to consumers. (This im age corresponds roughly to Scenario 3 in Chapter 1.) Note: Italicized text is written from the point of view of an observer in 2010. Forecast 1: Healthy Managed Care 2010 The Pew Commission on the Health Professions was accurate: in 2010, 90% of the insured US population receives care through integrated managed care delivery systems. These systems are characterized by a high degree of consumer satisfaction, significant im provement in individual and community health and a broader array of preventive and therapeutic choices, all for relatively far less cost than in the 1990s. While there are many variants, the def ining characteristic of managed care remains payment of a monthly fee by the employer or individual in exchange for a relatively comprehensive set of health care services. In effect, managed care continues to assume responsibility for the management of health care and the risks of costs for the individuals covered. The information revolution has been profound. Telemedicine allows sophisticated health care to be delivered virtually anywhere; expert systems have decentralized much expertise and decision-making to less formally trained providers from specialist physicians to general practitioners to nurses and other formerly complementary and alternativ e providers. Also, the managed care organization has provided all of its mem bers with very sophisticated personal biomonitoring and home health managem ent systems. This equipment and the advanced state of videophones mean that only rarely do patients need to meet with their providers, except to establis h or renew their personal relationships and to receive therapy involving touch or high-tech equipment. Most health care systems, individual pr oviders within systems and provider teams routinely generate outcome m easures that, when aggregated (with appropriate privacy safeguards), are publicly evaluated, allowing comparison of managed care organizations, health care teams, specific providers and specific therapies. These \"report cards\" on commun ity providers also provide the \"batting averages\" of providers in relation to both major conditions and the most common genotypes and phenotypic groupings in the community. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-31 The bargain between consumer and provider has shifted. Given the Forecast, Prevent and Manage paradigm now in widespread use, health care providers agree and are held accountable to lower a person's life-course morbidity, with the person's active participation. Thus the job of the managed care organization is not simply to treat well, but to fore cast problems that might arise for the individual, prevent as many of them as possible and optimally manage any illness that does arise. The US health care market continues to consolidate. Between 2002 and 2005 the information revolution allowed small organizations to compete effectively with large organizations. Also, local and r egional managed care players cooperate in region-wide \"virtual organizations.\" Some of the most successful managed care organizations were developed by CAA groups, such as chiropractors and Oriental medicine providers, using information technologies to integrate a variety of approaches into a package of optimal care customized to each patient. Managed care, to be cost-effective, focu ses on where it can leverage health gains in both prevention and treatment. Behavioral approaches are very important. \u00be Most managed care organizations ensure that their subscribers or members have personal health coaches. These are likely to include both human coaches (the 2010 equivalent of a primary care physician although they may be nurses, who take an ongoing, personal and very effective interest in the individual and ensure periodic personal contact) and electronic coaches that can be accessed at home or anywhere, anytime. Dramatic therapeutic advances have oc curred. Many diseases are preventable or curable, or their progression can be significantly slowed. This includes most cancers and heart disease. As research develops on the latest modalities including customization based on t he individual's phenotype and genotype, the stages of their disease and related factors this information is built into the protocols of managed care providers. The shift of managed care organizations to aggressive outcomes research was aided by sophisticated patient/consumer groups who work actively with the research community and health care providers to ensure that promising leads are pursued and utilized effectively. There remain more options for health ca re than can be paid for. Protocols help focus on cost-effectiveness, but the need for more conscious priority-setting remains. In most states priority-s etting follows Oregon's model. There is universal access to a basic package of health care. States are allowed to Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-32 determine what will be included in that basic package. Sophisticated analysis of the cost-benefit of a much broader array of approaches factors in the subgroups for which these approaches will truly work . Priorities are then set for the publicly available benefits package. \u00be Individuals can \"buy up\" to other opti ons, and managed care plans as a whole can choose to raise their fees and reset priorities within the broader fee structure. \u00be Managed care organizations, as well as their individual providers (especially CAA providers), routinely provide \"w ellness\" services which go beyond the health care benefit package and are paid for out-of-pocket by individuals. As the contribution of managed care to health gains was identified and measured by outcomes, the definition of \" health\" broadened. Managed care providers focused on where they could get the greatest long-term leverage. Not only lifestyle but also broader issues, such as environmental pollution and poverty, came to be seen as elements in retarding or enhancing health. Health care providers now share in the responsibility for the health of the communities they serve and community report cards show how well they are contributing. Managed care providers became creative in enabling communities to atta ck the causes of illness. \u00be Prevention and the focus on causes will lead to health care's participation in the process of designing health care systems and societies to \"design out illness\" wherever possible. Forecast 2: Self-Managed Ca re 2010: A Competing Forecast By 2010, who needs 'em? Individuals and families have largely retaken responsibility for their risk management. Expert syst ems, personal biomonitoring and disease forecasting systems based on a person's g enetic profile enable families to self- manage much of the care they sought from HMOs in the 1990s. Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) and ot her policies encouraging consumers and rewarding them for effective use of health ca re reinforced this drive to less reliance on professionals. Support for public policies relying more on the marketplace grew in the late 1990s and early 2000s as the public became awar e of the high cost of professional development for health care providers, par ticularly physicians, yet only contributed to provider surpluses. \"Enough!\" said consumers. Public policies funded universal access to catastrophic insurance, providing very frugal backup care to the unemployed, and ensured that all individuals and families could access powerful home health m anagement tools. These tools include The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, Institute for Alternative Futures Professionals and Delivery Systems 3-33 behavioral coaching for each family member, sophisticated biomonitoring and interactive lifelong health records. Policy also ensured quality standards for the competing protocol developers whose knowledge bases are used by health care systems and individuals. While demand has declined significantly for health care providers whose services could be automated, or curtailed by prev ention, a large market remains for those primary care providers who are ready to seriously share responsibility for their customers' health. In addition there remains a significant demand for services, such as manipulation, which are not amenab le to self-care by consumers. CAAS BEYOND HEALTH CARE Like Using AAA, AARP, the YMCA or Bally's? Seeking CAAs As Wellness Services Before we leave this chapter addressi ng trends and forecasts affecting CAAs, particularly chiropractic, it is important to note that much of the demand for CAAs does not conform to the medical or health care approach. Some people view acupuncture or chiropractic or massage services as they w ould the services of a spa, gym or fitness club. As noted in Chapter 4 bel ow, it is estimated that up to 35% of visits to chiropractors are \"wellness visits,\" not related to an immediate complaint. This is a very different model than the one focused on \"appropriate services\" to be provided by a health care system. Recall that health care systems have shown themselves liable to generate overspending for unnecessary or inappropriate services. Individuals choose to buy services, as we ll as guides to services and discounts, based on recommendations from groups such as AAA or AARP. Likewise individuals choose to join for-profit health and fitness clubs such as Bally's or non-profit groups such as the YMCA. For many CAA providers in 2010, these wellne ss services will be a significant portion of their business. The questions that determi ne \"appropriateness\" in the managed care context should not be applied here. Yes, consumers should be protected from fraud; they should know who the best providers ar e. But they should be able to spend their discretionary resources on wellness services of their choice, much as they choose to spend their discretionary income on health clubs. The trends toward smarter markets noted above will mean that consumers will be able to buy with greater assurance of quality. The \"report cards\" available to c onsumers will help them choose among local providers. Chapter 3: Trends: Therapeutics, Prevention, The Future of Chiropractic Professionals and Delivery Systems Institute for Alternative Futures 3-34 As we shall see in Chapter 4, on chiropract ors, this demand for wellness services will play an important role in determining if ther e is a surplus of chiropractors in 2010 as their number doubles. Demand from consumers for wellness services from other CAA providers will also play an important role in determining overall demand for chiropractic services.

There are 55,000 licensed chirop ractors, the largest CAA pr ovider group. Interest is growing and the number of chiropract ors will nearly double to 103,000 by 2010. Chiropractors are uniquely positioned to act as gatekeepers to holistic and integrative care, and possibly as primary care providers generally. Assuming this role, however, would require most chiropr actors to reconsider and revamp their practice style. Patient support for chiropractic is very high and most clients are satisfied with their treatment. However, many non-users have very negative impressions of chiropractic care and chiropractors. Key challenges to the profession include: \u00be Low consumer awareness of the potentia l for wellness/primary care services; Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-2 \u00be Scope-of-practice questions (whether and how far chiropractic should extend beyond back problems); \u00be Lack of professional solidarity; \u00be Variations in practice; Reimbursement restrictions; and \u00be Potential rise in competition fr om other types of practitioners. Chiropractic's future could be very bright given certain developments: \u00be Continued growth in the evidence c onfirming manipulation's efficacy and cost- effectiveness; \u00be Continued high support among customers; \u00be Increased evidence for the value of wellness or maintenance visits, and increased consumer willingness to pay for them (often out-of-pocket); \u00be Effective integration of other CAAs by chiropractors, including enhanced health coaching roles; and \u00be Enhanced chiropractor contributions to community health. BACKGROUND ON CHIROPRACTIC While musculoskeletal manipulat ion dates back as far as 2700 BC in China, modern chiropractic is thought to have been founded by D.D. Palmer when he adjusted a neighbor's spine in 1895, rest oring his hearing. D.D. and his son, B.J. Palmer, went on to establish a flourishing practice and school, centered on achieving health through manipulation of the spi ne. D.D. is credited wit h the philosophy of chiropractic: the notion of \"vitalism\" or innate healing force and t he enhancement of health through adjustment of the spine and joints. Today chiropractic blends this metaphor of a vital healing force with more testable principles: \"Contemporary chiropractic belief systems embrace a blend of experience, conviction, critical thinking, open-mindedness and appreciation of the natural order of things. Emphasis is on the tangible, testable principle that structure affects functi on, and the untestable, metaphorical recognition that life is self-sustaining and t he doctor's aim is to foster the establishment and maint enance of an organism-envir onment dynamic that is the most conducive to functional well-being.\" 1 Figure 4-1 illustrates this blend ing of principle and metaphor.

Mootz, eds., Chiropractic in the United States: Training, Practice and Research (Washington, DC: Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, US Department of Health and Human Services, 1997). Since its inception, chiropractic has weather ed continual challenges to its validity, starting with the 1910 Flexner Re port. A critical rating of 1 55 American medical schools, the Flexner Report favored a scientific, a llopathic approach to medical education modeled on that of Johns Hopkins Univ ersity (which funded the report). By recommending state licensure on ly of graduates from those schools that used this approach, the report helped make allopathic medicine the de facto standard of care in America. The American Medical Associati on (AMA), as the lead association of allopathic physicians, spent much of the re st of this century working to suppress chiropractic practitioners. In 1981 the US Supr eme Court curtailed these assaults in the Wilk decision, finding the AMA guilty of tryi ng to illegally boycott the chiropractic profession through \"restraint of trade.\" The Flexner Report helped trigger other f undamental changes in health care: adoption of an allopathic orientation by federal rese arch and development policy, particularly in the creation and direction of t he National Institutes of Heal th (NIH), and federal funding of allopathic graduate medi cal education (GME) thr ough a variety of agencies to the exclusion of funding doctors of chiropractic and other CAA doctoral tr aining programs. Despite these challenges and lack of equity in federal policy, the chiropractic profession today enjoys widespread recognition and use. In the United States, 55,000 doctors of chiropractic (DCs) are consulted by anywhere from 3.6% to 16% of the US population, according to various estimates (for this report we will use 10% as our approximate estimate for 1997). 2 Chiropractic care is licensed in 50 states; 45 states require insurers Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-4 to include it in their plans. Consumer awarene ss of chiropractic is growing and hospitals and HMOs are includin g chiropractic in their services. Considerable research has been done on patient satisfaction; the focus groups for this project, as well as major polls conduct ed by the Harris and Gallup organizations, have consistently shown that patients' support fo r and satisfaction with chiropractors is high. What does chiropractic do? While chiroprac tors are trained to use a range of approaches including nutrition, and some hav e made a point of learning other CAAs such as acupuncture, the prime component of ch iropractic care is spinal manipulation. Essentially, manipulation involves kneadi ng and adjusting the components of the spine to achieve a therapeutic effect often to relieve back pain, but also facilitating the transmission of nerve signals al ong the spine from the brain to other parts of the body. Chiropractors achieve their therapeutic benefit by manipulating the joints of the spine beyond what an individual could do alone. Fi gure 4-2 below illustrates the range of motion culminating in called \"paraphysiological,\" where t he therapeutic effects are thought to occur. 3 In normal activity, the spine has a \"neutral active\" range of motion as we move through the day. Beyond this is a range of \"passive motion\" which individuals can mobilize themselves. However, the greates t therapeutic effect is believed to come from manipulation beyond this passive range hence, paraphysiological. Manipulation in the paraphysiological range of motion is thought to stimulate the body's innate curative powers. In the area of pain relie f, for example, studies have shown that chiropractic spinal manipulation facilitates the release of beta-endor phins. Since it is believed that pain sufferers have become endorphin-deficient, chiropractors claim that chiropractic manipulation can play a large role in pain management.4 The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions Institute for Alternative Futures 4-5 Figure 4-2 Chiropractors vary widely in how they prac tice. Some chiropractors have been criticized for over-treating.5 To address the variability issue, in 1992 chiropractors met to develop the Guidelines for Chiropractic Quality Assu rance and Practice Parameters (the Mercy Guidelines), an effort to establish c onsensus on treatment approaches and outcomes. These Guidelines recommend, for example, that for uncomplicated cases (acute episodes) treatment should achieve \"signifi cant improvement withi n 10 to 14 days\" based on \"three to five treatments per week.\" To \"return to pre-episode status\" should require \"six to eight weeks\" based on \"up to three treatments per week.\"6 Currently, chiropractors provide 94% of mani pulation in the United States, while other providers (mostly osteopaths) provide the other 6%. 7 As outcomes research confirms spinal manipulation's value, however, many other types of health care providers are likely to seek training in its techniques. In the near future, physical therapists, osteopaths, massage therapists, physicians and nurses trained in manipulation will compete with chiropractors. Chiropractors have traditionally practiced solo. Because of the various competitive pressures, however, chiropractors will face st rong incentives to work in or for groups, and to be able to work on multidisciplinary teams.

Cassidy, \"Spinal Manipulation in the Treatment of Low-BackPain,\" Canadian Family Physician, Vol. 31 (March 1995), p. 537.Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-6 USE IN THE HEALTH CARE MARKETPLACE Demand for Services and Efficacy What do consumers seek chiropractic serv ices for? Of the estimated 27 million Americans who visit a chiropractor each year , most (70% to 80%) seek treatment for lower- or other back pain; 10% want relief from headaches; and 10% seek treatment for other conditions.8 In 1995, chiropractors reported that the vast majority (86.5%) of their patients received treatment fo r neuromusculoskeletal condi tions. Other conditions treated were viscerosomatic (11.3%) and vascular (5.5%).9 Back pain and back problems are a significant cluster of conditions in the US population. Twenty percent of Americans have some type of back problem in a given year while 80% experience back problem s at some point in their lives. 10 Back pain is a recurring condition which, in 1990, cost Amer icans an estimated $24.3 billion in direct costs and $50-$100 billion in indirect costs. T he prevalence of back pain is increasing as women enter the work force. Work ers' compensation for back problems was estimated to be $30 billion in 1990.11 While the data is currently insufficient to track these costs over time, according to chiropr actic experts, the costs may increase as people stay in the workforce longer or more people seek treatment for the first time. Spinal manipulation has been recognized by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) as an effective treat ment for acute lower-back pain based upon appropriateness criteria developed by a multidisciplinary expert team. 12 AHCPR's outcomes research enjoys a high degree of credi bility, making this study a significant resource. This proof-of-efficacy and validat ion of chiropractic from a respected government agency could serve as strong en dorsement for including chiropractic treatment in managed care. The fact that some indicati ons have already been shown to respond to chiropractic has led to a situation where consumers and chiropr actors often report the conditions treated as reimburseable conditions. This is one reason that 80% of demand for chiropractic services is usually described as being for back pain or problems. More will be said on efficacy research below, but one summary has argued t hat chiropractic has the following levels of effectiveness for muscu loskeletal conditions: for lower-back pain without neural deficit proven effectiveness (as noted by the ACHPR study); for neck painlimited evidence for effectiveness; and for headache promising though unconfirmed evidence for effectiveness. 13 Apart from reimbursement issues, the Na tional Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) presents a much more detailed list of the presenting or concurrent conditions for which patients seek chiropractic care. This list is shown in Table 4-1.

Christensen and D. Morgan, eds.

Mootz, eds., Chiropractic in the United States: Training, Practice and Research ( Washington, DC: Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, US Department of Health and Human Services, VIII-2, 1997). The number of chiropractic visits varies from patient to patient depending on the health and desired outcomes of each. For acute epis odes of care clients average 12.9 visits.14 Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-8 Beyond the diagnosis-based, targeted visits are wellness or preventive visits. This is a difficult area to quantify because of the lack of literature-bas ed evidence for its significance. However, based on the expert opinion derived from our interviews, it is clear that the majority of chiropractors prov ide wellness and/or preven tive visits for their patients, and this kind of care accounts fo r an estimated 14% to 35% of visits to chiropractors. Some chiropractors schedule t hese visits on a quarterly or even monthly basis, including some leading practitioners. And some have built much or all of their practice around such monthly wellness visits by patients. This appears to represent a significant consumer demand for preventive ca re and experts interviewed indicated that it is common for chiropractic patients to request periodic chiropractic office visits because they feel better when they receive them. As noted in Chapter 3, these wellness or preventive visits represent freely chosen care beyond the typical medical services model, some what akin to decisions to use a fitness club, take vitamins or engage in lifestyle choi ces which will affect their overall health. This is an economic calculus by individual consumers. Studies have started to explore whether these wellness visits lead to less us e of other health services. And consumers need ongoing and reliable information sources to judge consumer satisfaction (in addition to their own personal assessment ) with the value of wellness visits. Overall, the chiropractic market promises significant growth in demand for manipulation services: back problems (including for the ag ing population); wellness visits; and a long list of other conditions such as those in Tabl e 4-1 above, which, research is beginning to show, might be aided by manipulation. In summary, demand for chiropractic, while focused on back problems, includes a wider range of problems or conditions. In addition, t here is significant demand for wellness or preventive chiropractic services. Future le vels of demand will be affected by: managed care; the supply of chiropractors and their role in primary care; research on efficacy; and policy and reimbursement issues all discussed in the following sections. Supply of Services The current population of US DCs\u201455,000\u2014 is forecast to expand to 103,000 by 2010.15 This indicates an increase in the ratio of chiropractors to the general population from 19.2 per 100,000 in 1994 to more than 33 per 100,000 in 2010.16 Chiropractic graduates will increase to about 5,000 per year by 2010, bas ed on current projections. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions Institute for Alternative Futures 4-9 Table 4-2: Forecasted Supply of Chiropractors in the United States through 2010 1980 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 # of chiropractic colleges 13 14 16 16 18 18 Graduates per year 1,500 2,200 3,000 3,750 4,500 5,000 Total number of DCs in practice 30,000 44,450 55,000 68,160 84,700 103,000 Source: Forecast for number of colleges based on inte rviews with chiropractic exper ts; forecasts for chiropractic graduates and total number of DCs from R. Cooper and S. Stoflet, \"Trends in the Education and Prac tice of Alternative Medicine Clinicians,\" Health Affairs , Fall 1996, p. 229. Meanwhile, as mentioned in Chapter 3, the Pew Commission Report on the Health Professions has forecast an oversupply of hundreds of thousands of physicians and nurses by 2010.17 If this occurs, the competit ion for patients will be fierce. Whether the increase in chiropractors to 103,000 by 2010 exceeds consumer demand will depend on variables such as integrati on trends in managed care, consumer demand for wellness visits, increased consumer self-c are and the rise in competing manipulation services from other health professionals. The scenarios in Chapter 5 explore how these might play out, including the prospects for high levels of underemployment and unemployment for chiropractors . On the other hand, the number of persons entering the profession could slow significantly if unemployment or underem ployment become visible, or if chiropractic schools voluntarily limit enrollment (as dental schools did after fluoride and other preventi on approaches lowered the demand for their services). PRACTITIONER EXPERIENCE Chiropractic doctors, like allopathic physicians earlier in this century, have predominantly been solo practitioners. In a 1995 survey of its members, the ACA found that a majority (76%) reported they were in solo practice.18 Many experts feel this is changing. Researcher Cheryl Hawk , for example, argues that: \"The day of the solo practitioner, deali ng with the patient in isolation from other practitioners, is past. Chiropr actors, whether they function in horizontally or vertically organized systems, as gatekeepers of specialists must develop firmer ties with other practitioners and with community services and organizations.\"19 Other experts interviewed for this study concurred generally, but added that while solo practitioners could decrease to 25-35% of t he profession within 20 y ears, they will not disappear altogether. This shift away from solo practice includes partnering with other prov iders, a trend that is being encouraged by the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC). A health care Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-10 model recently developed by the ACC links spinal health to overall health within the context of evidence-based, cost-conscious care.20 The experts also report that referrals from medical doctors , particularly orthopedists and neurologists, represent an estima ted 11% of chiropractic demand. 21 Some experts feel this number represents a slight increase over the last 10 years. While this increase is important, and is likely to grow as outcomes reinforce the value of manipulation, many in the health care arena are pushing fo r integrated, multidisciplinary teams to expedite care and provide appropriate services. Some experts recommend increased collaborat ion with MDs. In most of the integrated health care model s described in Chapter 3, multidisciplinary teams are led by allopathic doctors who refer patients to chiropractors and other specialists. For example, at the Center for Complementary Health at California Pacific Medical Center, an MD trained in one or more complementary therapies acts as a gatekeeper who moves patients on to the ap propriate specialist within a team of practitioners. Some experts interviewed for th is report felt that ch iropractors, as the largest and most accessible gr oup of CAA providers, are e ffectively positioned to play the role of primary care provider and gatekeeper to other CAAs. And many chiropractors are themselves trained in t he use of other CAAs, such as homeopathy and Oriental medicine. Chiropractors who choose to position themse lves as primary care providers and/or gatekeepers will face some challenges, howev er. One is the ta rgeted nature of chiropractic manipulation, whic h allows practitioners to s pend a relatively short amount of time with a patient and yet yield beneficial effects. Using or dealing with other CAAs would inevitably take more ti me. Also, chiropractors will need to work as team players if they are to be considered captains of health care teams. Below, we discuss in detail the potential and challenges for chiropract ors becoming primary care providers. Scope of Practice A large portion of the Americ an public regards chiropractic as the first line of defense and treatment for back problems. DCs see roughly 40% of those Americans with back problems each year an impressive figure, given syst ematic efforts by the AMA throughout this century to constrain the pub lic's access to chiropractors. Among those who view chiropractors favorably, however, many consider them only back specialists a surprising fact given that chiropractors are trained and licensed to treat a broad array of conditions, and that most DCs see themselves as prim ary care providers. As a consequence, most chiropractors actually do little if any health promotion or wellness activity beyond spinal manipulation, accord ing to some studies. Meanwhile, another group of the public, which we encountered in the focus groups for this project, has strongly negative opinions of chiropractors, re inforced by medical hostility and in some cases by reports of bad experiences with chiropractic from people they know. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions Institute for Alternative Futures 4-11 From a legal perspective, state laws define the scope of practice. A recent survey of chiropractic licensing boards in the United States and Canada showed that a few states allow the chiropractor to do very little beyond spinal manipulation, while other states permit a number of diverse procedures such as acupuncture, electromyography and laboratory diagnostics.22 Beyond the narrow legal scope of practice, th e statement of the National College of Chiropractic typifies what chiropractors are prepared for:23 Recognition of a divers ity of factors that impac t upon human physiology, among them biochemical dysfunction, genetics, trauma, hygiene, microorganisms, nutritional status, exercise, motion, pos ture, environment, stress, emotion and human relationships; Primary care based upon diagnostic evaluat ion including patient history, physical examination, clinical labor atory data, diagnostic imagi ng and other measures, as well as procedures unique to the chir opractic evaluation of human spinal and structural balance and integrity; The application of a diversity of spinal and other adjustments and manipulations for the treatment, correction and prevention of neurologic, skeletal or soft tissue dysfunction and the production of benef icial neurologic effects; and The use of other conservative means in cluding, but not limited to, nutritional counseling, physiologic therapeutics, me ridian therapy/acupuncture, trigger point therapy, lifestyle counseling, emot ional support and stress management. Most states allow chiroprac tors to utilize a broad range of diagnostic and treatment approaches beyond manipulation, su ch as clinical lab tests, routine physical exams and pelvic exams, needle acupuncture, nutri tional intervention and homeopathy. 24 Primary Care Does DCs' scope of practice include primar y care? This is less a question of state licensure laws than it is a combination of 1) what insurers and managed care allow; 2) how DCs provide care; and 3) whether cons umers think of DCs as primary care providers and utilize them as such. Exploring this topic is made more difficult sinc e, as noted in Chapte r 3, the definition of primary care is a moving target, encom passing not only ongoing care management for the individual but also a concern for the person's family and community. Here, we will start with the question of whether DCs can appropriately function as first-contact health care providers, responsible for the bulk of a person's health and medical care and for referring the person to other providers as needed. DCs today are trained as primar y care providers. Arnold Cianc ulli, DC, Past President of NCMIC, points out that the Counc il on Chiropractic Education has said the \"purpose of chiropractic education is to prepare the Doct or of Chiropractic as a primary care Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-12 provider.\"25 And according to a 1993 national survey , 90% of chiropractors considered themselves primary care providers.26 The ACA's definition likewise argues that: \"in a primary health care delivery system [chiropractors are] a first contact gat ekeeper for neuromusculoskeletal conditions characterized by direct access, longitudi nal, vertically integrated, conservative ambulatory care of patients' health care needs, emphasizing neuromusculoskeletal conditions, health promotion and pat ient-centered diagnosis and management.\" 27 Some chiropractic colleges see training DC's in this primary care role as a core part of their mission. For example, the mission statement of t he Northwestern College of Chiropractic (NWCC), reads \"T o graduate Doctors of Chiropr actic as primary health care physicians who are educated in the basic and clinical science, and trained to care for the whole person in health and disease, as well as to consult, refer, and collaborate with other health care providers\" and \"To instill essential values of health care physicians, including an understanding of t he healing process and the importance of a strong alliance between the doctor and the pati ent...\" . And NWCC's sense of primary care extends to a focus on health promoti on and health education for the individual and the community. NWCC's report on Preparing Doctors of Chiropractic for the Twenty- First Century includes health promotion as par t of the DC's task: \"Chiropractic doctors will provide health promotion services and wil l work more closely with patients with a view toward mitigating risk factors and prev enting illness.\" And the two hundred plus competencies identified by NWCC as required fo r the [effective] practice of chiropractic include the capacity to: \"demonstrate an ab ility to educate and inform patients, and the community, about health-related issues and t opics;\" as well as capacities for risk assessment and prevention of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer and substance abuse. While parts of the chiropractic community and colleges such as NWCC are moving chiropractic toward being primary care prov iders, in practice, most chiropractors typically function as first-contact, port-of -entry providers for musculoskeletal problems only. While they may aspire to be primary care providers, they seldom practice that way. Likewise, many of the managed care executives we interviewed did not see chiropractors as a natural choice for the primary care role. A number of other obstacles hi nder chiropractors from ex panding into primary care: Public perception. As noted above, our focus groups and many other studies have shown that consumers and health care administrator s regard chiropractors as back doctors, not as primary care providers 28; Negative image among non-users. Those who do not use chiropractors tend to have a negative image of them. Many characterize chiropractors as \"quacks.\" In some cases they know people who have had a bad experience with a chiropractor; The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions Institute for Alternative Futures 4-13 Philosophic differences within the profession. A vocal minority of DCs thinks the profession should remain focused on its chie f strength, spinal adjustment. Most of these practitioners deliberately limit t heir practices to ma nipulation only; The rise in managed care. Managed care programs typically restrict chiropractors to treating only indications for which they have been proven to be cost-effective primarily back problems. This pressure wil l intensify as more managed care plans incorporate chiropractic; The rise in non-physician providers. Some years ago it was pointed out that \"since 50-80% of primary care practi ce is based on 8-12 chief complaints, it is possible to construct a dozen or less protocols that c ould be used by nurses for the majority of instances of primary care.\"29 Today, many managed care organizations use nurses as primary care providers, and other s are exploring this possibility. Anti-vaccination position. While the formal position of the chiropractic community is to support the use of childhood vaccinations , some chiropractors are opposed to mandatory child hood vaccinations a staple of primary care; Inexperience with referrals. Chiropractors are not nece ssarily qualified to act as referral agents and usually must both ex pand and demonstrate their knowledge before they can be accepted as such; and Influx of other primary care providers. As noted earlier, by the early 21st century MDs will be in surplus as the demand for spec ialists declines. Furthermore, nurses and pharmacists also will experience large surpluses as hospitals continue to downsize across the country. This means more com petition for chiropractors who want to become primary care providers. In this ambivalent environment, and despite t he obstacles listed above, we believe that chiropractors can successfully work to positi on themselves as primary care providers if they choose to do so. They will have to take certain proactive steps, however especially, demonstrating their own efficacy in providing a broader range of treatments and/or in managing referrals to other provider s with successful outcomes for the array of problems their patients exhibit. A major factor in chiropractors' favor is that patients, in most cases, have direct access to them without referrals and thus can make chiropractors their first choice. Since chiropractors typically surpass other types of providers in earning consumer satisfaction and loyalty, they may choose to leverage this first-choice advantage into ongoing relationships as primary care providers. In the managed ca re context, chiropractors may be able to become primary care providers for patients who come to them with back- related complaints. Another favorable trend is t hat the practice environment, as discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 above, will be \"smarter\" in several ways. Chiropractors will have more effective expert systems to utilize in determini ng how to deal with neuroskeletal and non- neuroskeletal problems. Information technology, as well as the commitment to practice in a preventive way, could arm chiropractors already \"high-touch\" practitioners with appropriate tools. Meanwhile, outcomes measur ement is likely to shift the core goals of Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-14 health care to the \"Forec ast, Prevent and Manage\" paradigm further favoring cost- effective wellness visits. On the other hand, the issue of treatment time remains unsolved. Currently DCs maintain high c onsumer satisfaction based on visits of relatively short duration. Adding other CAAs, e.g., acupuncture or nutrition coaching, will lengthen patient visits and could change th e fundamental nature of practice. Wellness Most scope-of-practice discussions focus on the medically determined needs in health care. Consumers buy health services in a va riety of ways, however , including ways that fall outside the medical model of reimbursed services to treat specific conditions. Many consumers purchase wellness or prevent ive services out-of-pocket. Wellness represents a significant new direction for chiropractic, one many practitioners have already taken. Growing numbers of patients, satisfied with their treatment experiences, are electing to visit chiropr actors routinely for maint enance or wellness visits not prompted by any current problem. As noted above, these visits already represent an estimated 14% to 35% of demand for chirop ractic services; some chiropractors are moving to make them the nearly excl usive focus of their practices. As part of the trend to wellness visits, m any chiropractors ar e adding acupuncture and homeopathy to their practices. Acupuncture is taught at some chir opractic colleges; the NCC is launching a training program in naturopathy and acupuncture. Again, however, the addition of other CAAs raises time i ssues for DCs. Effective chiropractors can generate good outcomes and satisfied customer s with an average of 10 minutes or less per visit. In highly effective practices with a large volume of patients, a DC may complete the manipulation and other aspects of the visit in even less time. Applying other modalities and particularly the attendant need to talk with patients longer will challenge some chiropractors in terms of the number of patient s they can see. A parallel issue raised by wellness visits is the need for guidelines. In effect, protocols equivalent to the Mercy Guidelines should be developed for wellness care. Consumers should be able to learn what services are appropriate to buy, and to be better able to judge themselves whether they are getting value for their money. Research into guidelines is being conducted now, according to some of our experts , who expect it to demonstrate that patients who have routine preventive or wellness visits will have lower overall health care costs. However, as with any type of health care provider, some DCs may over-promise. Watchdog groups lik e Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, which is critical of what it sees as chiropractors overtreating, will ultimately monitor and report on the value of wellness visits as they now report on the relative merits of fitness equipment. In addition to general research, \"report cards\" on individual practitioners (described in Chapter 2) will compar e DCs and other providers (inclu ding health and fitness clubs) on their wellness outcomes. The profession itself particularly the segment that provides wellness visits needs to accelerate the gatheri ng and sharing of outcome data. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions Institute for Alternative Futures 4-15 Meanwhile, chiropractors should and are lik ely to pursue more holistic wellness approaches. Other Potential Areas of Treatment Returning from wellness to treatment, we next consider what the range of problems treated by chiropractors by 2010 is likely to be and whether it will enhance the claims of today's chiropractors to a primary ca re role. The following list summarizes the conditions beyond back, neck and headache probl ems that our experts conjectured will be treated by chiropractors in 2010 (this assu mes that chiropractic treatment will have proven efficacy for these indications): Elevated blood pressure; Chronic disorders such as arthritis and pain syndromes; Acute disorders, particularly irritable bowel syndrome, sinusitis, middle-ear infection, childhood asthma, colic, viral sore throats and viral pneumonitis; Aging-related disorders, e.g. , nutrition counseling for diabetes; Rehabilitation from injuries; Quality-of-life and we llness maintenance; Sports medicine and fitness (an incr easingly younger population is seeking treatment and chiropractic specialists are being included on Olympic and professional sports medical teams); and Women's health issues, e.g., premens trual syndrome, pr enatal care and menopause. EXPERIMENTS IN MANAGED CARE What impact will the growth of managed care in the United States have on chiropractic? Some of the experts we spoke with feel t hat managed care will signif icantly mediate the demand for, and delivery of, chiropractic serv ices. Managed care growth worries many chiropractors for a variety of reasons: Reduced scope of practice. Managed care organizations may choose not to reimburse for all chiropractic services or visits; Ascendance of groups. Chiropractic practitioner groups will acquire more clout than solo practitioners; and Decrease in fee-for-service or private-pay clients. Some patients will lose their unlimited access to chiroprac tors and will use only those practitioners who are listed with a managed care organization. However, others in the profession s ee managed care as a great opportunity if chiropractors modify their practices to fit this evolving health care approach. Rising to the occasion will require fundamental c hanges in the framework and day-to-day Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-16 treatment practices of individual practiti oners. Since many of these changes involve teamwork, they will require a high degree of consensus in the chiropractic community that such experiments are even desirable. Benefits of participation in managed care could be: Access to more patients; Better outcomes measurement of care, leadi ng to greater uniformity of practice and greater understanding of what is appropriate and effective care; Involvement with other health care providers and possible formation of interdisciplinary teams; Greater access to resources, such as sophisticated information and monitoring systems and research funding; and Opportunities to provide expanded services , such as nutrition or stress reduction coaching, which dovetails with chiropracti c's philosophy of holistic health care. The average gross income for an individua l chiropractic practice is $225,000 a year, and the average net income for a chiropractor is $95,000 a year. 30 Further, according to chiropractic experts, the curr ent range of fees is betw een $20 and $45 per patient per visit, with approximately $10-40 per visit for use of devices such as the inter-segmental traction table (there are no specific data on the frequency of use of these additional equipment or services per visit). Table 4-3 below shows the relative perc entage of revenue streams for chiropractors today according to three different sources. (The wide variation of numbers between the three sources is another illustration of the vari ety of practice pattern s in the field and the current lack of definitive data. ) The table shows that, with managed care reimbursement accounting for 3.7% to 24% of chiroprac tors' total revenue, but controlling more than half the health care marketplace, managed care is an obvious area for chiropractic expansion. In fact, a 1993 study found that 75% of workers with health insurance coverage (either indemnity insurance or so me type of managed care) had chiropractic care in their benefits package.31 The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions Institute for Alternative Futures 4-17 Table 4-3: Estimates of Ch iropractic Sources of Revenue Payment Source ACA Survey32 RAND Study33 IAF Interviews with Chiropractic Experts Direct payments for patients 20.9% 35% Furthermore, as the federal government folds more of Medicare and Medicaid into the managed care umbrella, chiropractic opportuniti es in the treatment of these patients could increase. The introduction of new Ch iropractic Manipulati ve Treatment (CMT) codes in the Medicare Fee Schedule will allo w more accurate reporting of a chiropractic visit, including time and efforts spent in pre- service and post-service in addition to intra- service activities. Not only will this enable mo re Medicare chiropractic treatments to be covered, but the new CMT codes can also help create a patient -experience pool for later analysis for proof of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. 34 In the fall of 1997, chiropractors began t heir own experiment in managed care. NCMIC launched the first truly national chiropracti c managed care network, TRIAD Healthcare, Inc. Currently, approximately 22 million lives are under contract with TRIAD. TRIAD's goal is to grow that to 100 million lives. TR IAD Healthcare believes, \"It is no longer enough to offer quality care. Each profession and every doctor must be in a position to offer outcomes assessments, high-tech gener ation of information and data analysis and management.\" 35 To make this easier for chiropractors TRIAD has partnered with a technology company, Merallis, to provide ch iropractic offices with more efficient electronic information gathering and comm unication with other DCs, NCMIC, TRIAD and over 250 health plans and carriers, as well as other health-care related entities. REIMAGING THE HEALTH CONSUMER Until recently, most chiroprac tic patients were middle-aged , white and employed, with at least a high school education. Chiroprac tors have been gradually expanding to reach different consumer groups, including children (12% of the 1996 chiropractic patient base), minorities (approximately 32% of the total population, but 35% of the current patient base) and those over 65 (12% of t he population, but 17% of the patient base).36 The current demographic makeup of chiropractic patients refl ects the growing diversity Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-18 of the US population today, as well as proactive efforts by chiropractors to expand their consumer base into other population groups and the increased personal referrals as chiropractic becomes better known. The aging population in particular is providing a stream of new chirop ractic patients, as displayed in Table 4-4 below. Chiropractic care has been associated with better elderly health: in a 1996 pilot study of older patients who sought chiropractic care, investigators found these users were generally healthier, less likely to be hospitalized and less likely to have used a nursing home than their peers who did not use chiropractic. 37 Further research will identify the various contributors to this difference: it could be they were healthier to begin with, or that chiropracti c helped improve health and lower cost, or some mixture of both. Elderly patients will require increased emphasis on mobility and the quality-of-life issues associated with chronic pain. Demonstration of chiropractic efficacy and cost- effectiveness (made easier by the creation of the new CMT codes mentioned earlier) will be vital for serving this population. Quality- of-life studies will be important for all the areas where chronic pain creates demand for chiropractic care. Table 4-4: Age of Ch iropractic Patients Age Group % of US population 1996 % of all chiropractic patients 199638 % of US population 201039 % of chiropractic patients 2010 Under 16 13% 12% 10% ? 17 to 44 65 12% 17% 14% ? US Census Bureau population projections40 Judging by Table 4-4, the elderly appear to be demographically over-represented as chiropractic patients, but the picture changes when plac ed in the medical context. Elderly patients use about 33% of the drugs prescribed in the United States, so as a proportion of chiropractic patients, they actually appear to be under-represented. The proportion of the populati on over 65 will reach 14% in 2010.41 Chiropractic experts forecast that those over 65 might represent closer to 20% or even 25% of visits to chiropractors by 2010. CHIROPRACTIC AND COMMUNITY HEALTH Chiropractors have yet to be formally in tegrated into community-based efforts to improve health. Some experts see a leadership role for chiropractors in educating the public and participating in community health init iatives. For example, chiropractors might The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions Institute for Alternative Futures 4-19 be involved in worksite injury- and back- strain prevention strategies, for employee groups as diverse as construction work ers and retail store checkout personnel. In May 1998, Prevention magazine announced the winners of a contest designed to identify six chiropractors who have demonstr ated outstanding health services to their communities. The award, co-sponsored by th e Alliance for Chiropractic Progress, hopes to raise public awareness of chiropractic' s role in community health. Winners were profiled in Prevention as the \"best of the best\" chiropractors in the country. 42 Many see a close alignment between chirop ractic's non-interventionist, wellness- and prevention-oriented philoso phy and community-based health promotion and disease prevention activities. Recent innovations in chiropractic education, such as community- based internships, may increase the number of chiropractors who are prepared and willing to play a role in their communities. Already, more chiropractors are getting public health degrees or joining the American Public Health Association's chiropractic sub- group. Some chiropractors who have made these inroads, however, report they do not feel totally accepted by the public health field. RESEARCH A major focus for research on chiropractic in volves showing efficacy for treating various conditions. As noted in Table 4-1 above and in the discussion of it, various experts argue that manipulat ion has some degree of favorable evidence for a range of indications including back pain, migraine h eadaches, work-related injuries, allergies and even obesity. In terms of basic efficacy, many studies have shown chiropractic's efficacy in treating subluxations of the spine, defined by the ACC as a complex of functional and/or pathological articular changes that compromi se neural integrity and may influence organ system and general health. 43 Over the past 15 years, many studies and reports hav e shown chiropractic to be a safe, effective means of natural heal ing, cost-effective and inspir ing high levels of patient satisfaction.44 These include: Lower-back pain.45 The Magna Study confirmed that in terms of cost and efficacy, chiropractic management of lower-back pai n is more effective than medical management.46 Work-related injuries. The Florida Study claimed that ch iropractic care is more cost- effective than standard medical care in the management of work-related back injuries.47 Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-20 Cost-effectiveness .48 The Utah Study showed that pati ents of chiropractors returned to work sooner after an injury and that ch iropractic care was one- tenth as expensive as standard medical care in tota l workers' compensation costs. 49 z Compared to conventional hospital outpatient care . The Meade Study demonstrated that chiropractic treatment is more effective than conventional hospital outpatient treatment for patients with chronic or severe back pain.50 Women's health. Studies have noted that women who received chiropractic spinal manipulation reported significant reduction in back pain and menstrual distress.51 Overall therapeutic benefits. The Virginia Study found that \"by every test of cost and effectiveness, the general weight of evidence shows chiropractic to provide important therapeutic benefits, at economical costs.\"52 Patient satisfaction. The Gallup Poll found nine out of ten chiropractic patients felt that their treatment was effective and met or exceeded their expectations.53 Headaches. A study comparing manipulation versus amitriptyline for the treatment of muscle tension-type headaches showed statis tically significant improvements for those treated with manipulation.54 On the other hand, several sources have publish ed findings that are either more neutral or not as favorable to chiropractic care: Consumer focus. Consumer Reports stated that while ma nipulation might be an effective treatment for back pain, chir opractic care was not beneficial for the treatment of any other condition.55 Women's health. The 1995 Obstetric Pregnancy and Delivery Study found no evidence that the addition of chiropracti c care during pregnancy resulted in an observable benefit or detrim ent with regard to obstetric interventions used during labor and delivery.56 Prevention preparation for DCs. The survey of chiropractic practitioners on prevention reported that mo re MDs felt properly and completely trained on all aspects of prevention and pr imary care than did DCs.57 The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions Institute for Alternative Futures 4-21 Beyond back pain. Reports describe the format ion of a group of Canadian chiropractors who limit their use of spinal manipulation to treat back problems and who oppose claims that chiropractic c an treat conditions beyond back problems.58 And comments appeared in the Minnesota Medical Journal stating that claims that spinal manipulation can hel p optimize general health or treat non-musculoskeletal conditions are unfounded.59 Compared to other providers. The New England Jour nal of Medicine reported that patients with acute lower-back pain exper ienced similar health outcomes whether they received treatment from primary care practitioners, chiropractors or orthopedic surgeons, with primary care providers provid ing the least expensive care of the three types of providers.60 Neck pain. Conventional levels of statistical significance were only achieved for limited outcomes in most studies of tr eatment of neck pain with manipulation.61 Reviewing these diverse results, Daniel Cherkin and Robert D. Mootz, in their report for AHCPR, summarized the quality and comparabili ty of this research as deficient: The relative cost-effectiveness of ch iropractic care and medical care has not been convincingly established. Mo st studies have failed to compare equivalent patients, meas ure clinically useful outcomes and include both direct and indirect costs in the compar ison. Although a majority of studies have found that chiropractic care was less expensive than medical care, some have found the opposite to be true. Ultimately, randomized clinical trials that include cost measures will be needed to satisfactorily answer this question. 62 The chiropractic community has stepped into the breach, supporting a growing volume of new studies, which aim to amend the s hortcomings of prior research. The leading research organization for the chiropractic community , the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (FCER) (primarily funded by NCMIC), currently administers $4.5 million in research studies for chir opractic. Clinical outcomes studies are investigating chiropractic's efficacy in tr eating dysmenorrhea, asthma, hypertension, otitis media, colic and migraine headaches. The profession is also engaged in a number of non-clinical studies, examining, for inst ance, chiropractic's cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction rates. While this developing body of research pales in comparison to federally funded studies of conventional medical approaches, its magni tude does reflect, again, chiropractic's popularity and practice relative to other CAAs. No other CAA has enough practitioners to support research on this large a scale. FCER believes that the following are the most important areas for additional research: Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-22 Economic substitution.

Studies examining chiropr actic's holistic approach to health care and testing the proposition that manipulation is most effective when used as part of a biological-psychologic al-social approach. In addition, NIH's Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) has re cently announced the formation of the Center for Chiropractic Res earch. OAM views this center as the first step toward creating a cohesive national infr astructure for chiropractic research. The Center aims to facilitate interdisciplinary re search involving investigators from both the chiropractic and conventional research communities. By creating a network of chiropractic clinicians and researchers, OAM hopes the Center for Chiropractic Research will help develop chiropractic trea tment protocols and serv e as a bibliographic resource on chiropractic topics. POLICY State Regulations and Certification As noted above, scope of practice is generally se t by state practice acts as well as by state boards of chiropractic. St ates currently vary widely in their licensure requirements. However, 16 states have enacted legislat ion to substitute part of the national chiropractic test for their state licensing tests. In 1993, more than half of st ates allowed chiropractors to use electrode acupuncture, 25% allowed needle acupuncture and 77% a llowed chiropractors to dispense homeopathic remedies. 64 Approximately tors provide acupuncture and 37% dispense homeopathic remedies.65 This reinforces the observation, noted above, The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions Institute for Alternative Futures 4-23 by some experts that chiropractors, as the largest group of CAA providers in the United States, are well positioned to provide care that integrates other CAAs. New legal issues will emer ge as states upgrade their regulation of managed care, probably affecting hiring, reimbursement rates and scope of practice. Lines of accountability will need to be clarified amon g practitioners of different modalities. As the body of research substantiating m anipulation's effectiv eness grows, a wider range of health care providers will seek to provide musculo skeletal manipulation servicespredictably, with varying degrees of ex pertise. Michigan State University already offers a two-week course to medi cal professionals, in cluding physicians and nurses, on the basics of sp inal manipulation from an osteopathic perspective. Malpractice Although chiropractic is considered to have less potential for harm than many conventional modalities, health care fields generally are facing increased litigation. Chiropractors are as vulnerable to this trend as other practiti oners. In 1996, 3% of chiropractors were involved in malpractice litigation for alleged negligent treatment, as compared to the 14.5% of MDs involved in malpractice litigation that year.66 Systematic information on the adverse effects of chiropractic, as for most forms of health care, is not available although adverse effects are t hought to be low in relation to the prevalence of chiropracti c use in the United States. 67 Occasionally findings are published aiming to show chiropractic may have adverse outcomes.68 For example, Dr. Phillip Lee and colleagues at t he Stanford Stroke Center pub lished an article in the June 1995 issue of Neurology outlining the potential hazards of chiropractic manipulation. Based on a survey of the members of the American Academy of Neurology in California, commenting on their perceptions of adverse events, \"t he most frequently reported complication is posterior circulat ion stroke, usually related to vertebral dissection, occurring during or shor tly after cervical manipulation.\"69 Adverse events undoubtedly do occu r, but the Stanford survey prompted criticisms of both its methodology and its conclu sions, with some critics co mmenting that it reflected the generally poor quality of a ssessments of adverse effects. 70 Meanwhile, in a recent Norwegian study, abo ut half the chiropractic patients sampled reported at least one negative reaction to ma nipulation, including local discomfort, headaches, tiredness and radiating discomfor t. The reactions usually disappeared within 24 hours, however, and no seri ous complications were reported. 71 In fact, the occurrence of one of the most serious comp lications of lumbar manipulation, cauda equina syndrome, is estimated at 1 ca se per 100 million manipulations, and the incidence of vertebrobasilar artery comp romise at 1 in 1 million manipulations.72 Soon, as noted above, outcome measures, genomics and other advances in health care will probably allow us to identify in advanc e which patients are prone to suffer side Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-24 effects from particular medications. This will likely also be possible fo r some side effects of manipulation. With neck manipulation, whose risks are particularly high, Cherkin and Mootz note that \"because t he risks of cervical manipulation appear to be higher and more devastating, it would be helpful if future research could identif y subsets of patients at risk of complications for cervical mani pulation and determine if there are specific manipulative techniques that should be avoided or modified.\"73 Better-targeted research will be able to foreca st who is at risk, and greater outcome measurement and monitoring of treatments will also yield more precise information on the nature and frequency of adverse effects. TECHNOLOGY Most chiropractors use a highly sophistic ated and specialized chiropractic table designed to facilitate hands-on treatment. In addition, chiropractors use a variety of ancillary equipment in their offices, su ch as spine massaging tables, exercise equipment, traction tables, electro-stim ulation and heat equipment, to enhance their treatment regime. Key technological advances are occurring in t he areas of treatment devices, information and communications technology and genomics, any of which could significantly reshape chiropractic practice. Devices like mass age chairs, back massage devices and special neck pillows are already available to cons umers through any number of distribution channels. Information systems, particularly those inco rporating genomic information, will allow us to forecast likely diseases and treatm ent side effects and enable better prevention strategies. This ability could lead to lower de mand for chiropractic, if prevention efforts are successful, or increased demand if manipul ation shows itself to be effective in enhancing the immune system or providing qual ity-of-life benefits, which enhance the body's healing capacity. All chiropractors will be able to take part in more aggressive clinical research, even as they document the efficacy of their personal practice. (As discussed in Chapter 2, \"report cards\" will compare health care providers, including chiropractors. Much of their data will come from aggregated patient health records; or it may come from patients' own personal lifelong health records, which they will provide to designated third parties to aggregat e and to ensure confidentiality.) Will technology ever be able to substitute for a practitioner's manipulation skills? Precursors of such devices now exist, both as professional equipment in chiropractors' offices and as consumer-oriented acupressure or massage chairs or equipment (such as that sold in Brookstone stores). However, given the complexity of the more advanced aspects of manipulation, and given the importance of pers onal touch in chiropractic's healing effects any \"robot manipulators\" that exis t by 2010 are not likely to pose significant competition to DCs. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions Institute for Alternative Futures 4-25 Technological developments in biosensors, fitness equipm ent and computers mean that technological wild cards could appear wh ich pose a significant challenge to chiropractors. A minority of experts we inte rviewed did feel this was possible by 2010.Chapter 4: Issues, Trends and Future Directions The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 4-26 ENDNOTES FOR CHAPTER 4 1 R.

A study conducted between 1974 and 1982 found that 7.5% of the population consulted a chiropracto r; a 1980 report to Congress stated that 3.6% of the populati on visited chiropractors each year; and Davi d Eisenberg, MD, at Harvard, concluded in 1990 that 10% of the US population was under chiropractic care, based on telephone surveys (however, of this 10%, 30% said they were practicing self-chiropractic care, ther efore, a 7% figure is probably more reflective of the Eisenberg Study. Pa ul Ray in his Cultural Creatives Study for the Institute for Noetic Sciences in 1994 stated that 15.7% of t he US population visits a chiropractor each year. Landmark Healthcare, Inc., in its stud y, \"The Landmark Report on Public Perceptions of Alternative Care,\" January 1998, found that 42% of the population used some form of alternative care in the past year and 16% of respondents said they had had a chiropractic treatment in the last year (www.landmarkhealthcare.com , p.10).

SCENARIOS FOR CHIROPRACTIC IN 2010: LESSONS LEARNE D ............................ 9 INTRODUCTION This chapter describes four alternative future scenarios for chiropractic care and chiropractors in the year 2010. While eac h is a separate story, they should be considered as a set that will bound the \"future s pace of possibilities\" for chiropractic in light of possible changes to the health care environment in the United States. Keep in mind that health care will experience dramat ic change, as discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, independent of chiropractors' roles. In developing these four chiropractic scenario s, we made a variety of assumptions. For example, the rate of chiropractic underem ployment and the percentage of current and future chiropractic visits that are of a main tenance or \"wellness\" nature varies across the scenarios. There is little or no hard data on these wellness visits, so we have developed plausible estimates based largely on our expert interviews, as well as published sources. Appendix B gives the detailed assump tions for the various forecasts. Other forecasts can and should be explored. We encourage interested chiropractic practitioners, academics and students to dev elop a broader array of scenarios. The purpose of the one given here is to inspire t he reader to consider \"if-then\": \"If this scenario for chiropractic occurs, t hen what are the implications?\" These scenarios provide an impor tant range within which to explore different futures for chiropractic. The chapter contains brief statements of each sc enario, a comparative chart considering the demand for chiropracto rs implied by each one and further details on each scenario. Additional comparative detail and assumptions for the forecasts are given in Appendix B. Chapter 5: Scenarios for Chiropractic in 2010 The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 5-2 OVERVIEW OF FOUR SCENARIOS FOR CHIROPRACTIC IN 2010 Scenario 1\u2014More and Better Health Care Managed care, outcomes and consumers drive health care. Chiropractic care is proven cost-effective for low back pain, headaches, ne ck pain, arthritis, scoliosis, asthma and repetitive stress injuries, and as supplementar y therapy for cancer and other conditions where the disease or treatment involves si gnificant pain. Wal-Mart creates \"the back center\" in its stores and expands access to low cost chiropractic care. There are 103,000 chiropractors, with average visits per week holding at about 120, with back conditions representing 50% of visits and wellness another 20%. Underemployment among chiropractors holds at about 15%. Scenario 2\u2014Hard Times, Frugal Health Care Chiropractic is drastically affected by fr ugal universal coverage through managed care; outcomes limit manipulation to back problems. Meanwhile, 50% of spinal manipulation is delivered by physicians, nurses and other health professionals. Chiropractic colleges close, as only 68,000 chiropractors are needed in 2010. Many of those still practicing are forced to sell \"the $10 treatment.\" Wellness visits decline and underemployment grows to 35%. Scenario 3\u2014Self-Care Rules Very effective self-care, including advanced home health systems and universal catastrophic coverage, make health care a buyer's market. Individuals and families can do most of their care very effectively at home, lowering the need for all types of providers. Surplus providers exceed the 450,000 number forecast in the 1990s by the Pew Commission. Health care professionals who provide \"touch\" are in high demand but competition is fierce. Chiropractors are able to increase demand significantly by ensuring they provide care to 60% of thos e Americans with back problems (rather than 40% as in the 1990s). Chiropractors also expand the indications they can treat with proven efficacy as well as provide evidence that for many people wellness visits are appropriate. The success of chiropractors leads to 85,000 chiropractors in 2010 (about 20,000 fewer than anticipated in 1997) , but they are doing well. Scenario 4\u2014The Transformation Chiropractors' clarified and expanded vision fo r the profession leads them to expand their contribution to health outcomes for t heir patients and their communities. Wellness and self-healing through enabling the body to function effectively (the innate healing force) becomes a much sought-after contribution of chiropractors through manipulation\u2014so sought-after that 50% of manipulation in 2010 is performed by non-chiropractors. Chiropractors broaden what t hey do with and for their patients and their communities. For their patients they combi ne intelligent information systems with high touch and assertive coaching.

Electronic medical records are widely available and they are provider- and patient-friendly. This widespread availab ility helps complementary and alternative approach (CAA) providers to prove their efficacy. Insurance plans expand to integrate coverage for automobile accidents and workers' compensation claims. Oxford Health Care-style plans become the dominant form of managed care by 2010, giving the consumer the lead in deciding what type of care and by whom health care is provided. Chiropractic is advantaged because of its long history of high levels of patient satisfaction. Several chiropractic PPOs and IPAs are formed and compete successfully. The \"Forecast, Prevent and Manage Paradigm\" dom inates over the episodic, reactive treatment approach. Outcome measures (including patient sati sfaction) are generated for all treatment modalities. Many alternative remedies are proved effi cacious; chiropractic is found especially beneficial in treatment of low back pain, headaches, neck, arthritis, scoliosis, asthma and repetitive stress injuries. Periodic chiropractic manipulations (t wice yearly) show benefits for lifelong wellness. Managed care and insurance plans provide a high level of coverage of chiropractic services. Graduating classes from chiropractic coll eges grow to 4,500 by 2005 and 5,000 by 2010, compared with 3,500 per year in mid-1990s. Wal-Mart introduces \"category killer\" back health stores. Like its vision centers in the 1990s, these sections in Wal-Mart provide low-cost services such as massage and basic chiropractic treatments from licensed practitioners, and they sell equipment and devices. The stores handle some of the growi ng population of managed care patients. Wal-Mart creates its own insurance plans for dentistry, vision care and CAAs, including chiropractic, acupuncture and homeopathy. The stores offer extended and weekend hours. Younger chiropractors find job opportunities in these Wal-Mart back health stores and like the work. Chiropractic uses celebrity endorsements in national marketing campaigns to generate interest and create awareness of the benefits of chiropractic health care. Tiger Woods stars in the first nationwide television ad for chiropractic services. Chapter 5: Scenarios for Chiropractic in 2010 The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 5-6 SCENARIO 2\u2014HARD TIMES, FRUGAL HEALTH CARE Economic hard times and serious health care reform lead to frugal, universal coverage through managed care. Use of CAAs is widespread, outside of universally available managed care; patients often barter for services and receive only what they can afford. Coverage by managed care is driven by outcomes. Chiropractic outcomes for conditions other than back problems prove inconclusive and limit chiropractic demand. Based on dissatisfaction and excessive force in treatment, several high-profile chiropractic patients lodge successful ma lpractice suits against chiropractors. Outcomes for other CAAs are mixed and economic hard times make certain low-cost CAAs (e.g., herbal medicines) appealing. Some CAAs grow in use for a wealthy segm ent of the population regardless of efficacy. Demand for chiropractic care by DCs inside managed care is limited. Increased competition by non-DC provider s of manipulation and underemployed DCs leads to lower prices and the advent of many \"bargain basement\" chiropractors advertising \"the $10 adjustment!\" Chiropractic colleges see a nearly 50% drop in enrollment as earlier graduates find it very difficult to find work. Many colleges are no longer viable and t he number of colleges declines from 16 to 10. Half of basic manipulation to treat LBP is done by physicians and other practitioners (nurses, physical therapists, other a llied health professionals, DOs and massage therapists). Some community colleges begin to offer six-month courses that certify students in spinal manipulation. Other health professionals as well as many who were considering attending chiropractic colleges attend these programs. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 5: Scenarios for Chiropractic in 2010 Institute for Alternative Futures 5-7 SCENARIO 3\u2014SELF-CARE RULES Self-care, universal access to catastr ophic health insurance and expert systems all combine to create a system of self-managed care. Consumers pay for most care out-of-pocket because of the high deductible. Medical saving accounts (MSAs) are widely used and reinforce consumers' need to \"shop wisely.\" A two-tier system results, with the rich able to buy more expensive options. The wellness model is common and many people visit a chiropractor on a monthly basis, some through insurance, most paying out-of-pocket. Structural unemployment rises for all health care providers as managed care is replaced by managed self-care, with expert systems enabli ng consumers to do most of their own care. By 2010, the 1995 estimate of 350,000-500,000 surplus physicians, nurses and pharmacists has been exceeded. Structural unemployment affects more than just health professionals; it diminishes many individuals' ability to pay out-of-pocket for some services Health care professionals using \"touc h modalities\" have an advantage, but competition is fierce. A large range of sophisticated manipulation services is sought by consumers as treatment for LBP, arthritis, women's heal th and repetitive stress disorders. Spinal manipulation is delivered largely by chiropractors but also by physicians, physical therapists and others. Health care markets become much smarter, and consumers are able to make sophisticated choices about compet ing modalities and providers. Chiropractors compete with other CAA pr oviders and conventional providers for patients. Patient satisfaction, cost, pr oven efficacy and \"reputation\" as a healer separate the winners and losers. Government plays a role as monito r/regulator of health information. Expert systems are very effective \"electroni c coaches,\" enabling self-care and wellness; these are backed up, when needed, by in -person visits with practitioners. DNA profiles in medical records and genome mapping allow a better understanding of the relative role of genetics and environment in causing health problems, including low back pain Sophisticated \"home healthy\" chairs and rela ted devices provide relatively advanced acupressure, inter-segmental traction and back massage. Bio-data gathered by these chairs is recorded directly into the patient's electronic medical record. Chapter 5: Scenarios for Chiropractic in 2010 The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 5-8 The chairs are used in health providers' waiting rooms as well as in chiropractic offices. About 15% of chiropractors move into non- clinical roles as developers of self-care technologies, public health administrators and outcomes/integration researchers. SCENARIO 4\u2014THE TRANSFORMATION Values, cultural creativity and visionary c hoices, aided by a few human and natural catastrophes, lead to a global mind change. Wellness is pursued, particularly through high-leverage health gain strategies. Managed care dominates, with aggressive and visionary leadership. Focus of the health care system is now wellness. Wellness is seen as a combination of better physical health, personal growth and community health. The bio-psycho-social approach leads to greater emphasis on lifestyle. Healing touch is a major tool for prevention and treatment. \u00be Quarterly wellness visits to health prof essionals who also play a significant health coaching role become common for many individuals. \u00be Along with an increase in wellness care, chiropractors regularly treat the secondary and tertiary effects of terminal diseases and advanced aging. Health is defined in many compatible ways, one of which is more effective communication from the brain to each cell in the body and vice versa via the spine. The ability of the body to heal itself, called by many names\u2014including the innate life force, remembered wellness or the pl acebo effect\u2014becomes a central part of health care. People understand the benefits and risks of all relevant modalities. Individuals also know the \"batting aver age,\" the comparative outcomes, of all health care professionals and expert systems available to them. Health care adopts a design focus. Syndr omes of risk are designed out wherever possible. Health professionals expand into appropriate roles for broader health. Chiropractic work includes advice and advocacy on environmental, workplace and school health. Many chiropractic graduates continue their education in public health and become DC-MPHs and find work as non-clinicians in public health and policy roles. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 5: Scenarios for Chiropractic in 2010 Institute for Alternative Futures 5-9 SCENARIOS FOR CHIROPRACTIC IN 2010: LESSONS LEARNED As mentioned earlier, scenarios are tools fo r learning about the future. This set of scenarios on the future of chiropractic care should help the chiropractic community first to better understand the range of plausible futu res for the field and then to better plan to take advantage of the potential opportuni ties created by the changing future environment. There are a few lessons that the chiropractic community should take away from this set of scenarios: Outcomes will drive which prov iders will treat which conditions. Information systems will enable health care to become a \"market\" with providers and modalities better able to compet e with each other on level ground. Health care providers who seek opport unities to leverage health gains in the communities they serve will be winners. Non-clinical opportunities for chiropractors in community health, self-care technology development and policy areas will grow. Self-care, enabled by information technology and health devices, will play a large part in shaping 21st century health care. The competition for patients will be fierce\u2014 only those health care providers creating the greatest value-added (optimizing health gains) for their patients will remain viable. Strong relationships between patients and pr oviders will prove to be an important advantage, even in managed care settings. \"Touch\" professionals will have an advantage in the future. The chiropractic community should use this set of scenarios to understand: There is a range of plausible futures for chiropractic and health care. With insightful and proactive action and decisions, the chiropractic community can create the future it prefers. Chiropractic and chiropractors need a powerfu l shared vision of the desired future for the chiropractic community, while gr ounded in the realities described in these scenarios. The vision should reflect the deepest aspirations for the future of chiropractic and the profession's contribut ion to the health of the patients and communities it serves.

With 55,000 chiropractors in the United States it is the lar gest of the complementary and alternative approaches (CAAs), used by an estimated 10% of Americans. Yet this 10% represents only one-quarter of those who have back related problems. Thus there is potential for additional use of spinal manipulation for many more people gi ven the existing patterns of back related complaints. And there is a wide range of other indications for which chiropractic services are sought, for which efficacy is not yet estab lished. Beyond classic medical indications, as much as one-third of current demand for chiropractic services may be for wellness or routine maintenance visits not related to a specific problem or incident. These wellness visits might grow as well. And chiropractors face the choice of optimizing health gains by consistently using a wider range of tool s, such as behavioral and nutrition coaching, beyond the primary focus on spin al manipulation. Finally, beyond care for individuals lies chiropractors' contribution to health gains for their communities. In the face of these opportunities, supply is rising. The chiropractic field will nearly double its numbers by 2010, to 103,000. Meanwhile, a likely surplus of physicians and nurses could reach 300,000 to 450,000 by 2010. Surviving physicians will broaden their range of tools, including perhaps to mani pulation. Thus, competition may become particularly fierce. In this chapter we provide our major insight s, then identify what we found in relation to the five hypotheses we used for this st udy. Next are our recommendations for the profession and finally our conclusions. MAJOR INSIGHTS Principle Challenges Facing the Field The conflicts among the leadership in the chiropractic field are often more visible than any high-level cooperation; the field needs a powerful shared vision to remind the profession of what is significa nt that it shares in common. Consumers, other than satisf ied chiropractic patients, of ten have a low or negative opinion of chiropractic. While most chiropractors consider themselv es to be providing primary care, most do not provide what would be expected of a primary care provider, and neither the public nor the health care provider communi ty sees chiropractors as primary care providers. Most chiropractors are doing relatively little to include CAAs in their services. The potential doubling in the number of chiropractors by 2010 will create divisive competition if demand for services does not grow in proportion to projected growth. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations Institute for Alternative Futures 6-3 Some chiropractors do over-treat and have contributed to the negative image of the profession among some of the public. Managed care will at least initially limit what is covered, and often provide fewer than the normal number of visits at lower than profitable rates. Managed care in some areas has already created significant underemployment of chiropractors. Allopathic physicians, nurses and pharmaci sts also face surplus numbers in a marketplace squeezed by managed care. Other CAA providers, particularly t hose using homeopathy and acupuncture, have a more favorable image than do chir opractors among many consumers. Opportunities for Chiropractors Chiropractic is a dynamic healing profe ssion that as an American invention has helped people for more than 100 years. Chiropractic stimulates the capacity fo r self-healing and for effective neural communication within the body. Proof of this capacity ca n create a larger role and market for the profession. There is great potential for providing r egular \"wellness\" visits. Among established chiropractic practices, a significant per centage of patients already come in for \"wellness\" or routi ne maintenance visits. Chiropractors can create primary care and health promotion options for themselves\u2014given the right vision, commitm ents, strategies and communication of credible outcomes research. The information revolution will give chiropr actors better tools to enable effective primary care and health promotion in more time- and cost-effective ways. The profession can advertise that for a number of indications beyond back pain, the evidence of chiropractic benefits is growing, and that chiropractic patients generally report high degrees of satisfaction. A wide array of public figures uses chir opractic and no doubt many would gladly give endorsements. Chiropractic is fundamentally a touch or hands-on approach, at a time when the public is yearning for personal rela tionships with their providers. Chiropractic has its own interpretation of mind-body relationships in the chiropractic notion of vitalism. A public increasi ngly alienated from impersonal medical procedures may be drawn to this approach. The profession can enhance its research and learning capabilit y and may attract additional public suppor t and funding for research. Managed care can provide access to a la rger number of patients and to other health-care providers, enabli ng greater work on teams in integrated health-care systems. Beyond individual patients, significant opportunities exist for chiropractors to enhance community health, some of which could increase business. Chiropractic colleges can develop greater skill levels using techniques from other CAAs (such as Oriental medicine and homeopathy). Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 6-4 STUDY HYPOTHESES We began this study with certain hypotheses for which we expected to find support and which helped to frame our research. This se ction will set out our findings and insights related to these hypotheses. As noted above, this study on the Future of Chiropractic was done in parallel with a larger study on th e Future of Complementary and Alternative Approaches. The results here likewise paralle l those reported in that study, though with an explicit focus on the chiropractic profession. Again, the hypotheses we identifi ed in Chapter 1 are as follows: 1. Complementary and alternative approac hes, including chiropractic, will be integrated into conventional medical pr otocols, displacing some portion of conventional medicine. 2. Chiropractic and other C AAs will become major tools for health promotion and prevention. 3. Chiropractors and other CAA providers will become recognized as primary care providers and will be funded by the dominant health care systems. 4. The use of manipulatio n and other alternative t herapies by conventional providers and \"automated\" providers will increase. 5. Chiropractors, other CAA providers and conventional ca re providers who take a significant role in creating healthy comm unities will gain a competitive advantage. A \"futures study,\" speculati ng on what is likely to occur between now and 2010, has no empirical data to work with since the ev ents have not yet occurred. This in no way means that information is lacking. There ar e patterns of experience as well as newly emerging trends. There is also the will, t he commitment and the energy of individuals and organizations to create the future. At th e Institute for Alternative Futures we regularly observe these trends in so ciety and the environment, in science and technology, and in health care delivery and ther apeutics, as well as trends in visions or preferred futures. We cons idered the trends we are m onitoring on an ongoing basis, and we asked experts in health care, both conventional and CAAs, and in health policy for their insights, forecasts and reactions to our forecasts. These experts provided their assessments of what has occurred and their speculations about what might be and what they think should be. We also cons ulted consumers and managed care executives in focus groups. Finally, we conducted exte nsive additional literature research. Thus, this report reflects a high level of colle ctive intelligence. What we present here is our synthesis and interpretation of that intelligence in relation to the hypotheses our \"findings\" for this futures report. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations Institute for Alternative Futures 6-5 Hypothesis #1\u2014Complementary and Alternative Approaches (CAAs), including chiropractic, will be integ rated into conventional medical protocols, displacing some porti on of conventional medicine - Yes to both integration and displacement This trend has already begun to occur. By 2 010 CAAs will definitely be integrated into conventional protocols. Chiropractic manipul ation will be integrated for a variety of conditions. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) has found it effective for acute lower-back pain in the context of certain appr opriateness criteria. There is some, though as yet limited, evidence of effectiveness for neck pain and headaches, and promising though unconfirmed ev idence for effectiveness of many other conditions (see Table 4-1). It is likely to displace some degree of surgical or pharmacological care for those indica tions where its efficacy is shown. The degree of integration and di splacement will also be a ffected by four major trends occurring in conventional therapeutics: 1) The customization of therapeutics based on the genotype and phenotype of the individual; 2) Moving toward \"integrated therapeutics,\" wh ich naturally will include some CAAs; 3) Simultaneously seeking \"fu lly decisive\" therapeutics; and 4) Using cost-effective \"supportive\" or co mplementary approaches, which add to the quality of life. The use of chiropractic and chiropract ors will be affected by each of these. Customization of Therapeutics This area is more speculative, though it is likely that genomics will discover genes that relate to chiropractic, e.g., that signal speed within the nervous system. This may affect how chiropractic is delivered, and target its efficacy still further. Likewise the phenotypic groupings of Oriental, Ayur vedic or homeopathic medicine may prove relevant to what and how m anipulation is provided. Integrated Therapeutics z For chiropractors to use a more integrated approach takes knowledge and time. Part of the chiropractor's dilemma in considering future roles is the ti me-efficient nature of manipulation, allowing an effe ctive patient encounter in 10 minutes or less. There are likely to be expert systems developed whic h enable chiropractors, as part of their practice management, to cost-effectively do more lifestyle monitoring and coaching for their patients. z However, some chiropractors (often of the \"straight\" vs. \"mixer\" school of chiropractic) argue that chiropractors should remain focused on manipulation alone. Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 6-6 z Primary care will require chiropractors to c onfront a broader set of conditions among their patients, as well as a broad, integrated set of therapeutic tools. Definitive treatments z Medical scientist Lewis Thomas noted that most approaches used in conventional health care are \"halfway technologies\" they palliate, but do not provide definitive prevention or cure. Thomas thought we woul d find \"definitive treatments\" in the 21st century.1 Health care in this century has sought definitive treatments, sometimes conceived of as \"magic bullets\" which target the problem or disease but require little behavioral change on the part of the pati ent. Some CAAs may provide \"magic bullets,\" e.g., herbal or homeopathic remedi es for various problems. Chiropractic manipulation itself can, fo r some, provide a definitive treatment. Yet a profound lesson is now being absorbed by the heal th care system fr om the integrated approaches. Ornish's program for heart disease can reverse heart disease by reversing plaque buildup in the arteries. Or nish argues that his approach can also be used to reverse cancer. Instead of a \"magic bullet\" this represents a more holistic \"magic arsenal\" which includes behavioral approaches (particularly diet, exercise, stress relief and spiritualit y or personal growth). z There will be new, powerful \"magic bullets\" in the classic pharmacological sense, e.g., drugs that effectively melt plaque in the artery. And there will continue to be interest in and support for quick fixes, by both consumers and health care providers. But the paradigm of being healthier rather than relying on \"fixes \" will grow as well. Supportive treatments z Chiropractic offers great promise for enhancing the quality of life for those with certain chronic conditions and for thos e undergoing therapy which is physically taxing, such as cancer chemotherapy. C AAs are already widely used by consumers in this area and experts such as Michael Lerner have argued for such a role for chiropractic for some cancer patients. As evidence of the efficacy and cost- effectiveness of CAAs as complementary th erapies becomes more available, health care providers will incorporate them into their practices. IAF's foreca st for this report, presented in Chapter 1, is that chiropractic is likely to have value as a supportive or complementary therapy for AIDS, Alzheimer's, arthritis, cancer, some chronic pain, diabetes and heart disease. Cost-effectiv eness will be important to winning medical coverage, but coverage is likely to gr ow. In addition, out-o f-pocket spending for chiropractic as a supportive treatment\u2014es pecially as evidence of effectiveness is shown\u2014will grow. Hypothesis #2\u2014Chiropractic and other CAAs will become major tools for health promotion and prevention - Yes This will occur in two ways: first, by thei r fostering of broader lifestyle and mind/body approaches and second, through great er routine use of core CAA modalities, such as The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations Institute for Alternative Futures 6-7 periodic \"wellness\" visits for spinal adj ustment or for energy re-balancing through acupuncture. Health promotion usin g multiple modalities Physical, nutritional, psychological and spir itual approaches to health will generally make a person healthier and provide higher qual ity of life. Thus they are \"winning\" strategies even if the person has a fatal condition such as late-stage cancer. In some cases they may be all that is needed to rest ore health; in other cases they can help individuals to die well. CAAs such as Oriental medicine, ch iropractic and homeopathy are all based on philosophies that encourage holistic health practices on the part of the individual. These three, and many other CAAs, thus th eoretically reinforce health promotion. The same could be said for allopathic m edical care, at its philosophical best. In practice, as noted regarding integrated t herapeutics, CAA providers can be as reductionist as allopathic physicians o ften are in focusing on the immediate complaint at hand, using a limited set of therapeutic tools. W hen chiropractors act consistently with broader health philos ophies and visions, within a practice environment that monitors long-term outcome s and consumer satisfaction, CAAs are likely to become a standard component of health promotion\u2014particularly their lifestyle components. Health promotion through routine wellness visits z Leading CAA providers and experts argue that per iodic visits are needed to maintain patients' health. Some chiropractors recommend quarterly or monthly checkups; some physicians using integrated practice s recommend quarterly visits for energy re-balancing through acupuncture, spinal manipulation and conversations about personal well-being. Such visits can vary widely in their time and cost. A visit involving only spinal manipulation might l ead to patient and chiropractor contact of as few as five minutes, while a wellne ss visit incorporating a range of approaches including acupuncture might take 45-60 minut es of the consumer's time and 30-45 minutes for the practitioner. An estimated 14-35% of chiropractic visits in this country already consist of these \"wellness visits.\" Their popularity has been driven by consumer demand; many consumers are willing to pay for them out-o f-pocket. Some experts argue that such visits reduce the need for more costly diagnostic or treatment approaches, particularly hospital utilization. These \"we llness visits\" paid for by consumers as \"non-medical\" services will grow, as will t he consumer \"report cards\" which allow consumers to identify their degree of satisfaction with such payments. Simultaneously, chiropractors doing this ty pe of practice will be called on to identify how much of a difference thes e sessions make to health. Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 6-8 Hypothesis #3\u2014Chiropractors and other CAA providers will become recognized as primary care provid ers and will be funded by the dominant health care systems - Potentially Chiropractors and other CAA providers will be recognized as primary care providers As noted in Chapter 4, \"primary care\" is a moving target. The definition of a primary care provider is shifting, from simply the \"primary contact\" caregiver to the practitioner who assumes overall responsibili ty for effectively managing the patient's problems, including referrals to other heal th care professionals where appropriate. Beyond this, the role also includes acti ng as a consultant or advocate on health promotion both for the indivi dual and for the community. Using the broader definition as the person who is the pr imary or first contact for patients and who is responsible for managing an individual's health carechiropractors do play this role for some of their patients, but are not generally recognized as such. Other CAA providers, for example, naturopat hs, some Oriental medicine practitioners and homeopaths, are s een as primary care providers. As evidence on outcomes becomes more available, and as CAA providers show themselves able to work within health care delivery systems, thei r role as primary care providers will grow, particularly if they can offer either less-expensive care or consumer-preferred care, or both. To increase their own effectiveness, ch iropractors need to better understand both competing CAAs and conventional approaches to care. And they will need to become more open to evidence for the efficacy of c onventional practices t hat grate on them philosophically. Conversely, conventional health care will discover that some of the complaints by the CAA providers have meri t and can be dealt with. For example, some chiropractors oppose mandatory immunization because of the potential side effects. Yet the general success and appropriateness of childhood immunizations is sufficiently established that managed care organizations, to maintain their certification, are required to work to maintain high ra tes of immunization in their communities. Nevertheless, the chiropractors' argument has some merit, and, in the years ahead, genomics will allow us to target who is likely to experience parti cular side effects. Practitioners and patients can then consider the relative risks more effectively. Funding by dominant health care systems Increasingly, health care providers are including CAAs, both therapies and providers, in their coverage. As noted, many leading health care providers are opening CAA centers in their systems and in corporating CAAs into their standard practice. Given the high degree of consum er interest, and presuming growing evidence for cost-effectiveness, CAAs (medications and services) will be funded by the dominant heath care systems. The extent to which this will include chiropractors The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations Institute for Alternative Futures 6-9 as the primary care physician will depend on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of chiropractors handling the full range of health problems a managed care organization must deal with. Chiropractors' choices will define their primary care role In our view, the ultimate answer of w hether the chiropractor will become a primary care physician for more than a small per centage of individual s will depend on the decisions of individual chiropractors to ta ke on the responsibility and to broaden their tools, information sources, health care partnerships and practice styles. Hypothesis #4\u2014The use of chiropractic manipulation and other CAAs by conventional providers, \"automated\" providers and consumers themselves will increase - Yes by conventional providers for chiropractic; Probably Not by robots and consumers Application by conventional providers By 2010 health care in the United States will be far more effectiv e and cost-effective than now. Chiropractic manipulation and other CAAs will be incorporated into health care. Integrated therapeutics, protocols and best practice benchmarking will be common and will be more easily incorporated in to health care practice by various expert systems. Yet the same development of expert systems which assist health care providers will also provide much of th at knowledge directly to individuals for enhanced self-care. By 2010 significant surpluses of physi cians and nurses will have occurred. Health care providers who can compete successful ly in this environment will need to be able to deliver the most appropriate ca re. Given consumer demand for CAAs, including chiropractic, allopathic physici ans and nurses providing direct care are likely to incorporate chiropractic manipul ation as well as other CAAs. This will particularly be the case where they are reimbursed for the manipulation. Increasingly, health care syst ems will advertise how \"holistic\" they are. Local report cards are likely to assess how \"holistic\" health care systems and individual providers are, noting which major approaches they use and ultimately how successful they are in applying various conventional, comple mentary and alternative modalities, including manipulation, in treating specific co nditions and for prevention. It is feasible and likely that conventional health care plan s will also make more consistent use of their members to test and va lidate CAAs and conventional therapeutics. This active involvement of large numbers of individual patients/customers in testing new and old therapeutics will become more important, as cu stomization of care leads to a focus on effectiveness in specific subgroups in the population. Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 6-10 Chiropractic manipulation is an advanced skill related to sophisticated diagnostic requirements. As noted in Chapter 3, while it might take two to four years for a trained health care professional to be trained to provide full chiropractic care, limited spinal manipulation can be taught in several weeks. For other modalities, or aspects of them, e.g., use of a homeopathic rem edy or an Oriental herbal remedy, a physician might be able to apply them almost immediately if the relevant expertise has been incorporated into the protocols and expert systems used by the physician's health care organization. \"Automated providers\" Many aspects of health care generally, and CAAs specifically, will be provided by expert systems and/or intelligent equi pment in the years ahead. Automation of spinal manipulation, while f easible in the next century, is not likely to have a significant effect on the demand for manipulation by human professionals. Consumer self-care with manipulation One definition of the chiropr actor's role is to manipulat e the joints of the spine beyond what an individual could do alone\u2014the paraphysiological range. It is possible that some automat ed manipulators may become relevant for the consumer or fitness market. Potential examples include a chair or similar device a successor to the acupressure chairs already on the consumer market\u2014or consumer versions of the intersegmental traction tables used in chiropractors' offices. These devices would provide various types of spinal mobilization, stretching and traction. The technical question is whether these pieces of equipment could effectively move the spine into the paraphysiological range of mo tion. Most chiropractors in our study thought this unlikely and were offended by the idea. Some more technologically focused experts thought it feasible at some point in the first part of the 21st century, if not by 2010. Hypothesis #5\u2014Chiropractors and ot her CAA and conventional health care providers who take a significant role in creating healthy communities will gain a competitive advantage - A qualified Yes , hopefully This hypothesis is based on our observations of developments in health care in the United States and other regions of the worl d. Given IAF's experience, and what we have learned in developing this report, our forecast remains that health care providers (both individuals and health systems), while being held accountable for the health outcomes of their individual patients, will s hare responsibility for the health of the communities they serve. To the extent they can help create healthier communities, they will gain competitive adv antage. This forecast is made with less certainty than those above. It is as much an aspiration or statem ent of hope as a plausible forecast. To date, community health has not been a focus for most CAAs (as it is not for most MDs). The The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations Institute for Alternative Futures 6-11 1998 award from Prevention magazine and the Alliance for Chiropractic Progress to chiropractors for community service is an impor tant step from inside the profession in that direction. RECOMMENDATIONS Aspire: Clarify Chiropractic's Identity and Vision Chiropractic is based on powerful visions\u2014fro m D.D. Palmer on\u2014held by leaders who are committed to using a set of tools focuse d on the spine to bring about better health. Chiropractors have been able to maneuver successfully through a multitude of challenges over the last 100 years. Yet the challenges will become even more pronounced as we enter the 21 st century. It is time to consider the identity and vision of the profession for the 21st century. Much of what we have reviewed deals with t he tools, the strategi es and the challenges facing chiropractic. Chiropractic's vision is about what the fi eld is committed to creating\u2014What is the best that can be? What is the noble purpose of chiropractic? What is the legacy that today's chiropr actors will leave for their children and grandchildren? Answers to t hese questions are vital both within the profession and in communication with the public. Where powerful shared visions can be created, the pursuit of narrow self-interest becomes more difficult. It is essential that chiropractors develop this shared vision so that individual chiropractors can enhanc e their own vision and identity. In the challenging times ahead, vision and identity provide a compass. The environment for healing will become ever more rewardi ng, yet the economic and administrative challenges will appear more threat ening. A vision links the profe ssion's values to what it wants to create. Below we review our recommendations regarding primary care, managed care and health promotion. But these wil l be most productive in the context of a powerful shared vision for the profession. The leading national chiropractic organi zations should cooperate to develop a unified vision for the profession that helps it unite around the highest shared values of chiropractors, those they wish to sustai n and the resulting \"preferred future\" which they can jointly commit to creating. The development of this vi sion should touch as many ch iropractors in the United States as possible. This national chiropractic vision should be done in association with state and local vision development. Processes should be developed to help indi vidual chiropractors clarify their own personal vision and identity in connection with the larger profession. These Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 6-12 processes should enable chiropractors to more easily consider their long-term contributions and their near-t erm strategies regarding pr imary care, managed care and health promotion. Determine Chiropractic's Role in Primary Care Primary care is evolving into the leading edge of health care, responsible for the outcomes of the individual and sharing the responsibility for the health outcomes of communities. Primary care practitioner s and their patients will have ever more sophisticated tools that allow the patient to do advanced self-care and the practitioner to provide various levels of ongoing coaching and services, which formerly were the domain of specialists. A major factor in su ccessful primary care will be the commitment on the part of providers to pr oactively manage the health of their patients, in cooperation with their patients. Many chiropractors see themselves as pr imary care providers, yet they are not recognized as such by payors or by most co nsumers. Some chiropractors choose not to consider themselves primary care providers. Hence, we recommend that t he chiropractic community: Help individual chiropractors determine if they are willing to take on the additional challenges of being more broadly responsible fo r the health of more of their patients, including maintaining an effective personal relationship and taking responsibility for lowering their preventable morbidity. Fund outcome studies with large enough gr oups to determine the efficacy and cost- effectiveness of chiropractors as primary care providers in comparison with other primary care providers. Accelerate the development and availability of tools that chiropractors can use to do more effective primary care in the most time-effective ways. \u00be Prepare chiropractors to tr eat the wide range of primary care complaints and to refer effectively as appropriate. For those chiropractors who choose not to pursue primary care, celebrate the fact that many chiropractors will remain neuros keletal specialists providing worthy services, without taking on the broader responsibilities of primary care. Engage Managed Care Managed care faces its own identity and vision crisis. Managed care has spent much of its effort managing cost, not managi ng care\u2014much less managing and enhancing health. But this is likely to change, with managed care being driven by outcomes to provide long-term health gains. In addi tion, by 2010, managed care will have been partially displaced by sophisticated self -managed care. In the meantime, managed care will continue to be a major force affecting the practice of most chiropractors. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations Institute for Alternative Futures 6-13 Therefore, we recommend that the chiropractic community: Accelerate the development of outcome me asures to show the cost-effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation for t he traditional indications chir opractors treat as well as for the emerging indications listed in this report. Prepare chiropractors to compete in very cost-constrained settings. Prepare chiropractors to work effectively as members of various types of health care teams. Enhance and operate effectively the ch iropractic equivalents of managed care, taking on the risk, managing the care and generating greater health gains than conventional managed care. Encourage patients to dem and chiropractic care from managed care plans, and equip them with the evidence of chiropractic's efficacy. Enhance and document chiropractic's relevance to the Medicare business\u2014as more of Medicare comes under managed care, chir opractic's ability to treat geriatric conditions and manage pain should be promoted. Prepare chiropractors to play a gatekeeper role, managing access to proven CAAs effectively, for managed care. Take optimum advantage of third-party studi es favorable to chiropractic, such as AHCPR's, for publicity and leverage t hem into managed care coverage. Prepare chiropractors to thrive with emergi ng provider systems, such as retailers who enter the delivery market (\"Wal-Mart Back Store\" type of option). Champion Health Promotion To the extent that health prom otion is part of the identity and vision of chiropractors, the profession needs to make health promotion a r eal part of their daily practices. Health promotion will play a large role in 21st century health care. Chiropractors will want to demonstrate their ability to contribute to heal th promotion for individuals and for the communities they serve. Thus, we recommend that t he chiropractic community: Enable chiropractors to provide health promotion services more easily and cost- effectively. Increase chiropractic outcomes as health coaches, affecting behavior positively. Explore and document the effectiveness of r outine \"wellness visits\" to chiropractors. Accelerate the development of appropria te in-office and in-home tools for patient self-direction, automating appropriate par ts of the health promotion process. Individual chiropractors and local and stat e chiropractic associations should commit to community health initiatives. Use epidemiological approaches to determi ne where the greatest health gains can be achieved and to lower the incidence of back-related conditions. Be creative in attacking the largest caus es of illness regardless of their impact on Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 6-14 chiropractic demand; and seek out high-le verage situations where appropriate chiropractic treatment can ma ke significant health gains. Be personal models of health promotion. Provide \"performance enhancement\" and proac tive wellness services, and monitor their outcomes. Enable the Chiropractor to Practice More Broadly In this evolving health care environment, chir opractors must be able to deal with the emerging science and technology in health care , with the growing role of other CAAs and with relevant developments in conventional medicine. We recommend that individual chiroprac tors and the chiropractic community: Encourage the development of softwar e and other tools for choosing among and accessing various CAAs. Enable chiropractors to deal with the information which genomics will produce on the proclivity to various diseases, as well as the impacts that it is likely to have on the chiropractor's patients. Accelerate the capacity of chiropractors to customize their treatment and health promotion services, as appropriate genotype and phenotype markers become available. Foster appropriate research on the role of genotype and phenotype from a chiropractic perspective, and research the appropriate chiropractic response. Identify additional customiz ation approaches (in addition to genomic genotype, the phenotypes suggested, for example, by homeopathic, Oriental or Ayurvedic medicine) that will target chiropractic. Move beyond professional chauvinism in order to accelerate the ability to work with and refer to physicians and other health care providers. Explore the contribution that chiropract ors can make in public health, policymaking and research through roles ot her than as clinicians. \u00be Assist individual chiropractors and st udents to provide impor tant contributions beyond clinical services. Monitor: Define, Collect and Share Outcomes The chiropractic profession, like all health professions, will need to provide outcomes data in the future to just ify their treatment approaches. Outcomes may well make the difference between the winner s and losers in the 21st century health care environment. We recommend that the chiropractic community: Aggressively promote data collection in chiropractic pr actices. Ensure that this data can be used to aggregate information across prac tices, in order to show community and nationwide patterns. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations Institute for Alternative Futures 6-15 \u00be Support the development of local/community report cards on chiropractors and other health care providers. Update the Mercy Guidelines and other relevant benchmarks or practice guidelines, frequently; do this in relation to parallel advances in health pr omotion, genomics, self-care and community health. Develop the outcomes that justify chiropractic care fo r indications beyond treatment for lower back pain. Develop the outcomes that ju stify routine wellness visits. Develop the outcomes that enable chiropracto rs to optimize their use of multiple approaches by determining what CAAs or conventional approaches are best used with manipulation. Communicate Communication of a coherent message and vi sion will be vital for chiropractic. Chiropractors must overcome negative beliefs held by consumers and managed care executives regarding the profession' s scope of practice and efficacy. We recommend that the chiropractic community: Work to overcome chiropractic's negat ive image among many consumer and health care executives by focusing on the outcome s that chiropractors can provide and the wide range of individuals who use chiropractors. Develop a communication plan that makes use of both existing and emerging media to reach the wider public. Seek out celebrity users of chir opractic to endorse the field. Self-Police the Profession All health professions have their share of poor practitioners. One mark of a profession rather than a trade is the self- policing of its members. Self -policing is perhaps the most effective method for eliminating practitioners who can harm the overall field with their inappropriate or grossly ineffective actions. We recommend that the chiropractic community: Provide standards of conduct, codes of et hics, mechanisms for hearing complaints against DCs and the capacity to sanction wayward DCs. Develop the ability to identify and constrai n or remove chiropractors who over-treat, have high numbers of adverse reactions or misrepresent themselves and the field. Provide active support for local marketpl ace report cards and other devices whereby outcomes, including consumer satisfac tion, and adverse events are recorded and made available to consum ers and large purchasers. Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures 6-16 Don't Produce Surplus Chiropractors As noted in Chapters 3, 4 and 5, plausible forecasts and sc enarios exist that indicate the potential for a surplus of chiropractors. This possibility, in conjunction with the Pew Commission forecast of large numbers of excess MDs and RNs, makes the potential for overproduction of chiropractors something t he chiropractic community should monitor. We recommend that the chiropractic community: Not allow chiropractic colle ges to needlessly overproduce. Provide appropriate research to forecast potential surpluses of chiropractors, and to monitor current underemployment and unemployment among chiropractors. Ensure that students are given the tools to forecast demand for their services, and the size and nature of health professional competition while in school and beyond. Encourage appropriate non-clinical cont ributions and employment of students. Promote Health Equity The ability of an individual health profe ssional or group of health providers like chiropractors to enhance the overall health of the communities in which they work will become an important m easure in the future. Chiroprac tic can and should play a broad role in creating healthy communities and great er equity in access to health and health outcomes. We recommend that the chiropractic community: Promote greater equity in health services and health outcomes. Encourage individual chiropractors to contri bute their services for community health activities. Support policies and local actions that w ould increase access to appropriate health care and efforts, beyond health care , to improve community health. Stimulate Frontiers of R&D Research and development in the health arena will change the way in which health care is measured and delivered, and who is pr oviding the tools for greater health. Chiropractors should participate in expl oring this exciting new frontier. We recommend that the chiropractic community: Encourage research on chiropractic us ed in conjunction with other CAAs. Continually monitor leading-edge research (such as neurosciences, biosensors and nanotechnologies) and assess its im plications for chiropractic. Encourage research on customizat ion by phenotype and genotype and its implication for chiropractic. Investigate research by other groupings suggested by CAAs, such as homeopathy, Oriental and Ayurvedic medicine. The Future of Chiropractic Chapter 6: Insights and Recommendations Institute for Alternative Futures 6-17 CONCLUSION The future of chiropractic as a healing pr ofession will be shaped by a host of forces\u2014 the greatest of which is the identity, visi on and creativity of chir opractors. This report has outlined the field of forces and the alter native paths into the future that chiropractic may take. Chiropractic has had a significant first 100 years\u2014inventing, developing and growing\u2014along the way providi ng healing opportunities in di rect relationship with patients. The years ahead, as with most health professions, will involve greater teamwork, greater learning and sharing of approaches and a clear need to justify services on the basis of outcomes. Chiropractic must take i mmediate and ongoing strategic steps if the profession is to survive and thrive in the 21 st century. If the profession does not ri se to the occasion and proactively meet the challenges discussed here, it is our considered opinion that chiropractic, as a separately defined profession, will decline significantly. On the other hand, if chiropractic is able to address these challenges and to capitalize on many of the opportunities discussed here, then there is a strong chance that the profession wi ll not only grow but will also legitimize its position with key constituencies, including a br oader base of government agencies, consumer/patients, managed care, other co mplementary and alternative approaches (CAAs) to health care and the allopathic health care systems and providers. It is critical to note that success (or fa ilure) for chiropractic is in the hands of chiropractors themselves\u2014visionaries, leaders in the fi eld and individual practitioners. The alternative scenarios fo r the future defined in this report outline challenges in the environment for chiropractors, as well as choices for the profession itself. It is up to chiropractic to choose its preferred future and, by addressing the challenges and opportunities t hat have been defined, to ensur e that this future is realized. We have explored the first part of chiroprac tic's second century. Chiropractic has the potential to optimize health gains for indivi duals and for communities. Chiropractors can remain focused on the current indications w here they are now most successful. Or the field and its members can be overwhelmed by the challenges that lie ahead in the health care environment. Which of these futu res is created rests in the hands of chiropractors. 1 L. Thomas.

Thes e examples are by no means an exhaustive accounting of the rapid merging of C AA and conventional medicine occurring today. Rather, they demonstrate that CAA integration into convent ional medicine is a very visible, significant and ac tive trend in health care. PROVIDER INTEGRATION: PATIENT-DRIVEN CARE FOR LOW-INCOME CONSUMERS King County Natural Medicine Clinic, Kent, Washington Located at the Kent Community Health Cent er in Kent, Washington, the King County Natural Medicine Clinic provides integrated conventional family practice services and natural medicine services to poor and uni nsured people in Kent and throughout south King County. Opened in fall 1996, the Clinic is a collaborative effort by the Community Health Centers of King County and Bastyr Un iversity (the nation's leading naturopathic academy, located in Seattle), with funding fr om the Seattle/King County Department of Public Health. The Clinic's model evolved fr om a consumer survey indicating Clinic users were very receptive to CAAs. Many Clinic users are immigrants and are more accustomed to health care modalities that are still considered \"alternat ive\" in the United States. Clinic services include: family practice pr imary care, prenatal and obstetrical services, health education and prevention, referrals to specialists and hospitalization. In addition to naturopathic care, patients can receive acupuncture, massage therapy, chiropractic care, stress management and nutrition counseling. Users can select a natural medicine practitioner, typically a naturopath, or opt fo r a conventional practitioner. Unlike models in which a physician is the gatekeeper, at the Clinic users are screened by Triage Personnel, who may refer them to a CAA pr actitioner if they declare themselves interested in natural medicine. Appendix C The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures C-2 Celebration Health (Celebration, Florida) At Disney's new town of Celebration, Disney and Florida Hospital have joined to form Celebration Health. Dedicated to enhancing heal th in a holistic perspective which grows out of Disney's entertainment history and the Seventh Day Adventist traditions of Florida Hospital, Celebration Health will have a majo r offering of complementary and alternative approaches as part of their health care and we llness services. Their new health facility (more community center and fitness club than hos pital) will offer access to services at the site. In addition, their Ask A Nurse service will be geared to handle questions related to complementary and alternative approaches. (The Ask A Nurse service for Celebration Health and its par ent, Florida Hospital, has been in operation for some time. Of the calls dealing with medication which are referred to the pharmacy component of Ask A Nurse, 20% already deal with comp lementary and alternative approaches). Alternative Medicine Referral Service (Washington, DC) Alternative Medicine Referral Service (AMRS) is a network of licensed and credentialed holistic health professionals in the Washingt on, DC, Maryland and Virginia metropolitan area. Practitioners maintain independence and freedom to practice; clients pay a direct fee for services to practitioners, with a 20-25% discount. Begun in 1997, AMRS has 100 fully certified, licensed alternative and comple mentary health providers and is in the process of certifying 200 more. Consumers can pay a $49.00 yearly fee which enables them to receive a 20% discount on services from network providers. Some Washington area managed care organizations are consider ing offering this discount to their subscribers as a benefit (allowing their memb ers to pay, out-of-pocket, at the reduced rate and have certified practitioners ident ified by the AMRS). Other managed care organizations are more aggressively explorin g which conditions will merit coverage in their protocols. AMRS provides support to pr actitioners, which enable s them to generate outcomes data on their practice. AMRS also provides outcomes data base research, practitioner education and cross training and a credentialing committee to insure quality of providers, as well as public education se minars and services. AMHS is in the process of establishing a federation of similar net works of alternative and complementary providers in other cities. The Future of Chiropractic Appendix C Institute for Alternative Futures C-3 PROVIDER INTEGRATION: PHYSICIAN-DRIVEN MODEL OF CARE North Hawaii Community Hospital, Inc. Located at the base of Mauna Kea on the Bi g Island of Hawaii, the North Hawaii Community Hospital opened its doors in Ma y 1996. The 50-bed hospital is premised on the notion of \"total healing c oncepts\" and is designed to be a \"healing environment.\" It is part of a long-term plan to cr eate a healing community in t he North Kohala area of the Big Island, including networking with local pr oviders and fostering pat ient education at the resource center near the Hospital. The Hospital provides a broad range of c onventional services, such as a 24-hour emergency room, as well as five comple mentary healing techni ques: chiropractic, naturopathy (herbs, homeopathy), acupuncture (herbs, needling), massage and clinical psychology\u2014those modalities allowed under Hawaiia n state law. The practitioners of these five modalities are cons idered \"consulting staff\" and they have the same rights as MDs, with the exception of adm itting patients. To receive their services, a patient must be referred by an attending physician. In addition to providing the CAA modalitie s listed above, the Hospital has created a Department of Healing Services to in tegrate additional, lifestyle-based healing modalities such as yoga, meditation, touc h, music therapy and aromatherapy. The head of this department, an RN, wor ks with the Hospital's chaplaincy program and a social worker to provide these services. An MD re ferral isn't necessary and the services are provided free of charge. Institute for Health and Healing, California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco, CA Opened in Spring 1997, the Inst itute for Health and Healing provides complementary treatments to people with chronic illness w ho are familiar with CAAs but still want a conventional practitioner to be involved in their treatment. While an MD is the gatekeeper, this MD must be trained in one or two CAAs and also be able to appropriately refer a patient to the five C AA modalities that, eventually, will be included in the Center. The Center is patient-oriented in that it provides mu ltiple complementary therapies in one setting. The Center also se rves as a teaching facility for residents. Eventually the Center will be folded back into the Calif ornia Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) as an optional set of treatments. Appendix C The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures C-4 The Institute for Health and Healing is part of a larger effort by CPMC to infuse holistic definitions of health and health care into its surrounding communities. The Center's Institute for Health and H ealing provides a library (t he Planetree Health Library), education, research and clinical care prom oting disease prevention and wellness. The Institute's mission is to instill the Planet ree philosophy of patient-focused care throughout California Pacifi c Medical Center. INTEGRATED CONSUMER MODEL: SELF-CARE THROUGH HEALTH EDUCATION The Chopra Center for Well Being, LaJolla, California Founded by author and MD Deepak Chopra, the Chopra Center for Well Being in LaJolla, California, opened in Spring 1996. Its mission is to help people work toward a state in which \"...all bodily processes ar e in balance, the senses are enlivened and the mind and spirit are permeated with bliss.\" The Center combines Ayurveda, a 5,000- year-old healing tradition from India, with conventi onal medical oversight and monitoring. \"Health\" is broadly defined to in clude factors beyond the individual, such as environmental, spiritual, social and other factors. Users are educated in health- promoting behaviors, such as di et, meditation, yoga, etc. Users can choose from three levels of ac tivity: a seven-day retreat, workshops on mind/body health and targeted treatments such as facial massage, herbal wraps and deep-tissue massage. All participants in the seven-day retreat see a conventional physician with training in Ayurvedic healing, who acts as a gatekeeper referring the participant to other practitioners. The Center's philosophy emphasizes empower ing consumers through intensive health education. The Center works wit h external health care prov iders to help them integrate this approach into their own organizations. The Center is develop ing a certification program for health educators who want to take Center courses and activities into other provider settings. The Future of Chiropractic Appendix C Institute for Alternative Futures C-5 PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, CONSUMER EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROJECTS The Center for Mind-Body Medicine, Washington DC The Center for Mind-Body Medicine is a non-profit, educational organization dedicated to reviving the spirit and transforming the prac tice of medicine. The Center is at the forefront of a movement which seeks to br ing this empowering approach into the heart of American medical practice and to make it t he core of the education of all health care providers. The Center is particularly commi tted to the development of new models of care; to the education of m edical students and those who teach them; and to service to the poor, children, the elderly, the chr onically ill and the institutionalized. The Center hosts skills groups in which parti cipants learn and practice a variety of mind- body techniques to increase self-awar eness and enhance health and well-being. The Center also runs a year-long program that teaches health and mental health professionals to integrate t he mind-body approach into thei r lives and their practices, and a community education program in whic h center staff and volunteers help community organizations integrate the conc epts and practices of mind-body medicine into their work. The Center has also cont ributed to the developm ent of a comprehensive program of mind-body studies at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, and through consultations and workshops has hel ped develop programs at other medical schools including Columbia, Harvard, Johns Hopk ins and the University of California at San Francisco. The Center also sponsors and st affs a range of other projects, including an internship program for high school, co llege and graduate st udents; and educational programs for HIV-positive former pr isoners and intravenous drug users. INTEGRATED DISEASE-FOCUSED CONSUMER MODEL Commonweal Cancer Help Program, Bolinas, California Located in Bolinas, Californi a, the Commoweal Cancer Help Program provides an opportunity for people with cancer to sort out their choices in cancer treatments while simultaneously benefitting from health-p romoting treatments\u2014specifically, yoga, meditation, spirituality and st ress reduction. Participants in the week-long program are encouraged to address major issues in their liv es, including: their relationship with their Appendix C The Future of Chiropractic Institute for Alternative Futures C-6 oncologist, the prospect of death and dying, pai n control and choice in complementary therapies. The program's goal is to opt imize people's potentia l for healing. INTEGRATED PROVIDER MODEL: LOOSE ASSOCIATIONS Integrated Healing Arts (IHA), Los Angeles, CA Formed in the early 1990s, Int egrated Healing Arts is an a ssociation of health care practitioners dedicated to delivering both tr aditional medicine and healing alternatives based on the interconnection of body and mind. CAA practitioners in the association are loosely organized\u2014a team approach to ca re is not emphasized, although some practitioners do work together. Consumers ar e encouraged to play a proactive role in choosing their treatments and improv ing their overall well-being. IHA services include: chiropractic, holistic medical care, acupuncture and Chinese medicine, massage therapy, hypnosis, medi tation, biofeedback and health promoting classes. Health Medicine Forum (HMF), Walnut Creek, California A group of physicians and CAA pr oviders formed the Health Medicine Forum to facilitate the communication between health practitioner s of different paradigms. Started in Walnut Creek, California, by 12 people in August of 1996, the group had grown to 200 in three months and now has over 350 practitioners. Forum members are hosting a symposium on the integration of CAAs and allopathic care to maximize patient centered care with a health care rather than disease care paradigm. The HMF has just completed five television programs that are being shown on local cable stations in California on holistic approaches to health care. Aimed at consumers as well as practitioners, HMF would eventually like to develop a live call -in show where viewers can interact with panels of experts on a variety of health subjects. INSURANCE PLANS AND HMO'S COVERING CAAS The following examples\u2014as well as the Oxford Health Plan referred to in Chapter 2\u2014 illustrate the growing integrat ion of CAAs into conventional care. These examples will soon be joined by other large insurers such as United Health Care, which insures 5% of The Future of Chiropractic Appendix C Institute for Alternative Futures C-7 the US population and controls over 20% of the managed care marketplace. These companies will link up wit h providers and purchasers to offe r more integrated service to consumers. Blue Cross of Washington Since Washington State law requires health insu rance plans to provide access to every category of health care provider, plans such as Blue Cross of Washington have launched programs including CAAs. Working with Alternacare of Washington, a CAA credentialing organization, Blue Cross of Washington has created a network of 400 CAA providers. Blue Cross must offer a su pplemental insurance plan, AlternaPath Nontraditional Health Care Program, to all of its 170,000 subscribers. The plan covers CAAs, as defined by state law, at 50% of the costs up to $500 per year. Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound is another program born of Washington State's comprehensive coverage laws. Group Heal th offers CAA services and activities in some of its plans and has developed a net work of CAA providers that includes naturopaths, acupuncturists and massage ther apists. Though members must get a referral to see these practitioners, no re ferral is required to see an osteopath for manipulative care. Chiropractors must belong to the Group Health delivery network in order for their services to be covered. Gr oup Health has developed a list of clinical conditions that can be treated by covered CAA practitioners. For example, naturopaths can be consulted for premenstrual syndrom e, menopausal symptoms, chronic fatigue, chronic arthritis, chronic i rritable bowel syndrome and fibrom yalgia.
