From these and from our observations on ninety Schick-positive subjects, we have sought an easy regime for routine use. It is not yet clear as to whether Schick-positive, toxoid-sensitive individuals should be left uninoculated. A simple program of intracutaneous injections has rendered twenty-six out of twenty-seven such subjects Schick-negative, leaving only one to undergo a series of graded subcutaneous doses. The plan we have adopted for the whole group is as follows: Do a Schick-test on the group to be immunized. Do a Moloney-test on the Schick-positive individuals. Give the M neg. and M + reactors the routine 2 ml of undiluted toxoid in 1 ml subcutaneous doses with an interval of one month. Give the M ++ and M +++ reactors three 0.1 ml intracutaneous injections of toxoid used for the Moloney-test (i.e., a 1:100 dilution of toxoid) at weekly intervals. Perform Schick-tests three to six months after the last injection. If any M ++ or M +++ subjects remain Schick-positive, inoculate these with a series of graded subcutaneous injections. "}
