This is from a document entitled Report of the governors for the year ended 31st August 2010. It seems to be a statement of their vision: To enable children to have a full experience of childhood that can nourish and develop their innate gifts and potentials, so that they may become responsible, free individuals who think clearly, observe perceptively and act considerately and constructively for the good of the world. The ethos and educational activity in the Academy is informed by a developing body of work initiated by the scientist, philosopher and educator Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). Essentially, the education is based on an understanding that each child develops through a sequence of physical, emotional and cognitive stages through an integrated approach to teaching and learning which emphasises the dual aspects of care and learning. Hence the curriculum content & materials and teaching methods relate to the age and developmental needs of the pupils. The teacher is guided by observing and understanding the nature of the growing child and accordingly responds to each child's potential, emergent capacities and developing qualities with a belief that this education provides nourishment for the body, the soul and the spirit. I can't help but think they need to really explain a few words and concepts better, because this text paints an innocuous and deceptive picture. It's filled with half-truths. Sure, if you know the Steiner texts and previous anthroposophical publications, you know a little about what they're talking about. Lots of people don't, however, and may make the wrong decision based upon reading this text and similar (they are by no means unusual). The Academy's representatives need do be explicit about what they mean by 'full experience of childhood', child development and its stages (as envisioned by anthroposophy), 'innate gifts and potentials', 'free individuals', what's 'good' for the world, what 'relates to the age and developmental needs', the teacher's 'observing and understanding', what the 'nature' of the child is, 'child's potential, emergent capacities and developing qualities', and, last but not least, 'the body, the soul and the spirit'. The vision statement is totally inadequate \u2014 either you explain what you mean, or you can just as well leave it to everybody's imagination. This wouldn't be such a big thing, were it not for the fact that this text has to be interpreted in the light of anthroposophy, and everybody who supports the Steiner Academy ought to know exactly what this means. My hunch is that it isn't unusual that they don't. And the school, like most waldorf schools, is perfectly prepared not to be explicit about its foundation and its beliefs. Instead it serves us the usual fluff words that could be taken to mean just about anything \u2014 until you know the background of these words and concepts and can decipher them. Instead of talking broadly about child development and the nature of the child, they need to be explicit that their beliefs don't coincide with mainstream beliefs about development and nature. In this document, a new book is mentioned; it is about Steiner education and will be published in April by Routledge. See description [here](http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415603911/). Already in the title, we're faced with a somewhat insidious assumption: that Steiner schools are 'meeting the child'. It's written by people involved in Steiner education, so I guess what is to be expected from it. Another assumption is that other school types can learn from waldorf; interestingly, waldorf educators rarely seem to think they may learn anything from others or from mainstream education. It's usually more like this: they're here to save the world and rescue childhood from these dreadful materialistic practices. Other schools should reform and become more like waldorf, while they never need to do anything differently at all. It makes me wonder: what about all those children for whom waldorf is a really bad fit? Why don't waldorf ever talk about these children before failure is a fact? Then, and only then, does it suit waldorf to say: 'Oh, but waldorf is not for everyone...' What about the children waldorf schools can't meet but who are still stuck in these schools? Mary Jane Drummond and Sally Jenkinson are two of the authors who contribute. Here's an [earlier post](https://zooey.wordpress.com/2009/11/17/repost-launch-event-plymouth-uni/) on one of their projects. (Book cover image from Routledge.) To return to the Hereford report: The Academy works with the school doctor in order to gain advice and support for all the children who are moving from kindergarten into class 1. An (anthroposophical, I assume) doctor is called upon to give advice about children who are to begin first grade. Why? Do medical doctors possess special pedagogical knowledge about school readiness? Speaking of school doctors, parents who wish to enroll their children at the Hereford Academy have to sign an agreement. It's called a 'home-school agreement' and can be downloaded from the school website. Assuming that the school doctor is an anthroposophical doctor, this should scare the hell out of any parent, because he or she would have to agree to: Enabling my child to see the School Doctor at the Academy's request and taking my child to any therapy sessions or special needs assessment required by the Academy. I understand this is necessary to support my child accessing the education and the teachers' ability to meet his/her needs. Not only will an anthroposophical doctor assess the child's readiness to begin school (using anthroposophical knowledge to do so), he will also prescribe anthroposophical therapies. This means, e g, curative eurythmy and similar therapies with no real-world effects at all. Luckily, if the therapies are pure fantasy, so are most of the diagnoses made. (The school doctor in my school thought I would die soon. Presumably because my reincarnating spirit was gangrenous.) Another document (entitled Homeopathy Policy) from Hereford makes clear that homeopathy is used to 'treat' children. Also among the things parents are required to agree to is this: Protecting my/our child from unsuitable and unwarranted access to some of the concerns and worries of the adult world and from unmonitored exposure and un-mediated access to media such as television and DVD, computer games, internet chat-rooms and so on. Medical research shows that screen-based activity such as TV, videos, films and computer games can have a negative effect on children (brain activity, concentration, heart-beat, emotional balance and well-being). The younger the child, the greater the effect. For the well-being of your child and their ability to access the education and programme of teaching and learning, please allow no regular screen-based activity/watching for under 8s, no more than 3 hours a week for 9 to 14s and moderate and selective use for young people aged 15 and over. Please try to make sure TVs and computers are not kept in your child's room so that his/her bedroom is free to be a place of rest and comfort. (Further reading 'Remote Controlled' by Dr Aric Sigman & 'Toxic Childhood' by Sue Palmer, amongst others) I wonder if it is ok for a publicly funded school to interfere in this manner with a student's home life? And is it really morally acceptable for an educational institution to spread unfounded and misleading junk? Clearly, the intention is to scare parents who don't know better. Equally obvious is that what science says isn't what informs waldorf school policies. They only refer to science when they think it reinforces their beliefs. And they will never acknowledge science which contradicts their beliefs. Thus they back up their convictions with stuff like Toxic Childhood. Besides \u2014 why can't a TV in the bedroom offer comfort? (I don't think it would be a bad idea at all for children who, like I was, "}
