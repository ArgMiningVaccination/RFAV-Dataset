Ms. Toman stated that if they are happy with that, she's happy with that as long as it doesn't infringe on the other options we already have available. No further testimony IN FAVOR OPPOSED TO SB 2194 Written testimony OPPOSED to SB 2194 by George J. Hruza, MD, American Society for Dermatologic Surgery Association (attach #1) sent to Chairman Judy Lee through email. Cour tney Koebe le Executive Director of the North Dakota Medical Association and also Director of the North Dakota Psychiatric Association Society, spoke IN OPPISITON to SB 2194. We will be submitting testimony opposing. Introduced Dr. Steven Stripe, and provided Dr. Devlin written testimony. (27:45) Kwanza Devl in, MD, provided written testimony IN OPPOSITION to SB 2194 (attach 11) Senate Human Services Committee SB 2194 01/19/2015 Page 3 Dr. Stephen C. Stripe OPPOSI TION to SB 2194. Sena tor Howard Ander son, Jr. stated that he was old enough to remember osteopaths back in there earlier days. Some of the things you said were said about osteopaths in those days. Talk about the transition or comparison. Mr. Stri p indicated that osteopathic medicine has advanced since its inception. Osteopath ic was also manipulating bones but also some training with medicine. Over time, the manipulative training is optional. They get the same training as in medical school. If naturopaths want to do this, they should come to the scientific-based way of medicine. People will tell stories that work, those are anecdotes. It doesn't necessarily mean it's true. The placebo effect is when someone lays their hands on someone and thinks they cure someone. (37:00) Pau lette Def amin go testified IN OPPOSITION to SB 2194. Practiced as a traditional or direct entry midwife for 32 years. I'm not against naturopaths. I'm not even against them doing home births. This is not specified in bill if births are in home, cars, etc. The only problem is that home birthing parents in North Dakota want the right to choose what kind of home birth they have and who attends. They want to the right to choose and not be forced into choose someone not comfortable with. Paulette indicated this is the part that she is concerned with. If once there's a licensing for the naturopaths, then it's very easy to change and take out naturopath and all of a sudden regulate everybody who is doing home births. Chair man Judy Lee indicated that it couldn't happen without your group coming and packing the room. Chairman Judy Lee again voiced her strong opinion in favor of education and certification of midwives. In this particular case, it is talking about those who are licensed as naturopaths to do these services. No impact on midwife. Duane Hodack , Executive Board of Medical Examiners, testified IN OPPOSITION to SB 2194. The definition of minor office procedure may not be consistent with the medical definition of this, and could be contrary to surgical and invasive procedures. There is also a question of differing diagnosis to be able to recognize what you know, but what you don't know. Regarding the prescriptive authority, refer to Senat or Howar d Ander son, Jr. Having the group do write their own formularies and being in control of that when it is typically in statute is of concern. It was a big benefit in getting rid of controlled substances, because that's a real issue in North Dakota, and expanding this is an issue. Cha irman Judy Lee asked about definition of minor office procedure. Sena tor How ard Ander son, Jr. we've had medical association about minor medical procedures, could naturopaths come up with a more specific definition that they are more comfortable with , and then as an intermediary step as they move forward in their practice we might include that definition in here more specifica lly, and then at least that would overcome that roadblock. Sen ate Human Services Committee SB 2194 01/19/2015 Page4 Mr. Hodack indicated they could certainly do this. Chair man Judy Lee stated that the naturopaths might want to look at the statutory definition of minor office procedures and see if it suits them. Mr. Hodack indicated yes. No further testimony Opposing NEUTRAL TESTIMONY FOR SB 2194 (43:35) Kevin Oberlander , registered pharmacist, spoke neutral. (attach #16) At recent meeting, the board takes a neutral position. Sena tor Wa rner asked for clarification of off label use of drugs. What the positions of this, experimental use? Mr. Oberlander indicated that a physician with prescriptive privileges has the right to prescribe a drug for off-label use. Sena tor Howard And erson, Jr. provided further clarification, as long as the State of North Dakota says that these people can prescribe, then the FDA will allow them to prescribe off\u00ad label just like any other authorized prescriber. Recess 2015 SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Human Ser vices Commit tee Red River Room, State Capitol SB 2194 1/19/2015 22157 D Subcomm ittee D Explanation or reason for introd uction of bill /resolut ion : A bill relating to the regulation of naturopaths, and relating to the regulation of naturopaths. Min utes : Attach #1: Testimony by Dr. Shari Orser These minutes are from committee work on January 19, 2015. Sena tor Howard And erson, Jr. provided information. If the Naturopaths could get with the physicians and solve the problem with the definitions on minor office procedures, they may be in pretty good shape. With pharmacy, we have solved the issue of prescriptive authority. They can't dispense. The development of their formulary is pretty broad. They can do this by their board and rule, they can start out with formulary and then expand by rule and as others come on. That will work out alright. The exclusion of most controlled substances will mean that drug seekers won't be after them to prescribe narcotics all the time, and that will help them and the rest of us as well. They could move ahead with it. Cha irman Judy Lee asked they are part of the affiliated health board. There would be a couple of those people on that board that would be developing the rules. Under the heading of those who want to do this, are they developing the rules. Sen ator Howar d Ander son, Jr. indicated yes. Senator Dever stated he is trying to find in the bill where they talk about doing sutures. Maybe that is what is referred to as methods for repair. School nurse could do these minor things. Chair man Judy Lee any requirements for training and education is an improvement. Senator Wa rner asked for information on scheduled drugs. Senator Howar d And erson, Jr. stated scheduled drugs, they included schedule 1, which means if North Dakota authorizes medical marijuana, they won't be able to prescribe it because that is a schedule 1. Schedule 2 are the hard narcotics and amphetamines and Senate Human Services Committee SB 2194 01/19/2015 Page 2 so forth used for pain, for ADHD treatment, most potential for abuse and addiction. Schedule 3 are narcotics in combination with other things, like Tylenol with codeine. They reduce the risk of abuse because the Tylenol is stronger than the codeine. Schedule 4 drugs are lower level of abuse, like tranquilizers, valium, sleep meds. Schedule 5 is less than an 1/8 of codeine in a cough syrup. So the biggest number 5 is the lowest level of abuse. Schedue 1 does not have medical use in the United States. Sena tor Wa rner asked about injectable anesthetics. Sen ator Howard And erson, Jr. anesthetics typically are not scheduled. Now if you were going to use pre-anesthesia with fentanyl, that's a scheduled drug. Senator Howard Anderson, Jr. provided cla rification on the different drugs. Chair man Judy Lee asked if the naturopaths should dispense, prescribe? Sen ator Howar d Ander son, Jr. said no, they cannot. Chairman Judy Lee indicated that question is minor office procedure. Senator Wa rner asked if biologics are included as drugs or a separate thing. Senator Howard Anderson, Jr. indicated most are not scheduled. Injectable for immunizations are biologics. Cha irman Judy Lee asked if there is anything for our intern, Femi, to do? Sen ator Howard Ander son, Jr. said let them come back to us. V. Chairman Oley Larsen asked about the childbirth, midwife people here against the bill? Chair man Judy Lee indicated no. The concern was raised from Paulette that as long as it doesn't regulate them, they are fine. (12:08) Cour tney ). Testimony end (15:02) Cha irman Judy Lee talked about choices. Chairman Judy Lee didn't disagree with a thing Dr Orser said. If we have some people who have some training in delivering babies versus only people who have no training in delivering babies, that's maybe slig htly better. If we tell them they can't do it, they don't go to physicians. Dr. Orser doesn't know what to do about this either. We would like to see only trained people delivering babies, in hospitals or birthing centers, where immediate medical care is available. I wish there was a way to impress upon people the risks of at home births. Senate Human Services Committee SB 2194 01/19/2015 Page 3 Chairman Judy Lee discussed the triplets born, and such a challenge because if everything goes fine, that's fine, unless things don't go fine. The liability issue, not even good data, about situations that something happens at the hospital may have been from Mom and baby who were never seeing a physician and then ends i.Jp at the hospital. Sena tor Howard Ander son, Jr. asked do you know enough about the American Midwifery Certification Board to know if the training of the naturopath could be extended to make them eligible for certification. Dr. Orser responded not sure if just open to certified midwifes or others. Chairman Judy Lee asked if Dr. Kalanek could come over from Board of Nursing, perhaps they could have a parallel training. Sen ator Dever asked if certified midwives deliver babies outside the hospital. Dr. Orser answered not that she is aware of. The ones practicing in North Dakota are all affiliated with a hospital or obstetrician as their affiliated physician. Cha irm an Judy Lee indicated that 2 certified in Minnesota practicing in the valley, but one retired. People in North Dakota could make use of those services because we didn't say they couldn't. We were sort of regretting that because the few who were available in North Dakota, we lost the services of someone who was trained and certified in Minnesota. CLOSED HEARING Chairman Judy Lee assigned Femi to contact and seek information from Dr. Constance Kalanek, executive board of nursing, answer questions about the American midwifery certification board. 2015 SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Donald Mueller Human Ser vices Commit tee Red River Room, State Capitol SB 2194 1 /20/2015 22234 D Subcommittee D Conference Committee Explanation or reason for introduc tion of bill/reso lution: A bill relating to the regulation of naturopaths, and relating to the regulation of naturopaths. Min utes : Tim Davenport These are minutes from committee work on January 20, 2015. Email to Chair man Jud y Lee from Tim Davenport, National Registry of Naturopathic Practitioners, asking for a NO vote on SB 2194 (attach #1). V. Chair man Oley Larsen indicated that he had talk ed to someone and the reason for opposition is the larger group of people that are certified are not through an accredited entity. So the small group who has gone to Seattle to get accredited program is very small. There is no registry of the folks in that group, they don't belong to anybody. The person who talked to him who went to Seattle got the 4 year degree and further accreditation and certification, so that is why that group is opposed to it. If this bill goes through, they can't be called a doctor, can be a naturopath but not a naturopathic doctor. Senator Dever indicated that many were opposed to calling them doctors. Senator Dever went to the website of registry, referencing back to attachment #1, and downloaded their four-page application. The primary point is paying them $250.00. Senator Dever read the code of ethics for registered naturopathic diplomats from their website. This group doesn't have the training but want to be on a level par with them. Sen ator Howard And erson, Jr. has the question here that Connie Kolanek needs to answer from the testimony of Dr. Shari Orser. She states, those who claim midwifery training are not certified by the National Midwifery Certification board. Are you familiar with that board and wh at their requirements would be so the naturopathic doctors get accreditation with that board with very little addition to their training. Connie Kolanek looked at lay-midwifery a few years ago, we looked at the North American Registry of Midwives. The naturopathic physician would take the additional 3 years of Senate Human Services Committee SB 2194 01/20/2015 Page 2 training would fall within that particular registry of midwives. They are called professional midwives. There are a number of professions that fall under this, North Dakota doesn't recognize them. Cha irman Judy Lee indicated there are nurse midwives. The recognition by board of nursing for one of those American Midwife Recertifi cation Board, do you have to be a nurse to get that certification first. Ms. Kolanek indicated they wou ld be eligible with the North American Registry of Midwives. Cha irman Judy Lee what is your personal opinion regarding the training or observations and categories of training, licensure, that applies to here? We can't stop them from doing this. Ms. Kolanek In terms of what the board supports, its certification and education in the are of practice. There's mov ement in other states with midwifery path, doesn't know if good or bad. Senator Dever 2 issues -training, and birthing a baby outside a hospital. We have copy of curriculum and it is pretty extensive. But the greater concern is the availability of emergenc y services. Ms. Kolanek indicated that is one of the additional training concepts that they have in their training curriculum is the out-of-hospital setting. V. Chair man Oley Larsen stated that in this discussion with this individual he was asking about doing small medical procedures, she will be able to go to a home and deliver a baby, if hemorrhage, she can suture up. Will this legislation allow this if it goes forward. Ms. Kolanek stated number 3 on page 4, it needs to be tightened up considerably. It seems pretty broad and approved by the board. Maybe there needs to be some more work in that area so it is more specific, by the board of neuropathic child birth. Chair man Judy Lee stated that maybe we need more detail. They are under this new affiliated health board because there are so few of them that they can't afford their own board. It's a great idea to having this umbr ella board except there aren't enough of any profession on that list that are capable of developing rules. Senator Howard Ander son, Jr. when you read the whole thing, it does talk about 3 additional year program for certification, including national certification in midwifery endorsed by the board such as the North American Registry of Midwives. This would be consider ably additional training to do this. Board won't approve it unless additional training. Ms. Kolanek responded that, for example, letter \"A\", successfully complete a 3 year clinical certificated midwifery curriculum, she would add \"accredited by\" the organization rather than approved by the board. Should it not be accredited by the board, standardization of curriculum. Senate Human Services Committee SB 2194 01/20/2015 Page 3 Sen ator Howard Ander son, Jr. any idea who that accredited agency might be. Ms. Kolanek indicated the first thing is they have to be approved by the Department of Education to provide this education. She indicated she would have to do further research to provide recommenda tion. Chair man Jud y Lee stated that isn't your job that isn't yours. Sen ator Wa rner stated, in section 3, a naturopath may not practice childbirth attendance unless certified. That's a limitation. If no authority, then they could attend like a regular midwife. Senator Warner is struggling with definition practicing medicine without a license. Are you charging for your fees or services? You can have anybody do anything. But if charging a fee, then practicing medicine. Cha irman Judy Lee indicted letter from ASDSA is strongly opposed to this because the minor office procedures is too lose, and we need to look at that also. V. Chair man Oley Larsen stated that his knowledge to get accredited, superintendents were going on internet and then they were qualified. They did make a rule that it had to be accredited school, a list that everyone falls under. Ms. Kolanek indicated yes. V. Cha irman Oley Larsen followed up stating all these online classes that you buy a degree from, they are not from the accredited facilities. Sen ator Howard Ander son, Jr. indicated that many of them are accredited schools. We don't accept them because they are not accredited by the agency of the American Society of Health Systems Pharmacists that is specifically accredited technician programs, as an example in his field. Their college is accredited but their course is not. Ms. Kolanek stated that is how they get around this. In looking at #3, it should be accredited. Sen ator Howard And erson, Jr. asked them to come in to suggest who the accrediting agency might be, and that we won't approve this unless they tell us who that is. Cha irman Judy Lee indicated this is good idea. The frustration is that we can say naturopaths can't do this, and yet someone else can do this. Sen ator Dever asked what prevents them from doing home births Chair man Judy Lee indicated nothing. Sena tor Wa rner asked about the disciplinary powers is you can take the license away, so that's why they don't renew license. This board could take away the license if they didn't do the course of study. If we take it out of the bill, then we unleash the beast. Senate Human Services Committee SB 2194 01/20/2015 Page 4 Senator Howard Ander son, Jr. stated there is a different on someone who does something on their own, but naturopath, we are giving consumer some confidence. Mr. Kolanek indicated heard from a lot of those people previous sessions. End of Dr. Kolanek. (19:27) Cha irman Jud y some help. Cour tenay Koebele indicated minor office provision is very vague. Ms. Koebele didn't know if there is a separate definition for minor office procedures. There are a lot of ways that could be interpreted. Senator Howard And erson, Jr. what we asked them to do is to get together with you and nursing board and identify those things that they could do, a way to start. Make the list specific enough. Chair man Judy Lee is it fair that the organizations have to come up with a list when they oppose this. Ms. Koebele agreed, likes the practice act as it is. Problems with physician rights, midwivery, and there will be other bills where others want to be licensed within their training. But feel the practice act is correct as it sits. Chair man Judy Lee stated that it's interesting that somebody would spend that many years in school when they don't see it as a valid health care career. Ms. Koebele agreed. They are very nice people, probably do good work. There is a distinct education. What medical students and residents get is different, all engrained. Naturopaths are trained in the natural way. Not trained to use the prescription meds, hopping on at the tail end. Chair man Judy Lee indicated that Senator Howard Anderson, Jr. didn't have a bad idea, but it would be hard for Ms. Koebele and others to work with. Cha irman Judy Lee asked if naturopaths could provide more information on minor office procedures and then ask Ms. Koebele and nurse association to see if they have problems. Suggest that they tighten up the language on office procedure, and accredited program in midwifery. Sen ator Dever indicated that maybe over the years we've had similar conversa tions with other professions, like chiropractors. It's not the intention of the naturopa ths to encroach on scope of practice as doctor; they see it as an alternative. Seems what they want to do is what a doctor might not do himself but ask his nurse to do. Cha irman Judy Lee asked if he would be okay with this requesting that they tighten up that definition. Senator Dever indicated he would have no problem with that at all. Sen ate Human Services Committee SB 2194 01/20/2015 Page 5 Sena tor Wa rner was interested in tightening up is whether the skin is broken. Injection, skin tag, is a different level then doing something more complicated. Levels of severity or risk. Chairman Judy Lee indicated in their definition, it says repair and care incidental to superficial lacerations and abrasions, superficial lesions and the removal of foreign bodies located in superficial tissues. Sen ator Warner indicated he could see a nurse doing certain things, but not doing stitches. But not necessarily the same as naturopaths. V. Chairm an Oley Larsen stated his concern with the conversation he had upstairs, it's just skin tag, but they have no idea that it could be cancer. The position of these folks is great to keep center of balance. But you need to go to a doctor to have some of this done. Wart removal ended up being a big deal for his son. Chairman Judy Lee noted the assignment to naturopaths for definition of minor office procedure; review accredited program; prescribing prescriptions; Sena tor Howard Ander son, Jr. indicated that pharmacists are comfortable with prescribing. We only have a half dozen of these doctors of naturopathic, and we can handle that. 2015 SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Human Ser vices Commit tee Red River Room, State Capitol SB 2194 2/9/2015 23485 D Subcomm ittee D Conference Committee Committee Clerk Signature dJ.onatd - Explanation or reason for introduction of bill/ resolu tion: A bill relating to the regulation of naturopaths, and relating to the regulation of naturopaths. Min utes : Attach #1 : Electronic Correspondence with Elizabeth Allmendinger with proposed amendment Attach #2: Proposed Amendment from Elizabeth Allmendinqer Chair man Judy Lee distributed copies of electronic correspondenc e from January 21, 2015 with Ms. Elizabeth Allmend inger (attach #1 ), which includes discussion and a proposed amendment. Cha irm an Judy Lee distributed the final amendment dated Februar y 8, 2015 from Ms. Eliz abeth Allmendinger that has been agreed by both sides of the discussion (attach #2). Chairman Judy Lee read through the proposed amendment. (3:52) Sena tor Wa rner moved to ADOPT AMENDMENT as represented in Attachment #2. The motion was seconded by Sena tor How ard Ander son, Jr. No Discussion. Roll Call Vote to Amend \u00a7.Yes, Q No, Q Absent. Motion passed. Sen ator Wa rner moved a DO PASS AS AMENDED to SB 2194. The motion was seconded by Sen ator Howard Ander son, Jr. Discussion V. Chair man Oley Larsen wanted clarification. These folks who can do all this, do they have to have the four year accredited degree, or do they fall under the majority of the group of people in North Dakota who don't have that. There was only a small group who had received the accreditation in his recollection. Chair man Jud y Lee read from the bill, to have graduated from an approved naturopathic medical college, meaning a college and program granting the degree of doctor of Senate Human Services Committee SB 2194 02/09/2015 Page 2 naturopathy or naturopathic medicine which must require as a minimum a four-year, fulltime resident program of academic and clin ical study. Sen ator Howard Ander son, Jr. to deliver babies they have to have an additional certification. Not the same as Advanced Practice nurses, but did need additional certification. Chairm an Judy Lee page 3, line 21 and line 22. Right before that, they talk about the drugs. Sena tor Howard Ander son, Jr. pharmacy communic ated with the Naturopaths before the final draft of the bill, so it is generally agreed with pharmacy profession. Senator Dever regarding prescriptions, categories 1 to 4, he received an email that they would like categories 1 to 5. Sen ator Howard And erson, Jr. the difference there is 1 to 4 are drugs which are four classes of drugs that are most addictive. Schedule 5 you can do over the counter in many states. North Dakota does require a prescription for Schedule 5. There is no down side to include this - cough syrup with codeine. Page 3, line 19. Chairm an Judy Lee reviewed with Senator Dever, that this was agreed upon language between the two groups. Sena tor Dever early in process we received email from national organizations. One was a registry and he sent an email asking for a list of people from North Dakota who are on their registry. They responded and said none. Senator Dever suspects they want this bill to stop as they probably don't qualify. Chairm an Judy Lee that was why the group came here in the first place -in order to make sure that those who were well educated in that field actually protected the public who were well trained. She sees this as quality control, not fence building. Senator Dever vote in support of amendment (prior vote). Roll Call Vote to DO PASS as Amended \u00a7Yes, 1 No, Q Absent. Motion Passes.

Chairman Judy Lee asked the Senate Human Services Committee if they wanted to reconsider the prior motions (amendment and Do Pass as amende d). V. Chairman Oley Larsen indicated it can be resolved with legislative council or when the bill is reviewed at the House.

Min utes: II No attachments These are minutes from the Senate Human Services Committee second meeting on February 11, 2015. Senator Dever stated the proponents of SB 2194 understands the committee had previously passed the bill with a 5-1 vote. Senator Dever suggested that they be made aware of the latest decision of a 3-3 vote after fixing the amendment. Chair man Judy Lee asked if the committee is agreeable to everyone that we invite them back for further discussion. The committee confirmed yes. Sena tor Dever discussed that naturopathic medicine is not necessarily something new. It has been around since the beginning of time. Chair man Judy Lee instructed the intern, Femi, to contact Ms. Allmendinger the amendm ent change was approved and notify her of the change in vote, and to invite her back if she wishes . Sena tor Howard Ander son, Jr. stated that unfortunately the doctors of naturopathy who are licensed in North Dakota get painted with the brush of the naturopath , which is the group we heard from that want nothing to do with this bill. It is difficult to separate them, but the training and licensure is different. They have only been authorized in North Dakota since 2011. Perhaps the committee needs to consider sending it to the floor \"without committee recommendation\", but no motion yet until we have met with them again.

She prefers not to do without committee recommenda tion. 2015 SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE MINUTES Human Ser vices Commi ttee Red River Room, State Capitol SB 2194 2/11/2015 23669 D Subcommittee D Conference Committee Committee Clerk Signature Explanation or reason for introduction of bill/re solut ion: A bill relating to the regulation of naturopaths, and relating to the regulation of naturopaths. Min utes: \"Click to enter attachment information.\" Lee invited Ms. Eliz abeth Allmend inger to the podium. Chairman Judy Lee wanted to inform Ms. Allmend inger the latest vote 3-3. Senator Howard Ander son, Jr. stated there continues to be concern and confusion in the doctor of naturopathy and the naturopaths, and asked Ms. Allmendinger to remind the committee of the differences. Ms. Allmend inger re-explained that naturopaths do not require formal schooling. They can get a degree online, from unaccredited schools, and have no supervised clinical hours of training. A doctor of naturopathic medicine requires education from an accredited school, usually in a science, a four year graduate program with the first two years similar to a medical school. The second year they go into clinics, observing higher classmen treating patients and working with their supervisors. Their third year, they do the \"ologies\" and work in clinics seeing patients under supervision. There are residencies available, but they are not required as there are not enough of them for each graduating student. These are not federally funded, so it is usually the schools and private practitioners volunteering their time and money to support the residencies. They often get compared to Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants. They are probably closer to a medical doctor in education, but follow the nurse practitioner and physician assistants path. Sena tor Dever asked do you know how many states regulate and license. Ms. Allmendinger 17 states that are licensed. Some states have been lic ensed for many years. Senator Dever asked if a naturopath who is not licensed , can they do business in those states. Senate Human Services Committee SB 2194 02/11/2015 Page 2 Ms. Allme ndinger answered yes, unless law against it. They cannot practice in North Dakota. Ms. Allmendinger discussed the situation that V. Chairm an Oley Larsen had previously discussed with whopping cough regarding seeing a naturopath. There was also discussion regarding prior discussi ons with midwifery.

Sen. Jess ica Unr uh: Dis trict 33: Introduced and supported the bill which relates to the regulation of naturopath s. I do want to express my unwavering support for the bill. The bill would allow doctors of naturopathic medicine which is a different than naturopaths and it is a very important distinction, it allows them who are already authorized to practice in this state to expand their scope of practice to include some minor office procedures, some prescription right and also provides a certification for midwifery practices here in North Dakota Midwifery practices are already occurring here but there isn't a certification avenue for them. This would allow for regulation of midwifes in North Dakota. Doctors of naturopath ic medicine are highly trained, educated and qualified individuals and they want to provide the best possible service to their patients under the training they have received and this bill allows them to do that. It also provides cost savings to patients by reducing office visits and to receive comprehensive treatment that they are seeking. With the current physician shortage that we are experiencing in our state it only makes sense to provide more options for health care and to reduce co-pay obligations. Adjacent states allow these practitioners to more fully utilize their education and a similar form is being proposed to you here today and I would encourage have our state handle these issues the exact same way. I think it is important to encourage these individuals who have left the state to receive this type of training to encourage them to move back here to start their practices and encourage North Dakotans to move back to North Dakota and this bill allows them to do that while better serving their patients and more fully utilizing the education they have received. Dr. Elizabeth Allmend ing er: A doctor of natu ropath ic med icine: testified in support of .--- the bill. (See Testimony #1 ). 14:42 House Human Ser vices Committ ee SB 2194 March 25, 2015 Page 2 Rep. Por ter: Go into more of the pharmaceutical component of the initial training of Doctor of Naturopathic medicine with the monitoring of the physiology components as they relate back to the organ systems and the medications you are looking at and how your training adhere to monitoring those? For instance if Lipitor was one of the drugs, I have to go in every year at a minimum and have my liver enzymes checked to make sure it is at the right level. Dr. Allmendi nger : Dr. Nishek will go a little bit more detail on some of this, but our general curriculum, the first two years are broken down into the basic science classes. They are similar to UND's Allopathic school. We learn all of the basic sciences, then we have additional just pharmaceutical classes. In those classes we learn about the drug classes, the mechanism, action and different things like that. Then in the different -ologies, such as cardiology and pulmonology, that is where we learn to manage the specific drugs for specific conditions and overall health. There \u00b7is the combination of learning the basic sciences so we can appropriately diagnose and appropriately treat and then we have the - ologies where we can appropriately manage. Rep. Por ter: Inside of this, if your are comparing apples to apples, would you say this curriculum is the same or more than a that a Family Nurse Practitioner who has prescriptive rights through all 5 or 6 spectrums of the formulary or is it less or more equal to Family Practice Physician and what you would take as you are going to medical school? Dr. Allmendin ger : Essentially our curriculum has 500 mor e hours of clinical experience than Family Nurse Practitioners who have full prescriptive rights and almost twice as many pharmaceutica l classes plus the -ologies. We are more on par with Dentists and Optometrists in our training, who also have prescriptive rights in this state. Rep. Over sen: To the midwifery component it is an additional 3 year, is that 3 years on top of your 8 years or is that 3 years a masters level without the additional 4 year doctoral training? Dr. Allmendin ger: It is an additional 3 year training on top of the 4 year undergrad naturopathic medicine program. Rep. Por ter: You couldn't just have a Masters level midwifery component and hold yourself out as that, you would have to have the full Doctor of Naturopathic medicine on top of that to do the midwifery? Dr. Allmendin ger : Midwives in general, North Dakota has no certification so anyone can do it. There are midwives that only have the 3 year certification. This bill specifically says you have to have the naturopathic degree, which is the 8 years of training and the 3 year midwifery certification for this bill.

Dr. Orser: There was an article published in the last year in the American Journal of Obstetricians and Gynecologi sts but I can't give you the exact citation but I can get that for you. 1:03 Duane Houdek: Executive Secr etary of the ND Stat e Boar d of Medical Exami ner s: testified in opposition of the bill. (See Testimony #11 ). 1:05: Rep. Porter: In the letter that you are referenc ing there are statements in here, conjecture of the mistreatments and the non-normal types of therapies given by a doctor of naturopathic medicine. Since 2011 when they were licensed in ND have you had any complaints come back through your agency that have been then rereferred back to their board for disciplinary action or for being outside the norms such as injecting hydrogen peroxide through an IV? Houdek: I wasn't prepared for that question. I am not endorsing everything that is in that letter. It did raise concerns for us but it doesn't mean I vouch for everything that is stated in the letter. I am not recalling any complai nts at this time. 1:07 Or. Jeff Hostette r: An MO , MS: testified in opposition of the bill. (See Testimony #12). 1:12 Rep. Porter: A few years ago the Family Nurse Practitioners asked us to remove the collaborative agreement to allow full prescriptive rights in the whole spectrum except Class 1 pharmaceuticals and to your knowledge have there been any increased problems inside of that expansion that relate into your medication error rates you give us in Dr. Host ette r: I can't give you hard data about that because by nature of reporting medication errors in this cou ntry, blame is not laid. There is not data collected about the source of medication errors that occur. I can tell you from personal experience I have dealt with more side effects and more people admitted to the hospital that come to my clinic that has occurred. As a note to that it is interesting that I haven't a decrease in the number of '----- . House Human Ser vices Committee SB 2194 March 25, 2015 Page 5 - Nurse Practitioner s who ask for my advice about things and in fact I probably have more about that. By giving them that right removed some barriers possibly in my experience to talk to me about things. In interest of full disclosure, I was on the record of opposing those independent prescribing rights for the same reaso ns. Rep. Por ter: Going off that basic premise, inside of this prescriptive authority which is just this real limited class of pharmaceuticals that would be available to the doctors of Naturopathic medicine, would it limit some of your concerns by going to a collaborate type agreement arrangements that were present for a number of years until the Nurse Practitioner s proved themselves from the safety point of their practices? Dr. Hostette r: I would disagree with the limited assessment of the pharmaceuticals that they are asking for. They are just limited to scheduled drugs which have some of the least side effects. The side effects that hurt most people are actually routine drugs that are non\u00ad scheduled. Additionally many of those drugs are administered in the hospital which most naturopaths would not be prescribing so that would be attenuated by that to some extent. The strength of the collaborative agreement which I think is one of the reasons that Nurse Practitioners did get prescribing authority, quite honestly physicians have signed the paper but didn't actually do the collabor ative agreement. Unless there was a better system than existed for Nurse Practitioners that was built on mutual respect between the naturopath provider and their expertise and the Allopathic provider and their expertise and adds significant true collaboration because we both have something to learn from each other, I wouldn't go to just having a check box. 1:17 Keith Heuser: Pres ident of CHI Mer cy Hea lth in Valley City: I am here representing hospitals in the state and I am providing testimony on behalf of myself. In opposition to SB 2194. This area is close to areas I have had experience with. I am primarily in opposition to the pharmacy expansion . Naturopathic diagnoses focus on the underlying cause of the disease while naturopathic therapies are supported by research drawn from pier reviews journals from any disciplines including naturopathic medicine, European complimentary medicine, clinical nutrition, phytotherapy, pharmacognosy, homeopathy, psychology and spirituality. The two keys words I am focused on are phytotherapy and Pharmacognosy and both of those are the underlying courses on the study for naturopathic medicine, there is very little done with synthetic medications. Phytotherapy is the study of using extracts of natural origins as medicines of health promoting agents. Standard pharmacology isolates an active compound from a given plant and phytotherapy aims to presume the complexity of substances from a given plant with relatively less processing. Pharmacognosy is the study of the physical, chemical, biochemical and biological property of drugs and drug substances. It is important to understand when we talk about expanding the prescriptive authority of naturopathic medicines the vast majority if not all of their teaching is on the natural plant oriented side of medicines. The other concern is the third law of homeopathic medicine is that one should take the smallest dose to nudge ones vital force to start the healing processes. All these lead me to my concerns. Pharmacognosy ver sus evidence based practices from a hospital setting are entirely different. Evidence based practices are not based on natural medications or therapies, they include all therapies. When we look at how effectively are our physicians are dosing on the hospital side we look at the House Human Services Committee SB 219 4 March 25, 2015 Page 6 standardized practices that have shown proper dosing and proper success. They don't start with the minimum do se, they star t with the appropriate dose. When you look at the herbal complimentary medicines they have a very strong role and have their place in their work with medicines. My concern is the most of time for naturopathic doctors is spent on the herbal side and expanded into the synthetic side there isn't going to be a consist way to tell what the interactions will be and what the negative outcomes would be. One of the biggest components of errors in the hospitals is medication errors. We track and monitor them. We look at drug interactions also. I am very concerned with expanding that authority to people who don't have the oversight that the physicians and advanced practice providers who practice in the hospital setting do. In today's pharmaceutical market we are rapidly expanding on the synthetic side with the naturopa thic doctors not having that synthetic training I have significant concerns about them keeping up with what is happening and what they are prescribing and how it would interact with other drugs. 1:27 Megan Houn: Director of Gov ernment Relations for Blue Cross Blu e Shi eld of ND: testified in opposition of SB 2194. (See Testimony #13). I came upon an analysis from our legal wizard, I know that the naturopaths are not outwardly seeking reimbursement but under Section 43-58-032 of Century Code health insurance companies are required to reimburse naturopaths for services covered under a member's health plan. So I don't know if there is some clean up language there that can be done. It says that essentially it prescribes that a naturopath may designa te herself as of naturopathic medicine once properly licensed and upon fulfilling the requirements set forth under Chapter 43-58 and it is critical because Section 26.1-36-12.1 prohibits the health insurance company from denying from consulting or employing including doctors of chiropractic license to practice in North Dakota and requires health insurance company to recognize and reimburse certified by the doctor, hospital, sanitarium non withstanding any provision contained in the contract. Those would be our primary concerns. Cha irman We isz: What was the number in code? Houn: Section 43-58-03 , I can send you the citation. Chairman We isz: seeing? I am not seeing what you are saying would you restate what you are Houn: The section apparently prescribes that once there is a doctor, whether it is a doctor of naturopathic medicine or otherwise, once that happens and they are properly licensed and upon fulfilling the requirements set forth in 43-58. We are then required under Section 26.1-36-12.1 to as a health insurer reimburse for it. Chairman We isz: So you have been reimbursing then? This was passed in 2012 so you should have been reimbursin g for this. Houn : We have not been currently reimbursing. .-...... .-i House Human Services Committee SB 219 4 March 25, 2015 Page 7 Chair man Weisz: According to 43-58-03 effective January 1, 2012 based on his interpretat ion you should have been reimbursing for the last three years. You might want to send me that. Hou n: I will check and I will do that. 1:31 Dr. Joan Conn ell: A physician: testified in opposition of SB 2194. (See Testimony #14). 1:36 Rep. Fehr: You said you had a working relationship that reached out and made referrals, could you tell a little more on those, what kind of cases and feedback you received? Dr. Conn ell: I have some patients that sometimes have stomach issues and in pediatrics when it comes down to functional abdominal pain, I have sent some referrals for kids who just don't feel good. We have already tried many things to rule out the Western answer for this, then I will talk to the naturopath about this. Sometimes we do see a difference in this and I have seen a difference in patients with rhinitis. When the patient isn't responsive to typical medications and when that occurs I have turned to the naturopaths and they have had some variable success. Again very separate things. I also had a patient reflux at 6 months where the mother had taken the baby to a naturopath who suggested goats milk but again returned to me where I had her return to formula. A week later there was a story about a child who was 6-7 months who had died from goat's milk because it was not nutritionally sufficient for children. We each have our roles and it is important that we respect them. 1:39 Rep. Rich Beck er: We have to find to spread services in the nation we are adding population. How are going to provide services to the expanding population if we don't allow other people like the naturopaths to provide services? Dr. Connel l: It is a huge problem and I am concerned with that as well. I think that just because of this we can't pass laws. Maybe expanding medical schools and insi sting on a basic competency level. This year I have had a couple medical students who I don't think are going to be great physicians and we are going to have to make hard decisions about that. But I am not going to let them out to potentially injure patients . Do no harm. Rep. Rich Becker: I am still concerned, brick and mortar we won't put more medical schools up fast enough for what needs to be accomplish ed. We can't even import enough foreign doctors to meet the current need. All I am suggesting is certain restrictions and reservations and of course no medical personnel want to do harm to a patient, but I am concerned we are providing artificial barriers of increasing services to those that need it. I don't hear anyone sa ying we have a problem this big and we can only provide this much House Human Services Committ ee SB 219 4 March 25, 2015 Page 8 service. So we have to find ways to improve it and I hope this bill will help us address how we can do that. Dr. Connel l: I think we have to do that in a way that will not increase health care needs which translates into health care costs. When we have babies born at home and have lack of oxygen injuries, that dramatically increases health care costs for the rest of those kids lives. When we have medication given inappropriately it costs time and money, what the adverse drug reaction is and fix it and hope the patient returns to baseline. Example of a medication error in her practice. (1 :46:39). It takes many years of sacrifice and training to have competence and patients deserve competence. It is not fair to say here is a doctor and we know he probably is not good at every thing but here is a doctor because you need something. The patients can't discern that. The less you know the harder it is to understand what the limits of your knowledge are. I understand that very well working with med students, residents and some of my peers. Rep. Rich Becke r: I would agree with you, there is a line but I also believe from what I am hearing in testimonies today that those people in the audienc e that are not medical doctors also know that line. I have to believe that by and large there are not people overstepping their line. Nobody wants to cause harm. We have to find a way to encourage and to allow and to authorize more people to meet the needs of more people. Rep. Kiefert: My question regarding the training, maybe I misunderstood this but I though we heard testimony that they receive more training than and eye doctor or dentist or the Registered Nurses are receiving and another question I have is regarding the death from the wrong prescriptions, they are not prescribing medications now so how can we use that argument to numbers of people are dying from the wrong medicine, how can we point the finger at them? Dr. Connel l: It is my understanding that the person that is representing the hospital association was saying we already have this problem, deaths from inappropriate medications and increasing the pool of prescription writers, filling it with people that have less training than physicians do statistica lly will increase that statistic upward significantly. Regarding the training, the dentists and eye doctors work right here and this is talking about working everywhere, if you review this bill and look at the list of procedures, it is interesting because I would really like to bring ultrasound to our medical school at UNO and that has to be one of the top priorities but that will be a several year process, when I looked at myself taking training for me to be competent in ultrasound it would be every few weeks for a couple of years. When you ask how do we establish competence, I think there are a few ways to do that. You can say physicians have this many hours of pharmacology so you take the same. You can assess it by a written and oral exam. The evaluation subcommittee where I serve, we have developed minimum competencies for writing a pediatric history and physical, writing a prescription, coming up with a potential set of diagnoses for a condition. We have that available and potentially the naturopathic curriculum could look at those things and spend a little more time in there program and document competencies like that. They were talking about the competency testing and it is important for everybody to establish competency and in recertifying as a pediatrician I have had to have minimum amount of Continuing Medical Education credit, I have to do a quality House Human Services Committee SB 219 4 March 25, 2015 Page 9 -... assurance project and I need to take a written test and I need to do that every 7 years. Those are my ideas and I don't see any of those in place. Rep. Kiefert: Were'nt Registered Nurses compared to the natuopathic training and they receive more training than and RN who has prescription privileges? Dr. Connel l: An RN has a 4 year degree and if they are advanced practice status, such as a nurse practitioner, they have 18-24 months additional training. I don't how much pharmacology or clinical time they have. I think that is a fair question. The Pharmacology hours for a nurse practitioner is on average 107 .5 hours, for Physician Assistant it is about 105 hour as well, for a naturopathic person it is an average of 47 or 48 hours. So as the current curriculum stands it's not as good as the mid-level providers and sometimes that is of question as well. Rep. Kiefert: I am looking at their scope of practice and what they are asking to do. They are only asking for minor things to do. Wouldn't the medical field welcome not to have to some of these procedures and give them more time to address the more serious issues. Dr. Connel l: That is a great point and I think the point of Physicians with limited time based on the current fee for service model of reimbursement points out another glaring problem in our health care system. One that whose hand is being forced and it is being changed and I know we do have some accountable care organizations in our state and I think that it growing and I think that is the start of fixing that particular problem. The procedure I remember being listed here in addition to midwifery was removing toenails and ultrasound. I already talked about my concern with ultrasound and with removing toenails. I actually learned to do this in the emergency rooms during residency and was pretty competent. I worked in the emergenc y rooms after graduating. I was pretty competent and I haven't removed a toenail in a while and I wouldn't have tried my first one out of residency if I hadn't done several. I am a little concerned on how you can be competent in pharmacology with fewer class hours and competent in all of these procedures with a fraction of the clinical training that physicians and other providers have, it doesn't mathem atically add up for me, while you are becoming a master of naturopathic medicine which is your apparent passion. Rep. Fehr: Your comment for fee for service caught my interest and your reference to being a Jack-of-all-trades and I am reminded of one of the things they found when they were researching on plane crashes that one of the problems was lack of communication between and pilot and co-pilot. It seems to me with some of the things you are talking about in terms of increasing need for knowledge in areas really points to the problems that we find with fee for service that is individuals are supposed to know anything and everything about everything and what we really need is mor e collaborative work which perhaps gets away from the fee for service. In your opinion as a physician do you envision that we could get away from the fee for service that other providers might a place and welcome into some kind of collabor ative practice, such as the naturopaths we ar e discussing? Dr. Conn ell: I have felt up to this point that I have that nice level of collaboration with the naturopaths that I include in my consulting practitioners. I don't know that a shift from a fee House Human Services Committee SB 219 4 March 25, 2015 Page 10 for service is required for that. I think it would become muddier when we start to blur our specialties. If I start prescribing naturopathic medicines I will be less well known as a pediatrician and I am not a naturopath, so what am I? I wo uld like to consult a naturopath \u00b7 \u00b7--\u00b7 who actually practices naturopathy and is really good at it rather than to dabble in Western medicine. When lines are blurring and we do some of each how are we going to even evaluate outcomes? Writ ten testi mony: provided on SB 2194 that from people that were unable to attend. (See Testimony# 15).

Rep. D. Anderson: You wanted me to look at what the pharmacy differences were between the physician and naturopathic and it looks to me that they are about the same as a nurse practitioner. That is all I could find out with what their training is. Chairman Weisz: They have full prescribing rights I believe. Rep. Porter: They can go up to schedule 2. Only physicians can do schedule 1. Chairman Weisz: Nurse practitioners can go up to and including schedule 2? Rep. Porter: That is my recollection of what we did when we took that oversight away. The schedules are based on the federal schedules' levels of addictiveness. Chairman Weisz: There are three parts to the bill; minor office, midwife and prescriptive abilities. They are all in conflict so we will take each one separately. We don't license midwives. Rep. Porter: The boar d of nursing licenses a family nurse practitioner who has done the program of midwifing. They are employed inside of health care facilities. We do not have any requirements or certification inside of that group. Chairman Weisz: The midwife does require the 3 year course. Rep. Fehr: I don't have an issue with them attending births. My concerns have to do with proper pre-natal attendance that if any high risk pregnancies get screened so they get proper attention. Any concerns I have, a board could regulate beyond with what we are putting in here. The same with medication regulation. Rep. Rich Becker: (Microphone off so inaudible). House Human Services Comm ittee SB 219 4 March 31, 2015 Page 2 Chairman Weisz: All your narcotics are in schedule 1. Rep. Porter: All narcotics are in schedule 1. Family practitioners were in Schedule 2 and higher, but not in 1. Chairman Weisz: I did get an e-mail from the board of nursing saying they have changed their position from neutral to support. Rep. Fehr: The concerns I have can be addressed by their licensing board. I move a Do Pass on 2194. Rep. Kiefert: Second. Rep. Oversen: I don't support the bill and the concerns I have I don't think it is not always a fair comparison to just look at hours. The way the naturopaths are trained to look the body and system is just different and the way the body heals and I'm concerned about the prescriptive rights and the doors it could open.

As proposed, SB2194 would broaden the scope of naturopaths to allow them to prescribe drugs and to perform so-called \"minor office procedures.\" Naturopaths do not have the training to safely prescribe and monitor controlled substances and do not have the training and experience to prescribe prescription medications as they rely on over the counter and homeopathic remedies. Inappropriately expanding the scope of practice of naturopaths to prescribe puts North Dakota patients at risk. Additionally, as proposed in SB2194, \"minor office procedures\" is defined as \"the methods for repair and care incidental to superficial lacerations and abrasions, superficial lesions, and the remova l of foreign bodies located in the superficial tissues. The term does not include skin biopsies.\" While we are grateful that this explicitly exempts skin biopsies, we are concerne d that the term \"superficial tissues\" is not defined within the bill. Without clarity that \"superficial tissues\" means the stratum corneum (dead cells), this language could be interpreted to allow naturopa ths to perform procedures which affect living tissue. \"Repair ... of superficial lacerations \", could be interpreted as suturing lacerations, electroco agulation of bleeding, grafting skin, and rotating skin through skin flaps to repair injured skin. All of these repair techniques are in the purview of physicians and surgeons and would be inappropriate to be done by naturopaths as they do not have the requisite training to perform \"repair of lacerations.\" Removal of foreign bodies often requires injected local anesthesia, incision with a scalpel and after the foreign body has been retrieved, \"repair\" or suturing of the resulting defect. The minor office terminology is far too vague as written. Finally, we are concerned that more than being ineffective, some treatments of naturopaths may in fact, be harmful. One such treatment is the use of black salve, red salve and cansem a. According to the Australian Government's Therapeutic Goods Administration, these products, which contain an active ingredient called sanguinarine, which comes from Bloodroot, burn off layers of the skin and surrounding normal tissue. They can destroy large parts of the skin and AS American Society for '\" Dermatologic Surgery ASSOCIATION und erlyi ng tissue to signif icant scarring.1 I have personall y treated a patien t that was refe rred to me for several \"fungating skin can cers\" that I was to resect. On quest ioni ng, the patien t told me tha t he obtaine d \"Black Salve\" on the Interne t and has been applying it to various growths on his body. I instruc ted him to stop using the Salve and within 2 week s his \"tum ors\" disappe ared and he was saved from deform ing surgery. The patient had no skin cancer; the Black Salve was just eating away his norm al sk in. The U.S. Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA) include s black sa lve on the li st of \"187 Fake Cancer 'Cures' Consumer s Should Avo id.\"2 Addi tiona lly, the FDA has sought legal action against the manufacturers of such produc ts. In Octo ber 2012, a federal judg e granted an in jection against a black salve man ufacturer for selling pr oduc ts that hav e not been appr oved by the FDA for their claime d uses.3 For these reasons, ASDSA strongly opposes SB2194.

Federal judge grants permanent injunction agai nst Oregon herb and supplement Lobbyist (#164) Senate Human Services Committee Hearing January 19, 2015 Madam Chair and Members of the Commit tee, My name is Eliz abeth Allmend inger. I am a doctor of naturopa med icin e, also known as an ND , from Bismarck. I am regi stered as lobbyist 164 for the Nor th Dakota Association of Natur opa thic Doctors (NDAND). Sena te Bill 2194 has been introduced on our be half , and I have been asked to explain the bill. Sena te Bill 2194 is a scope expan sion bill for ND's. Our licensing statute was created in 2011. The three major objectives of this bill are to add minor office procedures, limited prescription rights and naturopath ic childbir th. Since pharmaceut icals are part of our trainin g, pres cription rights were incl uded in the 201 1 licensure bill but were removed by amendment at the request of the NOMA. Minor office procedures and naturopa thic chil dbirth - also part of our tr aining -were inclu ded in our first 20 I I bill draft. We removed them before filing based on discussions with legis lators, who felt the timing wasn 't right for home bi1th and to make the bill more stre aml ined. Page I Page 2 (Line 20-2 1) 43-5 8-0 I is the statute amends the homeop not need a presc ription, but may in some cases and this allows that right. Homeopath ic prep arat ions are normally made from natural substances such as herbs and minerals. (Line l) Creates Subsection 5, a new defin ition of minor office procedures. This definition is meant to refer to clean ing and repair of wounds, including suturing when nece ssary, simple dermatolo gy procedures like remov ing skin tags, as well as remov ing glass, splint ers or other foreign objects from the skin, and trea ting cuts and scrapes. Sup erficial is the surface or shal low layers of the body. Deeper layers would be considered perform ing sur gery. These are common tasks in famil y medicine that wou ld be particula rly important to an ND scope when working in a rural area or tribal facility, or anywher e a walk-in clinic or ER is not available. Suturing is als o a skill necessary in naturopa thic childbirth. By exc luding skin biopsies, the defin ition clearly indicates it does not refer to remov ing a mole to send to patholog y to rule out mela noma or other skin cancers. Patient scenarios like that would be referred to a dermatologist. (Line 22) Is an amendment to 43-5 8-08 (I a). It creates an exception to prescribe prescription drugs as defined in subsection 4, which I will review in a moment. (Line 25) This amends 43-5 8-08 (le). It creates an except ion to perform a minor offi ce procedure. These are the serv ices I just described to you in the defi nition sect ion. 1 SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope Elizabeth Allmendi nger, NDAND Lobbyist (#164) Senate Human Services Committee Hearing January 19, 2015 Page 3 (Line 2) Removes the non-pr escriptive limitation in subsection (2) for natural substances. Inject able vitamins and minerals require a pres cription. For examp le, we currently have to request a practioner with prescription rights to order the prescriptio n for a patient need ing a B 12 shot, even though ND' s already have been granted the abi I ity to inject in the original licensure bill. (Line 13) Creates a new Subsect ion 4 outlining the presc ription except ion. This enable s the board to estab lish a pres cription drug form ulary list that which presc ription drugs an ND can presc ribe. (Line 15) ection (4a) defines the members of the subc ommit tee of the Board of Integrat ive Health Care that will create the form ulary of presc ription drugs. The subcomm ittee is limited to board members with spec if ic training in pres cription drugs. It will consis t of the pharmac ist, the doctor of med icine or osteopathy, the natur opath and the nurse practitio ner. The other members of the board will not be involv ed in creat ing the formulary. (Line 18) (4b) the Unif orm Contr olled Substances Act from being in the fom rnla ry, except for spec ific stero ids hormones - prim arily testosterone. (Line 20) Creates a new Subsection 5, enabling the practice of minor office procedur es, which I have prev iously discuss ed. (Line 21) Creates a new Subsect ion 6, enab ling an ND with spec ialized training approved by the board to practice naturopa thic childbirth. (Line 25) Creates a new sect ion estab lishing the spec ializ to practice naturopa thic childbi1 th attendance as a specialized pract ice. (Line 27) Subsection 1 clarifies that a natur opath may not perform natu ropath ic childbir th attendance unless ce1tif ied by the board to have spec ialized training, educ ation and testing. Not all ND's have acquired this trainin g. (Line 29) Subs ection 2 mandates that the board adopt additional rules neces sary to qualif y for this specialt y practice. Examples of additional rules the board will consider include: accred itation standards, clini cal procedures perm itted for childbir th, other standards the board feels neces sary for pract ice and over sight. 2 '.

My name is Beth Allen. I am a licensed doctor of naturopa thic medicine (ND) living in Fargo. This morning I am speaking on the childbirth portion of the bill. First, I want to clarify that this is NOT a midwifery bill. This bill is meant to set the standards for licensed ND's to deliver babies in North Dakota. It is not meant to set the standards for midwives in North Dakota. Second, because of past failed midwifery bills, I want to point out that the Bastyr program exceeds the national midwifery requirements which were included in the 2011 midwifery bill. Bastyr WA program 2011 MW Bill Education 3 year curriculum, Varying curriculum options MEAC accredited program 3 MEAC courses Births 60 required for graduation 50 for CPM certification The practice of naturopathic childbirth includes all of the same care, exams, and tests as in conventional medicine. The primary differences are having a home birth and also several home visits during prenatal and postpartum care. Home birth is not the only reason women choose naturopathic childbirth -they desire the personalized prenatal and postpartum care. All patients are screened for appropriateness of home birth and are referred if not appropriate. All naturopathic-midwives are trained to handle emergencies and have transfer plans ready if necessary. Research studies com paring home and hospital births in the US, Canada, and other developed countries have consistently shown that for low-risk pregnancies, a planned home birth attended by a trained midwife results in: o Equal health outcomes for newborns regardless of location. o Better health outcomes for moms if born at home. The American Public Health Association, the World Health Organization, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (UK) and several Canadian organizations all recommend the use of midwifery for good maternal-child health outcomes. 1 .'\\J SB 2194 Naturopathic scope Bill Beth Allen, ND Senate Human Services Committee January 19, 2015 Dr. Molly Ferguson, ND/LM, is licensed in Minnesota and practices in Moorhead. She has provided written testimony since she could not be here today. In the past 10 years, at least 3 of our North Dakota classmates have graduated from Bastyr's naturopathic-midwifery program - two from Fargo and one from Jamestown. These North Dakota women did not have the option to practice here when they graduate d, so they stayed in Washington. We do get requests from patients asking for midwifery rec ommendations, but there is nothing we can offer them. This bill will allow ND's that specialize in home births to provide that service to the small but growing number of women tha t want them. I have added several attachments for your review: Attachment A. Washington standards & CDC facts Attachment B. Research table and list of studies Attachment C. Written professional testimony of Molly Ferguson, ND /LM Attachment D. Written patient testimony of Leah Schneck, RN from Fargo. I am happy to answer your questions. 2 \u00b7' SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope bill Senate Human Services Committee Testimony Attachment A-Beth Allen, ND January 19, 2015 Attachment A -WA law/rules, CDC facts 3.3 General curriculum requirements of Washington administrative rules -WAC 246-834-140 The basic curriculum shall be at least three academic years, and shall consist of both didactic and clinical instruction. Each student must undertake the care of not less than fifty women in each of the prenatal, intra-partum and early postpartum periods. Students need not see the same women throughout each period. A candidate for licensure must observe an additional fifty women in the intra-partum period in order to qualify for licensure. Students receive instructions in the following instruction areas: o Basic sciences (including biology, physiology, microbiology, anatomy with emphasis on female reproductive anatomy, genetics and embryology) normal and abnormal obstetrics and gynecology, family planning techniques, childbirth education, nutrition both during pregnancy and lactation, breast feeding, neonatology, epidemiology, community care, and medical-legal aspects of midwifery. o Basic nursing skills and clinical skills, including but not limited to vital signs, perinea! prep, enema, catheterization, aseptic techniques, administration of medications both orally and by injection, local infiltration for anesthesia, venipuncture, administration of intravenous fluids, infant and adult resuscitation, and charting. o Clinical practice in midwifery which includes care of women in the prenatal, intra- partum and early postpartum periods. Additional course requirements set out in law (RCW 18.50.040) include neonatal pediatrics, behavioral sciences, obstetrical pharmacology, and genetics. The training required under this section shall include training in either hospitals or alternative birth settings or both with particular emphasis on learning the ability to differentiate between low-risk and high-risk pregnancies. Key points of Washington law & rules for midwifery prescription drugs and devices RCW 18.50.115 Administration of drugs and medications A midwife licensed under this chapter may obtain and administer prophylactic ophthalmic medication, postpartum oxytocic, vitamin K, Rho immune globulin (human), and local anesthetic and may administer such other drugs or medications as prescribed by a physician. A pharmacist who dispenses such drugs to a licensed midwife shall not be liable for any adverse reactions caused by any method of use by the midwife. The secretary, after consultation with representatives of the midwife advisory committee, the pharmacy quality assurance commission, and the medical quality assurance commission, may adopt rules that authorize licensed midwives to purchase and use legend drugs and devices in addition to the drugs authorized in this chapter.

(2) In addition to prophylactic ophthalmic medication, postpartum oxytocic, vitamin K, Rho immune globulin (human), and local anesthetic medications as listed in RCW 18.50.115, WAC 246-834-250 licensed midwives may obtain and administer the following medications: (a) Intravenous fluids limited to Lactated Ringers, Lactated chloride use in intravenous locks; (b) Sterile water for intradermal injections for pain relief; (c) Magnesium sulfate for prevention of maternal seizures pending transport ; (d) Epinephrine for use in maternal anaphylaxis pending transport ; (e) Measles, Mumps, and born to hepatitis B+ mothers; (f) Terbutaline for non reassuring fetal heart tones and/or cord prolapse pending transport; (g) Antibiotics for intrapartum prophylaxis of Group B Beta hemolytic Streptococcus (GBS) per current CDC guidelines; and (h) Antihemorrhagic drugs to control postpartum hemorrhage, such as misoprostel (for use only in postpartum hemorrhage), methylergonovine maleate in the absence of hypertension, oral or intramuscular , prostaglandin F2 alpha (hemobate), intramuscular. (3) The client's records shall contain documentation of all medications administered. (4) The midwife must have a procedure, policy or guideline for the use of each drug. Center for Disease Control & Prevention Birth Data Trends - Nationwide 1.36% of births take place outside the hospital -2/3 of these occur at home. Out\u00ad of-hospital births have steadily increased since 2004 across all race and ethnic groups. Currently, 2% of white non-Hispanic women are having out-of-hospital births. Six states have more than 3% of births out-of-hospital : Alaska (6%), Montana (3.9%), Oregon (3.8%), Washington (3.4%), Idaho (3.4%), and Pennsylvania (3.1%). Midwives deliver 8% of all babies nationwide. States with the highest midwife deliveries include New Mexico (24%) and Georgia (18%). New Mexico also has the lowest C-section rates.

My name is Stephanie Nishek and I am a licensed doctor of naturopathic medicine. I opened Aurora Naturopathic Center in Minot last year. Before moving to Arizona in 2006 to pursue my degree in naturopathic medicine, I had lived in North Dakota my whole life. Once I completed my degree in 2010, I was given an opportunity to join an established practice in Arizona, so I remained there for another four years before deciding to come back home. Now, after only 7 months of practice in Minot, I can say with full confidence that returning to North Dakota was the best decision I have made for my career and for my young family. Public response in and around Minot has been overwhelmingly positive and my practice is growing quickly. I'd like to discuss the expansion of the naturopathic scope to include prescription writing privileges. In Arizona, licensed naturopaths do prescribe medications, and I did during my time there as well. You see, part of practicing naturopathic medicine responsibly is recognizing the limitations of natural therapies and knowing how and when to use conventional treatments, when the situation arises. There are a number of situations and medical conditions that require occasional or consistent use of pharmaceuticals. For example, Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis, or \"strep throat,\" is a bacterial throat infection most common in school-aged children and is easily diagnosed in-office with a swab of the tonsils and throat. This infection can have long term consequences, including heart problems and arthritis. The possibility of experiencing long term consequences is essentially negated if antibiotic therapy is initiated within 48 hours of infection. This is why the standard of care, even as a naturopathic doctor, is to use antibiotics. My patients are at a disadvantage in this situation. If diagnosed in my office, my only option is to refer them to an urgent or emergency care facility, which steals time from our 48-hour window and is an unnecessary financial burden on the patient. A much more common situation encountered every day in both medical and naturopathic centers, is hypothyroidism. According to the American Thyroid Association, one woman in 8 will develop a thyroid condition at some point in her lifetime and it is estimated that 20 million Americans have some form ofthyroid disease. My practice is 71% female, so I encounter patients on thyroid medication frequently. It is frustrating for patients that NDs have the tools and knowledge to diagnose their thyroid disease, but then have to send them out to be examined and tested all over again before receiving the appropriate treatment. Listed here are examples of both acute (immediate or urgent) and chronic (long-term) conditions or situations in which I prescribed medications while practicing in Arizona: High blood pressure Venomous spider bite Asthma Bacterial sinus infection Menopausal symptoms Urinary tract infection Skin abscess Oral contraception/birth control Pre-Diabetes/Diabetes Bacterial conjunctivitis (eye infection) Bacterial ear infection SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope Bill Stephanie Nishek, ND Senate Human Services Committee 1/19/2015 Pharmacology is a fundamental part of a naturopathic education. We learn how and when to prescribe drugs, how to monitor and assess for therapeutic levels and toxicity, appropriate weaning strategies, pharmaceutical contraindications and possible interactions with botanicals, nutrients and other medications and when to refer to a primary care provider or specialist. The current version of our Part II Clinical Board Exam, called the NPLEX (Naturopathic Physician Licensing Examination), lists 187 pharmaceuticals for student review. When compared to other mid-level practitioners with prescriptive authority in North Dakota, we found that NDs have up to 8 credit hours of pharmac ology, while University of North Dakota's Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (nurse practitione rs) and Physician Assistant programs both have 4 credit hours. Minimum clinical training hours for naturopaths, nurse practitioners and physician assistants are 1626, 680, and 20001, respective ly. In total, there are 17 states that license naturopaths, and currently1frof those have prescriptive authority. To support the points I have made regarding our education, I have attached the following documents for your review: A.

My name is Dr. Lezlie Link. I am a doctor of naturopa thic me dicine residing and practi cing in Bismar ck. I ap erson for the Nor th Dak ota Boar d of Integrative Health Care, which regulates the profession of naturopa thic medicine. This morn ing I am speaking on the naturopathic minor office proced ures portion of the bill. Dr. Allmendin ger has reviewed the definition of minor office procedu res and provided you a copy of the curricu lum. Minor offi ce procedu res are those as such that can be hand led within the workflow of a dail y heal th care office. Such procedu res include but are not limi ted to the remova l of an ingrown toenai l, an unexpected superficial wound req uiring sutu res, and the rem ova l of skin tags . A cruc ial elem ent for all health car e practi tioner s providing min or offi ce proc edur es is the abili ty to ble anesthetics. Injectable an esthetics provide loca lized infiltrat ion of ane sthesia and block nerve innervati on ther eby causing a loss of sens ation to that area. Mo re imp ortantly to the patien t, injecta ble an esthetics make a proced ure mor e comf orta ble. Loca lized anesthetics vary in their time of dur ation and when consider ed with oth er factors are chosen as needed for a procedu re. Injecta ble lidocaine can be used for quic k skin tag removal wher e as mar caine might be chosen for a proced ure nee ding more time such as an in grown toenail rem ova l. I would NOT provide or perform min or offi ce procedu res in my pr actice, if I couldn't perform the procedu res as I've been traine d to do with ane sthetics. It would viola te one of the basic ten ets of naturopathic medicine -primum non nocere, first do no harm. Perform ing minor offi ce proce dures is essenti al to those worki ng in rural areas wher e health care services can be limi ted. For exam ple, doc tors of naturopathic medicine are include d as licens ed provider s within the Indian Health Services progra m, however to service Nor th Dakota's Amer ican Indian popula tion effectively, it is necessa ry to be able to prescri be medications and perform min or office proc edu res. Accord ing to Indian Heal th Services data, 25% of Am erica n Indian women are diagnosed with diabetes; this is twice the non-Hispanic popula tion in the U.S1. Now ima gine , I need to at tend to this woman and evalua te a diabetic ulcer th at's has bec ome infected from not being able to heal from high blood glucose levels. Not only does this patient need medic ation man agem ent but she may also requir e wou nd debridem ent and antibio tic therapy to heal the wound. I am happ y to answer your questions today or provide addi tional information as you work on this bill in comm ittee work.

SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope Bill Glen Hyland, MD Senate Human Services Committee Januar y 19, 2015 Good morning Madam Chair and Members of the Senate Human Service Committee. My name is Dr. Glen Hyland, D. I am a North Dakota native and have been in practice in North Dakota for 39 years. I am an interni st, a board certified radiation oncologist, and am boarded in holistic medicine. Over the last 2.5 years, Dr. Lezlie Link, N.D. and I have worked collabor atively at Integrative Medical Solutions PLLC, here in Bismarck. I have found her to be very knowledgeable in our conversations about prescribing medicatfon to our patient s and discussing the actions and possible side effects with them. I personally have monitored her calling prescriptions to pharmacies and then have authorized those prescriptions. She knowledgably answers the pharmacist's questions. Dr. Link also knows when to refer patient s for subspe cialty advice. Example one: 60 y / o patient with difficult to control hypert ension. He had hypert ension diagnosed at age 21. When I asked her what she would do, she responded, \"Check for anatomical causes of hypert ension (renal artery stenosis or primar y renal disease).\" No one had previously consid ered this. Patient has been scheduled for appropria te studies to rule out a potentially correctible disease. Another example is, minor office procedures : since 1983 I have been primarily involved with cancer patients prescribing various forms of therapeutic radiations. I had not performed a punch biopsy in 30 years. Dr. Link created a practice forum for me, which allowed me to relearn and practice punch biopsies before performing them on patients. At Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, students are taught an integrative approach to thyroid disease. They are taught to diagnose thyroid disorders using stricter guidelines for thyroid ranges and they use hormone replacement and natural therapies for better outcomes. I have personally adopted this treatment approach after my experience working with Dr. Link. This approach improves response to standard hormone only replacement protocols. My observation of doctors of naturopathic medicine, is not limited to our integrative practice, but also from on site clinical observation of the training of naturopathic doctors at SCNM. I spent several days in classes with naturopathic students while they were instructed in IV nutrition, complimen tary and alternative therapies, and integrative cancer care. They were required to know side effect profiles of pharmaceutical chemotherapy drugs, side effects of nutritional and herbal therapies, and interactions of naturopathic and standard therapies . SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope Bill Glen Hyland, MD Senate Human Services Commi ttee January 19, 2015 Further, clinics covered by naturopathic students at SCNM prescribed a full range of pharmaceutical medications for common problems. I am happy to answer your questions today or provide additional information as you work on this bill in commit tee work. Madam Chair and Members of the Senate Human Service, thank you for you time . ... Sanford Health 300 N 7th St Bismarck, 701-323- 6000 January 15, 2015 Re: SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope Dear Madam Chair and Members of the Committee, My name is Dr. Sara Reinke and I am a board certified Pediatrician (MD, FAAP) at Sanford Health in Bismarck. I am writing this letter to discuss Senate Bill 2194 pertaining to Naturopathic scope expansion. As a physician with a consistent referral relationship with the local Naturopathic Doctor's (ND) I support this bill. One of the reasons I appreciate the referral relationship with ND's is their specialized training. They are trained in the standards of care of a primary care medical doctor (MD) but specialize in complementary medicine such as herbal and homeopathic medicine. As an MD, we have limited exposure to complimentary medicine unless we pursue additional training. Sinc e we have limited exposu re, I consult with ND's on a regular basis to discuss different supplem ents that my patients are on. I find ND's helpful in deciding if the supplem ents will interact with the prescriptions or treatment plans that I have advised. They usually also help me watch for potential side effects and dosage guidelines. Also, many of my patients have questions about complementary medicine that ND's can help me appropriately answer. I am very familiar with the training ND's have gone through and am confident in scope of expansion requests. In my interactions with ND's I've found them to be knowledgeable in both western and complementary medicine. Thank you for your consideration, Dr. Sara Reinke, MD, FAAP REGARDING SENATE BILL NO. 2194 /15 Jtf 2z139 I am Cheryl Rising, FNP and legislative liaison for the North Dakota Nurse Practitioner Association (NDNPA). NDNPA has reviewed Senate Bill 2194. We were requested to review the proposed bill in Nov. 2014. Suggestions were made to exclude controlled substances such as narcotics. Beth Allen, NDAND Secretary and Legislative Coordinator did communicat e they had made those changes and clarified professionals on the board that would be developing the formulary. NDNPA will support this bill. Cheryl Rising, FNP 701-527-2583 cdrising@earthlink.ne t Jan 19, 2015 Testimony in regard to SB2194 Madam Chairman and members of the committee, SE> 21q4 {)/ /1q /15 J:\u00b1t .:2213 9 My name is Andrea Toman, and I am a math tutor and stay at home mom her e in Bismarck. I am an independen t person. I like to make decisions for myself. I like having more options so I can choose the one that best fits my needs. I am excited to see the possible expansion of options in North Dakota for birth care. My only question is a point of clarification: I just want to ensure that this bill will in no way impact Direct Entry Midwives/Traditional Midwives or Certified Professional Midwives. With that assurance, I wholehe artedly support the Naturopathics in expanding their scope of care. Please vote DO PASS on SB2194. Thank you. Andrea Toman Bismarck ND District 35 51)2-fqtf VW:ach1f16 .J-r ;p-t- DoEs NATUROPATH NING JUSTIFY C. )rJ l rtVl LABO RATO RY, RADIOL OGY SER VICES AND )ftP PRESE NCE IN LABOR AND DELIVERY UNITS Natur opaths claim that they have the same or equi valent education /tra inin g as MD /DO's and the refore sho uld be able to do primar y care on the same level, including diagno sis and treatments. The natur opathic schoo ls are accred ited by private agencies dependi ng on region of the count ry they are in. These agencies are nongov ern men tal, voluntar y memb ership associations that set accreditation standar ds and eva luate member institutions aga inst those standar ds. These agencies have been appr oved by the Depar tment of Education (DOE) beca use it allows students access to student loans. The DOE only looks at administrativ e issues only, not curricu lum. Ther e are currently only five sma ll natur opathic schoo ls in the U.S.{1} The naturopathic schoo are not accredited by ei ther the Asso ciation of Amer ican Medical Colleges and Amer ican Medi cal Ass ociation the actic and other alternative medi cine schoo ls; they have no entrance exam and recommend a grade poin t average of a C from an under graduate facility at best. The only criterion seems to be the ability to pay the tuition. Medical schools req uire the Medi cal College Apti tude or Admissio n Test. One other admi ssion criteria that some natur opathic schools may require is havin g exp erienc e with sha dowing a practicing natur opath. Both MD /DO and natur opathic schools are four year s long. However, to practice primar y care (Family Medi cine) for an MD or DO in the U.S. requires a residency that is three years long to comple te. Natur opathic does not requir e a reside ncy for primar y care practice, but it is optional. If that option is taken that reside ncy is only one year long. To compar e and contrast med ical schoo l/oste opathi c school with natu ropathic schoo ling one can see a vast difference in training. Med ical school has in the preclin ical per iod an average of 2,700 hour s of lectures and 3000 hour s of study. Dur ing clini cal years medical stude nts will have 6,000 hours of clin ics and lectur es. In contrast natur opathic trainees in school average 1,500 hour s of lectu res with 1,665 hour s of study. Dur ing clinical yea rs the natur opathic trainee gets 2,600 hour s of combined clinic and lecture. When a newly graduated MD /DO goes into family medicine reside ncy they put in 9,000 to 10,000 hour s of extra training. The newly graduated natur opath if she /he wants to take a reside ncy only put in 535 to 1,035 hours of extra training. In sum a primar y care phys icia n from begi nnin g of medical school through the end of reside ncy has done 20,70 0 to 21,700 hour s of trainin g. In contrast the total numb er of hour s a nat uropath, includ ing the year of residency are 5,505 to 6,485 hour s. In other words a primar y care MD /DO has a tota l of over 15,000 hour s more tr ainin g than an equi valent natur opath.{3} The curriculum of natur opathic schools varies, but there are some similar ities. In one school, the Natural Coll ege of Natur al Medicine, the first year includes nor mal structure and fu nction of the human body with introduc tion to natur al ther apy, philo sophy, organ system Jo.l ses. The seco nd year is a cont inuat ion of organ systems and begins the study of disease and its diagnosis. Include d in that year is bota nical med icine, ther Thir d year is continua tion of the previous with an emph asis on case manag emen t and clini cal tria ls. The fourth year is practica l clini cal and work with a \"licens opath.{ 4} The cour se work the seems to be a mix of different alterna tive medicine syste ms, sprink led with some science. The bas ic sciences can be taken at other schools and can include chemis try, anatomy/physiol ogy, microbiolo ology and mixes those with an unique corre lation with a form a vita lism (a met aph ysica l doctrine that living orga nisms possess a non physica l inner force or ener gy that gives them the prope rty phil osophy of medic ine in the pre scientific per iod through to mid-19 th centur y. These alternat ive systems involve eas tern cultur e, such as ayur vedic and Chine se traditional medicine and and homeop athy. ways diagn osis; pulse, urine, stool, tongue, speech, touch, visio n and appearance. Its treatments in ancien t time s did include early surgeries, but primar ily today it emp has izes building a heal thier meta bolic system for good digestion and excre tion . It uses yoga and med itation to mainta in health. It also uses plan t based med icines along with milk , bone and gallsto nes in its medicines. Minerals such as sulphur , arsen ic, lead, copper and gold are added to pre parations for consum ption by the patie nt.{5} Chin ese her bal medicine and acupu ncture are also taught along with homeop athy. Mid wifery, massage, nutrition, psy chol ogy, world religions and mind body approach to heal th. Sign ifica nt portion of the cou rse work inclu des busin ess, entrepreneur ship, cooking etc. Some claim to have training in midwifery. The North Dak ota Boa rd of Nursing only recognizes the American Midwifery Certif ication Boa rd. None of the naturopathic schools are accredited to train midwives. The career s that are promoted are as follows: Primar y natur al cause or clin advisor in dietary supplemen t entrepreneur or natur al prod uct special ist, corporate wellnes s educ ator , pub lic heal th adv isor and author. Some of the claims made are: 1. Cra nial osteo pathy -beli eving realigning the bones of an adult or a child can cure lear ning disorder s. 2. Hyd roge n peroxide- applied to the skin effe ctively treats asthma. 3. Swa llowing digestive enzymes eas es inflammation of arthritis. 4. Homeo pathy- started in 18th centur y by Samuel Hahnemann and promotes that water has mem ory and what ever was in it and takin g it will cure diseas e . 5. Rid the body of toxins-believing that the large intestine must be periodically cleansed by fasting or enemas. 6. Measuring the skin resistance to an electrical current can test for parasite, food and environmental sensitivities, candida, nutritional deficiencies etc. One can only wonder with belief in prescientific philosophies of healing and practicing such arts, along with questionable quantity and quality of their training are naturopaths qualified to order and interpret scientific labs, imaging studies or be allowed to care for labor and delivery patients. At the same time I question, along with other alternative healing professions whether they even deserve the honorific title of Doctor?

Stripe MD., FAAFP President Minot Skeptical Society Society for Science Based Medicine Associate Professor of Family Medicine naturopathy -The Skeptic's Diction ary -Skepdic.com From Abracadabra to Zombies naturop athy The things naturopatlls do that are good are not special, and the tilings they do that are special are not good. --Harriet Hall, MD Naturopathy is a system of therapy and treatment which relies exclusively on natural remedies, such as sunlight, air, water, supplemented with diet and therapies such as massage. However, some naturopaths have been known to prescribe such unnatural treatments as colon hydrotherapy for such diseases as asthma and arthritis. Naturopathy is based on the belief that the body is self-healing. The body will repair itself and recover from illness spontaneously if it is in a healthy environment. Naturopaths have many remedies and recommend ations for creating a healthy environment so the body can spontaneously heal itselt: Naturopaths claim to be holistic, which means they believe that the natural body is joined to a supernatural soul and a non-physical mind and the three must be treated as a unit, whatever that means. Naturopathy is fond of such terms as \"balance\" and \"hannony\" and \"energy.\" It is often rooted in mysticism and a metaphysical belief in vitalism (Barrett). Naturopaths are also prone to make grandiose claims about some herb or remedy that can enhance the immune system. Yet, only medical doctors are competent to do the tests necessary to detem1ine if an individual's immune system is in any way depressed (Green). Naturopaths assume that many diseases, including cancer, are caused by faulty immune systems. (The immune system, in simple terms, is the body's own set of mechanisms that attacks anything that iso.'t \"self.\" Althou gh, in some cases rather than attack \"foreign bodies\" such as viruses, fungi, or bacteria, the immune response goes haywire and the body attacks it own cells, e.g., in lupus . multiple sclerosis, and rheum atoid arthritis.) Naturopaths also promote the idea that the mind can be used to enhance the immWle system and thereby improve one's health. However Dr. Saul Green argues that there are no reports in the scientific literature to support the contention that any AM [alternative medicine) operates through an established immunol ogical mechanism. Regardless of the means used to evoke an antitumor response, all the evidence available from clinical and animal studies clearly shows that only after the attention of the NIS [nonual immune system) has been attracted by some external manipulation of its components, is there any recognition by NlS of the existence of the tumor (Stutman, MJ. ( ed). !111111unity Against Tumors. N. Y. Academic Press: 431-432.). All the evidence amassed over the past 30 years provides a clear answer to the question, \"Does a11y AM treatment stimulate the NJS and cause it to identi.fy and destroy new cancer cells when they appear?\" The answer clearly is NO! (Green 1999: 20) Furthermore, the evidence that such diseases as cancer occur mainly in people with compromised immune systems is lacking. This is an assumption made by many oaturopaths but it is not supported by the scientific evidence. Immunol ogists have shown that the most common cancers flourish in hosts with fully functional and competent immw1e systems (Green 1999: 18). The notion that vitamins and colloidal minerals, herbs, coffee enemas, colonic irrigation, Laetrile, meditation, etc., can enhance the immune system and thereby help restore health is bogus. On the one hand, it is not necessarily the case that a diseased person even has a compromised immune system. On the other hand, there is no scientific evidence that any of these remedies either enhance the immune system or make it possible for the body to heal itself. Naturopathy is often, if not always, practiced in combination with other forms of \"alternative\" health practices. Bastyr University, a leading school ofnaturopathy since 1978, offers instmctioo in such things as acupuncture and \"spirituality.\" Much of the advice ofnaturopaths is sound: exercise, quit smoking, eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, practice good nutrition. Claims that these and practices such as colonic irrigation or coffee enemas \"detoxif y\" the body or enhance the immune system or promote \"homeostas is,\" \"harmony,\" \"balance,\" \"vitality,\" and the like are exaggerated and not backed up by sound research.

COULD NATUROPATHY EVER MEET ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS? NCAHF is in contact with naturopaths who are leaders in a reform movement. They understand that NCAHF's objection to the recognition of naturopathy is based upon its trad itional antiscience orientation. Reformers say that they hope to remove this objection and make naturopathy into an acceptable health care system. Their view of an ideal natur opathic physic ian (ND) is a practitioner suffic iently trained in diagnosis and screening to serve as a primary entry health care provider practicing general medicine with an emphasis upon teaching healthful lifestyles, mana ging minor illnesses, natural childb irth, personal counseling, and so forth. Rather than automa tically opposing drugs and surgery, they say, naturopathy would simply have a different emph asis. NDs would teach appropriate lifestyle changes that are safe and effective alternatives to drug s. For instance, weigh t-loss and exercise would be used as an alternative to medication for high blood pressure. If it were found not to be working for an individual patient, he or she would be referred to a regular physician. ND's believe that there is a selective patient population of people willing to make the extra effort required who would utilize naturopathic services. ND training would emphasize patient screening and practitioners would work in cooperation with MDs to whom more serious problems would be referr ed. Counter to their tradition as \"drugless practitioners ,\" reformers say that the idealized ND might even prescribe some medica tions. NDs say that they prefer to use herbal remedies, but acknowledge that these would have to meet scientific standards of safety and effectiveness. NDs would apply contempor ary medical standards to valida te their practices and would open themselves to peer review by MDs. NDs would rely upon the standard scientific medical literature for its knowledge base. NDs would abandon homeopathy, iridology, reflexology, and other sectarian or pseudomedical practi ces. Recognizing the propensity for naturopathy to attract sociopa ths, the profession would work to set a higher standard for self-discipl ine than is presently done with conventional medicine. ND reformers see the present dearth of family practitioners, its appeal to a growing health promotion\u00ad minded public willing to work at lifestyle changes, the high cost of high tech health care, and the high cost of medical education as favorable to their marketing strate gy. Reformed NDs would encourage immunization, pasteurization, fluoridation, and other proven public health measures. What the reformers have in mind sounds something like nurse practitioners, midwifery, barefoot doctor, and physician assistants, all rolled into a single role. This vision presents natu ropathy, not as an I 1 /1AAA 6of10 I'd )g \"alternative\" form of health care, but as filling a gap that has been left by the evolution of highly specialized, high-tech medicine. It would provide a low cost, low-technology brand of health care . Is this a pipe- dream or could such a profession emerge from the ranks of present-da y naturopathy with its unorthodox traditions? If so, could and would AMA-approved medical scho ols also offer such a program? Several reform-minded NDs say that it can be done. NCAHF's President has advised these reformers to demonst rate by developing a model program in one or more of the states that presently license NDs and approve Naturo pathic Medical Education. It may take a generation to accomplish, but once shown to be a responsible profession working within mainstream health care, naturopathy would have arrived and would grow rapidly. NCAHF has told ND reformers that just as it has done in the case of affilia ting with a chiropractic reform organiza tion, it would be willing to help build a bridge for NDs to enter mainstream health care if they appro ached their practi ces objectively and were open to careful scrutiny from the consumer protection perspective. As we have suggested to chiropractic reformers, reformer ND's may find it advantag eous to change the name of their profession to make it easier to purge itself of incorrigible quackery. NCAHF would be interested in reader's comments as the dialogue continues. NCAHF ATTORNEY FILES LETTERS OF WARNING Michael Botts has recently sent two letters of warning notifying agencies that actions they were about to undertake put the public at risk of serious injury and that ignorance of that fact could not be used as an excuse because they have been notified of the potential dangers of their actions. On May 17 Botts wrote to Oregon Attorney General David Frohnmayer regarding a Rule pending before the Natu ropathic Formul ary Council (NFC) of the Oregon Naturopathic Board. The Rule would permit naturopaths to prescribe 104 potentially dangerous or poisonous drugs. Included, for instance, was digitalis which can cause cardiac toxicity, heart attacks and deaths. Botts notified the AG that \"injury to the public from naturopaths prescribing under this Rule is not only probable, it is imminen t.\" He strongly advised that the AG \"take whatever steps are necessa ry to see that the public health is not endangered in this manner .\" Botts served notice that if the Rule is enacted and people are injured that he intends to publicize that prior notice had been given of expected dangers from the Rule. For your informa tion, the NFC was formed by an act of the Oregon Legisla ture in an apparent attempt to satisfy natu ropaths who have been clamoring to become something other than \"drugless practitioners .\" The NFC has been co nstituted in such a way that pro-na turopathic interests outnumber qualified pharma cologi sts likely to descent 3 to 2. From what NCAHF has learned the NFC appears to represent the worst kind of politicizing of a serious health care issue. The Oregon Board of Naturopat hic Examiners objected to the list because it was too restrictive, but agreed to adopt it under strong protest rather than go to court. The natur opathic patient medication time-bomb is ticking in Oregon! On June 6, Botts sent a letter of warning to the Governor of Alaska asking that he veto Alaska House Bill 146 because of Section 22 which states: \" ... the board may not base a finding of professional incompetence solel y on the basis that a licensee's practice is unconventional or experimental in the absence of demonstrable physical harm to a patient ;\" (In plain language, the board cannot lock the barn unless a horse has been stolen !) Botts clearly pointed out that this law put Alaska's citizens in very real danger because the only time the State could act is \"after someone is hurt or killed.\" Botts noted his own past experience as a former Iowa Ass istant Attorney General citing the reality that 7of10 /!J 9 people are regularly injured by quackery. He made it clear that he intended to publicize his letter in the event that the law was passed and someone was in jured by a (devia nt) Alaska practitioner.

PROMOTERS MOAN OVER OTA DRAFT REPOR T The Office of Tech nology Asses sment (OT A), the agency which does research and investigation on matters involving science and technology for the U.S. Congress, initiated a study of unconventional cancer treatm ents in January , 1987. The study was requested by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce which oversees a wide range of health issues. The Committee had been heavily lobbied by proponents of so-called \"Immuno-Au gmentative Thera py\" (IAT), a dubious cancer remedy being sold in the Bahamas by a maverick zoologist Lawrence Burton, PhD. Like laetri le promoters in the 1970's, the strategy involved picketing congressmen by allegedly cured cancer patients (many of whom are now dead), and people who operate the referral agencies posing as consumer advoca tes. NCAHF has followed this study carefully, but limited its comments to a single item in the May-June, 1987 issue of this newsletter. We predicted at that time that OTA would \" .. simply go over the ground covered by all of the rest of us who study cancer quackery. Following a negative report, the quacks will predictably yell 'foul' and resurrect their standby arguments about conspira cies, cover-ups, inside fixes, and so forth.\" This statement sounds like a perfect prophecy in light of what has transpired. On March 9 the OT A held a public meeting at which many of the promoters of cancer quackery appeared to vent their anger over the report. The usual players were present to present the familia r distortions of realit y that has become their creed . Promoters are pushing for a double standard . They want to be able to sell cancer remedies on the basis of the marketplace demand they can create through publicity and adverti sing employing testimonials and unsubstantiated claims. The essence of the OTA's review of the unconventional remedies and arguments of proponents can be summ ed up by linking several outstanding sentences in the draft report: \"One system of medicine is formally recognized in the United States--scie ntific medicine, domi nated by medical doctors. The safety and efficacy requirements of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act for new drugs and medical devices codify scientific medicine as the national standard \" (1-14 ). \" .. . 'unconventional cancer treatmen ts' ... are defined not by what they are, but what they are not: part of mainstream, orthodox medicine\" (1-25). \"Valid methods for determining the ef ficacy and safety of unconventional cancer treatments are the same as those that are valid for evaluating conventional treatmen ts. There is no 'alternative evaluation' methodology that can give valid answers ... \" (1-43). No matter how much the promoters of unconventional thera pies moan, there is no denying these facts. The obvious financial self-interest of those selling unconventional cancer remedies negates their arguments charging self-interest on the part of the establishment. What the promoters obviously seek is to esca pe the accou ntabili ty that goes with offering responsible medical care. [Citations used above are technically not quotable because they are taken from the unoff icial, prelimi nary draft. They are presented to show what it is that promoters are complaining about .] A CANADIAN TRAGEDY The quackery-related death of a 17-mont h-old girl has sent shock waves across Canada. No one aspect of the story is unusual. The scenario is a classic combination of cultural vulnera bility, modem urban 1990 Page 8of10 Dead from malnutrition and pneumonia is Lorie Atikian. Eight months before her death on September 25, 1987, Lorie was a perfectly healthy baby . When she died she was nearly bald, covered with deep red rashes, and so emaciated that the parame dics thought they were being tricked by being given a doll to treat. The Parents Lorie's parents Sonia, 38, and Khochadou r, 54, are emigres from Lebanon and Syria. In addition to Lorie, the couple has two teenaged children. Like many people these days the Atikian's were concerned about modern food additives, pesticide residues, and drugs. Their cultural background may have made them a bit more vulnerable, but like most people they held positive attitudes toward \"natural\" food and medicine. Sonia became enamored with Gerhard Hanswi lle, an \"herbo logis t.\" The \"Herbologist\" Gerhard Hanswi lle, 55, says that he learned herbology in Germany through self-study and books (Germany has a tradition of folk medicine that includes a great deal of Medieval herbal ism). In 1972, Hanswi lle obtained a mail order doctoral degree in naturopathy from \"Bern adean University\" (BU) located at that time in Las Vegas, Nevada. BU, which was never approved or accredited to offer any courses, was closed down by the Nevada Commission on Postseconda ry Education in 1976. It then moved to California where it operated for several years before eventually becoming \"authorized\" under the State's liberal rules (Aronson, 1983). California has tried to close BU but has been blocked by its claim to being a religious school of the Church of Universology (Emshwiller, 1987). Hanswi lle owns two \"House of Herbs \" stores, writes and gives semina rs at which he expounds his theor ies, which include making wax and clay effigies sealed with drops of blood and sperm (notions founded in Monism and Vita/ism which are the basis of most primitive folk medicine). Hanswi lle's book describes how to heal diabetes, epilepsy, TB, tumors and para lysis by \"touchless massage .\" Hanswille likens the technique to dowsing for wate r, something that \"not everyone can do.\" Sonia paid $450 to take Hansw ille's course. The Promise Hanswi lle's compelling vision of natural health made a convert of Sonia. When she became pregnant with Lorie in 1985 Hanswi lle convinced her to remain \"pure\" for the sake of the child. She testified that Hans wille promised to make Lorie a super baby. \"That baby is going to be very diff erent. Its going to develop without chemical s. Its going to be strong and pure .. .it going to be very special .\" Hanswille convinced Sonia that vaccinations would \"poison\" her child, and that ultrasound examination would damage an unborn baby's brain. He had Sonia tell her pedia trician that she would not be bringing Lorie in any more because the family was moving to California. Hanswille was described as \" .. .like a doctor. .. surrounded by medicine and books ... sure of what he was saying. He always had an answer .\" The Regimen 1/16/20 15 NCAF Newsletter July/August 1990 Page 9o f1 0 /().II Hanswille advocated an organic, vegetarian diet. He sold the Atikians a special juicer for $400 alleging that their own juicer \"burned the nutrition\" out of fruits. Among the special products the Atikians purchased from Hanswille were a bottle of baby oil that cost $16, a bar of soap costing $7.40, and a 3 kg box of laundry detergent that cost $35.99. When Lorie became ill she was treated with royal jelly, \"cell salts\" (homeopathy ), and an herbal concoction brewed by Hanswi lle. He also treated Lorie with an electromagnetic \"vitalizing\" machine that \"stimulates the blood\" and has attachments such as an electrified comb that \"livens up the hair.\" Sonia Atikian testified that they became very concerned about Lorie's condition but that Hanswille assured them that it was normal for clumps of her baby's hair to fall out and not to worry if Lorie didn't gain weight. Hansw ille told Sonia that taking Lorie to a hospital would be like \"holding a loaded gun to Lorie's head and pulling the trigge r.\" The Legal Charges The Atikians were charged with failing to provide the necessities of life for their baby daughter (child neglect). Up until now Hanswille has not been charged with anyt hing. He has angrily complained that he feels like \"the accused\" but denies that he did anything wrong. He says that he \"cannot tell people what to do,\" that it is up to the parents to make decisions for their children. The judge instructed the jury that it was all right for them to \"vent your spleen\" over the activities of Hanswi lle \"and his ilk,\" but neither he nor herbal ism were on trial in the death of little Lorie. The Verdict On June 12 the Atikia ns were found guilt y of child neglect. Sentencing is scheduled for July 6. How Unusual Is This Case? The sad story of the death oflittle Lorie Atikia n received national coverage in Canada by the Toronto Star (5/10-6/13) and The Globe and Mail. It is the kind of story that elicits harsh blame of the parents for their gullibility. \"How could they have been so foolish?\" is the usual response. The reality is that most of the public is sympathetic to the underlying assumptions that condemn modem food, commercial agricu lture and extol \"natural\" medicine. The herbal industry is trying to distance itself from Hanswi lle by saying that the case is \"not typical .\" However, we believe that what Hanswi lle told the Atikians is not only widely belie ved by health food and natural (herbal) medicine ilk; it largely represents the philo sophy that is used to justify the existence of \"alternative\" medicine and herbal ism. The faith the Atikia ns placed in Hanswille seems cult-like, but how different is it than the confidence a patient must put in a surgeon, anesthe siologis t, radiologist, or physicia n who hold lives in their hands? Mur der, By Words Alone? In 1962, a California chiropractor was convicted of second-degree murder by words alone in the death of 11-year- old cancer patient, Linda Epping. To get a conviction, the prosecutor had to prove that \"his fraudulent representations ... caused Linda to die when she died\" (Miner, 1964). We do not know enough about Ontario law to know if what Hanswille did cons tituted the unlawful practice of medicine, and if so, the result ant death of Lorie Atikian makes such a felony. We do know that Lorie's death is even more tragic than Linda Epping's because Linda had a form of cancer that is usually fatal ' II was a healthy baby with a normal future . People who preswne to give health advice that can make the difference between life and death must be regulated by the government and held accou ntab le for their misdeeds. Conswner protection law holds that pract icing medicine is a privilege, not a right. Like driving a car or flying an airplane, only those who are qualified are granted such privilege by the sta te. It is clear that the state has a compellin g responsibili ty to protect vulnerab lepeople--a glib purve yors of pseudomedicine . It matters not that such practitioners are sincere in their belief s. Experience teaches that, when it comes to quackery, zealotry can be more dangerous than fraud . References Miner J. \"The Phillips case--A new dimension in murde r,\" J 1964.

I had known her for thirty years. Her official diagnosis was breast cancer, but she was really a victim of quackery. Conventional treatment might have saved her, but she rejected the advice of her oncologist and went to \"natural healers.\" Debbie was a registered nurse at the Kaiser hospital in Portland, Oregon, but she had a deep distrust of standard medical practice. She didn't have a mammogram for nine years, and when she did --in March 1996 --it showed a cancerous lump in her breast. She had the lump removed, but she refused the additional treatment her doctor recommended. Instead she went to a naturopath who gave her -\u00ad among other things --some \"Pesticide Removal Tinctures.\" Soon after that, lymph nodes swelled in Debbie's armpit. The naturopath said that this was merely the effect of the herbal remedies he was giving her and not to worry. Belatedly, she returned to her oncologist at Kaiser hospital, where the lymph nodes were biopsied and found to be cancerous. Once again, she refused the recommended treatment. Unfortunately , the cancer was spreading throughout her body. Debbie continued to patronize \"alternative healers\" in the Portland area. One even claimed to diagnose her with a pendulum! She found another lump in her breast, but the cancer had invaded her liver and was no longer treatable by standard methods. During the last weeks of her life, another naturopath gave Debbie a skin preparation that was supposed to draw the tumor out of her. This stuff caused an ugly open sore on her breast. By this time, her liver was failing and she felt awful. The naturopath told Debbie she was feeling bad as a result of this medicine , and to get more sleep. When Debbie became too weak to get out of bed and the imminence of her death was obvious, the naturopath blamed Debbie's turn for the worse on \"giving up.\" I have reported Debbie's mistreatment to state regulatory agencies, and they Westword Page 1of4 Denver Westword More From Voice Nation Join Sign In News fNEWsl I II I.

Brian O'Connell was supposed to stand trial on June 23, facing fourteen criminal counts. Instead, he went to Disney World. That excursion violated the conditions of his bond, and when O'Connell returned to Colorado, he was arrested. His attorney also withdrew from the case because of a conflict of interest, so the naturopath had to find new representation. On Friday, June 29, he stood before District Court Judge Margie Enquist with his new attorney, Malcolm Seawell, asking for another extension in setting the trial date. Begrudgingly, Enquist agreed.

On March 30, 2004, the Wheat Ridge Police Department raided Mountain Area Naturopathic Associates, O'Connell's clinic on Ward Road. The cops had been alerted by doctors at Lutheran Medical Center; they had concerns about several of O'Connell's patients who had been admitted to their facility. Five days before O'Connell's arrest, physicians had treated seventeen-year- old Catherine \"Cat\" Elizabeth Bresina for cardiac arrest. Cat and her family had traveled from Wisconsin to receive medical treatment from O'Conne ll. During one session, he performed photoluminescence -\u00ad drawing blood, exposing it to ultraviolet light and replacing it in the body --and gave the teenager an injection of vitamins C and B12. It was supposed to be a routine preventive-care session, but after the vitamin injection, Cat vomited, gasped for breath and lost consciousness, according to police records. While O'Connell attempted mouth -to-mouth resuscitation, paramedics raced to the scene and delivered Cat to Lutheran Medical Center.

[C, Slideshows 2015 Oscar Best Picture Nominees Do No Harm I Westword According to paramedics, she was in cardiac arrest for at least ten minutes, and doctors initially weren't sure whether she would make a full recovecy. O'Connell explained to them that his patient had had an anxiety attack, but Dr. Joanne Edney was skeptical. She told police that she believed the young woman's sudden problem was caused by an allergic reaction, an air embolism, a blood embolism or a contaminated product --not by an anxiety attack. Doctors at Lutheran were particularly concerned because this wasn't the first patient of O'Connell's to end up in their emergency room. Two days earlier, colon-cancer patient Roy Gallegos died in the hospital hours after O'Connell treated him. And in December 2003, nineteen\u00ad year-old Sean F1anagan died the day after a photoluminescence treatment by O'Connell. When the Wheat Ridge police got to O'Connell's clinic, they charged him with a laundcy list of offenses, including theft, criminal impersonation, seven counts of assault, practicing medicine without a license and submitting a false application or report for controlled substances. F1anagan's parents also sued O'Connell for the wrongful death of their son; they settled out of court in June. (Neither O'Connell nor his attorneys returned numerous calls for comment.) Catherine Bresina, Cat's mother, however, isn't suing the naturopath. She believes mainstream medicine has a vendetta against alternative healing. \"He was a caring person. I really don't want to get him into trouble,\" she says. And therein lies the crux of the issue: Are naturopaths doctors? O'Connell's business card listed him as an \"NMD,\" a doctor of naturopathic medicine. He wore scrubs and a white coat with \"Dr. O'Connell\" embroidered on the breast. He hung an impressive assortment of certificates and diplomas on his walls. From that, a potential patient might assume that O'Connell is a naturopathic physician. Someone who has a pre-med bachelor's degree and attended one of the four accredited graduate programs in the United States. A program in which he would have had an experience similar to that of a traditional medical school, with rigorous coursework; anatomy and cadaver labs; classes in clinical nutrition and botanical medicine, as well as homeopathy, massage, lifestyle counseling and acupuncture; clinical tests; residencies; and the fourteen-test, three-day naturopathic board exams. In states that license and regulate the profession, such naturopathic physicians are licensed primacy-care physicians who can diagnose health problems, prescribe medication, perform minor surgeries and deliver babies. But despite his impressive wall display, O'Connell is not a naturopathic physician. He received his degrees from an unaccredited \"distance learning institution.\" O'Connell's alma mater, Herbal Healer Academy, is run by Mari jah McCain, who in August 2002 was sued by the Arkansas Attorney General for offering \"accredited\" two-week accelerated courses that would qualify participants to practice naturopathic medicine . She has since been ordered to stop offering \"accredited\" degrees. Colorado doesn't license naturopathic doctors, but there is a naturopathic \"regulatocy\" organization: the Colorado Alternative Medical Regulatocy Board. However, that board is \"illegitimate and unlawful ,\" according to the Colorado Department of Regulatocy Agencies. Naturopathic physician Rena Bloom is the president of the Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physicians and has been fighting for Colorado to license her profession for more than a decade; the current application for regulation and licensure was submitted to the Department of Regulatocy Agencies last year, and naturopathic physicians are expecting a reply sometime in November. \"Anyone can use food, herbs and homeopathy,\" she says, \"but not anybody can The Lumineer s, String Cheese Incident, OneRepublic and More at Colorado UP People and Animals of the National Western Stock Show 2015 More Slideshows \u00bb (L)i,A) T ((s)(,\u00b7 (w)\\6))(o) tt\u00b7.

That same day, the Littles took Mitchell to Fen n, who had been treati ng Mr Little for 15 years. Fenn had put two metal cylinders on the baby's legs and attached them to a machine, Mrs Little said.

Mrs Little said Fenn also prescribed drops for the baby. He advised the Littles not to let doctors perform surgery on Mitchell because he was too young, the court heard. The Littles were convinced, and cancelled surgical arrangements. The Crown says Dr Warner had then called Fenn and warned him that the baby could die suddenly and he would be responsible. Barrister Simon Harben, counsel for Fenn, said his client had not discouraged the Littles from arranging surgery for their son in the days before his death. He told the court that after his initial advice, Fenn had softened his stance and did not say \"don't let doctors operate\". \"He was happy, he was open to that. He reinforced to Mr Little that he was doing the right thing.\" Mr Harben asked Mrs Little if \"orthodox medical personnel\" had said anything to give her the impression surgery was urgent and she replied: \"No, I would have taken him that night if I thought it was necessary.\" Mr Harben said that was despite Mrs Little having asked Maitland Hospital pediatrician Keith Howard how much time she had to bond with her son before treatment.

The Sydney of 2 advertise I contact us January 19, 2015 I am a family physician who practices in Minot. I want to share my concerns with you regarding SB 2194, which proposes expanding the scope of naturopaths. I recently had a patient (12 year old boy) whose father was giving him something from the naturopath for his nosebleeds. I want to relay some of the disturbing things that I learned while caring for him. 1. The naturopath was mistreating my patient, giving him an iron supplement for nosebleeds caused by winter-related dryness. She had told his father that the iron supplement would help stop his nosebleeds. Even to those with little to no medical training, it is obvious that iron does not moisturize the nose. 2. Her \"prescriptions \" were for products that could only be purchased from their \"pharmacy. \" Trapping patients in this manner reeks of a scam and is unethical by medical standard s. 3. Her level of incompetence caused me to research her training. Her school was claiming to train people to become \"primary care physicians.\" They noted that their faculty included outstanding physicians. However, of the numerous faculty on staff, only one was a US-trained physician, and she does not even have a medical license to practice in her state. It is very troubling that the school that trained a naturopath already practicing in our state is making false claims about who they are and what they can do. would be extremely concerned if the privileges of naturopathic providers expanded in the state of North Dakota. I believe we owe it to the residents of our state to protect them from medical fraud. Untrained individuals claiming to offer medical care that they are not qualified to provide will jeopardize the well-being of the people of our state. In my situation, thankfully, I discovered what was happening to my patient in time to stop the erroneous treatment given by the naturopath before my patient was harmed. Yet, I'm not sure that we have enough physicians in the state to catch all the errors and fraud that would occur if this bill passes. We need to do what is in the best interest of the health of North Dakotans, and this bill is not that.

Attachment D - Janua ry 12, 2015 RE: SB 219 4 Naturopa thic of writing to Naturopa thic bill. I am a pract icing RN in Fargo. I'd like to share with you why I chose home birth and my experience. My husband and I chose to have home births with both of our daughters under Dr. Molly Ferguson's midwif ery care. Our decision was based on our understand ing of child birth as a natural, normal happ ening in life, not a medical event. In early pregnancy with our first daughter, we had a consultation with Dr. Molly Ferguson and felt home birth would be our best and safest choice for our baby. We desir ed to create our own peaceful, natura l, prayerful atmosphere at home for our baby to be birthed . I had healthy pregna ncies and felt no need to be in a hospital for either of the births of my daughters. Dr. Molly (for both births) and her appre ntice, Katie Murrey (for my second daughter's birth) empower ed me to make wise, happy choi ces that enabled me to have wonderf ul, joyful birthing experiences. They both had in min d my and my baby's best interest. Both births were very positiv e experiences. I had normal progr ession in labor and births with no compli cations. I would recommend Prairie Naturopa thic midwifery to my friends who want a empowering, joyful birthing experience. Thank you, Leah Dear c/# :Z7t.g9 Sinc e 1968, I have worked as a professor and, for 26 years, as a part-time administrator at Minot State University.

Senate Human Services Committee January 19, 2015 '1tf6 St3 2-1CJ;P I /19//,J c};tt: '2'289 Good morning Madam Chair and Members of the Senate Human Service Committee. My name is Kevin Oberland er, R.Ph. I am a board member of the North Dakota Board of Integrative Healthcare. I am here today to state that the board members of the North Dakota Board of Integrative Healthcare have met and discussed Senate Bill 2194. The board's position is neutral. Thank you, Madam Chair and Members of the Senate Human Service Committee for you time . Human Ser vices Commi ttee SB and mem ber s of the Comm ittee. My name is Dr. ---- Shar stetr myse lf. I am concerned pr imar ily with the portion of the bill related to childbir th attendanc e and the practice of midwifery. Natu ropaths are not med ical doc tors or ost eopa thic doc tors, nor are they certified nur se midwives who practice with medical doc tors and osteo path ic doctors. Their schools are not accred ited by the Associ ation of American Medical Col leges, the American Medical Ass ocia tion , on. Those who cla im midwifer y trainin g are not certified by the Americ an Midwifer y Cer tification Boar d, the only one recogn ized by the Nor th Da kota Boar d of Nur sing . Their educ ation and ,_trainin g are not equ ivalent to those phy sicians and certified nurse mid wives who prac tice in Nor th Dak ota . Natu ropaths will not get hos pital privileges so their prac tice will be one of home deliveries. Home del iveries have a high er risk of compl ications and per inatal mor tality (even in countries with highly reg ulated home deliveries such as the Netherlands) and are advised agai nst by the Americ an Col lege of Obs tetricians and Gynec ologists. My concerns are - who will be th eir backup? How wi ll they determine which patien ts to care for and can they recogn ize condit ions which put pregnanc ies at risk? Wh at complications develop dur prola psed the need for oper ativ e delivery, severe lacerati on, retained place nta, inverted uterus, need for neona tal resuscita tion? The se are the sorts of compl icated patie nts that appear at our hospi tals withou t warning after atte mpted home births. The on- call ob-gyn mus t step in at the last minu te with a patien t he or she knows nothing abou t, atte mpt to salvage the situa tion and shoulder the liabi lity. I do no t think the state should appr ove or enc ourage this prac tice.

Subject: Vote NO 582194 National Registry of Naturopathic Practitioners Committee on Human Services -Chairman Dear Honorable Senator Lee, RE: Vote \"NO\" on SB2194 You are being asked to consider 582194, a licensing bill for a small group of Naturopaths. The cost to the citizens of North Dakota for administration of such a board for the exclusive benefit of a few people is restrictive. The state of CA was forced to place the naturopathic board under the osteopath ic board because of the high administrative costs and low turnout of licensees . National Registry of Naturopathic Practitioners is a registration board for all naturopaths practicing natural, non-invasive therapies nationwide . The national board provides a service for the citizens of ND without so much as one cent out of pocket expense. NRNP does not support a distinction between naturopathic doctor and naturopath . NRNP does not support any legislation that would discriminate against any naturopathic practitioners . NRNP welcomes graduates of all schools, and NRNP promotes naturopathy including only natural non-invas ive therapies . When you look at the definition of naturopathy , you realize that naturopathy only includes natural non-invasive therapies, and naturopathy and naturopathic medicine are one in the same. Recently the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health published a booklet entitled \"Expanding Horizons of Health Care -Strategic Plan 2005-2009 listing the definition of naturopathy on page 66. This government declaration only confirms what NRNP promotes. The National Institute of Health defines naturopathy as follows: \"Naturopathy: A whole medical system that originated in Europe in the 19th century. Naturopathy proposes that a healing power in the body establishes , maintains , and restores health. Practitioners work with the patient with a goal of supporting this power, through treatments such as nutrition and lifestyle counseling , dietary supplements , exercise, and others. Also called naturopathic medicine.\" You can order this document by calling toll-free 1-888-644-6226 , fax 1-866-464-3616 or e-mail info@nccam.nih.gov This bill discriminates against the majority of individuals practicing naturopathy in the state of North Dakota and NRNP does not support bill 582194. VOTE NO No worries, I have so many emails in my in box right now I can barely keep any of them straight and I'm guessing you have many more than I do. The accrediting program for Bastyr's Midwifery education is MEAC or Midwifery Education Accreditation Council. Here is the link to their website: http://meacschools.org/member -school-directory / If you need an official statement from Bastyr or MEAC let me know and I can work on obtaining that. We were going to put this in the admin rules but can include it in the law if the committee feels its more appropriate. Duane Houdek and I have been playing phone tag but it sounds like he has a meeting with his chairman Friday to discuss the language. Hopefully we can meet Friday afternoon to find a language that will make everyone comfortable, and we could possibly have an amendment ready by early next week.

Senator Dever is planning to attend. Is there anything specific (procedures to limit or describe) the committee has concerns about? I had a chance to review the letter from the national dermatology association . We aren't trained in skin grafts (most MD's aren't either, according to the ones I asked) and would never consider doing them. While it could maybe be argued as superficial , though that would be stretching the definition, it is not a simple procedure and generally requires anesthesia. We do have a minor office procedures part of our NPLEX exam. We were planning on putting it in the admin rules to require taking and passing that portion but can include that in the law if the committee would feel more comfortable. I've forward your email to Beth Allen since she's the one that has been doing most of the midwifery research. I don't want to answer wrong and have to resend emails.

The first part is what NDAND suggested and the BOM added the second portion, which I left under Duane's name in the document. That's why its a bit out of order. If you'd like a cleaner version, let me know, and we'll get it to you. I just wanted to make sure it was what the BOM had exactly so I just copied and pasted.

SB 2194 ger, NDAND Lobbyist (#164) House Human Services Committee Hearing March 25, 2015 56\\G\\'- / 3/;i_t0)15 Chairman Weisz and Members of the Committee, My name is Elizabeth Allm endinger. I am a doctor of naturopathic medicine, also known as an . ND, from Bismarck. I am regis tered as lobbyist 164 for the North Dakota Associa tion of Naturopat hic Doctors (NDA ND). Sen ate Bill 2194 has been introduc ed on our behalf , and I have been asked to explain the bill. Senate Bill 2194 is a scope expansion bill for ND' s. Our licensing statute was created in 2011. This bill specifi cally pertains to licensed natu ropath ic doctors who have a 4 year undergraduate degree, 4 year graduate naturopath ic medical degree and have passed national board exams. Just to clarify, there are individuals who call themselves naturopaths in other states that do not have this level of education, and they are not eligible for lice nsure in our state . The three ma jor ob jectives of this bill are to add minor office procedures, limited prescription rights and naturo pathic childbir th. Since pharmaceuti cals are part of our training, prescription rights were included in the 2011 licensure bill but were removed by amendment at the request of the NDMA. Minor office procedures and natu ropa thic childb irth - also part of our training -were included in our first 2011 bill draft. We removed them before filing based on discussio ns with legis lators, who felt the timing wasn't right for home birth and to make the bill more strea mlined . Our current bill was amended in the Sena te -the Boa rd of Medical examiners and NDAND worked together to develop language clarifying the definition of minor office procedure s. I will go over more detail of the amendm ent when I review that portion of the bill. The NDAND provided advance copy of our bill to all of the major health care lobbying groups and boards before the session began. Only the medical profession did not work out their concerns with us prior to the legisla tive session. We met with NDMA both before the legis lative session and again last week to discuss the bill. Unfort una tely, we were left with the impression that the NDMA opposed the bill as a whole and would continue to oppose it, even if we changed portions of the bill. At the NDMA request we have drawn up a list of pharmaceutical categories that mig ht go into the formulary, however they have not comm itted to elim inating opposi tion if we agree to amend it directly into the bill. Placing prescriptive categories into law is unusual . Most states and prof essions set formularies by administ rative rules rath er than law due to the development of new drugs and changing standards of pract ice in pharmaceu ticals. We feel the subcomm ittee would be better suited to address this area. Page 1 (Line 20-2 1) 43-58-0 1 is the statute definition section. Subsection 3 amends the homeopa thic preparations definition. The amendment removes language thic prepa rations. Generally homeopa thic prepara tions do not need a prescription, but may in some cases and this allows that right. Homeopathic prepara tions are normally made from natural substances such as herbs and minerals. 1 SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope Elizabeth Allmendinger, NDAND Lobbyist (#164) House Human Services Comm ittee Hearing March 25, 2015 Page 2 Page 3 (Line 23) Creates Subsection 5, a new definition of minor office procedures. Part of this new definition was created with the BOM and is part of the amendment. This definition is meant to refer to clea ning and repair of wounds, including suturing when ingrown toenails, cysts, skin tags, treatment and removal of warts, incision and drainage of boils, as well as removing glass, splinters or other foreign objects from the skin, and trea ting cuts and scrapes. Superficial is the surface or shallow layers of the body. Deeper layers would be considered performing surgery . These are common tasks in family medicine that would be particularly impor tant to an ND scope when working in a rural area or tribal facili ty, or any where a walk-in clinic or ER is not ava ilable. Sutu ring is also a skill necessa ry in naturopathic childbir th. By excluding skin biopsies, the definition clea rly indicates it does not refer to removing a mole to send to pathology to rule out melanoma or other skin cancers. Patient scenarios like that would be referred to a dermat ologist. (Line 17) \" 'Surgical procedure' means structural ly altering the human body by the incision or destructi on of tissu es.\" This is the language the BOM added to insure that surgical procedure was defined and it was clear that minor office procedures do not include surgery , but a limited exception to the surgery prohibition. (Line 24) Is an amendment to 43-5 8-08 (la). It creates an exception to prescribe prescription drugs as defined in subsection 4, which I will review in a mom ent. (Line 27) This amends 43-5 8-08 (le). It creates an exception to perform a minor office procedure. These are the services I just described to you in the definition section. (Line 4) Removes the non-prescriptive limitation in subsection (2) for natural substa nces. Injectab le vitam ins and minerals require a prescription. For example, we currently have to request a prac titioner with prescription rights to order the prescription for a patient needing a Bl2 shot, even though ND's already have been granted the ability to inject in the original licens ure bill. (Line 15) Creates a new Subsection 4 outlining the prescription exception. This ena bles the board to estab lish a prescription drug formulary list that limits which prescription drugs an ND can prescribe. (Line 17) Subsection ( 4a) defines the members of the subcomm ittee of the Boa rd of Integra tive Health Care that will create the formulary of prescription drug s. The 2 SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope Elizabeth Allmendinger, NDAND Lobbyist (#164) House Human Services Committee Hearing March 25, 2015 Page 4 subcomm ittee is limited to board members with specific trai ning in prescription drugs. It will consis t of the pharmacist, the doctor of medicine or osteopat hy, the naturopath and the nurse practi tioner. The other members of the boa rd will not be involved in creati ng the formulary. (Line 20) Subsection (4b) Substa nces Act from being in the formulary , except for specific steroid hormones - primarily testoste rone. (Line 22) Creates a new Subsection 5, enabling the practice of minor office procedures, which I have previously discussed. (Line 23) Creates a new Subsection 6, enabling an ND with specialized training appro ved by the boa rd to practi ce naturo path ic childbirth. (Line 27) Creates a new section 43-58 -11, establishing the specialized criteria necessa ry for ND 's to practice naturo pathic child birth attendance as a specializ ed practi ce. (Line 29) Subsection 1 clarifies that a naturopath may not perform naturopa thic childb irth attendance unless certified by the board to have specialized trai ning, education and testing. Not all ND 's have acquired this trai ning. (Line 1) Subsection 2 mandates that the board adopt additional rules necessa ry to qualify for this specia lty prac tice. Examples of additional rules the board will consider include: accreditation stand ards, clinic al training docum entati on such as the num ber of bir ths atte nded, CPR and neo natal resuscitation certification, informed consent documenta tion, specific prescriptions and procedures permitted for child birth, and other standards the board feels neces sary for practice and oversi ght. subsection (3a) & (3b) esta blishes the following education and testing requirements to practice naturopath ic childb irth. (Line 5) Subsection (3a) -Educa professional midwifery program. The educa tion standard is based on Bastyr Univ ersity 's nationally accredited midwi fery program. Bastyr is loca ted in Washington, which requires a 3-yea r midwife ry program. A copy of the curri culum is included as Attac hment B. The Bastyr program origi nated as a joint certificate program of Bastyr and the Seattle Midwif ery School, specifically for its natu ropa thic studen ts. The Seattle Midwi fery School merged with Bastyr in 2010 and the certificate program is now offered as a Mast er's degree. 3 SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope Elizabeth Allmendinger, NDAND Lobbyist (#164) House Human Services Committee Hearing March 25, 2015 (Line 7) Subsection (3b) -Testing. Passing the North American Regi stry of Midwives (NARM) national board examination. (Line 10) Subsection (3c) makes clea r that the applica nt must meet and maintain all other qualifica tions that will be esta blished by the board through the admini stra tive rules process. I've included attac hments that provide additional information - Attachment A is a list of other state 's ND scope of practice Attachment Bis Bast yr's Mid wifery curriculum Atta chment C is Southwest Colle ge ofNatu ropathic Medicine (SCNM) 's curriculum Attachment D is a list of recent studies showing naturopathic clinic and cost effectiveness If the committee would like to see the prescriptive formul ary list we created, I can provide that either by written copy, or email. Dr. Ferguson, a Minnes ota naturopat hic doctor and midwife is here to spea k on naturo pathic childbirth. Two associa tion members, Dr. Nishek and Dr. Link, are here to more specifically addre ss prescriptions rights and minor office procedures. As you work on this bill in committee, I would be happy to at tend the sessions and will be available to do any research or answer questions. If you don't have any specific questions for me right now, I will tum it over to Dr. Ferguson. 4 \u00b7\u00b7--\u00b7 State Manipulation IV Therapy Pharmaceuticals Acupuncture Childbirth Minor Office Procedure Minor Surgery Primary care Insurance Alaska x x Arizona x x x x x x x california .\u00b7 x x x x x Colorado x ? x x x Connecticut x x DC x x x x Hawaii x x x x x Kansas x x x x Maine x x x x Maryland Minnesota x x x x Montana x x x x x x x x New Hampshire X x x x x x x x North Dakota x Oregon x x x x x x x x Utah x x x x x x x Vermont x x x x x x Washington x x x x x x x _ .. ~\u00b7.\u00b7 , __ grant naturopathic physicians limited\u00b7authority to prescribe prescription drugs.

SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope CPM House Human Services Commi ttee March 25, 2015 # 5\u00b78 a.11'/ 3/J-5/t 5 Good morning Mr. Chairman and Members of the House Human Services Committee. I am Dr. Molly Ferguson, a licensed naturopathic doctor and midwife in Minnesota. I am here to testify for the midwifery portion of the bill. I am current ly practicing at Prairie Naturopathic Doctors in Moorhead with my husband Dr. Todd Ferguson, and Dr. Allison Svobodny. I graduated from Bastyr University in Seattle in 2006 -comple ting both the naturopathic medicine and midwifery programs. My teachers were naturopat hic doctors, MD's, PhD's, nurse midwives, and licensed midwives, and they provided my classroom and clinical training. Part of that training included 100 births prior to licensur e, and another 50 under the supervision of a licensed midwife after I was first licensed. I am trained in the use of IV's, anti-hemor rhagic medications, neonatal resuscitation, antibiotic prophylaxis, suturing , and many other skills of birth care. To maintain my national certification, and MN license to practice, I am required to document peer review , CEU ho urs, and maintain certification in neonatal resusci tation and CPR. I currently attend out of hospital births in both MN and ND, and provide full prenatal and postpartum care at my clinic. I follow a typical recommended visit schedule, and all standard labs and imaging are offered. I also refer out clients who don't qualify as low risk or whose risk status changes during pregnancy. My care involves developing a good working relationship with my clients; I provide families with highly informed and personalized care. My patients are a very diverse group, and have included lawyers, doctors, missio naries, Harley racers, minimal English speakers, single women, and even women who chose to birth in another's home due to their poverty. I think that many families desiring a home birth are looking for this level of care, but are often unable to find it in their area. Naturopat hic doctors trained in childbirth have the knowledge and skills needed to offer this. Out of hospital births are not the norm in the US, and complications can always arise no matter where you choose to give birth; so, research is very important in evaluating out of hospital birth as a viable option when making public policy. The research is clear that for women who are low risk, and receive prenatal, deliver y, and postpartum care from a trained provid er, planned-homebir th outcomes for babies are the same, and mothers receive far less intervention to achieve this. This research is referenced in your packets, and the data is collected from thousands of North American births for over a decade. This is not an interpretation I expect you to take my word on, the American Public Health Association, the World Health Organization, the United Kingdom's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists all recommend mi dwifery care for improved maternal\u00ad fetal health outcomes, and give me confidence, beyond my own experience, in the care I provide.

I am a pract icing RN in Fargo. I'd like to share with you why I chose home birth and my experien ce. My husband and I chose to have home births with both of our daughters under Dr. Molly Ferguson's midwifery care. Our decision was based on our understand ing of child birth as a natur al, normal happ ening in life, not a medical event. In early pregnancy with our first daughter, we had a consultation with Dr. Molly Ferguson and felt home birth would be our best and safest choice for our baby. We desired to create our own peaceful, natur al, prayerful atmosphere at home for our baby to be birt hed. I had healthy pregnanci es and felt no need to be in a hospital for either of the births of my daugh ters. Dr. Molly (for both births) and her apprentice, Katie Murrey (for my second daugh ter's birth) empowered me to make wise, happy choices that enabled me to have wonderful, joy ful birthing experien ces. They both had in mind my and my baby's best interest. Both births were very positive experien ces. I had normal progression in labor and births with no complica tions. I would recommend Prairie Naturopathic midwifery to my friends who want a positive, joyful Scope Bill Lezlie Link, ND House Human Services Committee March 25th, 2015 Good morning Mr. Chairman and Members of the House Human Service Committee. My name is Dr. Lezlie Link. I am a doctor of naturopathic medicine residing and practicing in Bismarck. I am also the chairperson for the North Dakota Board of Integrative Health Care, which regulates the profession of naturopathic medicine. This morning I am speaking on the naturopathic minor office procedures portion of the bill. Dr. Allmendinger has reviewed the definition of minor office procedures and provided you with a copy of the curriculum. Minor office procedures are those as such that can be handled within the workflow of a daily health care office. Such procedures include but are not limited to the removal of an ingrown toenail, an unexpected superficial wound requiring sutures, and the removal of skin tags. A vital element for all health care practitioners working in rural areas is the ability to perform minor office procedures. These services can be limited in rural areas from lack of health care providers, clinics, geographic distance, or what the Bakken Shale Play has given us an abundance of patients in the western part of North Dakota. Naturopathic doctors could alleviate the shor tage of providers within smaller towns and within Indian Health Services. For example, doctors of naturopathic medicine are included as licensed providers within the Indian Health Services program. However, to service North Dakota's American Indian population effectively, it is necessary to be able to provide minor office procedures, prescribe and manage medications, as well as coordinate care with other providers. According to Indian Health Services data, 25% of American Indian women are diagnosed with diabetes; this is twice the non-Hispanic population in the U.S1. Now imagine , I need to attend to a woman and evaluate a diabetic ulcer that's has become infected. In this example, the ulcer isn't able to heal due to her high blood glucose levels. Not only does this patient require medication management, additionally she may require wound debridemen t and antibiotic therapy and she may even require a referral to a specialty wound care clinic. Currently, I can and would gladly make the referral but what happens while we wait for the patient to be evaluated, I have to refer her to another practitioner, i.e. a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or a medical doctor. Another crucial element for all health care practitioners providing minor office procedures is the ability to use injectable anesthetics. Injectable anesth etics provide localized infiltration of anesthesia and block nerve innervation thereby causing a loss of sensation to that area. More importantly to the patient, injectable anesthetics make a procedure more comfortable. Localized anesthetics vary in their time of duration and when considered with other factors are chosen as needed for a procedure. Injectable lidocaine can be used for quick skin tag removal where as marcaine might be chosen for a procedure needing more time such as an ingrown toenail removal. I would NOT provide or perform minor office procedures in my practice, if I 1 The Provider's Guide to Quality Services Commi ttee Mar ch 25th, 2015 couldn't perform the procedures as I've been trained to do with anesthetics. It would violate one of the basic tenets of naturopathic medicine -primum non nocere, first do no harm. I am happy to answer your questions today or provide additional information as you work on this bill in committee work. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Senate Human Service, thank you for your time.

I opened Aur ora Naturopathic Center in Mino t last year . Before movi ng to Arizona in 2006 to pur sue my degree in natur opathic medi cine , I had lived in Nor th Dakota my whole life. Onc e I comp leted my degree in 2010, I was given an opportu nity to join an esta blished practice in Arizo na, so I remai ned there for anoth er four years before deciding to come bac k home. Now, after only 9 months of prac tice in Minot, I can say with full conf idenc e that returning to North Dakota was the best decision I have made for my career and such a blessing on my you ng family. Public response in and around Minot has been over whelmi ngly positive and my practice is gro wing quickly. I'd like to discuss the expansion of the natu ropathic scope to include prescription writing privileges. Arizona is one of 13 states where Naturopathic Doctors do prescribe medications, and I did during my time there as well. You see, part of practicing natur opathic medicine respons natural apies and knowing how and when to use conventio nal treatme nts, when the situation arises. While our licensing law states that we are \"naturo paths ,\" the truth is that we are Doctors of Natur opa thic Medi cine or Naturopa thic Docto rs, and ther e is a significant between a mail There are a number of situatio ns and medical condi tions that require occa sional or consis tent use of rmac is most com mon in schoo l-aged childr en and is easily diagnosed in-offi ce with a swab of the tonsils and throat. This infection can have long term cons equenc es, including hear t problems and arth ritis. The pos sibili ty of experiencing long term conseq uences is essentia lly negated if an tibio tic ther apy is initiated within 48 hours of infect ion. This is why the standar d of care, even as a Naturopathic Doctor , is to use antibiotics. My patie nts are at a disa dva ntage in this situation. If diagnosed in my office, my only option is to refe r them to an urgent or emer genc y care facility, which steals time from our 48-ho ur window and is an unnec essary financ ial burden on the patient. A muc h more com mon situation enc ountered every day in both medical and naturopathic prac tices, is hypothyroid ism. Accord ing to the Amer ican Thyroid Association, one woman in 8 will develop a thyroid condi tion at some poin t in her lifetime and it is estimated that 20 million Amer icans have some form of thyroid disease. My prac tice is 71% female, so I enc oun ter patients on, or in need of, thyroid medic ation frequen tly. It is frustrating for patie nts that NDs have the tools and kno wled ge to diagno se their thyroid disea se, but then have to send them out to be exa mined and tested all over again before receiving the appropr iate trea tmen t. Our patie nts, espec ially those who have come from a state that allows NDs to prescri be and exp ect the same compr ehen sive care her e in North Dakota, are the driving force behind our prese nce her e today.

The current version of our Part II Clinic al Boar d Exam, call ed the NP LEX (Na turopathic Physi cian Licensing Exa mina tion), lists 187 pha rmaceuticals for student review. We are also the only doctoral level heal th professi on with advan ced trainin g in drug/supplemen t interactions. This is important, consid ering a 2012 study pub lished by the Council for Responsible Nutrition indicated that as many as 68% of Amer icans take some type of vitamin , sport nutrition produc t or botanical and man y con sumer s and heal thcar e providers are comp letely unawar e of possi ble interactions with medi cations.

I am writing this letter to discuss Sena te Bill 2194 pertainin g to Natu ropathic scope expansion. As a physician with a cons iste nt ref erral relat ionship with the local Naturopathic Doc tors (ND ) I sup port this bill. One of the reasons I app reciate the referral relatio nship with ND's is their specialized training. They are trained in the standar ds of care of a family practice doctor (MD ) but specialize in com pleme nta ry medicine such as her bal and hom eopathic medicine. MD 's generally have limi ted exposu re to complimen tary med icine unless we pur sue additional trainin g. Since we have limited exposure I consult with ND's on a regular basis to discuss different supplemen ts that my patients are on. I find ND's helpful in deciding if the supp lemen ts will interact with the prescriptions or treatment plans that I have advised. The y usually also help me watch for potential side effects and dosage guidelin es. Also, man y of my patients have questions about complemen tary medicine that ND's can help me appropriatel y answer. I am very famili ar with the traini ng ND's have gone through and am confident in scope of expansion requ ests. In my inter actions with ND's I've found them to be knowledgea ble in both conventional and complemen tary medi cine. Dr. Sara Rein ke, MD , FMP ,f SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope Bill Glen Hyland, MD House Human Services Committee March 25, 2015 df 5 s6 1q tJ 3\"\"'S,-t5 Good morning Mr. Chairma n and Members of the House Human Service Committee. My name is Dr. Glen Hyland, MD. I am a North Dakota native and have been in practice in North Dakota for 39 years. I am an interni st, a board certified radiation oncologist, and am boarded in holistic medicine. Over the last 2.5 years, Dr. Lezlie Link, N.D. and I have worked collabor atively at Integrative Medical Solutions PLLC, here in Bismarck. I have found her to be very knowledgeable in our medical practice about prescribing medication to our patients and discussing the actions and possible side effects with them. I personally have monitored her calling prescriptions to pharmacies and then have authorized those prescr iptions. She knowledgably answers the pharmacist's questions as well as our patient's questions regarding their prescriptions. Dr. Link also knows when to refer patients for subspec ialty advice. Example one: 60 y / o patient with difficult to control hyperten sion. He had hyperten sion diagnosed at age 21. When I asked her what she would do, she responded, \"Check for anatomical causes of hypertension (renal artery stenosis or primary renal disease) .\" No one had previously considered this. Patient has been schedul ed for approp riate studies to rule out a potentially correctible disease. Another example is, minor office procedur es: since 1983 I have been primarily involved with cancer patients prescribing various forms of therapeutic radiation. I had not performed a punch biopsy in 30 years. Dr. Link created a practice forum for me, which guided me in re-learning punch biopsies before performing them on patients. My observation of doctors of naturopathic medicine is not limited to our integrative practice, but also from personal on site clinical observation of the training of naturopathic doctors at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine. I spent several days in classes with naturopathic students while they were instructed in IV nutrition, complimentary and alterna tive therapies, and int egrative cancer care. They were required to know side effect profiles of pharmaceutical chemotherapy drugs, side effects of nutritional and herbal therapies, and interactions of naturopathic and standard therapies. At SCNM, students are taught an integrative approach to thyroid disease. They are taught to diagnose thyroid disorders using stricter guidelines for thyroid ranges and they use hormone replacement and natural therapies for better treatment outcomes. I have personally adopted this treatment approach after my experience working with Dr. Link. This approach improves response to standard hormone only replacement protocols. SB 2194 Naturopathic Scope Bill Glen Hyland, MD House Human Services Commi ttee March 25, 2015 Further, clinics covered by naturopathic students at SCNM prescribed a full range of pharm aceutical medications for common problems. I am happy to answer your questions today or provide additional information as you work on this bill in commit tee work. Mr. Chairman and Members of the House Human Services Commit tee, thank you for you time. _.;' Chair man and membe rs of the comm ittee, my name is Steve lrsfeld. I am a pha rma cist and phar macy ow ner from Dic kinson . I currently sit on the ND state board of phar macy howeve r I am ng . In today's convent ional practice model wher e office visits seem to get shor ter year afte r year, ofte n times patients get treatm ent to help relieve thei r current sym ptoms but not always information on trea ting the under lying cause . By the time the pati ents come to me with , for exa mple, their pain med icati on prescriptions they are often frustr ated and defeat ed. They are looking for someone who will spend the time helping them to find out the ca use of their pain rather than cove ring up the pain . Most time s this takes an in teg rative trea tme nts. ! feel that naturopaths fill a void for patie nts who need this type of care to be hea lthy and don' t feel that the conven tional avenues are helping them . I kno w this from per sonal experience as well. My wife is one of these patients. She was suff ering from increa singly debili tating pain and head aches and was just not getting any relief. It just kep t getting worse to the poin t that her quali ty of life was sever ely suff ering. This was not only hard on our family but also the commun ity that she had no choic e but to pull back from. We sough t help through the reg ular channels but, frankly, it was difficult to get anyone to look at her sym ptoms as a whole and not just treat each one separ ately. It wasn't until with God 's grace we stumb led upon a couple MD s who were also schooled in and belie vers of integ rative medicine and were willing to take the time that was neede d to figure out a very frustra ting puz zle. We started on a new path that involved all of the channels me ntioned above: exer cise, physic specifi c , some which are contr olle d subs tanc e pain killer s). To day she is 80% impr oved and feelin g great. Not only did this change our personal life, it change d the mission of my work. In 2006, I felt a need in the communi ty to help patie nts with their nutritional supp lem ents . We wer e rece iving many que stions their existi ng medic ations . We want ed to our patie nts were taking appr opr iate supple me nts at appr opriate doses and that they did not interact with th eir exis ting med ications. This led me to joining the American Aca demy of Anti- Aging and Func tional Medicine, tion that provides educat ion on fu nctional medicine and the use of nutritional suppl eme nts as a way to address medical conditions. It was at these mee tings that I came in contac t with like-m inded phy sicians, naturopaths, tants, gainin g kno wledge on different ways to help our pati ents. We are conti nually having patient s ask us if we kno w of any integ rative med ical provider s, al lowing na ptive author ity will bring more practitio ners to the state whic h in turn will provide mor e access for patients looking for alternatives to conve ntional treat men t. Some large heal thcare syste ms like the Cleveland Clinic are embr acing integrative medicine by giving it its own depar tment. I belie ve this is a sign of the times. In my practi ce, we are able to provide patients with cus tom compoun ded med ications. Wh en we have patient s with difficult med ication problems, we work closely with the patient and practiti oner to find solu tions. We refe r to this as the triad of care: the patient, practiti oner and phar mac ist wor king together for a com mon goal. I find it odd that we are legally able to fill prescri ptions from naturopa thic doctors from other states a 1000 miles away who we don' t have a working relationship with but not from the practitioner down the street from us. ! am he re to test ify because ! saw first hand that ther e are times when an integ rative appr oach is not only the best way but the only way to solve some hea lth issues. This occu rred prior to naturopa ths bein g recognized in the state of ND. Many times through our jou rney when we were trying to manage the ins and outs of my wife's care we often felt sad for thos e who didn 't have anyone with a medic al ba ckg round to advoc ate for the m--no one was gathering the pieces and managing the care (including the prescr iptions similar to the one s naturopaths will have the abil ity to prescribe if this bill passes) . Unf ortu nately not all patien ts have ist or other heal th profes sional livin g with them to navigate the healt hcar e maze. In my wife's case with this situation a naturopath ic doc tor with prescri bing rights would have been extre mely valuab le. In the next situation that may not be the case at all, but this time it was and we didn't have access to it, and for those times, for those patient s, it should be available. It is obvious tha t conventi onal medicine is the backb one to our nations hea lthcare but not all patients respond to its treatm ents. Having options for patients is some thing the legisla ture realized in the last assem bly by recog nizing naturopa ths as a profession. Giving them the tools nec essary to treat their pati ents only mak es sense. l ask you to co nsider a do pass vote coming out of comm ittee. Lastl y, I would please ask that, before denying them the presc ribing rights as the ir counterparts in conve ntional med icine would like to see , that you ask you rself: Is it really because they are less-quali fied or is it because the y are not as like-minded? Ther e is a big differe nce. -- \u00b71 \\..10 Pr oci tion REGARDING SENATE BILL _-Ji 7 I 15' I am Cheryl Rising, FNP and legislative liaison for the North Dakota Nurse Practitioner Association (NDNPA). NDNPA has reviewed Senate Bill 2194. We were requested to review the proposed bill in Nov. 2014. Suggestions were made to exclude controlled substances such as narcotics. Beth Allen, NDAND Secretary and Legislative Coordinator did communicate they had made those changes and clarified professionals on the board that would be developing the formulary. NDNPA supports this bill.

Our con cer ns focus on patient safety and quali ty medical care. NOM A is in ----. sup por t of licen sure of professions within the scope of thei r trai ning. In 2011, when the naturopa tors sough t opposed the prescrip tion sec tion of the bill and their use of the term phy sician. Onc e those were stricken from the bill, NOM A did no t oppose thei r licensur e. Similar ly, dur ing this legisla tive sessi on, NOM A did not oppose the licensure request of the acu punc turis ts and the radiologic tech nologis ts. However, when professions seek to practice outside of their training, and thus endanger the safety of Nor th Dakota pati ents, NO MA will object. Na turopaths are not traine d adequa tely to prescribe, do minor office proced ures, or practice midwif ery. NOM A has further conc erns that the boar d regulating them in Nor th Dakota does not have the exper tise in the areas of prescri ption, office pr oc edur es, or midwifery to properly regulate and discipline in those areas. Naturopath ic schools do not have the same admi ssion standar ds as medic al sch ools. The y do not req uire the MC AT or similar exa m before admission. The admission rates are quite high for naturopathic sch ools; in fact one accredited naturopathic sch ool has a 100\u00b0/o admission rate. Mor eover, ther e is no 1 requir ement for naturopath ic doc tors to complete residen cies. Medic al students gradua ting from medical sch ool wi shing to practice family medicine have a three year residenc y. Recently, these residenc ies were limi ted to 80 hour s - per week. The training is not compar able. The compar ison of phar mac and phy sician assis tant s is also not correct. I have handed out two documents subm itted by Britt Mar ie Hermes. She is a gradua te of Bas tyr Uni ver sity and pr acticed as a natu ropath in Arizona until 2014. Her subm ittals are quite leng thy -and I enc our age you to read them all in their entirety . However, I wanted to point out a few items in each of th em for your attenti on. First, she poin ts out the lack of clinic al trainin g compar ed to any other trad itiona lly trained heal th practitioner. On page three of her Mar ch 7 letter, Ms. Hermes break s down what the 1, 100 hour s of clin ical trainin g means for naturopathic doc tors. She goes on to break down wha t the actual patien t care rota tions of 778 hour s entails. She specif ically states that her \"clinical trainin g include d of phar macolog ical exper ienc e that it har dly see ms worth mentio ning.\" On page five she goes on to state that \"natur opathic clinical trai ning is no t on-par with medical or osteopath ic doctors and is in fact far less, in terms of qua ntity and quali ty, than nurse practitioner s and phy sician ass ista nts.\" Sec ond, I would lik e to draw your attention to her Mar ch 24 letter, Appen dix A, wh ich sets forth the exact amoun t of phar macology hour s requir ed oners, and sician assi stant programs. As you can see, Naturopa ths receive far mor e trainin g in botanic al, MA respec tfully ues ts a DO NOT PASS on SB 2194. Thank you for your time today. I would be happy to ans wer any que stions.

My nam e is Dr. Brenda Miller and I am here to testify in opposition to Senat e Bill 2194. The areas of concern for me in volve prescri bing and boa rd regulation of this group of doctors. 3/;;lsJ1s I work as a Family Medicine phy sician in Bismar ck currently and was trained as a Physica l Therapis t prior to attendi ng medical scho ol. In my yea rs of experience both as a Physica l Thera pist and now as a physician, I have learned that the area of prescri bing is vast and compl icat ed which is why tradit ional medical schools focus on training physic ians poly- pha training which highligh ts complex medical nts who are on mul tiple pharmac eutical drugs at once. With the incorpor ated care model set in place now with nur ses, phys ician assistants, advanced practice nurses, and other suppor t staf f, all of these profes sionals receive nsive worki ng with compl icated cas es. It can be difficult to partition out just what any of these prac titioner s receive in way of pha rmacology training as it is ingr atiated into every aspect of care thro ughout all of your scho oling, residenc y, and required clinical experi ence. Here are a few areas of red flags that I quickly iden tified when thinking about prescri bing: It is imp ortant to under stand the indications for the use of prescription medications but equall y important to the contr aindications--- when not to use. It is essenti al to be awa re as to how prescriptions work. Of equal importance, when the drugs are finished worki ng, you need to have the understandin g of how the body meta bolizes them in the liver, kidne ys, skin, and the gas troi ntesti nal syste m. If any of the patie nt's pathways are imp aired, you must know what to do or you could cause serious damage to vita l organs. Ofte imaging. A provider is respons ible for kno wing this and how to interpret the subsequent results. Medic ations work differently based on sex, weig ht, body fat, age, and now we know gene tics play a role as wel l. There are man y drugs that will not work or they will work too much in a group of people based on genetic differences. This is now the standar d of care for treati ng peopl e. With years of trainin g, I feel physici ans are adequ ately versed in understanding the importance of prescri bing. Nur se Practitioners and Physi cian Assi stants most ofte n work in concer t with physicians and other health care providers and speci alists, thus prov iding mor e over sight into the work of all the individual players to provide the highest qua lity of care to the patie nts of Nor th Da kota . Second ly, Naturopathic Doctors received licensur e and board over sight in 2011. I currently serve on the Board of Medic al Exa miners, which mon itors physicians and physi cian assi stants in the state. I do not speak for the Board, which has no position on this bill, but I would lik e to relay to you the comprehens ive system that is set up to protect Nor th Dak otans. We analyze the work that phy sicians do, the care they provide to their patients, and their profess ionalism. We review individ ual cases through research, intervi ews, and thor ough exami nation of the individ ual involved and his or her staff. I am concerned that the Board of Integ rative Health, which oversees the work of Nat uropathic l Therapis ts and soon, acupunc turis ts, migh t not provide the level of oversight and follow-up with their doctors, as the Board of Integrative Hea lth is sma ll, is not fully staffed (the position of the Medical Doctor is vacant and has been for seve ral months), and does not have full-time staffi ng to respond to concerns. Ultimately, I am only concerned with ensuring that all Nor th Dakota ns receive the highest quali ty of care with the best set of checks and bala nces in place to emp ower the patient and hold the providers accounta ble. Pleas e consider a Do Not Pass recommenda tion on this bill.

My tetri cian/gyne colog ist in Bismar ck and I am testif ying for myself. I am concerned primar ily with the portion of the bill related to childbirth attendanc e and the prac tice of midwifery. Naturopaths are not medical doctors or osteopath ic doc tors, nor are they certified nur se mid wives who practice with medical doc tors and osteopa thic doc tors. Their schools are the Associ ation of Amer Colleges, the Medical Associ claim midwif ery trainin g are not certif ied by the American Midwifery Cer tification Boar d, the only one recogn ized by the Nor th Dakota Boar d of Nur sing. Their educ ation and training are not equi valent to those phy sicians and certifi ed nurse mid wives who practice in Nor th Dak ota . Naturopa ths will not get hospital privi leges so their practice will be one of home deliveri es. Home deli veri es have a highe r risk of complic ations and peri natal mor tality (even in countries with highly regula ted home deliveries such as the Nether lands) and are advised agains t by the American Col lege of Obs tetri cians and Gynecolog ists. My concerns are - who will be thei r backup? How will they determ ine whic h patients to care for and can they recog nize conditions which put pregnanc ies at risk?

I HOUSE HUM AN SER VICES COMM ITTE E SENATE BILL NO. 2194 Mar ch 25, 2015 Testimony of Duane Houdek North Dakota State Board of Medical Examiners :fl// 5f3 J..11t/ 3/;;_5 /15 Chairman Weisz, members of the House Human Services Committee, my name is Duane Houdek , executive secretary of the North Dakota State Board of Medical Examiners. On behalf of the board, I oppose Senate Bill 2194. When this bill was heard in the Senate, the board took a neutral position, focusing on amendmen ts with regard to the issue of \"minor office procedures\" the board felt necessary to exclude the practice of surgery from the naturopathic practice. We were concerned about the lack of training and education in that area of practice. The areas of midwifery and prescribing, we felt, were best addressed by others more closely tied to those practices. The board's proposed amendme nts about \"minor office procedures\" were adopted. Since then, we have received the letter you now have calling into question aspects of naturopathic training from one who has been through them. Furthermor e, we have learned there are questions about their practice within the public health arena that could encompass the practice of midwifery. It has caused our board to question whether this expansion into office procedures, prescribing and midwifery is appropriate at this time. There appear to be sufficient questions about the training of naturopaths in these areas that, to us, cause concern and warrant opposition to this bill. If the committee feels it is necessary to move in this direction, than, at a minimum, we respectfully suggest this matter be studied first, so that the full extent of naturopathic training for this expansion of scope of practice can be assessed thoroughly, not in the rush of a session, but in the deliberative manner of an interim study. Thank you. I would be glad to try to answer any questions you may have. r -=ff/:2.

Qualifications: American Board of Family Physicians certified, 13 years Fellowship training in graduate medical education, NIPDD Fellowship, American Academy of Family Physicians Program Director of the UND Center for Family Medicine Residency in Bismarck, 10 years Assistant Professor of the UND School of Medicine and Health Sciences in the Dept. of Family and Community Medicine, 13 years Board member and officer of the ND Academy of Family Physicians, 13 years Chairman Weisz and Representatives, Thank you for this opportunity to speak. I stand in opposition to SB 2194. I base this opposition on one major point of the legislation, and on one erroneous argument I have heard given in support of this bill. The major issue of this measure that I feel is unsafe is the provision for prescribing privileges for naturopathic doctors. Medications kill people. Pharmaceuticals have given us increased life expectancy, and improved quality oflife, but they are dangerous tools. Current estimates are that medication errors kill over 100,000 people annually in the United States making it the third leading cause of death. This is in spite of over 15 years of efforts to improve patient safety by people who are expert in the field. As an allopathic medical educator, one of my main duties is to make sure that young doctors have a healthy respect for the medications they are prescribing, and that they are equipped with the knowledge to save their patients from unexpected side effects like drug interactions, severe allergic reactions, cardiac arrest, and psychological reactions. In order to accomplish this allopathic physicians receive extensive training on theoretical and clinical pharmacology. Overall, we receive approximately 8,700 lecture and clinical hours in medical school and another 10,000 hours of training in residency at a minimum. During this time, we receive dedicated lecture in pharmacology for two hours a day, five days a week for a year (500 hours), and clinical applied pharmacology of at least 2,500 hours. Contrast this to naturopathy training time of 4,100 hours overall in naturopathy school and another 1,000 hours if they complete residency*; it is not required to complete a residency in naturopathy to be licensed as a Naturopathic Doctor in North Dakota. For naturopaths, pharmacology lecture training is less than 100 hours, and there is no standard for how much clinical applied pharmacology training is received. So professionals with at least 3,000 hours of training each in prescribing medications kill 100,000 people a year, and this bill would give this power to professionals with, at most, 100 hours of training. This is a significant threat to patient safety. 1 Naturopathic doctors receive extensive training and are expert in areas of compliment ary . ..-.. medicine of which allopathic doctors get little to no training. We do not prescribe these complime ntary therapies, because we do not have adequa te knowledge to do so. By the same token, naturopathic doctors do not have adequate training to safely prescribe most prescription drugs. -- --The erroneous argument that I have heard in support of this bill pertains to the possibil ity of naturop aths being able to provide care on Indian reser vations at Indian Health Service facilities if they gain prescribing privileges. This is not the case. I was chief of staff and acting clinical director at the Standing Rock Service Unit in Fort Yates, ND. During my training and orientation, we were told that the IHS does not hire alternative medicine providers by rule. This federal rule could not be modified when we explored hiring Traditional Indian Healers to serve our patients. Naturopa ths could be hired by tribal-run facilities. There are only two such facilities in ND: the clinics at New Town and Wahpeton. Naturopaths could not work at the hospitals or any affiliated clinics in the Fort Yates, Spirit Lake, or Belcourt service units. Additional ly, I discussed this issue with the head recruiter for the Fort Yates service unit last night. He told me that in his 14 years of doing this job, he has not had even one naturopath contact him with any interest in working in Fort Yates. Thank you for your time and service. I would be happy to answer any questions if you have them. *Source: Council on Naturopathic Medical Educati on standards 2 Edu cation and Training: Family Naturopaths \"Naturopathic Physicians,\" and the like\u00ad receive their education typically through a four-year degree program that confers a Doctorate in Naturopathy (ND) or Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (NMD). Currently, there are four institutions in the United States- Bastyr University, National College of Natural Medicine, Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, and the University of Bridgep ort-accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME), the only accrediting organization recognized by the US Department of Education. Naturopathic medicine schools do not require students to satisfactori ly pass an entrance exam, such as the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) or Graduate Record Examination (GRE). CNME requires the course of study provided at these institutions be at 4, 100 total clock hours in length. This figure includes clinical education clock hours beginning in the third year of naturopathic study. At least 1,200 clinical clock hours are required, 60 percent of which (720) hours must be in direct patient care. Graduates of naturopathic degree programs are not required to undergo post-gr aduate training, like the residenc y required of medical school graduates. Optional 1 year programs are offered by some institutions. The University of Bridgepo rt, for example, offers a program that includes from 535 to 1,035 total hours of direct patient contact and didactic learning. Family Physicians receive their education typically through a four-year degree program at one of the 130 accredited medical schools in the United States. Students must pass the Medical College Admissions Test for entrance into medical school. In 2005, the average score of matriculants was 30.2 of a possible 45. Medical students spend nearly 9,000 hours in lectures, clinical study, lab and direct patient care. The overall training process begins with medical school and continues through residency. During their time in medical school, students take two \"step\" exams, called the Uni ted States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), and must take core clerkships, or periods of clinical instruction. Passing both exams and the clerkships grants students the Medical Doctor (MD) degree, which entitles them to start full clinical training in a residenc y program. Family medicine residenc y programs, which are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), require three years of training. As with other specialties, family medicine residenc y programs have specific requirements with certain number s of hours that must be completed for board certification. They are designed to provide integrated experiences in ambulatory, community and inpatient environments during three years of concentrated study and hands-on training. The first year of residency, called the internship year, is when the final \"step\" of the USMLE (Step 3 exam) is taken. During their three years of training, residents must meet the program requirements for both residency education in family medicine and certification by the American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM). Specific requirements for family medicine residency training vary by program. After three \"program years\" of training are completed and all requirements are met, residents are eligible to take the certification exam by the ABFM. Toward the end of residency, physici ans also apply for licensure from their state medical boards, which determines where they can practice as a board-certifi ed family physician. Although each state is different in their requirements for initial medical licensure, it is a necessity that physicians pass Step 3 of the USMLE. 3 The below tables offer a side-by-side comparison of the education and training involved in becoming a family physician versus the requirements to become a naturopath.

I am the Director of Government Relations for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota (BCBSND). BCBSND believes that the substantial expansion in scope of practice for Naturopaths in this bill falls far short of the rigorous adherence to quality assurance and regulatory oversight which we believe needs to be in place prior to permitting naturopaths the expanded prescribing authority and enhancement of in-office surgical procedures and midwifery which they are seeking in SB 2194. Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota shares the concerns outlined by the ND Medical Association and the ND Hospital Association, including the lack of appropriate regulatory oversight and concerns for patient safety: Naturopaths are not versed in pharmacology, receiving the majority of their training in homeopathy and utilize non-FDA approved substances in their practices; Naturopaths are not regulated by the ND Board of Medical Examiners, raising concerns about oversight and proper regulation; Naturopath education is not equivalent -Naturopaths complete a 4-year program, falling far short of the training hours completed by MD's. Their schools are not accredited by the Association of American Medical Colleges and they are not certified by the American Midwifery Certification Board. For all of these reasons, BCBSND is opposed to SB 2194. I March 25, 2015 Human Services Commit tee Testimony against Senate Bill 2194 Good Morning Chairman Weisz and Commit tee Members, j/L/ s 6 ;;1-. ICfi 3\\'J.-,6 \\ 1. My name is Joan Connell. Today, I provide written testimony against Senate Bill 2194, which would provide naturopaths the ability to expand their scope of practice beyond what they have been trained to do. This testimony is based on my experience and education as a physician, a pharmacist , a medical edu cator, and as a patient advocate. The practice of medicine is based on fundamen tal course work during or after an undergraduate degree that lays the foundation for the academic framework that comprises four years of medical school followed by three to five years of residency. This can be followed by additional years of fellowship. This course work and training is essential to arm physic ians with the necessar y foundational knowledge to understand mechanisms of health and wellness prevention. This specific training is also necess ary to arm us with the ability to understand mechanisms of disease, signs and symptoms associa ted with disease, and appropr iate treatments for such disease. When patients come to see \"the doctor\" this is their expectation-as it should be. The practice of naturop athy, per this bill, is based on support of the patient's self-healing processes. The educational process is comple tely different. Please see the attached items outlining the curriculum for medical school and for naturopat hic school. As a physician, I understand that I have not been trained in the art of naturop athy, and I respect that. While there is some vague wording in Section 2-1-d of this bill that states that a naturopa th cannot adverti se himself to be a \"primary care provid er\", the naturopath's doctoral degree will make it very easy for patients to confuse a doctor of medicine with a doctor of naturopat hy. Furthermore, in this same bill, section 1-7 refers to naturopathy as \"primary health care\". It is unfair and unrealistic to expect patients and their families to navigate these semantics when pursuing healthcare. Interest ingly, when looking up the North Dakota Board of Integrative Health Care Website, one sees a man wearing a white coat with a stethoscope ... what kind of doctor does that image depict? I am concerned regardi ng the level of naturopath's training to support prescriptive authorit y and procedures if this bill becomes law. The wording of this bill with respect to prescriptive authorit y is confusing and potentially open-ended. Section 2-la states that naturopaths will not be able to prescribe prescription drugs with the exception of what is outlined in subsection 4. This subsection allows for potential prescription of class V medications (combination medications that contain codeine and other narcotic substances) and other non-ad dictive prescription drugs that would be found on the naturopathic formular y. I do not wish to prescribe naturopathic medicine, nor do I pretend that I know how to do this. I wish for the same respect from naturopaths. How many procedures should be performed during training to be considered competent? How many should be done in practice to maintain competency? Based on the clinical time expectations in the attached naturop ath's curriculum, I find it impossible that naturopaths would leave training compe tent in the list of procedures described in this bill. In conclusion, physicians and naturopaths are not the same. Our training and experiences are different, setting us up to approach health of a patient in different ways. I ask that you please respect those well-established differences. Voting \"NO\" on SB 2194 will make it easier for patients to clearly access the excellen t care they deserve-whether they seek traditional or naturopathic medicine. -, Underg raduate Require ments for Entry into Medical School Bachelors degree that includes the following courses Course Mini1num Semester Hours Chemi stry (with labor atory) Inor and Organic Biology (with Phy sics labor atory) Psych ology /So ciology Language Arts (Engli sh, Speech, etc.) College Algebr a (or calculus or statis tics) 3 16+1 abs 8 8 8 8 3 6 3 Medical School Year 1 Basic Scienc es -Functional biology of Cell & Tissue s Genes and Chr omosome s Proteins Metabolism; Replicative Behavior Intracellular Com mun ication Architec ture of Cells and Tissues Early Development Basic es -Biology of Organ Syste ms tem Muscu System Clinical Scienc es -Physical Exa mina tion and Hum an Life Cycle Vita Signs Basic Exa mination of Musculosk eletal, Lymphatics, Pedi atric Hum an Developmen t and Ped iatric Exa m Basic Scienc es -Biol ogy of Organ Sys tems GI Tract Liver and Biliary System Exocri ne Pancreas Ren al and Urinar tion -Physic a l mination and Hum an Life Cycle Normal Adult Developmen t Sexu ality Cha lleng ing Patient Interviews Basic Exa mination of the Abdomen Male and Female Geni tourinar y Syste ms Basic Scienc es -Biology of the Nervous Syste m Central Ner vous Sys tem Peripher al Ner al Scienc es -Physic a l Exa mination and Hum an Life Cycle Normal Human Dev elopmen t \\ Aging, and Death and Dying Preve ntativ e Medicine Basic Exa mination of the Neur ological Syste ms lnterprofessional Health Care (IPHC) Course Dur ing Block s 3 and 4, half the clas s will participate in the IPHC experienc e.

I am a family physician practicing in Minot and am presenting information on behalf of myself, with concerns for our community. I am not concerned about competition or hierarchy in my opposition to the expansion of the legal scope of practice for naturopaths in North Dakota. I am concerned that unsafe conditions would be created for the citizens of our state with the adoption of SB 2194. Two provisions of the bill concern me: 1-Broader legal ability to prescribe medications. Since the very definition of naturopathy is to reject prescription medications, it is seemingly obvious that naturopathic training would de\u00ad emphasize pharmacology. Rather than expand the scope of practice in this area for naturopaths, encouraging naturopaths to have collaborative referral relationships with health care providers with extensive training in pharmacology combined with physiology and pathology and their clinical application (physicians, nurse practitioners, physicians assistants) would seem more appropriate. It could be a great advantage for individuals participating in naturopathic care to have their providers working collaboratively and at the top of their scope of practice. I have attached definitions of naturopathy from the American Association ofNaturopathic Physicians and a description of why individuals select naturopathic \u00b7care from the North Dakota Association ofNaturopathic Doctors website. Both indicate an aversion to use of prescription medication. 2-Legalization of naturopathic attendance at childbirth. The only venue in which naturopathic practitioners would be attending childbirth would be in homes. Some of the hospitals in the state grant privileges to physicians and nurse midwives to attend deliveries within the hospital. The privileges are granted based on extensive criteria. It is my belief, based on my familiarity with hospital medical staff function, that it is unlikely that the hospitals would extend privileges for childbirth attendance to naturopathic doctors. Therefore, I conclude that the naturopaths are interested in expanding home births in North Dakota. I believe that our legislature has declined to license lay midwives in the past. Though this issues is about health care practitioners with formalized education and licensure pathways, including this specific language in state law would seem out of fairness to require additional regulation of other health care providers providing home deliveries. Data from a Colorado study of planned home births reports a perinatal death rate at home birth of 16.4 per 1000 births, compared to overall perinatal morality in Colorado of 6.3 per 1000 (from http ://homebirthdeathstatisti c. blogspot.com/2012/07 /no-wonder-colorado-homebirth\u00ad midwives.html ).

BRIEF DEF INITION OF NATUROPA THIC MEDICINE Naturopathic medicine is a distinct primary health car e profe_$sion, emphasizin prevention, treatment and optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and substances which encourage the person's inherent self -healing process, the vis medicatrix naturae. . .;.:, PARAGRAPH DEFINITION OF NATUROPA THIC MEDICINE Naturopathic medicine is a distinct method of primary health care -an art, science, philosophy and practice of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness. Naturopathic physicians seek to restore and maintain optimum health in their patients by emphasizing nature's inherent self-healing process, the vis medicatrix naturae. This is accomplished through education and the rational use of natural therapeutics. SHORT DEFINITION Naturopathic medicine is a distinct system of primary health care-an art, science and practice of preventing, diagnosing and treating conditions of the human mind and body. Naturopathic physicians work with their patients to prevent and treat acute and chronic illness and disease, restore health and establish optimal fitness by supporting the person's inherent self-healing process, the vis medicatrix naturae. This is accomplished through: Prevention Prevention of disease is emphasized through public health measures and hygiene as well as the encouragement and guidanc e of persons to adopt lifestyles which are conducive to optimal health. Diagnosis Diagnosis and evaluation of the individual's state of health are accomplished by integrated modern and traditional, clinical and laboratory diagnostic methods. Treatment and Care Therapeutic methods and substances are used which work in harmony with the person's inherent self -healing process, the vis medicatrix naturae, includin g: dietetics and nutritional substances, botanical medicine, psychotherap y, naturopathic physical medicine including naturopathic manipulative therapy, minor surgery, prescription medications , naturopathic obstetrics (natural childbirth), homeopathy, and acupuncture. ONE PAGE DEFINITION OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE Overview: Naturopathic medicine is a distinct system of primary health care -an art, science, philosophy and practice of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of illness. Naturopathic medicine is distinguished by the principles upon which its practice is based. These principle s are continually reexamined in the light of scientific adv,ances. The techniques of naturopathic medicine include modern and traditional, scientific and empirical methods. The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medical practice: Principles: \u00b7\u00b7--'\" \u00b7'\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7:. The Heal ing Power of Nature (Vis Med ic.atrix Naturae);.Naturopathit medicine which is ordered anc;I intelligent. Naturopathic physiciansact to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. Ide ntify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam): The11aturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than to merely eliminate or supprsssymptbms. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere): Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient: Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the leas t force necessary to diagnose and treat; Avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms; Acknowledge, respect and work with the individual's self-healing process. Doctor as Teacher (Docere): Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic physicians treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encou rage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Prevention: Naturopathic physicians emp hasize the prevention of disease -assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease and making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine is committed to the creation of a healthy world in which humanity may thrive. ....-. ... Practice Naturopathic Methods: Naturopathic medicine is defined by its principle s. Methods and modalities are selected and applied based upon these principles in relationship to the individual needs of each patient. Diagnostic and therapeutic methods are selected from various sources and systems, and will continue to evolve with the progress of knowledge. Naturopathic Practice: Naturopathic practice includes the following diagnostic and therapeutic modalities: nutritional medicine, botanical medicine, naturopathic physical medicine including naturopathic manipula tive therapy, public health measur es and hygiene, counseling , minor surgery, homeopathy, acupuncture, prescription medication, intravenous and injection therapy, naturopathic obstetrics (natural childbir th), and appropriate methods of laboratory and clinical diagnosis. COMPREHEN SIVE DEFINITION OF NATUROPA THIC MEDICINE Overview: Naturopathic medicine is a distinct system of primary health,care -an art, science, philosophy and practice of diagnosis, treatmen t and prevention of illness. Naturopathic medicine is distinguished by the principles which underlie and determine its practice. These principles are based upon the objective observation of the nature of health and disease, and are continu ally reexamined in the light of scientific advanc;es: Methods used are consistent with these principle s and are chosen upon the basis of patient indiyiduality. Ntyr'bpthic ph'yicians are trained as primary health care physicians whose diverse techniques include modern and traditional, scientific'and empirical methods. The following principle s are the foundation for the practice of naturopathic medicine: Principles: The Healin g Power of Nature (Vis Medi catrix Naturae) . The healing power of nature is the inherent self -organizing and healing process of living systems which establishes, maintains and restores health. Naturopathic medicine recognizes this healing process to be ordered and intelligent. It is the naturopathic physician's role to support, facilitate and augment this process by identifying and removing obstacles to health and recover y, and by supporting the creation of a healthy internal and external environment. Iden tify and Treat the Causes (To lle Causam) Illness does not occur without cause. Causes may originate in many areas. Underlying causes of illness and disease must be identified and removed before complete recover y can occur. Sym ptoms can be expressions of the body's attempt to defend itself, to adapt and recover, to heal itself, or may be results of the causes of disease. The naturopathic physician seeks to treat the causes of disease, rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere) Naturopathic physicians follow three precepts to avoid harming the patient: Naturopathic physicians utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful effects, and apply the least possible force or intervention necessary to diagnose illness and restore health. 7 Whenever possible the su ppression of symptoms is avoided as suppression generally interferes with the healing process . Naturopathic physicians respect and work with the vis medicatrix naturae in diagnosis, treatment and counseling, for if this self -healing process is not respected the patient may be harmed. Doctor as Teacher (Docer e) The original meaning of the word \"doctor\" is teacher. A principal objective of naturopathic medicine is to educate the patient and emphasize self-responsibil ity for health. Naturopathic physicians also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person Health and disease result from a complex of physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physic ians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Naturopathic medicine recognizes the harmonious functioning of all aspects of the individual as being essential to health. The multifactorial nature of health and disease requires a personalized and comprehen sive approach to diagnosis and treatment. Naturopathic physicians treat the whole person, taking all of these factors into account. ;: \\ Prevention Naturopathic medical colleges emphasize the study of healt'1 as well as disease. The prevention of disease and the attainment of optimal health in patients are primary objectives of naturopathic medicine. In practice, these objectives are accomplished through education and the promotion ofhealthy ways of living. Naturopathic physicians assess risk factors, heredity,and:5usceptibiliW to disease, and make appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Naturopathic n)edicine asserts that one cannot be healthy in an - unhealthy environment and is committedo the creation ofa world in which humanity may thrive. Practice Naturopathic Methods: Naturopathic medicine is defined primarily by its fundamental principles. Methods and modalities are selected and applied based upon these principle s in relationship to the individual needs of each patient. Diagnostic and therapeu tic methods are selected from various sources and systems and will continue to evolve with the progress of knowledge. Naturopa thic Practice: Naturopa thic practice includes the following diagnostic and treatmen t modalities: utilization of all methods of clinical and laboratory diagnostic testing including diagnostic radiology and other ima ging techniques; nutritional medi cine, dietetics and therapeutic fasting; medicines of mineral, animal and botanical origin; hygiene and public health measures; naturopathic physical medicine including naturopathic manipulative therapies; the use of water, heat, cold, light, electricity, air, earth, electromagne tic and mechanical devices, ultrasound, and therapeutic exercise; homeopathy; psychotherapy and counseli ng; acupuncture, injection surgery; prescription medication; and naturopathic obstetric s (natural childbirth). Adopted at the 1989 /\\nnual Convention Reviewed by AANP HOD, 2000 Reviewed by AANP PPRC 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 Arnemlf\"d by scope expansion March 7, 2015 To the House Human Services Committee of North Dakota: My name is Britt Marie Hermes. In 2011, I graduated from Bastyr University (an \"accredited\" naturopathic medical school) with a doctorate in naturopathic medicine. I passed the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examination (NPLEX) and landed a competitive, one-year re sidency in family medicine and pediatrics at an out-patient clinic in Seattle. When I completed my residency, I remained in naturopathic medical practice as a primary care physician in Arizona until 2014. My mother was raised in Moorhead, MN on a beet farm. She attended Moorhead University and then moved west to California after marrying my father. While I technically grew up in California, I consider both Minnesota and North Dakota to be my second homes. I spent nearly every summer fishing on Cotton Lake in Detroit Lakes and having slumber parties with my cousins on the patio of my grandmother's Fargo apartment. I still have many family members in North Dakota; in fact, the flower girl from my recent wedding lives in Watford City and my favorite aunt still resides in Bismarck. When I learned that naturopaths were attempting to expand their scope of practice in North Dakota to include prescription rights, minor surgery, and midwifery, I knew I needed to contact you immediately and share my story. I watched my colleague, Elizabeth Allmendinger spearhead the political movement to get naturopaths licensed in North Dakota in 2011 from Bastyr's classrooms. I remember the excitement I felt about North Dakota \"gaining licensure.\" With so much of my family still residing in the midwest, the hypothetical possibility of practicing near family was an enticing fantasy. North Dakota passed legislation right before we graduated and I watched El izabeth travel back home to fulfill her dream of practicing naturopathic medicine in her home state, while I went on to fulfill my dream of practicing in a pediatric clinic. Sadly, it did not take much time for my dreams to come crashing down around me. During my brief time in practice as a naturopa th, I witnessed dangerous, illegal, and unethical naturopathic medical practices from licensed naturopath ic doctors who graduated from accredited schools. I had previously believed that only the \"fake\u00ad NDs\" who earned online degrees engaged in menacing medical practices, such as intravenous hydrogen peroxide therapy for the treatment of cancer or chronic disease. In reality, an abundant number of licensed naturopaths from accredited universities use dubious diagnostic methods and unsound therapies. I personally witnessed the illegal importation of cancer therapies for use on terminally ill patients. I found this type of egregious behavior so common wit hin the profession of \"real\" naturopathic doctors that I felt like I had no other choice than to change professions. I have since left the profession to study biomedical research in Germany. Based on my educational and professional experience as an accomplished member of the naturopa thic community, I can say that naturopathic medicine might be a distinct form of something, but it is not any form of primary health care. I am saddene d to report that not only was I misled, but so were hundreds of legislators, thousands of students, and tens of thousands of patients. I do not want to see legislators in North Dakota fooled by false information regarding the education, training, and medical capabilities of naturopaths. The issue of this deceit boils down to the education and clinical training of naturopaths and how the American Association of Naturopath ic Physicians (MNP) and its members manipulate this information for political advancement. The naturopathic profession perpetuates a series of false assertions to justify its progress, which unfold in a closed-loop system that eschews external criticism. Two examples of this dynamic show that naturopaths are the sole regulators of naturopathic medicine. The NPLEX, the naturopathic licensing exams administered by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiner s (NABNE), is written entirely by naturopaths and not made publicly available like the USMLE or COMPLE X-USA for MDs and DOs. The NPLEX continues to be kept secret by NABNE, making it impossible for legislators and health organizations to assess the quality of the licensing examinations and to assess claims that the exams are as rigorous and comprehensive as the USMLE or COMPLE X-USA. The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) is an accrediting agency that approves naturopath ic medicine programs in North America as designated by the U.S. Department of Education. This accreditation does not mean what naturopaths were taught in school or what legislators are told. It actually means that the CNME meets administrative criteria and conducts its own evaluation process of naturopathic programs which it approves. The CNME board members have numerous conflicts of interest with naturopath ic and alternative medicine, in general. The founder of CNME, Joseph Pizzorno ND, is also one of the co-founders of Bastyr University. This historical conflict of interest alone is enough to suggest that CNME and the accredited naturopath ic schools are likely mutually profiting from their relationship. In 2001, the U.S Secretary of State recommended that the U.S. Department of Education not recertify CNME as an accrediting agency for naturopathic medical schools due to CNME's prime role in covering up extensive debt at the accredited Southwest College for Natural Medicine in Tempe, AZ. I suspect that there are many more conflicts of interests and corrupt activity yet to be revealed. Despite the use of the term \"accreditation\" by naturopaths, naturopathic organizations and their universities, this term does not vouch for the quality of the education provided at the institutions. It simply means that certain administrative criteria are in place and that the university is willing to participate in a self\u00ad assessment process. Naturopaths are led to believe that the specific content of their education is \"U.S. Department of Education approved\" and flaunt this fact to lawmakers to help push through licensing laws. In fact, the only thing approved by the U.S. Department of Education is the university's administration management, its mission statement, and its willingness to partake in a self-evaluation. ID Furthermore, the AANP and its member s like to say the the naturopathic medical degree is classified \"on par with medical degrees and doc tor of osteopathic medicine degrees.\" This statement is a lie. Naturopaths love to use education comparison charts to show that they are qualified to practice medicine as a primary care provider, write prescriptions for pharmacologic medications, and perform proced ures like minor surgery or intravenous procedures. I've found several charts comparing naturopathic education to the education of other health care providers. They are all a bit different in how hours are categorized for comparison, which tipped me off that there was some manipulation of the data. To clarify the training of naturopaths for you, I have attached my transcript and a chart of my education hours which shows you exactly what was required for me to earn my naturopathic medical degree. You will be interested in the following points from my transcript and the accompanying spreadsheet detailing the hours I spent in each class and in clinical training. Clinical Training: 1, 100 hours of primary care medicine training in \"direct patient contact\" including 7 48 total clinical training hours on \"patient care rotations\" 44 hours on a counseling rotation 176 hours on physical medicine rotations (chiropractic therapy) 132 hours spent shadowing any kind of health practitioner (ND, MD, DO, DC, LAc, Homeopa th, PT, PA, NP, etc.) 7 48 Hours Patient Care Rotations: A patient care rotation is scheduled in 4 hour shifts, once per week, for an 11-week quarter. One of these four hours is spent discussing patient cases and information on every shift. Three hours are spent in direct patient care, reducing the total numbers of hours spent in clinical training down to 561 hours. Clinical training on patient care shifts encompassed debunked medical theories, pseudoscience, energy medicine like homeopathy, hydrotherapy like colon irrigation, physical medicine like chiropractic adjustments (called naturopathic manipulation in your bill), and yes, some primary care concepts. However, the primary care training is diluted with the sheer amount of experimental medical practices and quackery. My clinical training included such a small amount of pharmacological experience that it hardly seems worth mentioning. I spent far more time learning how to write a prescription for botanical medicine s than how to prescribe appropriate pharmaceutical medications. I specifically befriended a pharmacist at a local pharmacy in Seattle so I could ask questions about drugs, dosages, interactions, and protocols. Of note, there are no naturopathic standards of care. Students and residents at Bastyr University have compiled documen ts explaining the diagnosis and treatments for a variety of diseases, which are available to students and faculty on the university's online portal. A review of these documents reveals a large degree of I I untamed variability that is reflected in naturopathic medicine. For example, the entry on angina includes a variety of treatment options: nutrient therapy with selenium, CoQ10, magnesi um, and niacin; limiting fat intake, removing sucrose, alcohol and caffeine from the diet; botanical medicine doses of ginger, ginkgo biloba, aconite, and bromelain; at home exercises; recommendations to address a type A personal ity; a detoxification diet; colon hydrotherapy; castor oil packs; food allergy elimination; juice fasts; hormone replacement therapy; lifestyle changes; and monitoring of uric acid levels. Of the documents I've reviewed, all fail to mention any standard of care, which for some conditions, at a minimum should include an immediate referral to the emer gency room or medical specialist. I know it sounds cynical, but naturopathic medical care is like picking treatment s out of a magical hat. The theme of not making firm clinical or public health recommen dations rooted in science is apparent in the profession's position papers. Most notably, the MNP position paper on vaccinations does not mention any vaccine schedule specifically nor does the paper recommend an adherence to any standard of care regarding immunizations. The paper instead clearly leaves room open for exemptions and custom inoculation schedules between parents and practitioners \"within the range of options provided by state law.\" Since many states have major loopholes in public health law regarding vaccine exemptions, this statement basically means vaccinate as you like or even not at all. This type of weak public health care policy results in infectious disease outbreaks like the pertussis outbreak in California in 2010. I can imagine that strong public health policies regarding immunization is very important in North Dakota right now given the state's large workplace flux with the energy industry. Course Training: BC 6305 Pharmacology for ND Students: \"pharmacology for the ND student population\" 55 lecture hours in one course No additional pharmacology training provided in other courses Minimal, if any, additional pharmac ology training provided in clinical training hours NM 7 416 Minor Office Procedures: Lecture course that covers suturing techniques, use of anesthesia, performing biopsies, managing wounds, infections, and complications with natural therapies, homeopa thic remedies for wound healing and infections, and insurance billing for these procedures. Technique and skills are practiced on pig feet. 96 lecture hours No required clinical training No clinical competenc y exam req uired for graduation or licensing NM 7 417 Medical Procedures: Lecture course that covers common \"primary care procedures\" such as epi-pen injection, intravenous therapies, heavy metal testing, injections, IV cannulation, safety issues with IV therapy, sinus irrigation, naso\u00ad sympatico, eustachian tube massage, ear lavage, nebulizer use, how to use an oxygen tank and CPR/ first aid 12 --.. 33 hours lecture hours No required clinical training No clinical competency exam required for graduation or licensing This meager class meets the \"16 hours of IV training required\" to be licensed as a naturopathic doctor in the state of Washington. It is my opinion, that naturopathic \"doctors\" or \"physicians\" are not qualified to practice primary care. Yet, I hope that my description of the clinical training provided by Bastyr propels this claim closer to the realm of fact. I find it extremely troubling to have been the victim of so many layers of deceit: from naturopathic medical school promotional material, the education and clinical training, the AANP's political efforts, and information promulgated by my former naturopathic peers, colleagues, and elders. I sincerely hope that I can help shed light on the truth, which is why I decided to start my own blog. In short, naturopathic clinical training is not on-par with medical or osteopathic doctors and is in fact far less, in terms of quantity and quality--also less than nurse practitioners and physician's assistants. Of the hours that Bastyr provided to me and my classmates in purported primary care training (7 48 hours), one quarter of this time was spent in case preview and review. The remaining 75% (561 hours) contained dubious diagnostics and experimental treatments that were so embedded within a pseudo-medical practice that the student clinician loses the ability to assess what is truth and what is make-believe. When homeopathic remedies are presented on the same level as antibiotic treatment, the naturopathic student is lost, and I don't blame them. I think it is quite apparent that the 561 hours of what I calculated to be\"direct patient contact\" in clinical training are nothing of the sort that would instill confidence in anyone that naturopathic education can produce competent primary care physicians. There is no way that such training produces better health care that is affordable or efficacious than what is currently available. Yet, this is exactly the rhetoric fed to federal and state lawmakers about naturopathic medicine, and it is wrong. I recognize that it is a common position of governing bodies to promote freedom of choice. And by that logic, it is easy to license naturopaths, expand their scope of practice, and state that you are allowing citizens to make their own decisions regarding who is providing primary health care to them and their families. However, granting naturopaths an expanded scope of practice that includes prescription rights, minor surgery, and midwifery practices provides the false illusion to North Dakotans that they are choosing between equally qualified health care physicians. I graduated from naturopathic medical school with no midwifery training whatsoever, a meager amount of pharmacology training, and the bare minimum amount of minor surgery training; all of which, by the way, was taught in a lecture format and not in a clinical setting. Any naturopath claiming to be adequately qualified in these areas, without having sought extensive training outside of naturopathic medical school, is simply regurgitating lies from their governing organization. J3 Furthermore, I would never recommend that any of my family members or friends seek naturopa thic medical care for any medical condition, and certainly not for primary care. If naturopaths are going to continue to argue that their scope of practice should reflect their training, then they need to accept that their scope of practice should be severely, severely, severely dialed back or they need to conduct a massive overhaul of their training, as the DOs did in the 1970s. Furthermore, naturopaths are not required to complete residencies (except for those practicing in Utah who need one year of residency), which is where any physician will argue the real practice of medicine is learned over the course of a multiple-year residenc y in a teaching hospital. Realistically, if I were to practice naturopa thic medicine according to my training at Bastyr, I honestly do not even know what I would be qualified to do. Please do not support SB 2194 to expand the scope of practice for naturopa thic \"physicians\" in North Dakota. Please continue to limit the scope of naturopa thic \"physicians\" that is commensurate with their minimal training in primary care medicine. To act otherwise, is to risk the well-being and safety of every North Dakotan.

I'll describe issues of inadequate clinical training and blatant lying about the profession. The consequences of allowing naturopaths to practice independently, prescribe drugs, provide maternity care, or deliver babies will endanger the health of North Dakota ns. I'll reiterate that naturopaths should not: Provide medical care on Native American reservations Prescribe any pharmacologic or scheduled medication Practice as a primary care physician in any capacity Naturopaths are not quali fied to pro vide medical care on reserva tions Students attending accredited naturopathic schools, such as Bastyr University in Seattle, University of Bridgeport in Connecticut, Southwest College for Natural Medicine in Phoenix, and National College for Natural Medicine in Portland acquire substantial student loan debt. Naturopaths graduating from these programs are allowed to borrow federal money to finance their education. Some clever naturopaths have come up with a solution to help receive government assistance to repay part of their federal debts: work with Native populations on reservations and apply for Indian Health Services' student loan repayment support. Allowing licensed naturopaths to work on reservations would be a dangerous mistake. Typically, the patient population on reservations suffer from multiple complex health conditions that require medical management with numerous pharmacological medications and experienced clinical skills. Naturopaths have neither the education or the clinical training that make them capable of managing complex medical diseases and multiple pharmacological medications. This is evidenced by the lack of pharmacology training and the low quality of the clinical training in naturopathic programs. Natur opaths are not qualified to prescribe any drugs I graduated from Bastyr University in 201 1. This is the same year Beth Allmendinger graduated, the naturopathic doctor who spearheaded SB 2194. According to my transcript and the course catalog from our time at Bastyr, we received 55 hours in pharmacology. I included my official transcript with my previous letter. I have now included to this addendum the syllabus to the single pharmacology course Beth and I took for reference to the scope of instruction (Appendix B). Bastyr University has recently undergone curriculum changes which includes a \"system-based\" medical education, yet according to the 2013 Bastyr Course Catalog, current students receive only 27.5 hours in pharmacology. This new course catalog is included with this letter for your reference. I think we can all agree that a mere 27.5 hours of pharmacology trai ning hardly instills any confidence in one's pharmacological competency. NDs do not receive more clinic al or pharmacology training than PAs or NPs I also researched the number of didactic pharmacology hours at Northwest College of Natural Medicine (NCNM) and University of Bridgepo rt, two accredited naturopathy universities. Naturopathic students receive 72 hours in classroom pharmacology training at each university. Even though these numbers appear better than Bastyr's, they are still inadequa te. Physician Assistants receive far more pharmacology training and apply this knowledge in a very active setting working exclusively alongside a Physician (Medical Doctors or Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine). For example, Salus University in Pennsylvania, Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee and University of Utah provide their students with 90, 90, and 120 hours in pharmacology, respectively from which students apply their knowledge in clinical training at hospitals and medical clinics. l Even with this training, though, Physician Assistants must always practice under the supervision of a Physician (MD or DO). Because naturopaths receive less training in pharmacology than Physician Assistants, naturopaths are not capable of practicing independently. When compared to the pharmacology training for Nurse Practitioners, naturopathic programs still fall short. From Nurse Practitioner programs at Long Island University, Vanderbilt University, and Ohio State University, graduates will have received 105, 115, and 101 hours, respectively in pharmacology. Again, like Physician Assistants, Nurse Practitioners are trained in hospitals and medical clinics. Naturopathic programs do not adequately train their graduates to practice at the same level as Physician Assistants or Nurse Practitioners. The quan tity and quality of natu ropath ic clinic al training hour s At Bastyr, Beth Allmendinger and I were each required to receive only 1100 hours of what Bastyr claims as clinical training. Any statement claiming that currently licensed naturopathic doctors were required to receive more than 1100 hours of clinical training from Bastyr University is false. Naturopaths often exaggerate their training. First, naturopathic clinical training hours are not rooted in medical science or evidence-based practice. Most of the training provided at accredited universities encompasses instruction in diagnosing fake diseases, using unproven or disproven laboratory testing methods, and treating real diseases with alternative therapies including homeopathy, hydrotherapy, chiropractic adjustments, dietary supplements, and energy healing. It is worth noting that naturopathic students receive large amounts of training in pseudoscience, such as homeopa thy, botanical medicine, and naturopathic manipulation (the naturopathic version of chiropractic.) As an example, naturopathic students at Bastyr University, National College of Natural Medicine, and University of Bridgeport receive 88 hours, 144 hours, and 144 hours, respectively in homeopathy. This field is an antiquated practice from the 19th century that has been definitively debunked by the scientific community and is consider ed by medical experts to be health fraud. In the attached chart (Appendix A) comparing training between naturopaths, Nurse Practitioners, and Physician Assistants, you will see that a much larger number of pseudoscientific topics are taught than pharmacology in naturopathic programs. Large proportions of naturopa thic training is occupied by learning homeopathy, herbalism, and manipula tions (hydrotherapy, massage, cranio-sacral, and chiropractic adjustment s). Natu ropaths do not use the sa me textbooks as medical doctors A common argument used by naturopathic doctors to prove their education is \"on-par with that of medical doctors\" is a claim that naturopathic courses require the same textbooks as students in medical school. I have not reviewed the course syllabi f or medical schools, so I cannot speak regarding the truthfulness of this argument. However, the similarity of a handful of textbooks cannot demonstrate that naturopathic education is equivalent to medical doctors. I can show that many of the naturopathic clinical science courses require and use textbooks that teach unproven, untested, or discredited medical therapies and theories. Here is a short list from my Bastyr course syllabi: MW 7320 Normal Maternity: o Davis, Elizabeth. Heart and Han ds, A Midwi fe's Guide to Pregnancy and Birth, 4th Editio n (2004). Celestial Arts. o \"This introductory and concise text outlines the basics of normal mat ernity care in a warm and engaging fashion.

Her bal Treatment of Childr en: Western and Ayurvedic Per specti ves. (2005) Elsevier. o Sears, Robert. The Vaccin e Book. (You may recognize this author as the medical physician who popularized the delayed and alternative childhood immunization schedule.) While some medical science was taught, the education at Bastyr is heavily supplemented with pseudoscience and alternative health practices. Non- existent Standards of Care There are no naturopa thic standards of care. One of the most important points I can make is that naturopaths do not have their own clear standards of care nor do they adopt the medical standards of care practiced by the vast majority of Physicians worldwide. One of the parts about my clinical training I consider the most shocking is that naturopathic diagnosis and treatments lacked any semblance of consistenc y or efficacy. For example, students and residents at Bastyr University have compiled documents explaining the naturopath ic diagnosis and treatments for a variety of diseases, which are available to students and faculty on the university's on line portal. A review of these documents reveals a large degree of untamed variability. For example, students and residents use a library of naturopathic treatments for training in the Bastyr Clinics. The entry on angina covers a plethora of treatments (Appendix C): nutrient therapy selenium, limiting fat intake; removing sucrose, alcohol and caffeine from the diet; botanical medicine doses of ginger, ginkgo biloba, aconite, and bromelain; at home exercises; recommendations to address a type A personal ity; a detoxification diet; colon hydrotherapy; castor oil packs; food allergy elimination; juice fasts; hormone replacement therapy; lifestyle changes; and monitoring of uric acid levels. Of the docume nts I've reviewed, all fail to mention any standards of care, which for some conditions, at a minimum should include an immed iate referral to the emergency room or medical special ist. I know it sounds cynical, but naturopathic medical care is like picking treatments out of a magical hat. Standards of care that Physicians follow are formulated by public health agencies and scientific advisory boards. For example, the child hood immunization schedule is set by the Center for Disease and Control and the World Health Organization. Medical doctors follow these recommenda tions because, the scientific consensus is shown to be the best practice, in the best interest of the public, and based on rigorous and ongoing medical research. In contrast, naturopaths often do not follow the CDC childhood immunization schedule for their patients. This has contributed to the outbreaks of commun icable diseases like the measles and Whooping Cough. Given the wide variability of naturopathic belief systems regarding anything in medicine, it is possible that a naturopath who does not advocate for childhood immunizations, or who believes a delayed vaccine schedule is medically appropriate, may endanger the health of North Dakotans. The public health consequenc es of discouraging immunizations are grave. Naturopathic Training with MDs or DOs In naturopathic education and training, student precepting has a broad definition that can mean anything from the student shadowing, assisting in medical (or naturopathic) diagnosis or treatment, or providing administrative/fro nt desk support. These hours may be spent with a medical doctor, osteopath, naturopathic doctor, homeopath, chiropractor, acupuncturist, or anyone else deemed appropriate by one's program. For me, eighty-eight of these 132 hours were required to be spent with a naturopath, and a student was limited to 44 hours of precepting with non-naturopathic providers, including medical doctors. SB 2194 may result in pati ent deaths Naturopathic training is not as naturopaths present. It is riddled with pseudoscience, debunked medical theories, and experimental medical practices. Naturopathic doctors are medical fraudsters. They are falsifying their medical training and subsequently risking the lives of patients they treat. As a result, they are incapable of treating medical diseases and this incompe tency can lead to patient harm and death. I think it is very important to note that naturopaths are nice people and believe they are doing the right thing. From my experience in the profession, I used to believe these ideas too. I can strongly say that these false beliefs originate in the professional organizations and naturopathic schools and are presented to students as the truth. A noticeable effect is that naturopaths have the most difficult time explaining clearly and factually how their training enables them to diagnose and treat diseases with prescription drugs or practice midwifery. The naturopathic profession, organized by the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, perpetuates false claims to meet its political goals. Lawmakers have been told that naturopathic schools are accredited by the US Department of Education, but this is on;y partly true. An independent body run by naturopaths and chiropr actors acts as the agency that is responsible for accrediting naturopathic programs, called the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). The organization that administers the naturopathic licensing exam, North American Naturopathic Board of Examiners (NABNE), is also run solely by alternative health providers . . :':) _,,- _ Lawmakers often look to these organizations in order to make decisions regarding the safety of licensing naturopaths and expanding their scope of practice. Lawmakers also often hear from naturopaths themselves and sometimes their patients. Please be wary of anecdotal evidence from alternative health providers. Prior to what I have shared about my time at Bastyr, naturopathic education remained mysterious to outside observers. It has been often understood as being on-par with MDs or DOs, better than Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners, and of high quality. Dr. Stephen Barrett wrote about naturopathic medicine in November 2013 on his website Quackwatch .com. He ended his article with this historical fact: In 1968, the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) recommended against Medicare coverage of naturopathy. HEWs report concluded: Naturopathic theory and practice are not based on the basic knowledge related to health, disease, and health care which has been widely accepted by the scientific community. Moreover, irrespective of its theory, the scope and quality of naturopathic education do not prepare the practitioner to make an adequate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment. I could not have said it better myself to describe the profession as it is today. Naturopaths claim to have undergone reforms and evolution based on scientific research, but nothing could be further from the truth. The education of naturopathic doctors is just as dismal as it was 47 years ago. Do not allow North Dakotans to be victims of medical fraud. Do not support SB 219 4.

This naturopathic licensure bill would inappropriately authorize naturopaths to prescribe medications in a manner beyond naturopaths' education and training. A close review ofnaturopathic education and training reveals significant shortcomings that should give the North Dakota House of Representatives pause when conferring independent authority on naturopaths to prescribe drugs. Naturopathy- by its very definition as a \"natural modality\" based on the belief that the human body has an innate healing ability -pays almost no attention to pharmacological treatment or education. For example, naturopathic doctoral programs accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education require a mere seven to eleven credit hours of intervention during naturopathic training. Because naturopathic training does not include meaningful pharmaceutical education or provide sufficient experience, by virtue of the accreditation of naturopathic schools and the underlying philosophies of naturopathy, this bill's authorization ofnaturopath prescribing of prescription drugs threatens the health and safety ofNorth Dakota's patients. The AMA thanks you for the opportunity to submit these comments. Based on the above, we urge you to oppose S.B. 2194. Please contact Kristin Schleiter, JD, Senior Legislative Attorney, Advocacy Resource Center, at kristin.schleiter@ama-assn.org or (312) 464-4783, with any questions. Sincerely, James L.

I am writing this letter to discuss Senate Bill 2194 pertaining to Naturopathic scope expan sion. As a physician with a con sistent refe rral relationship with the lo cal Natur opathic Doctors (ND ) I sup por t this bill. One of the reasons I appr eciate the referral relation ship with ND's is their special ized training. They are trained in the standar ds of care of a family practice doctor (MD ) but specialize in com plemen tary medicine such as herbal and homeopathic medicine. MD 's genera lly have limi ted exposur e to complimen tary med icine unless we pur sue addi tiona l training. Sinc e we have limi ted exposure I consult with ND's on a regular basis to discuss different supplemen ts that my patien ts are on. I find ND's help ful in deciding if the supple ments will inte ract with the prescriptions or treatment plans that I have advised . They usua lly also help me watch for potential side effects and dosage guideli nes. Also, man y of rny patients hav e questions about comple men tary medicine that ND's can help me appr opriately answe r. I am very familiar with the training ND's have gone through and am confident in scope of expansion reques ts. In my interactions with ND's I've found them to be knowledge able in both conventi onal and complemen tary medicine. Tha nk you for consideration, 1731 16th St NW Minot, ND 587 03 March, 11, 2015 Dear Member of the Legisla ture : Attachment D I Since 1968, I have worked as a prof essor and, for 26 years, as a part-tlime admini strator at Minot State University. I i I have had various health challenges, including asthma, during my entire life. Dr. Beth Allmendi nger, in I Bismarck, and Dr. Stephanie Nishek, in Minot, have successfully treated me for many of these challenges during the last couple of years. For instance, I no longer need an inher for my asthma. I plan to continue seeing Dr. Nis hek. If she could renew the prescript,on for my thyro id medicine, I'd save the time and money that I now spend on visiting an MD for this renew al. I strongly enco urage you to support grant ing naturopath ic doctors the right to pr escribe medications. Thank you. Sincerely, fl /t/ Harold Nelson Professor, English and Literature _,___ .,-..
