Whilst this area of research is known to be used in assessing the rational use of drugs, including prescribing, less is known about it in the neonatal population. In the UK, a drug utilisation study across neonatal units was conducted in 2009, but several limitations were observed that hinders a true representation of drug use patterns on a national level. Also, this study highlighted future research needs in one of the most challenging areas in neonatal medicine, which is managing patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Ibuprofen is one of the drugs used to manage PDA; howe ver, the rising reports of its adverse effects from observation al studies requires further evaluation on when to use this agent, especially with the emergence of paracetamol as a suggestive alternative. In light of these existing gaps in knowledge, this th esis has been formulated to address a general question of 'Where are we at when it comes to rational prescribing of drugs in one of the most vulnerable populations towards adverse effects from drugs?'. The aim was designed to assess the rational use of dr ugs in neonates at the very first step of the drug use process, which is prescribing. As a result, several questions were answered, and others set for future research. Page | iv Methods An updated literature review was undertaken to provide an overall picture o f neonatal drug utilisation studies across different regions. Then, this was narrowed to the UK setting by a retrospective pharmaco -epidemiological study investigating drug use patterns in England and Wales from 2010 to 2017 using the National Neonatal Res earch Database (NNRD) , a large database from participating neonatal units across the UK . Having identified the drug use patterns and changes on drug use over time from 2010 to 2017, a follow up analysis to investigate the changes in drugs used in PDA was undertaken to explore the current practice in this condition. This was followed by a systematic review and meta -analyses of adverse effects of ibuprofen when used in preterm neonates with PDA to illuminate the safety profile of this popular agent. As a fina l explorative step , investigating the drugs' prescribing contents were looked at across neonatal drug formularies and/or clinical practice guidelines across UK neonatal units . Results The findings of the drug utilisation literature review have shown that drug use patterns are similar globally, especially in Europe, with antibiotics remaining the most frequently prescribed drugs. In the retrospective pharmaco -epidemiological study , 638,843 neonates across 187 neonatal units in England and Wales (from 2010 to 2017) were included in the final analysi s. The number of drugs prescribed per neonate (median (range, IQR)) was 2 (0 -69, 0 -3), with extremely preterm neonates received the highest number of drugs , 17 (0 -69, 12 -25). Across the entire cohort, the most frequently prescribed drug was benzylpenicillin, prescribed to 355,679 (56%) of neonates at least once during their hospital stay, closely followed by gentamicin which was prescribed to 347,713 (54%) o f neonates. Drug Page | v changes over time have also been explored; those with an overall increase in their use over the eight -year period across the entire cohort were sodium, benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, and pulmonary surfactants, whereas those with were cefotaxime, domperidone, 30%) of very and extremely preterm neonates had a record of PDA from 2010 to 2017. The analysis of different PDA treatment modalities has shown th at ibuprofen was prescribed at least once to 27% of neonates with PDA, indomethacin to eight percent, and surgery to six percent, whereas 65% of neonates with PDA have not been recorded with any treatment (indomethacin and/or ibuprofen and/or surgery). A total of 90 studies were included in the systematic review of adverse effects of ibuprofen, with the largest number of neonates (3,831) receiving ibuprofen were recruited within 26 retrospective studies and accounted for h alf of the extracted adverse effect s (2,264/4,700) . Ibuprofen was discontinued in 56 neonates because of GI bleeding and renal toxicity. Inconsistencies in the dosage regimen of drugs with harm potential ( e.g., gentamicin, caffeine) were found in the collected drug formularies . Conclusion Understanding how drugs are prescribed and the pattern of their use over time in any neonatal care setting is important as a primary step towards rational prescribing. This thesis provides a benchmark for referral when prioritising research agendas in neona tes, especially in the UK. However, the resources (such as NNRD) used to assess drug utilisation need to be improved to provide more in -depth understanding of drug use in neonates and to detect any inappropriate/irrational prescribing in this population.

Summary of the caveats for future research emerged fr om this thesis ................................ ................................ ................................ ......... 361 Page | 1 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION In critical care settings such as neonatal care, any inappropriate use of drugs is a great risk, especially to vulnerable neonates at the start of their lives (1). The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that more than 50% of drugs are prescribed, dispensed or sold inappropriately (2). This has driven researchers towards exploring the best ways to rationalise the use of drugs . In response, this thesis aims to address some of the gaps concerning the rational use of drugs in the neonatal population. Rational use of medicines in neonates The WHO denes the rational use of medicines as \"the use of med icines so that individual patients receive medicines that are appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses in accordance with their own individual requirements, for the appropriate period of time, and at the lowest or reasonable cost to both the individua l and the community\" (3). This definition has been cited over the years and used extensively in re search to evaluate the process of drug use within any healthcare system or organisation. Prescribing is the first step in any medication use process . The complexity of prescribing to the neonatal population stems from several factors that include the lack of licensed formulations and limited evidence -based information on dosing and indication of drugs suitable for this population (1). Lack of universally standardised and accepted guidelines on drug prescribing and individualising drug therapy in neonatal care adds a further challenge when prescribing to neonates (4,5). The concept of 'one size fits all' cannot be Page | 2 applied when deciding on dosage considerations in this population. This is due to the rapid changes in neonates' body surface area and weight that necessitates continual dosing alterations (4,5). Another obstacle when prescribing in neonates, particularly in preterm neonates , is the immaturity of their organs, which alters the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) of the drugs and may consequently predi spose them to various adverse drug reactions (5). The potential significant harm from inappropriate prescribing in neonates adds a further twist to the problem. This is emphasised by an observational study that reported a three -fold increase in the potential adverse events that occurred as a result of medication errors in neonatal care sett ings compared to adult settings (6). This study included paediatric inpatients, of which 16% were neonates. Overall, they reported that 79% of the potential adverse events were at the prescribing stage. However, the nature of the potential adverse events, including those that occurred in ne onates, were not stated in the study. Hence, prescribing constitutes a crucial step in the drug use process. It needs to be rational ised, especially in the neonatal population who are at greater risk of harmful effects of th e drugs. Page | 3 Drug utilisation research in neonatal medicine Drug utilisation research (DUR) is a tool that can be used as a benchmark to explore the prescribing patterns in a healthcare system and to assist researchers in prioritising the research agenda for improving practice (7). It is defined as the research into \"the marketing, distribution, presc ription, and use of drugs in a society, with special emphasis on the resulting medical, social and economic consequences\" (8). Since its introduction, several terms were developed to further define the methods and domains used in this area of research, s uch as pharmaco -epidemiology, pharmaco -surveillance and pharmaco -vigilance. Pharmaco -epidemiology is the application of epidemiology to investigate the clinical use of drugs in a particular population. DUR is an essential part of pharmaco -epidemiological s tudies to provide an insight into the pattern of drug use and drug prescribing. DUR uses either a descriptive approach to portray a drug use pattern in a population or an analytical approach to further illuminate drug use by linking these data to morbidity , quality of healthcare , and treatment outcomes (8). Page | 4 1.2.1 Previous reviews of drug utilisation in neonates So far, three systematic reviews have been conducted with an overall aim of providing an insight into drug prescribing patterns in neonates (9-11). However, two of those reviews hav e yielded a small number of studies that investigated drug use in neonatal care units ( 20 studies) (9,10) . The most recent review of the literature in this field was published by Allegaert et al. (11). It provides an updated overview of the characteristics, objectives, methods, and patterns of drug use in hospitalised neonates (11). In this paper, Allegaert et al. updated a previous systematic review search by Rosli et al. and found an increasing number of studies investigating drug utilisation in neonates. This review further extend ed their findings to descriptively include patterns of certain drug classes that are used in neonates, such as opioids, gastro -intestinal (GI) drugs , respiratory stimulants, and anti - epileptics. Despite the availability of these reviews that summarise th e drug utilisation studies across different neonatal care settings, there remain limited comparisons of different prescribing practices between different regions of the world (Table 1). This is pivotal as studies describing drug use in neonates are accumulating , and emerging evidence suggests wide variation in practices across the globe (11). Page | 5 Table 1.

Prematurity is the leading cause of death in children under five years (13). The WHO estimates that 15 million neonates are born prematurely, every year with one million deaths because of complications of preterm b irth (13). In the UK , approximately 60,000 neonates are born prematurely per year (one in every 13 neonates born in the UK) (14). The calculated rate of preterm births in England and Wales was found to be almost constant, ranging from 75 per 1,000 live births in 2014 to 79 per 1,000 live births in 201 8 (Figure 2). Page | 7 Figure 1. Number of live births in England and Wales Source: The Office for National Statistics (ONS) (15) Page | 8 Figure 2. Number of preterm births (< 37 weeks gestation ) in England and Wales Source: The Office for National Statistics (ONS) (16) Page | 9 1.3.1.2 Neonatal mortality from the UK Neonatal mortality rate indicates the number of deaths during the first 28 completed days of life per 1000 live births in a given year or other period (17). The neonatal mortality rate was lowest in England and Wales in 2014, with a rate of 2.5 per 1,000 live births (12). The rate following that year ha s increased reaching 2.8 per 1,000 live births in 2018 (Figure 3). A recent perinatal mortality surveillance report was released by the UK maternal, newborn and infant clinical outcome review programme in October 2019 (18). In 2017, 12.2% of neonatal deaths were due to extreme prematurity classified as a primary cause of dea th. Other reasons are shown in Figure 4.Page | 10 Figure 3.

Causes of neonatal death across UK and crown dependencies in 2017 using the Cause of Death & Associated Conditions (CODAC) classification a. Neonatal deaths according to CODAC classification Page | 12 1.3.1.3 Neonatal care in the UK The National Neonatal Audit Programme (NNAP) in 2019 estimated that one in seven neonates in the UK received neonatal care due to prematurity, low birth weight (LBW) , or need for other specialist treatment (19). Most of these admissions, around 60%, are for those born at full term gestation (20,21) . Across the UK, there are approximate ly 195 neonatal un its with three different levels of service within the Nat ional Health Service (NHS) (22,23) . Each of these levels functions to provide the specialist care that is tailored towards the needs of neonates (24). These levels are categorised according to the complexity of care provided by the British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM) according to 2011 definition into special care unit (SCU - level one), lo cal neonatal unit (LNU -level two), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU -level three) (24). Level one (SCU) of neonata l care provides care for singleton births born at gestational age (GA) > 32 weeks and birth weight (BW) > 1000 g. However, neonates born between 30 -32 weeks can be admitted to this level provided that their BW is > 1000 g and not requiring intensive care. This level is known for its initial and short -term care and involve stabilisation of neonates prior to their transfer to other unit levels (LNU s or NICU s), or caring for neonates in need of special or post-surgical care following their retu rn from those units. Services provided can include neonates requiring phototherapy, having an intravenous (IV) cannula, needing observation or continuous monitoring and those on feeding by nasogastric or jejunal or gastrostomy. Page | 13 Level two (LNU) is a high d ependency unit providing additional services to those provided by SCU s and is dedicated to providing care for singleton births with GA > 27 weeks, multiple births with GA > 28 weeks provided that their BW > 800 g. LNU provides limited intensive care and is responsible for ongoing post -surgical care and care for transferred neonates from other network neonatal units. Also, this level is responsible for stabilising neonates before their NICU transfer. This level includes neonates requiring non - invasive respir atory support, parente ral nutrition (PN) and continuous drug infusions (except prostaglandin and/ or insulin ). Level three (NICU) represents the highest level in terms of neonatal care for neonates who are mostly unwell and unstable. Similarly, this level provides all the services provided by SCUs and LNUs in addition to other complex services. This unit level provides neonatal services for neonates with GA 23 weeks , and any neonate requiring complex or prolonged intensive care. Neonatal units in the UK a re organised as collaborative regional operational delivery networks to provide high quality specialist neonatal care and improve the survival of neonates admitted to neonatal units (25,26) . These networks involve collaboration between tertiary and non -tertiary neonatal units to transfer neonates in need for a high level of care to a tertiary unit vs . step- down transfer for those requiring less level of care to a non -tertiary unit within the same network (27). This was emphasized following the recommendatio n by the department of health to reorganise neonatal services into clinical networks in 2003 (25). Page | 14 1.3.2 Paucity of drug utilisation studies in the UK There are a limited number of drug utilisation studies in the UK, and only two were found across the literature (28,29) . The most recent one was conducted in 2009 . A scoping survey was used as a data collection tool to collect t he results over two week period from 116 neonatal units. This study reported that the most frequently prescribed drugs were gentamicin, followed by benzylpenicillin and vitamin K. This study was limited mainly by the low response rate. Only 42% of units re sponded (n=49) to the survey, limiting the ability to generalise the findings of this study. The second study was also a prospective study, by Conroy et al., aimed to determine the extent of use of unlicensed or off label drugs in a single neonatal unit (29). 1.3.3 Neonatal drug formularies and clinical practice guidelines Quality, which is considered a determinant of irrational practice, is assessed through the comparison of current practices against the local drug formularies and guidelines (7). Drug use across neonatal care un its (including dosing, formulations, and direction) differs widely. This is related to the setting, availability, and accessibility of the drug depending on the country, licensing and off -labelling status, and national and international guidelines (9,10) . This will consequently affect the available prescribing information within any neonatal drug formulary or any clinical practice guidelines. Page | 15 The previous study by Conroy et al. exploring the nature of off label and unlicensed drugs have reported that benzylpenicillin accounted for the highest number of f-label prescription in terms of its dosage (29). Benzylpenicillin prescribed 120 mg/kg/day , followed by 240 mg/kg/day is higher than the license d dose (50 -75 mg/kg/day). This suggests differences in terms of the recommendations of the product licence and the current prescr ibing practice. Interestingly, this study has pointed out the fact that different doses of benzylpenicillin contained within different commonly used neonatal prescribing formularies. However, this study was a single centre study so these findings may not b e generalisable. In the UK, the British National Formulary for Children (BNF -C), published by the British Medical Association and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society , is considered the standard of drug prescribing and dosing guide. It meets the WHO standards for national formularies (28) and widely used in the UK. Neonatal units often have their own local or regional resources in which they use it in conjunction with the BNF -C. No study has explored whether prescribing information in those formularies and other clinical practice guidelines is similar or different to national guidelines . 1.3.4 A dilemma in neonatal complication of prematurity in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth. The ductus arteriosus is a vital blood vessel that connects the aorta and the pulmonary artery to allow blood flow Page | 16 between these arteries du ring fetal life. Normally, the ductus arteriosus closes within a few days after birth as the lungs expand and blood is redirected from the right side of the heart, through the lung, back to the left side of the heart and out to the body (30). In PDA, the ductus arteriosus remains open leading to increased risk of complications such as heart failure and reduced blood flow to vital organs (e.g. kidney and GI tract). It has been estimated that PDA affects approximately 25% of preterm neonates born at GA < 33 weeks (31). In most term neonates ( GA 37 weeks ) PDA closes by 72 hours, whereas it takes longer in preterm neonates (32). Small to moderate PDA tends to close spontaneously, therefore treatment is not required, especially in those born at GA > 28 weeks (33). However, larger PDA may require medical or surgical interventi on as they are also associated with adverse outcomes (33). Several treatment strategies have been investigated in terms of their efficacy and safety in the management of PDA. Treatment strategies can be divided into three main catego ries: conservative, pharmacological and surgical. Conservative treatment includes fluid restriction, ventilator support, and increased positive end expiratory pressure. Several recent studies have shown that non -intervention strategies (i.e. conservative strategy ) were not associated with an increase risk in morbidity and/or mortality (34-37). Conservative strategy has proven its successfulness in neonates with a BW > 1000 g with few risk factors of having PDA (33,38) . Pharmacological treatment is often reserved to preterm with LBW and diagnosed with PDA as persistent PDA in this population is associated with a higher risk of mortality (33). Two non-steroidal Page | 17 anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), indomethacin and ibuprof en, have been approved for PDA closure. This is due to their inhibitory effect on the release of prostaglandins, which play a role in maintaining ductal patency. Both have been associated with similar closure rates but differ in terms of their adverse effect profile (detail in section 1.3.4.1 ). Paracetamol is the most recent drug used in PDA, as it has a similar effect of NSAIDs in decreasing circulatin g prostaglandins but with different mechanism by acting at the peroxidase site of prostaglandin H2 synthetase (33). Paracetamol was found to be most effective when started in preterm neonates during their first week of life (39). Despite its better tolerability when compared to ibuprofen, paracetamol is associated with increased level of hepatic enzymes (38). Surgical ligation strategy can be considered when pharmacological measure s failed to close PDA, often beyond the fourth week of life (40). This strategy is also considered in neonates where PDA results in cardiac, renal or respiratory failure (38). 1.3.4.1 Why is the management of PDA a dilemma? There is a long -standing debate concerning the optimum management of PDA in preterm neonates. The most important questions of 'when' and 'whether' to treat PDA, especially in extremely preterm neonates ( GA < 28 weeks). This question remains unanswered despite more than four decades of investigating the outcomes of different treatment stra tegies (41-44). The use of pharmacological interventions (indomethacin, ibuprofen, and most recently paracetamol) is one of the most extensively researched areas in Page | 18 PDA. However, mu ch uncertainty still exists about the long -term benefits of attempting to close the PDA with these agents. The most recent Cochrane systematic review on the safe and effective use of ibuprofen in PDA was published in February 2020 (45). The systematic review updated previous reviews and supported their conclusion by indicating that ibuprofe n is as effective as indomethacin in PDA closure. The review has also concluded that ibuprofen remains the drug of choice as it was found to be associated with a lower risk of NEC and transient renal insufficiency when compared to indomethacin. Another rec ent Cochrane review published in January 2020 investigated the efficacy and safety of paracetamol when used in PDA (46). This review concluded that paracetamol is as effective as ibuprofen in PDA closure and was associated with lower risk of GI bleeding when compared to ibuprofen. One of the reasons for the lack of clear evidence is the fact that clinical trials have not yet full y addressed the issue of clinically relevant, long term benefits in their research question (47,4 8). A recent review by Bentiz and Bhombal interestingly aimed to focus on long term benefits of NSAIDs in PDA closure. This review conducted a meta - analysis of 51 RCTs (1980 -2016) that used (indomethacin, ibuprofen) and paracetamol in PDA. It con cluded that there was no significant difference in long term outcomes, inc luding neurodevelopmental outcomes, when managing PDA with or without the use of these drugs (48). PDA was flagged as one of the areas in need for further research by clinicians who participated in the Turner et al. survey in 2009 (28). Over a decade has passed and PDA management continues to be debated. Several Page | 19 systematic reviews have investigated the efficacy of pharmacological agents in PDA closure. However, not many have focussed on the problems related to use of these agents in preterm neon ates. 1.3.4.2 Adverse effects of ibuprofen in neonates with PDA To date, there is not enough evidence to suggest that one pharmacological management strategy is superior to another in the management of PDA (49). Therefore, quantifying the risks of adverse effects associated with pharmacological agents may assist neonatologists in their clin ical judgement for se lecting the appropriate management strategy when treating PDA, or indeed in deciding whether to use or not to use pharmacological management. Despite the fact that ibuprofen is the preferred pharmacological agent when compared to indomethacin, there have been several observational studies that have reported adverse effects following its use. Ibuprofen was found to be associated with several reports of pulmonary hypertension (50-52), GI bleeding (53), and acute renal failure (54). Currently, there is no systematic review that provides comprehensive information of all the reported adverse effects associated with ibuprofen use in preterm neonates. Several Cochrane systematic reviews were conducted to derive a useful conclusion on the efficacy and safety of ibuprofen for use as a guidance for neonatologists when managing PDA in preterm neonates. These reviews only included RCTs or quasi -randomised trials. Some were conducted to collate studies where ibuprofen was used for PDA prophylaxis (55-58) trea tment (47,59 -61). Page | 20 Thesis aim and objectives This thesis intends to shed light on some of the topics surrounding drug utilisation in neonates in the UK . The main aim sets out to assess the rational use of drugs in neonatal care units within areas in the UK . Several ob jectives emerged to achieve this aim based on the previous introductory sections which are summarised in Figure 5. Page | 21 Figure 5. Aim and objectives of the presented thesis Page | 22 Outline of subsequent chapters The next chapter is an updated review of neonatal drug utilisation studies and a comparison of the patterns of drug use across different regions. In light of fin dings from this review, drug utilisation patterns across neonatal units in England and Wales using a national database was then investigated in general and the results of this study are reported in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 reports the results of drug utilisation patterns that are used for PDA using the same national database. Chapter 5 reveals the findings of a systematic review and meta -analys es of adverse effects of ibuprofen when used in PDA management. This is followed b y another study presented in Chapter 6, which describes the available prescribing information in the collected neonatal drug formularies and/or clinical practice guidelines from neonatal units in the UK. The findings of each study are discussed within the context of each chapter, but the overall implications for practice and future research are discussed in -depth in Chapter 7. Page | 23 CHAPTER 2 REVIEW OF DRUG UTILISATION STUDIES IN NEONATAL UNITS This work has been published in the International Jo urnal of Environmental Research and Public Health in August 2020, vol.17, issue 16. A copy is attached in 9.1. Introduction Drug utilisation research (DUR ) is needed particularly in neonatal medicine due to sev eral factors that constitute a challenge to prescribers when deciding on the safest medicines for neonates. These challenges include the lack of universally standardised and accepted guidelines o n drug prescribing and individualising drug therapy in n eonatal intensive care units (NICUs) (4,5). Consequently, this can cause a large variation in drug prescribing patterns. Also, the lack of licensed formulations and limited evidence -based information on dosing and indication of drugs suitable for this population is another challenging factor many prescribers may face (1). Scoping literature reviews are important in th is field as there are many studies that reported on medication use in their settings worldwide. A review on drug use patterns will collate all the relevant prescribing information to understand the differences in prescribing patterns, if they exist, betwe en and within different geographic regions. Hence, the aim of this study was to conduct an up-to-date review of the literature to find out the most frequently prescribed drugs across neonatal units worldwide. Page | 24 Methods 2.2.1 Search strategy I constructed the search strategy with the help of the senior librarian at the University of Nottingham (Ms. Ruth Curtis). The search was checked by two people to ensure its robustness. Three databases, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Medline were searched from their inception to July 2020 without any other limits. A combination of both 'free text' and Medical subject headings 'MeSH terms' was applied for each database separately to attain a comprehensive literature search. The search was based on the following PICo (P opulation, Interest/intervention, Context) summarised in Table 2. Table 2. Summary of the PICo used in this review Population (P) Interest or intervention (I) Context (Co) Neonates, infants or newborns (all gestation age groups) Drug use or drug utilisation Neonatal intensive care units Page | 25 2.2.2 Search terms Various free-text keywords were created and used to complement the MesH terms. For the population search terms, an infant* or newborn* or neonate* were used and are defined as those who were born during the first 28 days after birth. For the interest/intervention , free -text keywords, a combination of drug use and drug utili?ation was applied. The term util?ation was used to cover both different spe llings of this term; ut ilisation or u tilization. The free text keywords for the context or setting free in this review were neonatal intensive care unit* and neonatal unit*. This setting was used as the aim of this review was to provide an updated drug utilisation literature review at the level of neonatal intensive care units only. All the previously mentioned free text keywords were used in addition to the MeSH terms identified in each database separately. The full search strategy is detailed in 9.2 Following the retrieval of the records, titles were reviewed to remove any duplicates before starting to screen the abstracts for inclusion. This was done manually (using Microsoft Excel, Version 15 Microsoft Corporation) by myself. Page | 26 2.2.3 Inclusion a nd exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria: Studies of drug utilisation were included in this review if they fulfilled all the following criteria: Included neonates treated in neonatal units Provided information on drug use patterns and/or prescriptions patterns Provided information on the most frequently prescribed drugs. This includes ge neral or overall , frequently prescribed drugs or pharmacologic groups, off -label and or unlicenced drugs, specific pharmacologic groups Exclusion criteria: Studies were excluded for the following reasons: Conference abstracts with insufficient data on drug utilisation Drug utilisation studies not reporting the most frequently prescribed drugs Drug use in ch ildren (age > 28 days) Editorials and review articles Maternal drug use studies Systematic reviews Studies in non -English language that could not be translated Unrelated to the review question Page | 27 2.2.4 Data extraction and analysis All included studies were tabulated (using Microsoft Excel, Version 15 Microsoft Corporation) to summarise the most frequently prescribed drugs reported in those studies. To ensure completeness, data extraction was performed by two reviewers: myself and D r Ojha (Clinical Associate Professor of Neonatology, University of Nottingham and the PhD supervisor). The data extracted included the following: Location of the study Inclusion and exclusion criteria Demographics of the included neonates (number, mean ge station al age (GA) , mean birth weight (BW) , gender) The number of drugs prescribed per neonate Ten most frequently prescribed drugs or pharmacologic groups Quality assessment of the studies was not performed as there is no appropr iate tool for the type of the studies that are included. All studies included in this review were descriptively summarised and presented in tables or figures. Stata SE 16 (64 -bit) software was used to summarise some of the data extracted (sample size and d uration of the studies). Where the standard deviation (SD) of the number of the drugs received per neonate not available, it was imputed from the available summary statistics (mean, median, interquartile range (IQR), range) and sample size using the proces s described by Hozo et al. (62). The correlation between proportion of included preterm neonates and number of drugs per neonate was calculated using the Pearson's correlation coefficient test in Stata. Page | 28 Results 2.3.1 Search results The initial search resulted in 715 titles and abstracts. Duplicates were then removed and titles and abstract screened and 92 studies were selected for full text evaluation . Of these, 15 were excluded and a further seven were added (by searching the refere nce list of other studies). Thus, a total of 84 studies are included in this review (Figure 6). Page | 29 Figure 6. Selection of the studies for inclusion in the review of drug utilisation studies Page | 30 2.3.2 Drug utilisation studies: An overview Eighty -four studies included in this review were classified into four groups (Figure 7). Studies were conducted in 26 different countries across six different continents ( Figure 8). India (n=14) and the United States (n=13) accounted for the largest number of drug utilisation studies. There was one study that involved several European countries (21 participated) (63) and one study conducted in Germany and Brazil (64). Page | 31 Figure 7. Classification of the studies included in this review Page | 32 Figure 8. The geographical location of drug utilisation studies included in this review Page | 33 Table 3 summarises the key demographics of the 84 studies. The studies had a wide range of sample size with a median (IQR) of 220 (113 -1491). This reflects the large variation in the duration of the study period ( range 1-264, IQR 3-18 months). The retrospective studies utilised large databases with routinely collected data and thus included more neonates and data over a longer span of time. For inst ance, the two main large studies were conducted in the United States of America (USA) over nine and five year periods by Clark et al. and Hsieh et al. respectively (65,66) . There were 52 single centre studies out of 84 included studies. Table 3.

However, four studies were excluded from this graph due to their large sample size (high outliers) (65-68). Page | 34 Figure 9. Sample size vs Duration of studies (months) of 69 studies Page | 35 2.3.2.1 Drug utilisation studies investigating drug use in general Sixty studies aimed to investigate drug use in the neonatal population and were conducted between 1983 to 2020. The majority of those studies were prospective in their design (43 studies, 73%) (4,5,28,29,63,69 -106), with the remaining 17 studies (27%) utilising retrospective data extraction (65,66,68,107 -120). The participants' gender was not reported in 20 of the 60 studies. Where reported, most had more boys than girls (37 of 40 studies). Three studies had equal number of boys and girls. More than half of the studies (34 of 60, 57%) reported the proportion of prematurity among the participants ( Figure 10). Two out of the 34 studies enrolled only preterm neonates. In addition one study by Puia -Dumitrescu et al. reported drugs received by neonates born at gestational age (GA) of 22- 24 weeks only (120) .Page | 36 Figure 10. Percentage of preterm neonates among participants in drug ut ilisation studies in neonates Page | 37 All the studies had similar inclusion criteria which was based on including all neonates admitted into the neonatal care units who received at least one drug. However, the exclusion criteria varied. The majority of studies exc luded certain items from their ana lyses such vitamin K, intravenous (IV) fluids, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and fluids to keep the patency of the venous access (e.g. heparin and sodium chloride for flush). The details of inclusion and exclusion for each included study are given in 9.3. Drug use per neonate: 14 studies out of the 60 studies reported the mean ( SD) of the number of drugs prescribed per neonate. Seven studies reported the mean, but provided no information on the SD . The SD for these seven studies were imputed by estimation from the mean, median, range and sample size, where possible (62). However, it is worth noting that this formula has been developed with no assumptions on the distribution of the data. A total of 21 studies with their reported means and reported or impute d standard deviations of the average number of drugs prescribed per neonate in each study and divided by each continent are plotted in Figure 11.Page | 38 One study by Du et al. is plotted twice (Du -A, and Du -B) as it compared drug use in two different periods and reported different sample sizes and means (109) . The pooled mean and the pooled SD from 29 studies out of 6 0 studies on drug use in general included in this review were 4 (2.4). Those 29 studies include 14 studies that reported the mean (SD) and 15 studies with imputed values of either mean and or SD based on the formula. The remaining 39 studies were not incl uded in this plot for the following reasons: 15 studies reported the median instead of the mean . The medians reported in those studies ranged between 3.5 and 9 One study by Aranda et al. did not report the sample size (107) 17 studies reported neither the mean nor the median Six studies reported the mean only without reporting the ran ge. Therefore, the standard deviation could not be estimated using the formula (4,5,72,76,79,117) . The means reported in those studies ranged between 1.2 and 11.1 There were 27 studies reporting the maximum number of drugs received by at least one neonate. Kumar et al. reported the highest drug burden with at least one neonate recei ving 62 drugs (115) , while eight other studies repor ted that the maximum number of drugs per neonate was > 30 in their population.Page | 39 Figure 11. The number of unique drugs prescribed per neonate Page | 40 2.3.2.1.1 Most frequently prescribed drugs Among the studies that reported drug use in general, 48 of 60 studies reported the most frequently prescribed drugs. Thirty studies out of the 60 reported the most frequently prescribed pharmacologic groups instead of individual drugs, 20 studies reported most frequently prescri bed off -label and/or unlicensed drugs, and eight studies reported most frequently prescribed antibiotics. All the 48 studies that reported most frequently prescribed drugs have reported at least one antibiotic agent among the ten most frequently prescribe d drugs across NICU admissions (Figure 12). Penicillins and gentamicin were among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs in the majority of studies; 4 1 and 34 studies, respectively. Most studies had either penicillin or gentamicin as the most frequently reported antibiotics in their list except for six studies. Of these, two reported antibiotics (without specifying which antibiotic ) (5,78) and the other four cefoperazone -sulbactam and amongst their most frequently prescribed drugs (88,104,106,10 9). Caffeine was among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs cited by 25 studies. There were 21 studies report ing a drug from other therapeutic class as its most frequently used. These were calcium gluconate (two studies (70,107) ), multivitamins (three studies (63,75,96) ), vitamin K (seven studies Page | 41 (4,81,97,101,106,111,121) ) caffeine (two studies (80,88 )), chlorhexidine powder (one study (89)), theophylline (one study (122) ), epinephrine (one study (102) ), parenteral nutrition (one study (116) ), cholecalciferol (one study (123) ), fentanyl (one study (124) ) and vitamin D (one study (68)). Of the two studies that reported caffeine as the first mo st frequently prescribed drug, 86.8% of included neonates in Cuzzolin et al. were preterm (80) while Jong et al. did not report the preterm proportion in their cohort (88). The following sections detail the most frequently prescribed drugs in each geograph ic region. The overall summary of the most f requently prescribed drugs per each geographic region is outlined in Table 4. Page | 42 Figure 12. Twenty most frequently prescribed drugs in neonatal units reported by 48 studies (*include: benzylpenicillin/penicillin/ampicillin/amoxicillin/piperacillin) Page | 43 Table 4.

Appendix 9.4 details the ten most frequently prescribed drugs reported by each of those 24 studies. However, some studies have reported less than ten most frequently prescribed drugs; a study by Alonso et al. reported only four frequently prescribed drugs (70). One study by Girardi et al. compared the frequently prescribed drugs in two different groups of neonates categorised according to their body weights, and therefore it was plotted and reported twice (70). Also, another study by Lass et al. have reported the most frequently prescribed drugs in term and preterm neonates and therefore the results were plotted twice for both groups in this review (92). However, if the same dr ug was reported in the two groups, it was counted once. The most frequently prescribed drug in Europe was found to be caffeine or caffeine citrate (18 studies ), followed by gentamicin (17 studies) and ampicillin (12 studies). Two s tudies were conducted in the UK and both of them reported gentamicin to be the most frequently prescribed drug in neonates followed by benzylpenicillin (28,29) . Page | 45 2.3.2.1.1.2 Frequently prescribed drugs in North America Ten studies in Nort h America have reported the most frequently prescribed drugs in their NICUs whereas two studies reported the most frequently prescribed pharmacologic class instead of drugs (detailed in 9.5). There were two studies that compared drug use in two different periods and hence the drugs in those studies were counted twice (107,109) . The most frequently reported prescribed drugs in North America were ampicillin and gentamicin, which were reported by nine and eight studies respectively. Aranda et al. (107) reported it in both periods which are included in their study. This was followed by furosemide and surfactants, which were reported by six studies, with also Aranda et al. reporting it twice. A study by Du et al. reported surfactants twice in both periods of the study among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs. 2.3.2.1.1.3 Frequently prescribed drugs in Asia Six studies from Asia described the most frequently prescribed drugs whereas five studies reported the most frequently prescribed pharmacologic class instead of drugs (detailed in 9.6). Two studies reported antibiotics without specifying the individual drugs as frequently prescribed drugs . These antibiotics are detailed in section 2.3.3.1.3 . Phenobarbitone and vitamin K were reported by most of the studies , five and four studies respectively , followed by amikacin, which was reported by three studies. Choure et al. have reported 'others' as most frequently prescribed drugs without any information on what drugs were included in this category (78) . Page | 46 2.3.2.1.1.4 Frequently prescribed drugs in Latin America and Caribbean Four studies from this region reported the m ost frequently prescribed drugs whereas two studies reported the most frequently prescribed pharmacologic class instead of drugs (detai led in 9.7). Marino et al. compared the drug use in four different groups of neonates characterised according to their BW (117) . Fentanyl was the most frequently prescribed drug in Latin America and the Caribbean as reported by all of the studies. This was followed by gentamicin, vancomycin, and multivitamins, which were reported by three studies as amongst the ten most frequently prescribed drugs. 2.3.2.1.1.5 Frequently prescribed drugs in the Middle East Only two out of the 56 studies were conducted in the Middle East (both in Israel) and they reported the most frequen tly prescribed drugs in their NICUs (73,97) . Gentamicin, a mpicillin , amoxicillin and vitamins were among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs reported by both studies. 2.3.2.1.1.6 Frequently prescribed drugs in Australasia Only two studies were conducted in this continent that reported the most frequently prescribed drugs (80,98) . Vancomycin and gentamicin were among the most frequently prescribed drugs in both studies. Page | 47 2.3.2.1.2 Most frequently prescribed pharmacologic groups As described earlier, 30 studies out of the 60 included studies reported the frequently prescribed pharmacologic groups in their NICUs using different methods in their c lassification . Most used the World Health Organisation - Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical ( WHO -ATC) classification system (19 of 30 studies, 63%). Four studies listed the pharmacologic class of the drugs. One study by Kumar et al. has classified the pharmacol ogic groups based on the most frequent indication and the physiologic effects of the drug (115) . The remaining six studies have not stated their classification method. Among the studies that used the WHO -ATC system, anti-microbials for systemic use were the most frequently prescribe d pharmacologic group in the majority (14 studies, 81%) , followed by agents for gastro -intestinal (GI) and metabolism (four studies) , and agents for the central nervous system (one study). Among the four studies that listed the pharmacological groups accor ding to their pharmacologic class, three studies reported that antimicrobials were the most frequently prescribed group and one study by Ashwin et al. identified that penicillins were the most frequently prescribed pharmacologic group. A study by Kumar et al. reported that the GI agents were the most frequently prescribed pharmacologic group (115) . Page | 48 2.3.3 Drug utilisation studies investigating antibiotics only Characteristics of the studies: 11 studies aimed to evaluate antibiotic use only in their neonatal units (64,125 -134). The studies varied in their design between prospective (seven studies) (125,126,128,130,131,133,134) , retrospective (two studies) (64,129) , and two studies used both prospective and retrospective study design (127,132) . Enrolled neonates ranged between 84 to 5,619. The inclusio n and exclusion criteria of those studies are detailed in 9.8. 2.3.3.1 Most frequently prescribed antibiotics Seven of the 11 studies reported on the most fre quently prescribed antibiotics. In addition, several antibiotics appeared in the list of the most frequently prescribed drugs that did not focus on antibiotics only. In total, 59 studies reported the most frequently prescribed antibiotics used in their NICUs and their data are presented per each continent . 2.3.3.1.1 Most frequently prescribed antibiotics in Europe Twenty -three studies in Europe have cited antibiotics among their most frequently prescribed drugs. Each study reported more than one antibiotic, and hence they are all counted accordingly. The most frequently prescribed antibiotics in Europe are gentamicin (17 studies) followed by ampicillin (12 studies) ( Figure 13).Page | 49 Figure 13. Most frequently prescribed antibiotics in Europe (cited as one of the 10 most frequently prescribed drug in those studies) Page | 50 2.3.3.1.2 Most frequently prescribed antibiotics in North America Twelve studies in North America reported the most frequently prescribed antibiotics in their settings. Two studies by Aranda et al. and Du et al. have investigated drug use pattern in two different periods and reported the same antibiotics in both periods ( Figure 14). Page | 51 Figure 14. Most frequently prescribed antibiotics in North America (cited as one of the 10 most frequently prescribed drug in those studies ; *cited twice by the same study in two different periods) Page | 52 2.3.3.1.3 Most frequently prescribed antibiotics in Asia Eleven studies in Asia reported the most frequently prescribed antibiotics. One study out of those 11 have reported the most frequently prescribed antibiotics i n the participating units by their broad pharmacological groups instead of individual names of the antibiotics. This study was conducted in two units at two different hospitals and reported that aminoglycosides were among the most frequently prescribed ant ibiotics in both units (130) . Amikacin was reported b y most of the studies ( nine studies) followed by cefotaxime ( eight studies) and gentamicin ( six studies) (Figure 15). The single study from China (106) reported the use of cefoperazone -sulbactam , and piperacillin -tazobactam as the most frequently used for all gestational age groups. Page | 53 Figure 15. Most frequently prescribed antibiotics in Asia (cited as one of the 10 most frequently prescribed drug in those studies) Page | 54 2.3.3.1.4 Most frequently prescribed antibiotics in Latin America and Caribbean Seven studies in this continent reported the most frequently prescribed antibiotics. The data from the study conducted by Marino et al. is counted once in this review if the same drug was reported more than once. The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were gentamicin, ampicillin and vancomycin (all reported by four studies) ( Figure 16).Page | 55 Figure 16. Most frequently prescribed antibiotics in Latin America and Caribbean (cited as one of the 10 most frequently prescribed drug in those studies) Page | 56 2.3.3.1.5 Most frequently prescri bed antibiotics in other regions The Middle East: Two studies conducted in Israel reported antibiotics among their frequently prescribed drugs in their NICUs (73,97) . Both studies cited gentamicin, ampicillin , and a moxicillin among the ten frequently prescribed drugs. The recent study by Nir -Neuman et al. (97) has reported meropenem in addition to the previously mentioned antibiotics. Australasia: Two studies i n Australasia reported the most frequently prescribed antibiotics and have included gentamicin, vancomycin, ampicillin and benzy lpenicillin in both lists Africa: One study Zim babwe by Chimhini et al. reported gentamicin, amoxicillin and ceftriaxone as the top three most frequently prescribed antibiotics (132) . Page | 57 2.3.4 Drug utilisation studies investigating off -label and or unlicensed drugs only Characteristics of the studies: Six studies aimed to evaluate only off -label and/or unlicensed drugs use across NICUs (135-140) (detail ed in 9.9). Three studies were retrospective (136,138,139) , and three were prospective (135,137,140) . Number of included neonates ranged from 38 to 910. The percentage of preterm neonates was 53.9% in one study by Kouti et al. (136) , whereas three studies reported more term neonates in the included population (137,139,140) . The remaining two studies have not stated the percentage of neonatal prematurity in their included population (135,138) . Most frequently prescribed off -label and /or unlicensed drugs: 20 studies that assessed drug utilisation , in gen eral, have reported also most frequently prescribed off -label and/or unlice nsed drugs. In total, the number of studies reporting most frequently prescribed off -label and or unlicensed drugs in this review is 26 studies. The studies varied between listing most frequently prescribed off label drugs only or most frequently prescribe d both off -label and unlicensed (Table 5). Most of the studies (17 studies , 65%) have listed both the most frequently prescribed off label and /or unlicensed drugs. Page | 58 Table 5. Studies reporting the most frequent unlicensed and/or off -label drugs Category Studies n % References Frequently prescribed off - label drugs only 9 35 (69,77,80,87,111 ,1 35,135,137,138) Both frequently prescribed off-label and or unlicensed drugs 17 65 (29,70,82,83,87 - 89,91,92,96 - 98,101,103,136,13 9,140) Some st udies have not distinguished whether the most frequently prescribed drugs were off -label or unlicensed . Therefore, the results presented here are extracted from studies that clearly reported the most frequently prescribed off-label or unlicensed drugs. Table 6 and Table 7 summarise the most frequently pr escribed off -label and unlicensed drugs, respectively. Page | 59 Table 6.

Three studies evaluated the use of sedatives, analgesics and narcotics in their NICUs (67,141,142) . One prospective study evaluated the use of anti -epileptics (143) , and one study (published as a conference abstract) evaluated the u se of cardiovascular agents (144) . One study have evaluated the drugs used in neonates diagnosed wi th Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (145) . One study have evaluated the use of only IV drugs in neonates (146) . 2.3.5.2 Analgesics and sedatives Three studies investigated the use of analgesics and sedatives in the neonatal population and reported that fentanyl, morphine, midazolam and paracetamol were among the five prescribed analgesics and sedatives (67,141,142) . 2.3.5.3 Anti-convulsants A study by Ahmad et al. evaluated the changing pattern of anti -convulsants over time, from 200 5 to 2014, in 341 NICUs (9,134 neonates) in the USA (143) . This retrospective study found that phenobarbital was the most frequently prescribed drug from 2005 to 2014 (96.3% - 99.4%). This was followed by phenytoin (11.6% - 13.8 %) from 2005 to 2012, and levetiracetam (14.3%) was prescribed more than phenytoin (11%) from 2013 to 2014. Page | 63 2.3.5.4 Cardiovascular agents A study by Hallik et al. evaluated the use of cardiovascular agents across 89 different European NI CUs and reported that inotropes (dopamine followed by dobutamine and adrenaline), diuretics and indomethacin/ibuprofen were the most frequently prescribed cardiovascular agents (144) . 2.3.5.5 Drugs used in Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) A retrospective study by Bamat et al. that involved multicentre (43 NICUs, 3252 neonates) in the United States aimed to expl ore the most frequently used drugs among neonates with symptomatic BPD. This study reported sodium chloride followed by furosemide and potassium chloride as the top three drugs used in BPD (145) . 2.3.5.6 Intravenous drugs A prospective survey b y De Basagoiti et al. conducted over one month in nine Spanish NICUs with an aim of exploring the most frequently prescribed IV drugs (146) . This study reported the most frequently used IV drugs by their pharmacological class and found that anti -infectives f ollowed by cardiovascular drugs and drugs used in central nervous system were the most frequently prescribed IV drugs. Page | 64 2.3.5.7 Drug utilisation in high - and middle -income regions This s ection compares the use of analgesics, anti-convulsants , and surfactants use between high- and middle -income regions. Use of analgesia: 27 studies in this review cited one or more analgesics among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs in their NICUs ( Figure 17) (29,66 -69,74,76,78,80,89,98,101,102,108 - 111,113,115,117,118,120,124,141,142,147,148) . In high income regions (Europ e, North America, Middle east, Australasia), the most frequently prescribed analgesic was fentanyl, followed by morphine and paracetamol. In middle income regions (Asia, Latin America), the most frequently prescribed drug was fentanyl, followed by paraceta mol. Use of anti -epileptics: 11 studies (4,5,69,76,78,104,108,117,124) reported the use of one or more anti -epileptic agents among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs in their NICUs ( Figure 18). In both high - and middle -income regions, phenobarbital was the most frequently prescribed anti-convulsant . Page | 65 Figure 17. Most frequently prescribed analgesics in a. high income regions b. middle income regions (cited as one of the 10 most frequently prescribed drug in those studies) Page | 66 Figure 18. Most frequently prescribed anti -convulsants in a. high income regions b. middle income region (cited as one of the 10 most frequently prescribed drug in those studies) Page | 67 Use of surfactants: 12 studies (65,66,91,93,95,109 -111,113,113,119,120) in high income regions reported different types of surfactants among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs in their NICUs ( Figure 19). However, only one study, Marino et al. (117) , conducted in Brazil reported pulmonary surfactants as one of th eir ten most frequently prescribed drugs. This study has reported pulmonary surfactants in four different groups of neonates divided according to their BW and surfactants were reported as the most frequently prescribed drugs in neonates with BW < 2500 g. Page | 68 Figure 19. Use of surfactants in high income region (cited as one of the 10 most frequently prescribed drug in those studies) Page | 69 Discussion and conclusion To date, this is the most comprehensive review of the literature that provides widespread and updated information on the most frequently prescribed drugs across various NICUs worldwide, with a comparison between different geographic regions. 2.4.1 Comparison with other reviews This review has added 35 studies to the previous systematic reviews and their dates of publication ranged from 1983 to the most recent study in 2020. Availability of resources is a major determinant in provision of neonatal care. This i s evident in the wide disparities in survival of neonates, especially preterm neonates between different regions of the world . The United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation reported that in 2017 the annual neonatal mortality rate (NM R) was highest in west and central Africa, at 30.2 deaths per 1000 livebirths and in south Asia (which included India) at 26.9 per 1000 livebirths and lowest in the high -income countries, 3.0 per 1000 livebirths. Together, south Asia and sub -Saharan Africa accounted for 79% of the total burden of neonatal deaths (149) . With such disparities, it is important to stud y the differences in all aspects of care between different regions of the world. In this review I have investigated any reported differences in drug utilisation patterns. When looking at drug utilisation studies globally, this review has captured studies f rom most parts of the world with India, which has the highest number of preterm births, contribut ing the largest number of the studies followed by Page | 70 the USA. There have been WHO -led concern that the WHO South -East Asia region, which includes India, is likely to be the most at risk part of the world for the emergence of resista nt to microorganisms (150) . In terms of the methodologies of the included studies, they remained limited due to lack of information to assess the rational use of drugs such as dose, indication or duration of use. Most studies were restricted to a single centre and included a limited sample size. However, larger studies such as those from t he Paediatrix Medical group in the USA (65,66) are powered by their electronic patient records. Such re cords may enable further large -scale evaluations of drug utilization; however, this requires efforts to improve electronic patients records to appropriately assess the rational prescribing in neonatal medicine. Such improvement should be directed towards u se of standardized nomenclature and categorization of drugs, collection of data on indications, dosage, adverse effects and medication errors. 2.4.2 Drug use in general Half of the studies (27 studies) that investigated drug use in general were conducted in 11 European countries . In addition to those 11 European countries, a collaborative study presented in this review was performed which involved several European countries (21 participated) (63). None of the previous systematic reviews have summarised the sample size, the duration of studies, or proportion of premature n eonates in the included cohorts. In this current review, the median (range, IQR) sample size of neonates in 77 studies that reported the sample size was 220 (34 -450386, 113-1491). This huge variation can be attributed to the study designs Page | 71 (prospective vs . retrospective) and the study duration, which can affect the number of neonates enrolled. There were 17 single centre studies (out of 84 studies) with less than one hundred neonates included that may limit a firm conclusion with regard to the drug utilisation in such settings . The larger studies that included many thousands of neonates were enabled by retrospective analyses of routinely collected clinical data from large healthcare providers in the United States (65). In the UK, a critical review by Foster and Young assessed the usefulness of secondary data (i.e. routinely collected patient da ta and stored electronically) for research purposes on a neonatal level (151) . This critical review highlighted the possibility at present of using secondary data for research purposes in the UK due to the existence of the National Health Service (NHS), which holds thousands of elec tronic neonatal records collected over a long period of time. B lack et al. pointed out the usefulness of such data in several research areas such as identifying the development and causes of certain diseases, assessment of the healthcare interventions, and trends in the use of healthcare . The benefit of such data can be manifested in service planning and operational management of a healthcare system as added by Higgins et al. However, one should take into account several issues concerning parents' consent, use of patient - identifiable data, and the accuracy and security of electronic records when using such data in research (151) . The population included in the studies within this review are quite heterogeneous. Most studies include all neonatal unit admissions with varied proportion of preterm neonates. More than half of the studies reported the percentage of included neonates who were born prematurely (34 studies). Page | 72 Twenty -one out of those studies (64%) reported that more than half of the participants were preterm , with a range of 52% -87% of NICUs admissions included in the study. One would expect a higher number of drugs used in preterm neonates as reported by individual studies (77,82,87,115,121,124) . The studies ; however, did not dir ectly report the number of drugs per patient for term vs . preterm neonates. The pooled mean (SD) of the number of drugs per neonate from 29 studies was 4 (2.4) unique drugs per patient. The highest mean was reported by Neubert et al. as 11.1 unique drugs per patient (95). As discussed by the authors, the inclusion of high proportion of preterm and very pret erm neonates (69%) and the specialisation of the neonatal unit may have contributed to the high number of drugs prescribed per neonates when compared to other studies. Another possible explanation for this may be the greater availability of medicines in th e healthcare setting of this study, as it was conducted in a high -income country. Also, the inclusion of drugs given routinely in the delivery room prior to neonates being transferred to the unit were collected retrospectively and that could increase the n umber of drugs prescribed. Unlike some studies which have excluded the routinely used drugs at the delivery room (108,109,119) , Neubert et al. retrospectively collected this data and included it in their analysis. 2.4.3 Frequently prescribed drugs Overall, penicillins and gentamicin were among the ten most frequently cited drugs in the majority of the studies. These results support the data from previous systematic reviews (9,10) . This was not unexpected as most Page | 73 neonates admitted for intensive care are treated for presumed infections, and often penicillins and aminoglycosides are the first line antibiotics used. In most regions, ampicillin and gentamicin were among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs in their neonatal units . There is an exception; in Asia, amikacin and cefotaxime were among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs in their neonatal units . Few stu dies reported drugs other than an antibiotic as the one in most common usage e.g. caffeine featured at the top of the list in two studies. This can be attributed to the high proportion of preterm neonates in the study ; however , this was confirmed by only o ne study captured in this review (80) where 87% of included neonates were born preterm. Variations in which drugs were excluded from analysis in each study accounts for some other drugs which were not antibiotics appearing as the most frequently prescribe d, such as parenteral nutrition, vitamin K and multivitamins which, due to their ubiquitous use, were excluded from most studies. The current review found limited studies conducted in the Middle East region that cited most frequently prescribed drugs in th eir neonatal units with only two studies were found, both in Israel (73,97) . Both studies were also prospective and reported that gentamicin and amp icillin were among the five most frequently prescribed drugs in their centres. The limited data on drug use is a matter of concern, especially in a vu lnerable population such as neonates. The need to investiga te the drug use pattern in such regions is important to explore where the main misuse, if any, of drugs exists. Also, it Page | 74 will identify existing gaps and whether adherence to guidelines is implemented. Surfactants are recommended by the WHO for ventilated and intubated neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (152) . However, in the low - and middle -income regions, lack of human or material resources may hinder the use of those agents compared to countries in high income regions. This is supported by this review as seven studies in high income regions cited surfactants as one of the ten most frequently prescribed drugs, whereas only one study conducted in a middle -income region cited th e use of surfactants as frequently prescribed drugs. 2.4.4 Antibiotic use This review has reported the most frequently prescribed antibiotics in 59 studies that ranked the use of antibiotics in their NICUs. Overall, the use of antibiotics was s imilar in Europe, North America and Latin America, with ampicillin and gentamicin to be among the most frequently prescribed antibiotics. This finding broadly supports the work of a previous systematic review by Rosli et al. that concluded ampicillins and aminoglycosides w ere the commonest antibiotic groups reported by the included studies (10). This is again is not an unexpected finding as the burden of infections remains high; neonatal sepsis or meningitis accounted for 6.8% neonatal death globally in 2015 (153) . High risk of death and poor outcomes in survivors warrants the reliance on empirical antibiotic usage based on the sensitive but nonspecific clinical diagnosis of po ssible infections, particularly in preterm neonates, and the anti biotics given to clinically well neonates born with risk -Page | 75 factors for early -onset sepsis. Unfortunately, the selective pressure exerted by this widespread use is driving antimicrobial antibiotic resistance. The wide use of antibiotics in the neonatal popula tion is mainly to manage neonatal sepsis as either a prophylactic or treatment measure. However, an observed difference between these findings and Asia was found in this review. Many neonates in hospitals in south Asia are now treated with carbapenems as a first-line therapy for sepsis or presumed sepsis (154) . This was reflected in this review, with the more frequent appearance of ant ibiotics such as third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) and meropenem, and tazobactam in studies from Asia and Latin America. Cefotaxime was cited as the most frequently prescribed antibiotic instead of penicillins in studies conducted i n Asia, followed by amikacin. Cefotaxime can also be used in the management of neonatal sepsis due to its broad -spectrum cover for both gram positive and negative organisms. Cephalosporins are mainly eliminated via the kidneys with their clearance and half -life being dependent on neonates' de velopment . The half -life of cefotaxime and ceftazidime decreases with the increase in gestational and postnatal age with an opposite trend of the clearance of those agents (155) . This warrants careful monitoring when it comes to deciding the dosage regimen for neonates. Data from South Asia reflect a high burden on neonatal sepsis and a distinct pathogen profile with predominance of Gram -negative organisms and lower prevalence of group B streptococci as compared to high income countries (156) . In this review of neonatal sepsis in South Asia, Chaurasia et al. reported that 50 -88% of common isolates from health facilities are resistant Page | 76 to first -line antibiotics ampicillin and gentamicin and often to third -generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime. One unanticipated finding was that ceftriaxone appeared among the ten most frequently cited drugs in three studies in Asia (69,104,134) . Ceftriaxone was also cited among the ten most frequently prescribed antibiotics in an A frican NICU in Zimbabwe (132) . Ceftriaxone has been associated with several concerns about its safety use in neona tes. This antibiotic is highly protein bound with an ability of displacing bilirubin from its albumin binding sites, resulting in accumulation of bilirubin in brain tissues, and consequently kernicterus in neonates (155) . Furthermore, the FDA has issued a warning in 2007 restricting its use in neonates, especially when used concomitantly with calcium -containing IV products (157) . This is because this combination has been associated with life threateni ng cardiopulmonary adverse drug reactions due to the precipitation of calcium salts in the lungs and kidney (158) . Another intere sting finding seen in antibiotics use in Asia is the combination of cefoperazone -sulbactum , which was cited by two studies in India among their most frequently prescribed antibiotics (5,134) and in one recent study in China (106) . This antibiotic is a combination of B -lactam antibiotic and b - lactamase inhibitor and it is used for nosocomial sepsis caused by multi -drug resistant pathogens in NICUs (159) . This combination is not routinely used in the neonatal population due to the limited data on its use in neonates. A study by Ovali et al. was the first study to show the effectiveness of this combination to be used as an alternative to carbapenems in the management Page | 77 of nosocomial sepsis in NICUs without any apparent adverse effects (159) . However, the emergence of this agent among the frequently prescribed drugs may suggest the emergence of antibiotic resistance, which warrants further evaluation and application of strategies to improve antibiotic prescribing. To date, there is a lack of standard guidelines for empiric choice of antibiotics in neonatal sepsis, especially late onset sepsis. This is evident as the last published Cochrane review in 2005 concluded inadequacy of randomised trials for the empiric choice of antibioti c for late onset sepsis (160,161) . This can explain the variety of antibiotics regimens used for neonatal sepsis worldwide and even in NICUs within the same country. Broad spectrum antibiotics are often being prescribed by neonatologists, as it is difficult to differentiate signs of prete rm sepsis from those of prematurity (160) . This is also compounded by the fact that clinical and laboratory findings (such as C - reactive protein and white blood cells count) are not sensitive during the first hours following birth (105) . Therefore, these reasons can be attributed to the high rate of antibiotic use which can accelerate resistance, especially with broad spectrum antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics, especially in early neonata l life, can dist ort the gut microbiota which is pivotal for the developmental of the immune system and digestive function, leading to dysbacteriosis (162) . A recent systematic review was conducted with the aim of investigating the effect of antibiotic therapy in neonates on gut microbiota and/or antibiot ic resistance (162) . This systema tic review included 48 studies (three RCTs and 45 observational studies) and concluded that prolonged antibiotic therapy was associated with reduced gut mi crobial diversity (i.e. Page | 78 disrupts the microbiota) and increased antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic use pattern in China is distinctively different from any other setting around the globe. A recent Lancet global health commentary has reported that China is accounted for the lowest antibiotic use (7.8%) among 56 countries (23,572 patients) that participated i n a global study that describe paediatric patterns of WHO's Access, Watch, and Reserve classification of antibiotics (113). The pattern of antibiotic use in China is different when compared to other countries due to several reasons. First, gentamicin is ba nned in China for children who are below 8 years, unlike many countries in which it is used for gram negative bacteria in children and neonates. Another reason is the limited access of penicillin in China due to their policy of skin testing prior to penici llin use and the unavailability of those agents in many hospitals in China. A f inal reason is the high willingness of physicians to prescribe macrolide and third generation cepha losporins in China based on a latest survey on knowledge, attitude, and practi ce of antibacterial agents among Chinese paediatricians (113). The search in the present review have yielded one recent study conducted in a Chinese NICU (106) that supported this difference in drug use pattern in China. This study concluded that the three most frequently prescribed drugs were vitamin K1, hepatitis B vaccine, and cefoperazone -sulbactum . Authors suggest that this is driven by the high levels of am picillin resistance and prohibition of gentamicin use due to the high risk of hearing loss in the population . Page | 79 2.4.5 Lack of evidence for antiepileptic use in neonates There is in sufficient evidence from literature supporting the use of anti - epileptics in neonates. Only two RCTs were found to assess pharmacotherapy of anti -epileptics and were reported by a Cochrane review published in 2004 (163) . With regards to this current review, four studies in Asia have cited phenobarbitone among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs in their NICUs. Phenobarbitone remains the mainstay in the management of neonatal seizures as cited in the literature (143,164) . A recent large retrospective cohort study in the USA by Ahmad et al. was conducted with the aim of investigating the change of antiepileptic use over time (143) . This study conc luded that phenobarbitone was used in 98% of the cohort, with a minor decrease overtime compared to phenytoin use, which decreased significantly from the period 2005 to 2014. This downward trend was met with an opposing trend in levetiracetam use during the same period. A possible explanation for the recent increase in levetiracetam use is the favourable safety profile in several studies compared to phenobarbitone (165) . Levetiracetam is currently suggested to be possibly used as a second - line agent following phenobarbital due to its efficacy and safety, but evidence is still lacking with regards to its use as monotherapy or a first -line agent. The fact that phenobarbitone appears to be cited among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs in the majo rity of the studies in Asia indicates the prevalence of neonatal seizures in this region. The four studies that were conducted in Asia have reported that perinatal asphyxia was found to be one of the common morbidities and mortalities of the included neona tes Page | 80 (4,69,78,104) . Annu ally, three m illion neonatal deaths are due to prematurity, asphyxia and sepsis on a global scale (166) . Perinatal asphyxia is a major cause of neonatal mortality in Asian countri es. This was evident in a study that analysed the causes of 3,772 neonatal deaths in N epal, Bangladesh, Malawi and India between 2001 and 2011 (167) . This study has found that more than one third of neonatal deaths in urban India were attributed to asphyxia. Peri natal asphyxia could trigger seizures in neonates, which can eventually lead to the use of anti -epileptic drugs. Hence, this could explain the frequent use of phenobarbitone compared to other drugs. Furthermore, phenobarbitone and other first -generation antiepileptics (e.g. phenytoin) are readily accessed in low - and middle -income countries due to their lower cost compared to the higher cost newer generation anti -epileptic drugs (e.g. levetiracetam) which explain s the high use of first generation anti -epileptic drugs in Asia (168) .Page | 81 2.4.6 Strengths and limitations This is the most updated review to provide comprehensive data on the most frequently prescribed drugs, from 1983 to Ju ly 2020, in different regions. It included all studies without any restriction on language or search dates. The robust search strategy that was constructed with a senior clinical librarian has added another strength to this review. The data extraction, which was done by two reviewers, is considered another strength that ensures completion of the extracted data. This review has summarised the overall drug use in neonates worldwide in terms of the geogr aphic location , the included sample size, duration of the studies, average drug use per neonate, and the most frequently prescribed drugs of all of the studies that aimed to evaluate drug use in general. Unlike the systematic review by Rosli et al. (10), the high number of the studies yielded in this review would provide a thorough picture of drug use across the globe and in different geographic regions. The analysis of data extracted from the incl uded studies is limited by the heterogeneity of the included populations , variations in study designs and different methods of reporting the findings. One source of weakness in this review is excluding two studies in German as one could not be obtained (169) , and the other one was received as a scanned copy which hindered its translation to English (170) . Due to the lack of uniformity among the included studies in terms of the la belling and licensing definitions, the identification of the most frequently prescribed off -label and/or unlicensed drugs was not feasible, which added another limitation to this review and hence they were reported descriptively per each study. Page | 82 2.4.7 Conclusion Despite the descriptive nature of this systematic review, it provides valuable insight into the frequently used drugs across different NICUs worldwide. Globally, the pattern of drug use across neonatal units is similar, especially in Europe, with antibiot ics being the most frequently prescribed drugs. The high usage of antibiotics is still an ongoing concern that needs to be tackled to rationalise the use of those agents worldwide , especially with the introduction of combined antibiotics, which has led tow ards the emergence of resistance in some countries. This review also highlighted the lack of details such as paucity on information of indication, dose, duration of use or adverse effects calling for improvement in data collection and analysis of drug util isation data when conducted on a neonatal level. Such research is important, particularly when conducted collaboratively across national and continental boundaries to improve rational use of medicine in neonates. In the UK, there i s a need for larger updated studies on drug use in neonates due to the limitations of previously conducted studies. A further study with more focus on drug use in neonatal units at a national level will provide a better description of the most frequently p rescribed drugs and the current practice in the UK. Page | 83 CHAPTER 3 DRUG UTILISATION PATTERNS IN NEONATAL UNITS IN ENGLAND AND WALES Introduction Assessing the rational process behind drug therapy is the fundamental goal of drug utilisation research, which involves eithe r quantitative or qualitative methods. Quantitative methods aim to measure prescribing, dispensing, or the consumption of medicines in a population using primary or secondary data sources (171) . As very little was found in the previous review chapter regarding the question of the pattern of drug utilisation in neonatal units in the UK, the present study was designed to fill the gaps and extend the body of literature . This chapter describes a retrospective pharmaco -epidemiological study in England and Wales over a long period of time and on a national level using prospectively collected data stored in the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD). Page | 84 Study design This is a retrospective pharmaco -epidemiological study to explore the utilisation of drugs across neonatal units in England and Wales over eight years (2010 to 2017). The study uses a database of routinely -recorded, prospectively collected data (NN RD), which is approved by the National Research Ethics Service in the UK to permit the use of de -identified data for research (REC Number: 16/1093). A description of the database is detailed in section 3.4. 3.2.1 Ethical approval process This study was registered prospectively at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03773289). The protocol for this study was approved by the Health Research Authorit y (HRA) following a favourable opinion from the Yorkshire & The Humber - Leeds East Research Ethics Committee and Health and Care Research Wales (IRAS project ID: 248088, REC reference: 18/YH/0209; Date of approval: 25 May 2018) (attached in 9.11). Page | 85 Aim and objectives The overall aim of this study was to investigate historic pattern of drug utilisation in neonatal units in England and Wales. Objective 1: What are the most frequently prescribed drugs? Objective 2: Have prescribing patterns changed from 2010 to 2017? Objective 3: Are there any variations in prescribing accordi ng to gestational age and birth weight and treatment location? Post-hoc objective: Are there any differences in antibiotic prescribing according to gestational age group? Page | 86 Methods 3.4.1 Overview of the data used in this study 3.4.1.1 Sources of neonatal data in the UK The routine collection of neonatal data in the UK started in 1990 through a study called The Neonatal Survey, which has become a resource for providing clinical information on neonates (172) . However, the data provided by this survey covers some regions of England only (Leicestershire & Rutland, Derbyshire, Nottinghamsh ire, Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, South Humberside and Northamptonshire). In addition, the reports produced by The Neonatal Survey do not provide drug records from the collaborating neonatal units. Another electronic platform that is used in the UK is t he Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database. HES is a database of all admissions, Acute care and Emergency (A and E) attendances, and outpatient appointments in the National Health Service ( NHS ) hospitals in England only. This database was established in 1989 with an aim of recording every episode of admission in England and the care delivered (173) . This database contains key clinical information (diagnoses and operation s), patient information (age groups, gender, and ethnicity), administrative information (dates and methods of admission and discharge), and finally, geographical information (treating centre and area of living) (174) . However, it does not capture any information regarding drug treatment in neonates. Page | 87 Since the main aim of this study was to identify the most frequently prescribed drugs in the neonatal population and investigate patterns of drug use over time, the use of both the Neonatal Survey and HES were not appropriate. The NNRD, established in 2007 by the Neonatal D ata Analysis Unit (NDAU), is an approved research database which can be used to meet the aim and objectives of this study. 3.4.1.2 NNRD and justification for its use in this study Neonatal clinical data are entered daily into a national electronic platform by healthcare professionals providing care to neonates across the UK. This platform is known as Badger.net, which holds neonatal electronic health records of all admissions to NHS neonatal units and is managed by an authorised hosting company, Clevermed Ltd (Leve l 6, Edinburgh Quay, 133 Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, EH3 9QG, www.clevermed.com). Since the establishment of the NDAU in 2007, based at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital campus of Imperial College London, the collection of electronic neonatal data for re search and quality assessment was facilitated (175) . Neonatal Data Analysis Unit ( NDAU ) extract data quarterly from all NHS neonatal units, combine it, and undertake initial data ma nagement and cleaning to produce the NNRD. At present, the NNRD holds data on around one million neonates and ten million days of care (176) . The database includes a variable where names of individual drugs prescribed to neonates are entered dai ly. In addition, there are other data items which capture drug use, such as drugs used in resuscitation at birth, surfactant at delivery, and drugs given for specific Page | 88 conditions, such as for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) . Therefore, the NNRD was selected for its ability to provide a detailed insight into drug use across neonatal units in the UK and fulfil the aim and objectives of this study, as it is currently considered the only national neonatal database providing clinical information on neonates admitt ed at different neonatal unit levels and their drug use across the UK. For this study, all data on neonatal unit admissions over an eight -year period (01 January 2010 to 31 December 2017) in England and Wales was utilised for the purpose of analysis. Howev er, the data from Scotland and Northern Ireland were not included. This is because a different ethics process was required and Northern Ireland do not use the Badger.net . Therefore, I have focused on data from England and Wales only. 3.4.1.3 Dataset used in this study and statistical software Data in the NNRD are broadly organised in two files - Episode data and Daily data - and were extracted by NDAU and provided to us in this form. Episode data represent an admission to a neonatal care unit. Each row in the episode data corresponds to one adm ission (i.e. one episode of care in a single unit regardless of how many days a neonate stays at the unit). A neonate may have several episodes of care if they are transferred between units. Daily data represent a day of care for a neonate and each row in the daily data file corresponds to one day of care. Figure 20 and Figure 21 detail the variables requested from NDAU to be extracted from NNRD. All data management and statistical analysis were carried out using Stata SE 16 (64 -bit) (Stata Corp. College Station, TX, USA) for Windows 2010 Enterprise Edition (Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, USA).Page | 89 Figure 20. Variables extracted from the NNRD Episode file Page | 90 Figure 21. Variables extracted from the NNRD Daily data file Page | 91 3.4.2 Study population All neonates admitted to a neonatal unit in England or Wales from 01 January 2010 to 31 December 2017 were eligible for inclusion. Neonates with the following criteria were excluded: Neona tes with missing or contradictory information in their demographic data (gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), gender , month of birth) Neonates admitted to a non -neonatal unit Neonates with missing episodes at the start or in the middle of their care Neonates whose first admission is not within the study period Neonates with GA < 22 weeks or > 44 weeks Neonates with extreme BW for GA Z-scores (detailed in section 3.4.3.4 ) WHO definitions were adopted to categorise neonates according to different GA groups and BW groups (13,177) (Table 8). Table 8. Definitions of gestational age and birth weight categories according to WHO Gestational age category Birth weight category Term: born at 37 weeks Normal birth weight: born 2500 g Moderate to late preterm: born between 32 -36 weeks Low birth weight (LBW): born < 2499 g Very preterm: born between 28 -31 weeks Very low birth weight (VLBW): born < 1500 g Extremely preterm: born at < 28 weeks Extremely low birth weight (ELBW): born < 1000 g Page | 92 3.4.3 Overview of data management A summary of the steps taken to derive the final study dataset for the purpose of analysis is provided in Figure 22, followed by a detailed explanation.Page | 93 Figure 22. Summary of the key steps in data management *exceptions are mentioned in drugs coding section Page | 94 3.4.3.1 Initial data management Episode and Daily data were received from NDAU as two separate.csv files, and an anonymised identification number (anon -id) was used to enable linkage between the two files. Some of the variables were coded as 'integers' (i.e. numbers) while others were coded as 'strings' (i.e. text). The initial data management was supported by my supervisor Dr Lisa Szatkowski (Associate Professor in Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham) using her computer as initial data processing required a computer with sufficient processing power to be able to open the extremely large files. This process involved importing the .csv dataset into Stata and saving it in a Stata format. Both Episode and Daily datasets were then divided into 20 smaller files of approxim ately equal numbers of neonates. This was done as I was not able to run the analysis on one complete file on my computer due to lack of adequate processing power. It was therefore necessary for me to perform the key steps of analysis on one Episode/Daily d ata file and then repeat it on the subsequent 19 files before combining results. Page | 95 3.4.3.2 Drugs coding Drug data entered in the NNRD data are in text format with different spellings and alternate names (generic/brand). For example, amoxicillin appears as two different spellings, 'amoxicillin' and 'amoxycillin', and paracetamol is entered using the brand name 'calpol' as well as the generic 'paracetamol'. Hence, it was essential to harmonise and code drugs before starting the analysi s. As a first step, every single drug entry in the Daily data file was identified and extracted. The number of unique drugs identified from the raw data was 659. These were extracted and copied to an Excel file to start the process of coding. This process involved three different steps applied as necessary (Figure 23). Figure 23. Stepwise drugs coding process Page | 96 In the first step, all drug entries were corrected in terms of their spelling. Secondly, drugs entered using brand name entries were converted to their generic names. Following those two steps, the drugs were then categorised according to two main categories for the purpose of analys es: Broad group category: Drugs were renamed according to their broader category and their primary use in the neonatal population Individual category: Drugs were renamed according to their original scientific/generic name with appropriate UK spellings I performed the initial cleaning and categorisation which was subsequently checked by my supervisor Dr Ojha. The British National Formulary for Children (BNF -C, September 2018 update) and specific produc t characteristics (www.medicines.org.uk) were used as a reference for categorisation. Some examples of the drug cleaning and categorisation are shown in Table 9. Table 9. Examples of coding and categorising drugs Drug entry (as presented in original dataset) Broad group Individual drug ibuprofen Agents used oral morphine - level 1 oral morphine - level 3 oral morphine - level 4 oramorph oromorph Page | 97 Some drugs were not categorised according to the references stated above, but instead according to their use as reported in the literature. An example of this is oral sucrose which is effective as an analgesic for procedural pain in neonates (178) . Another example is paracetamol, which can be used in neonates as an an algesic but more recently shown to be effective in PDA management (179) . However, paracetamol was classified as analgesic as it was not clear at this stage from the data if it was used for PDA or as an analgesic. The broad pharmacological groups of the drugs are listed in Figure 24 whereas the full drug list with their codes and categories along with the corresponding references is detailed in 9.12. Page | 98 Figure 24. Broad pharmacological group categorie s Page | 99 3.4.3.3 Neonatal units coding The neonatal unit providing each episode of care was coded according to their level (level one, two, or three ) as defined by the NHS Neonatal Specialist Commissioning Group network's definition of different neonatal levels of care (180,181) and British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM) categories of care (24) . These are: Level one: SCU (special care unit) for initial and short -term care for neonates born at GA > 32 weeks Level two: LNU (local neonatal unit) for high dependency care for neonates born between 28 -32 weeks Level three: NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) for complex care for neonates born at GA < 28 weeks One unit was identified as a non -neonat al unit and coded as level 0 of care after checking with NDAU. All neonates labelled with admission to this unit were excluded from the study.Page | 100 3.4.3.4 Episode file management The Episode file contains information on basic characteristics of neonates' demographics, such as GA in weeks, BW in grams, month and year of birth, gender of the baby, and the place of birth. The Episode data file was therefore used as the key file to create a new dataset of demographic data for each neonate, which was later merged into the D aily file to enable analys es. Before merging, an initial attempt was made to ensure that the data in the Episode file were consistent and there were no duplicates, conflicts, or missing records in any entry of the demographic variables. A summary of the steps followed to ensure completeness of data in the Episode data file is presented in Figure 25. Figure 25. Steps followed to ensure completeness and consistency in demographic variables in the Episode data file Page | 101 Neonates with GA < 22 weeks or > 44 weeks were marked to be excluded. Neonates with extreme BW for GA Z scores were also identified for exclusion. A Z score i s a standard deviation (SD) score that allows a comparison of a child to the reference population (182) . In this study, Z scores were calculated to exclude neonates with a BW for GA Z score greater or less than 4 SD as performed in the recent published study using the same database wherein neonates with incongruous BW were also excluded (27). Z scores were calculated using the 'Zanthro' function in Stata to generate the acceptable BW bounds, based on the UK -WHO growth charts -neonatal and infant close monitoring (NCIM) (183) . Appendix 9.13 details the calculated \u00b14 SD Z score bounds for boys and girls for each week of GA at birth (184) . Weight data in UK reference charts are available from 23 weeks' gestation only. Since there are no reference BW data for neonates at 22 weeks of gestation, BW records for neonates born at this gestation were examined manually and co mpared to the \u00b14 SD bounds for neonates born at GA of 23 weeks. This manual inspection concluded that the BW of all neonates born at 22 weeks' gestation fell within the acceptable weight range for neonates born at 23 weeks and so these neonates were not marked for exclusion. Page | 102 3.4.3.5 Daily file management Management of the Daily data file included simple 'housekeeping' tasks such as labelling variables and dropping variables not needed at this point in order to reduce the data file size. 3.4.3.6 Derivation of the final study dataset At this stage, the clean Daily data file and the demographic data file were merged. Figures for the number of neonates excluded, both in total and according to each specific exclusion criterion, were created . 3.4.4 Specific methods for each objective 3.4.4.1 Objective 1: What are the most frequently prescribed drugs? For this objective, the following steps were undertaken: 1. Merged the newly created demographic data file to the Daily data file using the anonymous Identification number (anon_id) variable to link individuals and excluded neonates based on the previously mentioned list. 2. Dropped any irrelevant variables from the data file to reduce its size and speed the analysis process. 3. Created a new variable for each individual drug and group of drugs, coded as 'one' if the drug/group was prescribed on each day of care and coded as 'ze ro' if it was not prescribed. Page | 103 4. For each neonate, created a binary variable indicating whether each individual drug or group of drugs was prescribed at least once during their care. 5. For each neonate, created a continuous variable counting the number of days each individual drug or group of drugs was prescribed during their care. I have tabulated two scenarios below from the data analysing the prescribing of analgesics (as an example) to explain the function of the created variables (Figure 26). Intravenous (IV) morphine and paracetamol are two examples that were coded as analgesics in those presented scenarios. The anon_id was rem oved and replaced by 'a' and 'b' for the purpose of confidentiality.Page | 104 Figure 26. Variables created to identify drug prescribing Page | 105 3.4.4.1.1 Mean number of drugs and proportion of drugs free days A secondary aim was to quantify the mean number of drugs per neonate and the proportion of drug free days. To achieve this, for each neonate I created a variable counting the total number of different individual drugs prescribed, and a variable counting th e number of days when no drugs were prescribed. 3.4.4.1.2 Drugs excluded from the analys es In line with other drug utilisation studies, some drugs and other substances were excluded from the analys es. These include IV fluids to prevent c lotting of vascular lines (heparin sodium, sodium chloride for flush), standard IV replacement solutions (electrolytes, glucose), parenteral nutrition solutions, milk formula, and all types of vitamins and topical dermatological agents that contain combine d antibiotics and/or corticosteroids. Also, some substances were classified as unrecognised as they could not be identified and were excluded from the analysis (detailed in 9.14). 3.4.4.1.3 The total days of use of drugs This was calculated by multiplying the number of neonates who were prescribed a particular drug at least once during their neonatal stay by the average number of days of exposure. The drugs were then ranked based on the total number of days of use from the highest number of days of use to the lowest and the results of the top ten drugs are presented.Page | 106 3.4.4.2 Objective 2: Have prescribing patterns changed over time? The methods used to answer the three parts of this objective build on those described above and are detailed below. 3.4.4.2.1 Changes over time in which drugs are most frequently used relative to other drugs For this, I have taken the ten most frequently prescribed drugs identified from objective 1 and analysed them by year of admission using the absolute number and proportion of neonates who have been prescribed each individual drug at least once from 2010 to 2017. 3.4.4.2.2 Changes o ver time in the average number of days that neonates are given particular drugs Again, the ten most frequently prescribed drugs were identified as per the first objective. Then, the absolute numbers and proportion of neonates prescribed those drugs at lea st once were tabulated by year of admission from 2010 to 2017 to illustrate the change in prescribing patterns. In addition, the median, range and interquartile range for the number of days each drug was prescribed were calculated by year of admission from 2010 to 2017, and this was also repeated for each GA group. Page | 107 3.4.4.2.3 Changes in drug use over time for the entire cohort and for very and extremely preterm neonates In order to explore the change in drug use over time for the full cohort (i.e. neonates of all GA), the percentage of neonates who were prescribed a particular drug at least once in a particular year (e.g. 2010) among all neonates who were admitted in that year (e.g. 2010) was calculated. This was repeated for each year in the study period (from 2010 to 2017). Following this step, the minimum, maximum, and range of the percentage of neonates who received the drug at least once in each study year was determined. These ranges were ranked from the largest to the smallest value (detailed in 9.15). However, only the data on drugs with a range of greater than one percent were extracted to attain a manageable number of drugs to describe in more detail. This cut off was chosen for the full cohort. Following this, the percentages of neonates prescribed the drugs at least once from 2010 to 2017 were plotted. Similarly, the change in drug use over time was investigated among very and extremely preterm neonates separately. As the ranges of the percentages of neonates who received the drug at least once in these subgroups were larger, a higher percentage cut off was selected to attain a manageable number of drugs to describe in more detail for these two cohorts. For very preterm neonates, drugs that had a range of more than 3% ( detailed in 9.16) and for extremely preterm neonates, drugs that had a range of more than 5% (detailed in 9.17) are presented. All the calculations were done using Microsoft Excel (version 16, 64 bit). Page | 108 In this analysis, research drugs were excluded as the change in the use of those drugs over time is related to the start and th e end of each trial , and hence will not provide a meaningful interpretation of the change in their use over time. Those drugs are detailed in 9.12. 3.4.4.3 Objective 3: Are there any variations in prescribing according to gestational age and birth weight of neonates and treatment location? For this objective, the analyses carried out for objective 1 were repeated for sub-groups of the study population define d by GA groups, BW group and unit level, using the group definitions listed in Table 8 and Section 3.4.3.3 . For the analyses at unit level, only those neonates who received all their neonatal care in one unit were included. Neonates who were treated in more than one unit were e xcluded, as were any neonates where the care level of the treating unit could not be identified .Page | 109 3.4.4.4 Post -hoc objective: Are there any differences in antibiotic prescribing for each gestational age group? This objective focuses on four questions; the methods for each are detailed below. Initially, a general coding of the antibiotics was undertaken similar to that described in objective 1 (step 4), but this was done only for the group of antibiotics. After that, the following analysis steps were undertaken for each question. 3.4.4.4.1 How many different antibiotics are prescribed per neonate during their hospital stay? A binary variable was created for each individual antibiotic where each row, representing a day of care, was coded as 'one' if a neonate was prescribed that antibiotic on that day. Then, by generating a variable called total antibiotics (total abx), the number of different antibiotics that were prescribed per neonate who were prescribed antibiotics at least once during their hospital stay was calculated . 3.4.4.4.2 How many days of antibiotics are prescribed per neonate? The number of days on which neonates were prescribed antibiotics was analysed by first generating a binary variable (antibiotics_baby) identifying neonates who were prescribed antibiotics on at least o ne day. Another variable was created (antibiotics_baby_days) to count the number of days antibiotics were prescribed per baby. Page | 110 3.4.4.4.3 On what percentage of neonatal care days are antibiotics prescribed amongst neonates who have been prescribed antibiotics for at least one day? This percentage was calculated for each neonate by dividing the number of days where antibiotics were prescribed by the total number of days of care. Figure 27 depicts two scenarios extracted from the dataset to illustrate the function of the above -mentioned variables used to identify antibiotics prescribing. 3.4.4.4.4 How many courses of antibiotics were pre scribed, where antibiotics were prescribed for at least 5 days continuously? For this analysis, a course of antibiotics was defined as five consecutive days of prescribing per neonate. A gap of at least two days was required between courses to call them di fferent courses of antibiotics. The total number of courses of antibiotics prescribed, overall and in each GA, group was counted. Page | 111 Figure 27. Variables created to identify antibiotic prescribing Page | 112 Results 3.5.1 Derivation of the study dataset for the analys es The total number of neonates for whom records were received from NDAU was 643,233. Of these, a total of 4,390 (0.7%) neonates were excluded from analysis for one or more reasons (Figure 28).Page | 113 Figure 28. Number of neonates excluded from the analys es Page | 114 For the analys is at unit level ( objective 3), 52,566 (8%) neonates were excluded where they were treated in more than one unit or because the level of care could not be identified ( Figure 29). 586,277 neonates were therefore included in the analys es of drug use by unit level. Figure 29. Derivation of neonatal record for the inclusion of analys is by unit level Page | 115 3.5.2 Population characteristics After exclusions, a total of 638,843 neonates admitted to 187 neonatal units across England and Wales from January 2010 to December 2017 were included in the study (Table 10). 44% of neonates (n=283,553) were female and 59% were born at term (n=379,410). A histogram was done to inspect the normality of the data sets and mean/median were chosen for normal/ skewed distribution, respectively . Following the inspection of the histogram it was clearly not normally distributed data set in terms of the GA , BW, and length of hospital stay . Therefore, median (IQR) was chosen to summarise these variables. The median (IQR) GA in weeks and median (IQR) BW in grams were 37 weeks (35 -40) and 2890 (2168 -3500) , respectively. The median length of neonatal unit stay was five days (IQR 3 -13). As expected, length of stay was longer for neonates born the most premature. 66% of neonates were discharged to home and 1% (n=8,666) died. Mortality w as highest among extremely preterm neonates, 22% (n=4,234) of whom died. Appendix 9.18 describes the demographic characteristics of neonates by BW category. Page | 116 Table 10.

As expected, neonates who have not been prescribed any drugs had higher GA and BW compared to those who had drugs during their neonatal stay. Also, the median length of neonatal unit stay of neonates who did not have any drugs was three days (IQR 2 -5), which was lower than those who had the drugs (median 7, IQR 3 -18) (p<0.001). Further analys es was done to extract the diagnosis at the admission of neonates who have not been prescribed any drugs (Table 13). Across all the cohort, 22% (n=137,578) of neonates had no entries of any diagnosis at admission. Whereas 39% (n=74,698) of neonates who have not p rescribed any drugs had no entries of diagnosis at admission. At least 13% of neonates who have not prescribed any drugs were diagnosed with prematurity, followed by hypoglycaemia (10%), and 'other' (10%). Some entries were excluded from the list of diagno sis as they were signs and symptoms (1%, n=2,730), unclear entries (2%, n=4,036), entries related to social issues and delivery (3%, n=6,610), or maternal related conditions (5%, n=10,140).

The number of term neonates increased from 32,567 (54% of total admission in the year) in 2010 to 63,760 (64% of total admissions) in 2017. Moderate to late preterm neonates were 34% of the total admission in 2010 (n=20,573) and their percentage reduced to 28% of all admissions (n=27,943) in 2017. There was a slight decrease over time in the percentage of admissions in the year who were born at very preterm (from 8% (n=5,057) in 2010 to 6 % (n=5,437) in 2017). Although the actual number of extremely preterm neonates increased, there was a decrease in their percentage among the total ad mission for each year from 4% (n=2,240) in 2010 to 2% (n=2,401) in 2017. The number of neonates admitted each year by GA group is detailed in Table 14. Page | 125 Table 14.

The second most frequently prescribed group was electrolytes and minerals, prescribed to 26% of neonates. The miscellaneous group of drugs included emollients, ocular lubricants, and wound dressings (detailed in 9.12) was the 10th most frequently prescribed pharmacological group ( Figure 31). The most frequently prescribed drug was benzylpenicillin, prescribed to 56% (n=355,679) of neonates at least once during their neonatal stay, closely followed by g entamicin which was prescribed to 54% (n=347,713) of neonates. Sodium was prescribed to 24% of neonates (n=56,109) at least once during their neonatal stay ( Figure 32). The top 50 most frequently prescribed drugs are listed in descending order in 9.19 for all and each GA .Page | 128 Figure 31. Ten most frequently prescribed pharmacological groups in neonatal units in England and Wales (2010 - 2017) Page | 129 Figure 32. Ten most frequently prescribed individual drugs in neonatal units in England and Wales (2010 -2017) Page | 130 There was a total of 377 different individual drugs prescribed from 2010 to 2017 in neonatal units across England and Wales, after omitting those labelled as excluded drugs. The median (range, IQR) number of d rugs prescribed per neonate across neonatal units was 2 (0 -69, 0 -3). Extremely preterm neonates were prescribed the largest number of drugs and this number decreased with increasing GA (Table 15). The median number of drugs prescribed by neonates was similar for each year of admission (Appendix 9.20). Overall, half of all days of care were drug free, but there were large differences by GA group (Figure 33). For neonates born extremely preterm, just 3% of days were drug free on average. Moderate to late preterm neonates had the highest proportion of drug free days, 70% on average. Page | 131 Table 15.

This was followed by benzylpenicillin and gentamicin as they were prescribed for a total 1,067,037 and 1,043,139 days, respectively (Figure 34). Appendix 9.21 shows the calculated total number of days of u se of the top 50 drugs ranked from the highest to lowest number of days of use.Page | 134 Figure 34. Most frequently prescribed drugs in neonatal units in England and Wales (2010 -2017) (measured as the number of days of use of individual drug Page | 135 3.5.4 Results for objective 2: Have prescribing patterns changed over time? 3.5.4.1 Changes over time in which drugs are most frequently used relative to other drugs The ten most frequently prescribed drugs identified in section 3.5.3 are here analysed further to investigate changes in the frequency of their presc ribing over time. Figure 35 and Figure 36 show that the number of neonates prescribed benzylpenicillin, gentamicin and pulmonary surfactants at least once, has increased over time. Of the total admissions in each year, the percentage of neonates prescribed benzylpenicillin and gentamicin at least once during their neonatal stay increased from 51% to 60% and from 52% to 57% , respectively from 2010 to 2017 ( Figure 36). The percentage of neonates receiving pulmonary surfactants increased from 4% to 6% from 2010 to 2017. The absolute number and percentage of neonates who have been prescribed the remaining seven top ten drugs remained fairly constant over the study period. However, the percentages in Figure 36 are misleading as of the number of term admissions have increased significantly over the years. This inflation can lea d to an apparent decrease in the use of drugs that are given only to preterm neonates. Therefore, I have done sub -group analysis for the change in drug use over time in very and extremely preterm neonates' cohort (detailed in 3.5.4.4 and 3.5.4.5 ). Page | 136 Figure 35. Absolute numbers of neonates prescribed the most frequently prescribed drugs by year of admission Page | 137 Figure 36. Percentage of neonates prescribed the most frequently prescribed drugs by year of admission Page | 138 3.5.4.2 Changes over time in the ave rage number of days that neonates are given particular drugs Caffeine and phosphate supplements were prescribed for the highest median number of days compared to other drugs, with a median (IQR) of 20 (9 -37) and 15 (6 -34) days, r espectively (Table 16). Table 17 shows the median number of days of exposure (IQR) for the ten most frequently prescribed individual drugs, for each GA group. The median number of days on which neonates were prescribed these drugs amongst neonates prescribed the drug on at least one day was higher with increasing prematurity. This was found, for example, with gentamicin, in which number of days was higher in extremely preterm neonates compared to term neonates, with a median (IQR) of 8 (4 -14) and 3 (2 -4) respectively. This was also true for caffeine, in which the number of days of drug exposure decreased from 48 (37 -60) to 1 (1-3) in extremely preterm and term neonates, respectively. Page | 139 Table 16.

The percentage of neonates receiving the drug at least once increased for some drugs (n=5) and decreased for others (n=12) while four drugs showed a fluctuation in use over the years (n=3). Overall decrease : 12 drugs had an overall decrease in their use over the years. This change in use could be attributed to either safety issues or factors related to their use in different neonatal gestational age groups. I have divided them into three groups of drugs: tho se with a decrease in their use that may be due to safety concerns, those where the decrease may be due to changes in the proportion of admitted neonates over the years based on their GA, and those where the decrease may be associated with lack of evidence of effectiveness. Safety concerns: the percentage of neonates who have been ranitidine, and ocular chloramphenicol ( Figure 37.a) at least once decreased from 2010 to 2017. This may be related to safety concerns associated with their use in neonates, which is detailed in the discussion. The percentage of neonates who have been prescribed cefotaxime decreased over time in general from 15.6% (9,417 neonates) in 2010 to 12.1 % (12,001 neonates) in 2017, with 3.5% absolute decrease from 2010 to 2017. The percentage of neonates who have been prescribed domperidone at least once decreased from 4% (2,406 neonates) in 2010 to 0.4% (377 neonates) in 2017, i.e. a 3.6 % absolute decrease in use. The Page | 142 percentage of neonates who have been prescribed ranitidine at least once decreased from 5.1% (3,100 neonates) in 2010 to 2.5 % (2,504 neonates) in 2017, with a 2.6% absolute decrease fr om 2010 to 2017. Percentage of neonates who have been prescribed ocular chloramphenicol decreased steadily (1,525 neonates) with 1.1% absolute decrease from 2010 to 2017. Changes in population composition: The percentage of neonates who have been prescribed flucloxacillin, vancomycin, metronidazole, caffeine, feed thickeners, and supplements (iron, phosphates) at least once have decreased from 2010 to 2017 ( Figure 37.b). All these drugs are known to be prescribed to preterm neonates and their decrease in use might be attributed to the change in the population composition of the st udy cohort, detailed in the discussion. Page | 143 Figure 37. Drugs with an overall decrease in the percentage of neonates receiving it at least once from 2010 to 2017 a. safety concerns b. changes in population Page | 144 Lack of evidence: The percentage of neonates who have been prescribed topical nystatin at least once dec reased from 5.1% with 1.3% absolute decrease from 2010 to 2017, which might be attributed to the lack of evidence that supports its effectiveness in the neonatal population. Overall increase: Five drugs were found to have an overall increase in their use over time; sodium, benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, amikacin, and pulmonary surfactants ( Figure 38). The percentage of neonates who have been prescribed sodium at least once increased from 16.6% (10,038 neonates) in 2010 to 27.3% (27,198 neonates) with 10.7% absolute increase from 2010 to 2017. Amongst the antibiotics, benzylpenicillin had the highest percentage of increase over time. The percentage of neonates who have been prescribed benzylpenicillin at least once increased from 51% (30,828 neonates) to 59.4% (59,088 neonates) 8.4% absolute increase from 2010 to 2017 . With regard to pulmonary surfactants, the percentage of neonates who have been prescribed these agents at least once increased from 3.9% (2,351 neonates) in 2010 to 6% (5,938 neonates) 2.1% absolute increase from 2017. Fluctuated: The percentage of neonates receiving amoxicillin, probiotics, and at least once fluctuated over time ( Figure 39).Page | 145 Figure 38. Drugs with an overall increase in the percentage of neonates receiving it at least once from 2010 to 2017 Page | 146 Figure 39. Drugs fluctuated in the percentage of neonates receiving it at least once from 2010 to 2017 Page | 147 3.5.4.4 Change in drug use among very preterm neonates There were 2 6 drugs that had a calculated range value greater than three percent (detail ed in 9.16). Some of these drugs had an overall increase in their use (n=1 0) or an overall decrease in their use (n=1). Others displayed fluctuations in use over the years (n=1 5). Those with fluctuations in their use are detailed in 9.22. Overall decrease: Percentage of very preterm neonates who have been prescribed domperidone at least once each admission year was found to be continuously decreased from 17.8% (899 neonates) in 2010 to 2.6% (139 neonates) in 2017, with 15.2% absolute decrease from 2010 to 20 17 (Figure 40). Page | 148 Figure 40. Overall decrease in the percentage of very preterm neonates receiving domperidone at least once from 2010 to 2017 Page | 149 Overall increase: 10 drugs were found to have an overall increase in the percentage of very preterm neonates receiving it at least once ( Figure 41). The percentage of very p reterm neonates who have been prescribed caffeine at least once had increased from 76.5% (3,868 neonates) in 2010 to 91% (4,945 neonates) with 14.5% absolute increase from 2010 to 2017. This was followed by benzylpenicillin in which the percentage of neonates that have been prescribed this drug at least once was 76.4% (3,865 neonates) in 2010 to 88.3% (4,801 neonates) in 2017, and with 1 1.9% absolute increase from 2010 to 2017. The percentage of very preterm neonates who have been prescribed pulmon ary surfactants at least once also noticeably increased from 17.4% (880 neonates) in 2010 to 34.7% (1,885 neonates) in 2017, with 17.3% absolute increase from 2010 to 2017. Page | 150 Figure 41. Drugs with an overall increase in the percentage of very preterm neonates receiving it at least once from 2010 to 2017 Page | 151 3.5.4.5 Change in drug use among extremely preterm neonates There were 4 3 drugs that had a calculated range value greater than five percent (detailed in 9.17). Some of these drugs had an overall increase in the percentage of extremely preterm neonates receiving it at least once (n= 11) or an overall decrease in the percentage of extremely preterm neonates receiving it at least once (n= 1). Others displayed fluctuations in the percentage of extremely preterm neonates receiving it at least once (n=31). Those with fluctuations in the ir use are tabulated in 9.23. Overall decrease: The percentage of extremely preterm neonates who have been prescribed domperidone at least once have decreased from 31.2% (699 neonates) in 2010 to 5.8% (139 neonates) in 2017, with 25.4% absolute decrease from 2010 to 2017 (Figure 42). Page | 152 Figure 42. Overall decrease in the percentage of extremely preterm neonates receiving domper idone at least once from 2010 to 2017 Page | 153 Overall increase: One of the most obvious drugs that can be extracted from Figure 43 in terms of its increase in prescribing in this cohort is pulmonary surfactants. Despite the three minor decrease in the percentage of neonates being prescribed those agents in 2012, 2016 and 2017, the use of those agents has been found to be increased over time. The percentage of extremely preterm neonates who have been prescribed paracetamol at least once increased from 18.8% (420 neonates) in 2010 to 37.8% (907 neonates) in with 19% ab solute increase 2010 to 2017. Similarly, in the very preterm neonates, the percentage of extremely preterm neonates who have been prescribed caffeine at least once increased from 79.5% (1,781 neonates) in 2010 to 93.6% (2,248 neonates) in with 1 4.1% absolute increase from 2010 to 2017.

GA category: Benzylpenicillin and gentamicin were the most frequently prescribed drugs in term and moderate to late preterm neonates, whereas caffeine was the most frequently prescribed drug in very preterm and extremely preterm neonates (Figure 44). The average duration of drug exposure in days for the most frequently prescribed drugs was similar in each gestational age group ( detailed in 9.24). BW category: Benzylpenicillin and gentamicin were the most frequently prescribed drugs in normal, LBW and VLBW neonates. Caffeine was the most frequently prescribed drug in extremely LBW neonates (Figure 45). The average duration of drug exposure in days for the most frequently prescribed drugs was similar in each BW group ( detailed in 9.25). Unit level: There was no difference in the most frequently prescribed drugs according to the unit level of care; benzylpenicillin and gentamicin were the most freq uently prescribed drugs in all unit levels ( Figure 46). Page | 156 Figure 44. Most frequently prescribed drugs by gestational age group Page | 157 Figure 45. Most frequently prescribed drugs by birth weight group Page | 158 Figure 46. Most frequently prescribed drugs by unit leve l Page | 159 3.5.6 Results for post -hoc objective: Are there any differences in antibiotic prescribing for each gestational age group? The median number of antibiotics prescribed per neonate was two (IQR 2 -2) (Table 18). The median number of different antibiotics prescribed to one neonate decreased with increasing GA, where extremely preterm neonate s were prescribed a median of five different antibiotics (IQR 4 -7). The overall median (IQR) number of days of antibiotics across all GA was 3 (2-5) (Table 18). The number of days of antibiotics, as well as the length of hospital stay, increased with the level of prematurity. In extremely preterm neonates the median length of hospital stay and median number of days on antibiotics per neonate were 86 and 19 , respectively. In term neonates, the median length of hospital stay and median number of days of antibiotics decreased to four and three, respectively. Overall, neonates who were prescribed antibiotics for at least one day were prescribed antibiotics for an average of 60% of their hospital stay, and this percentage increased to 100% in term neonates. The highest absolute number of courses of antibiotics lasting at least five days was amongst term neonates ( 65,487 neonates ) (Table 18). Extremely preterm the highest number of antibiotic courses per neonate, with a median (IQR) of 2 (1 -3). Page | 160 Table 18.

If there was a gap of 2 days between stopping and re - starting antibiotics, they were counted as two different courses Page | 161 Discussion This drug utilisation study is the first study to provide a benchmark for drug use across neonatal units in England and Wales. With the aim of exploring historic patterns of drug use across England and Wales neonatal units, several objectives were answered , and new questions have emerged which need to be answered in future research. This discussion focuses on comparing the findings in the present study with the UK as well as international drug utilisation studies, that used a similar approach. It also incl udes a discussion on the quality of data and issues with the use of NNRD in DUR, strengths and limitations of this study. The suggestions for future work will be highlighted in the final discussion chapter of this thesis. 3.6.1 Comparison with other studies: P opulation characteristics Two prospective studies have been conducted in the UK for the purpose of exploring drug use in neonates (28,29) . One investigated the frequency of off-label and unlicensed drugs use in a single NICU (29) whereas the more recent study by Turner et al. aimed to investigate the most frequently prescribed drugs in several NICUs across the UK and highlighted therapeutic gaps in the field of neonatal pharmacotherapy (28). However, the latter stud y did not report any information regarding the sample size or the characteristics of the population, and only reported the number of NICUs that participated in the survey (37 units). Conroy et al. included a small number of neonates (70 neonates). It was p rospective in design and conducted over a short period of Page | 162 time in a single NICU. In addition to those two prospective studies, a recent multi -European study by Mesek et al. conducted to assess the drug prescribing patterns using a single -day point prevalen ce survey (65). In this study, 15 neonatal u nits from the UK contributed; however, the data of the UK could not be extracted. This is because the results in this study were reported by each European geographic region rather than single countries. When turning to drug utilisation studies worldwide, two studies in the USA have used an approach similar to the present study in exploring drug use in neonatal units, by using large national datasets and setting out similar aims (66,185) which allows better comparison in terms of their findings to the present study. In the current study, 44% of included neonates were female; this matches the findings of Cl ark et al. (185) and Hsieh et al. (66) where both showed 44% of neonates were female. This is also similar to my findings in Chapter 2 where there were more males in 33 out of 56 drug utilisation studies included in the review. The median GA of the neonates included in the present study was 37 weeks (IQR 35 -40) and this can be attributed to the high percentage of term neonates (59%) in the studied population. In the previous studies conducted in the USA , the median GA of the included neonates was 35 (IQR 33 -38), which represents ). Neonates with ELBW accounted for 3.5% of the entire cohort in the present study. This percentage was lower than that the study by Hsieh et al. where 6.5% of the included neonates were ELBW. The length of neonatal hospital stay in this present study i ncreased with the decrease in the GA of the neonatal population (longest for extremely preterm neonates). This is expected, as the medical complications related to Page | 163 prematurity and the intensive care required for preterm neonates results in a longer hospita l stay compared to term ones (105) . This finding cannot be compared to the previous studies in the USA as the length of hospital stay was not reported for each GA group. However, in the present study, the median length of hospi tal stay for the entire cohort was lower (median 5 days, IQR 3 -13) than the previous study by Hsieh et al. (median 10 days, IQR 5 -21). This could be explained by the fact that the majority of neonates in the current study were term, who usually have the sh ortest length of hospital stay. In Hsieh's study the breakdown of admissions by GA group was not reported. However, it might be speculated that the longer neonatal hospital stay in Hsieh's study is due to a proportionally more babies admitted of a younger GA who would be expected to have longer lengths of stay. 3.6.2 Comparison with other studies: Drug use profile Several methods have been reported in the literature quantifying drug use in neonates. Two studies in the USA, that used large datasets, represented drug use descriptively in three ways (courses, exposure, and frequencies), and interestingly, both reported no significant difference in the rank of the frequently prescribed drugs when comparing the three methods (66,185) . In the current study, counts and proportions were used to rank the drugs and represent the frequencies of drug use across the population. Courses were defined differently by both studies that were conducted in the USA. In Clark et al. a cou rse of a drug was defined as the number of times a unique medication was recorded for a single patient with a specific start date. Whereas in Hsieh et al. the course of a drug was defined as number of times Page | 164 a unique drug name was reported in in the databas e. The limited information available in the NNRD database did not allow me to calculate the courses of each drug apart from antibiotics where an accepted definition of a course of antibiotics could be used. With regard to exposure, this term was defined exactly the same by both Clark et al. and Hsieh et al. as the number of unique drug names that were reported for each patient, which can be similarly applied to the counting method in the present study. I have used the term frequency to represent the raw cou nt of each unique drug if it was prescribed at least once to a neonate. However, regardless of these inconsistencies in the terms used to define drug use, the results were similar when comparing the present study with Clark et al. and Hsieh et al. With regards to the drug use profile findings, the present study supports that as the prematurity of neonates increases, the total number of drugs a neonate is exposed to increases (115,119,186) . The median number of drugs prescribed per neonate in England and Wales was lower (median 2, range 0 - 69) than Hsieh et al. (mean 4, range 1 -14), which is a study with a similar setting, design, and approximately similar sample size to the current study (66). A lower median number of drugs per neonate may, again, be due to the larger percentage of the neonates in the present study being term -born, the group that was prescribed the smallest median number of drugs compared to the other GA groups. Gulati et al. assessed the changes in drug use patterns in preterm neonates and very low birth weight neonates and reported a lower number of prescribed drugs per neonate (median 9, IQR 5 -15) (114) . This might be due to the included criteria of preterm neonates in Gulati which was confined to very low birth weight neonates with completed data (5,529 Page | 165 neonates included), whereas in the presented study the cohort of preterm neonates was larger. The top of the list of most frequently prescribed pharmacological group s was antibiotics, with 66% of neonates being prescribed at least one antibiotic during their neonatal stay; this is consistent with 23 studies from the previous literature review that found anti -infectives were the most frequently prescribed group of drug s in their NICUs (Chapter 2). With regards to the most frequently prescribed individual drugs, the present study supports evidence from two studies from the USA that utilised large databases in exploring drug utilisation in their NICUs (66,185) . Penicillin and gentamicin were the most frequently prescribed drugs in the present study as well as the aforeme ntioned studies. Also, this finding broadly supports the work of one of the two previous UK studies, in which gentamicin, followed by benzylpenicillin, were amongst the most frequently prescribed drugs (28). This was not an unexpected finding a s most neonates are treated for presumed infections, especially early onset sepsis, with penicillin and aminoglycosides being the first line antibiotics used in Europe and North America ( Chapter 2). Both are narrow spectrum antibiotics that are usually used to treat early onset sepsis. A review by Russell et al. reported that 70% of neonatal units in the UK use narrow spectrum antibiotics (penicillin/gentamicin) for treating early onset sepsis empi rically, according to an audit across UK neonatal units (187) . Clinicians often opt to use antibiotics empirically due to the fact that early onset sepsis is a life - threatening condition if not treated promptly. Page | 166 Other antibiotics f ound among the top ten most frequently prescribed drugs in the present study were cefotaxime and flucloxacillin. Flucloxacillin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic used often in the empirical management of late onset sepsis in neonates, alongside cefotaxime. I n addition, it is used in the management of skin and soft tissue infections, cellulitis, bone infections, and pneumonia. Cefotaxime, a broad spectrum third generation cephalosporin, is often used in treatment of neonatal sepsis. In Chapter 2, among the inc luded studies, cefotaxime was reported amongst the ten most frequently prescribed antibiotics in Europe by three studies (74,101,122) . However, none of those studies were conducted in the UK, and the two prospective studies that were conducted in the UK in 1999 (29) and 2009 (28) have not cited this drug among the ten most frequently prescribed drugs in the participating neonatal units . The concern with such an agent is the emergence of antibiotic resistance, and the appearance of this drug amongst the ten frequently prescribed drugs in the current study needs to be explored further to avoid the misuse of broad spectrum of antibiotics. In the present study, comparing the number of antibiotics received by neonates in different GA groups showed that term neonates had the shortest length of hospital stay (median 4, IQR 3 -7) with most of those days spent on antibiotics (median percentage of days on antibiotics 100, IQR 60 -100). Term neonates are frequently admitted for suspected sepsis and/or treated empiri cally with antibiotics for this condition. They are then often, very quickly, discharged to the postnatal wards where they may or may not continue on antibiotics. Hence the majority of their time on neonatal units is spent on antibiotics. Page | 167 Extremely preter m neonates were found to be prescribed the highest number of different antibiotics (median 5, IQR 4 -7) and the highest number of days on antibiotics per neonate (median 19, IQR 9 -33). Extremely preterm neonates are more prone to sepsis and require frequent sepsis screening, which leads to more antibiotics being prescribed. Analgesics were amongst the ten most frequently prescribed pharmacological groups, with IV morphine ranked amongst the ten most frequently prescribed drugs. The popularity of this opioid analgesic has been observed in the literature as it was cited by eight studies (high income countries) amongst the ten most frequently prescribed drugs included in Chapter 2. Morphine is used as pain relief and for sedation during invasive mechanical ventilation in preterm neonates. However, it is known to be associated with respiratory depression, which can lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and prolonged time to full enteral feeding (188) . Two randomised controlled trials have been conducted to assess the use of morphine in preterm neonates in terms of its efficacy and safety (189,190) . Both of those trials have not supported the routine use of morphine in ventilated preterm neonates in the short term. Simons et al. report ed the lack of efficacy of morphine to improve pain relief (190) . Use of morphine as a short -term analgesic f or painful procedures was recently explored in the Poppi Study (191) when the study was p rematurely stopped due to the profound respiratory adverse effects of morphine without any suggestion of efficacy. Despite this body of evidence showing lack of efficacy and high risk of adverse effects, in the current study, I found a widespread use of mo rphine especially among preterm neonates. The proportion of neonates being Page | 168 prescribed intravenous morphine increased with a decrease in GA (5% in term vs. 66% in extremely preterm neonates). This suggests that further research and quality improvement work is needed to support evidence -based use of morphine and other opioid analgesics (such as fentanyl) in these cohorts. Other drugs, not including antibiotics and analgesics, that are cited amongst the ten frequently prescribed drugs in this study were caffe ine and surfactants, which are discussed in the next section (variation according to neonatal characteristics). 3.6.3 Variation in prescribed drugs according to neonatal characteristics Caffeine was the most frequently prescribed drug in very and extremely preterm neonates in the current study. These results reflect those of Clark et al. who also cited caffeine citrate as the most frequently prescribed drug in preterm neonates born at GA < 32 weeks, followed by surfactants and vancomycin (185) . Additionally, two prospective studies included in Chapter 2 (80,88) have cited caffeine amongst the most frequently prescribed drug in their neonatal units . One of those studies by Cuzzolin et al. was a multicentre study (36 NICUs) which included a majority of preterm neonates amongst the included population (191/220, 86.8%) with more than half of the and VLBW (140/220, 63.7%) apnoea of prematurity in preterm neonates because of its longer half -life and wider therapeutic range, which leads to reduced drug monitoring and higher cost -effectiveness compared to other Page | 169 methylxanthines (e.g. theophylline) (192,193) . Apnoea of prematurity is a common condition in those born prematurely, especially at lower gestational ages (194) . Also, apnoea of prematurity incidence is inversely correlated with BW, affecting nearly all neonates born weighing < 1000g (195) . When comparing the variation among units of levels of care, there were no differences in the most frequently prescribed drugs; gentamicin and benzylpenicillin were the most prescribed drugs overall in all units and each unit level. Another drug that was frequently cited across all unit levels is pulmonary surfactants. Surfactants were found to be amongst the ten most frequently prescribed drugs in level two units and ranked as number 11 in level three units. Level two and level three units care for neonates who require a higher level of ventilatory support, and the admitted gestational ages are usually between 28 -32 weeks and GA< 28 weeks respectively. Exogenous pulmonary surfactants are usual ly indicated for the prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), a condition that is reported frequently with decreased GA; it is caused by structural immaturity of the lungs and insufficient production of surfactants (113,196) . Hence, the use of those agents is expected in unit levels that care for neonates w ith lower GA and those presenting with medical complications. 3.6.4 Change in drug use over time The change in drug use over time was observed across the entire cohort, and amongst very and extremely preterm cohorts, these observations will be discussed in this section for drugs highlighted in the results of this study. Page | 170 3.6.4.1 Drugs used for GI conditions There was an overall decrease in the percentage of neonates who were prescribed domperidone at least once across the entire cohort and among very and extremely pret erm neonates. The decrease in the use of domperidone, usually given for gastro -oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), maybe a response to the restriction of its use in children following a report by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), released in 2014, with r egard to its association with cardiac side effects (197) . Also, a systematic review conducted in 2014 looked at the management of GORD in a paediatric population. It concluded that there is no robust evidence of using domperidone i n neonates in terms of its efficacy and safety (198) . This decrease in domperidone use was also observed by Cuzzolin et al. (80). Ranitidine is another drug used for GORD. Its use has decreased across the entire cohort. This may be due to safety concerns about its use as well. Ranitidine use has been associated with NEC and increased risk of infections and death in VLBW neonates as published in a study by Terrin et al. (199) . Furthermore, there are no studies to date that have advocated its efficacy and safety in neonates (200) . A systematic review conducted in 2014 on the pharmacologic management of childre n with GORD concluded that weak evidence exists for using H2 antagonist (such as ranitidine) or proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole/ lansoprazole) in managing GORD in children (including neonates) (198) . However, Clark et al. and D u et al. have reported an increase in ranitidine use over the period from 1997 to 2004 (185,186) . Page | 171 These studies assessed drug use prior to the publications that associated use of ranitidine with NEC and infections. Feed thickeners, also used to manage GORD, are commonly used in neonates, in particular preterm neonates , as GORD is common in preterm neonates and can be exacerbated by the immaturity of the oesophagus and the lower oesophageal sphincter (201) . The overall percent age of neonates prescribed feed thickeners decreased over time across the entire cohort, which might be attributed to the change in population composition (an increase in number of term babies in the database every year) rather than an actual shift in drug use (202) . 3.6.4.2 Drugs used for respiratory conditions Caffeine is a respiratory stimulant that is used for apnoea of prematurity. As the number of term neonates included in the cohort each year increased, across the entire cohort, the overall percentage of neonates who were prescribed caffeine at least once decreased from 2010 to 2017. However, the percentage of very and extremely preterm neonates who received caffeine increased over time. The vital role of caffeine in preterm neonates has become apparent following the Caffeine for Apnoea trial (CAP), the largest randomised controlled trial conducted to date on the efficacy and safety of caffeine in preterm neonates (203) . The results of this trial supported the prophylactic use of caffeine for apnoea of prematurity as it reduces the frequency of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). This was followed by a Cochrane review in 2010 evaluating the effect of prophylactic effect of caffeine and included the CAP trial. However, the Cochrane review included Page | 172 only three randomised trials and concluded against the use of prophylactic caffeine for preterm neonates at risk of apnoea due to insufficient available evidence on the effectiveness of this agent in decreasing episodes of apnoea or short term outcomes (e.g. use of mechanical ventilation, bradycar dia, episodes of hypoxaemia) (204) . This review was followed by series of retrospective stud ies and randomised trials supporting, overall, the initiation of caffeine especially within the first three days of life (192) . A systematic review and meta -analysis by Park et al. assessed the early (0 -2 days of life) vs. late use of caffeine ( 3 days of life). This meta -analysis has supported the early init iation of caffeine as it was associated with decreased incidence of death, and BPD without significantly affecting the duration of mechanical ventilation (205) . Another more recent systematic review released in 2017 by Kua and Lee included 14 studies comparing early caffeine administration (< 3 days) with late caffeine, placebo or theophylline. The meta -analysis of cohort studies and randomised trials in this review showed a reduc tion in BPD rate and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (206) . The accumulating evidence in favour of using caffeine early had led to the increase in its use in extremely and very preterm infants. Pulmonary surfactants have been used for the prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome, which is common in preterm neonates who are deficient in surfactant production. The surfactant prescriptions included in this study do not include surfactants given in delivery rooms as those are reported separately in the NNRD. In the included data, overall, the percentage of neonates receiving pulmonary surfactants increased from 2010 to 2017. In the cohort of very preterm neonates only, the percentage of Page | 173 neonate s who have been prescribed pulmonary surfactants at least once increased over time as expected. However, the percentage of extremely preterm neonates who were given pulmonary surfactants fluctuated over time with a general increase from 2010 to 2017, apart from three minor decreases in 2012, 2016 and 2017. This overall increased recording of use may reflect the shift in clinical practice from routinely giving surfactants to preterm neonates in the delivery suite (which would not be recorded in this dataset) to provide early support with continuous positive airway pressure followed by surfactant administration in the neonatal unit if needed. This later administration would be recorded in the database and may have been captured as the increasing trend in use o f surfactant on neonatal units. Some increase in recorded use may also be due to improvement in data entry practices over the years. Evidence supporting the use of surfactants as prophylactic measures for preterm neonates suggests it reduces the risk of p neumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, and mortality according to a systematic review published in 2012 (207) . However, this systematic review highlighted that some large trials included have supported the use of continuo us positive airway pressure as early stabilisation with selective use of surfactants as a treatment strategy rather than prophylactic surfactant use. The use of antenatal steroids also has a role to reduce the risk of RDS and the use of surfactants, which has not been addressed in terms of analysis in the present study. Page | 174 3.6.4.3 Antibiotics and drugs used in infections Benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, are frequently prescribed to term neonates for the empirical treatment of neonatal sepsis, so the increase in the proportion of term neonates corresponds to the increase in percentage neonates being prescribed those drugs at least once over the years in the present study across the entire cohort. Interestingly, the percentage of very preterm neonates who have been pres cribed benzylpenicillin also increased from 2010 to 2017, whereas the use of this agent fluctuated among extremely preterm neonates. Percentage of neonates who have been prescribed amikacin increased from 2011 to 2017 across the entire cohort. This aminoglycoside antibiotic is active against gram -negative bacteria resistant to gentamicin and has a half - life of 7 -14 hours in neonates (GA < 30 weeks) (208) . Prescribers may often opt to use amikacin as an alternative agent in managing neonatal sepsis resistant to gentamicin (209) . This raises the possibility of the emergence of bacterial resistance and warrants further studies exploring the use of amikacin in neonatal units in the UK. There is a decrease in the percentage of neonates prescribed some antibiotics s uch as flucloxacillin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. These trends might be related to the increase in the number of term born infants included in the dataset as at least some of these are more frequently used in preterm neonates. Therefore, the use of the whole population as a denominator to calculate the proportion of neonates being prescribed these drugs to explore their change in use over time might lead to such results. Page | 175 Vancomycin is used for the empirical management of late -onset sepsis due to its cov erage of Coagulase -negative staphylococci, which are found in majority of methicillin -resistant infections (210) . Late -onset sepsis affects 10% of neonates, with more 25% in those bein g VLBW (211) . Flucloxacillin is also used in the management of late -onset sepsis, with an increase in its use as GA decreases (212) . This was also shown in the results of this study as the percentage of neonates who received flucloxacillin increased with decreasing GA (2% term vs. 52% extrem preterm). mostly affects preterm neonates and metronidazole is often used in its management. Cefotaxime is another antibiotic that the present study revealed the steady decrease in the percentage of neonates receivi ng it over time, apart from two minor increases in 2016 and 2017. This decrease might be associated with the emerging findings of the increased risk of fungal infections (candidiasis) in neonates with the use of third generation cephalosporins (213,214) . Two retrospective studies by Hsieh et al. and Gulati et al. investigating the patterns in drug use have also reported a decrease in the use of third generation cephalosporins in the included neonatal care units and attributed the decreas e to the emerg ing information of the increase risk of candida infections with third generation cephalosporins (66,114) . The percentage of neonates who were prescribed ocular chloramphenicol decreased over time across the entire coh ort from 2010 to 2017.This may be due to safety issues. The use of systemic chloramphenicol has been associated with toxicity in neonates, with symptoms such as grey baby syndrome, haemopoietic disturbances, and bone marrow aplasia (215) . Page | 176 However, debates and insufficient evidence exist with regard to the use of the topical formulation (i.e. ocular) for treating neonatal conjunctivitis. The topical form can be absorbed directly th rough the nasal mucosa or swallowed and absorbed into the intestine. This small amount might also be of concern as aplastic anaemia (also known as bone marrow aplasia) may be dose - independent (216) . This un certainty and insufficient evidence for the safety in using the topical form of chloramphenicol might be the drive behind the decrease of its use in neonatal units in England and Wales. Lack of evidence may be attributed to the decrease in the percentage of neonates who have been prescribed topical nystatin which was captured in the database 2014 onwards. Topical nystatin is usually used as a prophylactic agent against invasive fungal infections, especially in those born with VLBW. Inv asive fungal infections are more common in such cohorts due to several risk factors, such as the use of multiple courses of antibiotics, severe illness at birth, and the use of a central catheter (14). A Cochrane systematic review in 2015 (14) assessed the effectiveness of prophylactic oral/topical non -absorbed antifungals (nystatin or miconazole) on the incidence of invasive fungal infection, mortality, and morbidity in very preterm or VLBW neonates. It concluded that there is insufficient data to provide conclusive evidence that supports the efficacy of those agents and recommended larger high -quality trials to resolve the uncertainty of the findings. The use of some antibiotics such as amoxicillin fluctuated over time. In addition, the percentage of neonates who have been prescribed probiotics Page | 177 also fluctuated over time. Probiotic use increased between 2013 to 2014 and then fell in 2015 and 2016. This d emonstrates the continuing debate about the routine use of probiotics in neonates. The Cochrane review published in 2014 compared the efficacy and safety of prophylactic use of probiotics in the prevention of severe NEC or sepsis, or both, in preterm neona tes (217) . This review strongly supported the use of probiotics to prevent severe NEC and all cause of mortality in preterm neonates. However, several reports of probiotic sepsis published in 2015 and 2016 and one neonatal death due to fungal infection from a contaminated probiotic raised concern regarding their use (218,219) . Furthermore, the use of probiotics in the UK may have been discouraged following the results of a large multicentre trial in the UK in 2016 (PIPs trial), (220,221) . This trial has concluded the ineffectiveness of using probiotics in preventing NEC and late -onset sepsis in very preterm neonates. Another randomised trial conducted in the UK, ELFIN trial, to enhance the validity of the available evidence on the use of lactoferrin supplements in neonates, especially preterm ones (222) . Enteral lactoferrin is a supplement that promotes the growth of probiotic bacteria and is involved in several mechanisms of the immune system. It has been proposed as an alternative to compensate for the little/no intake of the mammalian lactoferrin that presents in human breast milk during the early neo natal period. As a result of this trial, the use of enteral lactoferrin was discouraged in very preterm neonates as those supplements did not show any reduction in the risk of late - onset infections and associated morbidity (NEC, ROP, BPD) or mortality in this cohort . Page | 178 3.6.4.4 Other drugs The percentage of neonates being prescribed chlorhexidine fluctuated during the study period across the entire cohort. Ch lorhexidine is a topical antiseptic that is widely used in NICUs to prevent nosocomial infections. Although some fluctuations in recorded use may be due to inconsistency in data entry into electronic patients records, the dilemma in the effective and safe use of antiseptics, including chlorhexidine, in neonates, may have contributed to some variation in use. An evidence -based review by Sathiyamurthy et al. concluded that chlorhexidine is associated with local reactions compared to other antiseptics (iodine) which is associated with an increased risk of systematic absorption and toxicity (223) . In June 2014, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) urged physicians to use chlorhexidine with maximum care in preterm neonates due to several reports of erythema and local bur ns in extremely preterm neonates (224,225) . The percenta ge of extremely preterm neonates who were prescribed insulin at least once increased from 2010 to 2017. Insulin is used in extremely preterm neonates as they are more prone to hyperglycaemia (226) . The increase might be related t o the increase in the records of insulin in the database. Other reasons that may drive increased use of insulin may be related to more intensive nutritional strategies with higher concentrations of parenteral nutrition given to extremely preterm neonates l eading to the increased chance of glucose intolerance and need for insulin. Increase in the percentage of extremely preterm neonates who have been prescribed dexamethasone (from 13.3% in 2010 to 20.2% in 2017) may also drive Page | 179 higher insulin use. Dexamethas one, which can cause hyperglycaemia as one of its adevrse effects, is often prescribed in the prevention and treatment of BPD in preterm neonates. Several Cochrane reviews conducted in 2009, 2010, 2014 and the most recent in 2017 (227-230) investigated the effectiveness and safety of administring postnatal corticosteriods in pereterm neonates at risk of developing BPD. The authors of these reviews concluded that dexamethasone is effective in facilitating extubation and reducing BPD in preterm neonates, but the risk of the adverse effects of such agents may not outweigh the benefit. It is worth highlighting the fact that not all the drugs that are actually prescribed are meticulously entered into NNRD. But as data entry has improved in gen eral over the years, the entry of routinely used drugs, such as sodium supplements, might have increased which then shows as an increase in the percentage of neonates who have been prescribed this supplement. In very preterm neonates, the increase in the p ercentage of neonates being prescribed drugs such as immunisations and topical agents such as phenylephrine have increased over time, which may also be due to improvement in data entries and recording over the years. Supplements such as iron and phosphate are known for their prevalent use in preterm neonates as this cohort are usually born with low stores of phosphate and iron. Therefore, the percentage of extremely preterm neonates who have been prescribed those supplements increased in the study period. Page | 180 3.6.5 NNRD data quality Secondary data sources in drug utilisation studies have been used to estimate incidence, prevalence, duration of drug use, and investigate drug use patterns over periods of time (231) . The NNRD was u sed to answer several questions that were proposed in this drug utilisation study, as so far this is the only database that captures information about drug prescriptions to neonates from almost all neonatal units in the UK. This database is a repository of pre-defined clinical data that is extracted by NDAU quarterly on all neonatal admissions to the NHS from any point of care in England, Wales, and Scotland. It is worth highlighting that by 2012, all neonatal units in those three countries contributed thei r data into the NNRD to cover the whole population admitted to neonatal units. A recent validation study in England set out to assess the validity of the NNRD in terms of the population coverage from 2008 to 2014 by assessing the accuracy and the complete ness of the data held in this database (202) . The completeness was assessed by calculating the percentage of 7 data items of patients' characteristics that includes GA, sex, and BW, and reported over 90% completeness. This study also linked the NNRD with independently collected data from the Office for National Statistics a nd the Probiotics in Preterm babies Study (PiPS) to assess the accuracy of the data and compared the agreement between 44 prespecified items in both databases. The specificity of the NNRD was found to be > 85% for all outcomes and the sensitivity ranged be tween 50 -100%. So, it can be concluded that the completeness and the quality of data held in the NNRD is high, which assures its applicability for research purpose use (202) . Page | 181 Despite these assurances on data quality and completeness, this study revealed several drawbacks of the NNRD when used for drug utilisation studies. F irst, not all neonates who received drugs are admitted to neonatal units and thus, their data are not included in the NNRD. This is because many neonates are treated in postnatal wards, discharged from postnatal wards, or discharged from neonatal units and returned to the hospital to be treated by a paediatric unit and as such, their data is not included in the NNRD. The second observation made while analysing this data is the limitation of the drug data available in this database, which can impede a firm conclusion with regards to the rational use of the drugs in this population; this is the ultimate goal of any drug utilisation study and as such, is deemed pertinent. Although the name of drugs is recorded daily, limited information was available on the route of administration, such as some drugs were coded as 'morphine -iv' and 'beclomethasone -inhaler', while most others were missing such information. There was no information recorded on the dose given, actual duration, adverse effects, and most importantly the indication of drug use. Thirdly, poor coding of the drugs is another drawback of the NNRD, as all drugs were coded in free text with several incorrect spellings as illustrated in the coding section of this study. Also, there were many unrecognised dr ug entries encountered while extracting the drugs, and all were excluded from the analysis. For example, 41 neonates were prescribed 'supplements' and four neonates were prescribed an 'unlisted drug'. So, there was no standardisation of coding such as thos e by WHO -ATC classification system Page | 182 that was observed in other drug utilisation studies that appeared in the previous review chapter. Diagnosis coding had some drawbacks that was observed while analysing the characteristics of neonates with no drugs. First, 22% (n=137,578) of the included neonates across the entire cohort and 39% (n=74,698) of those who were not prescribed any drugs had no entries of diagnosis at admission. The reason for missing such necessary entry is worth to be explored. Also, the term ' other' in diagnosis at admission was used in at least 7% (n=46,373) of the entire cohort and in at least 10 % (n=18,540) of neonates who have not been prescribed any drugs. Using a general broad entry, such as other, requires further exploration to underst and what this term exactly includes. The fourth observation related to the data quality that may constitute a limitation of this work is the fact that admission criteria appear to have changed over the study period. This is demonstrated by the increase in the number of neonates admitted every year, especially those born at term gestations. Consequently, the interpretation of some drugs used, especially those that are used mostly in preterm neonates is not representative of actual change in use when the who le cohort is considered together. Lastly, data entered at the point of care (i.e. Bager.net platform) by a variety of staff, who might not necessarily be those who prescribed the drug or be appropriately trained in data entry (175) . How drugs are entered into the dataset may between units and from one year to another and some changes in drug use over time might be due to these variations rather than actual change is use. Page | 183 While some data are known to be accurate and complete such as those related to the population characteristics as per the validation study mentioned earlier (202) , the accuracy and completeness of other important data points for a drug utilisation study such as those related to the drugs have not been evaluated or validated. Despite these limitations, NNRD provides a unique opportunity to conduct large scale data analysis and this study has utilised this to produce an overall picture of drug utilisation in neonatal units in England and Wales. 3.6.6 What does this study add? This is the largest study to date reporting on drug utilisation in neonates in England and Wales. It is the first study that has used a national database to explore drug use in neonates and to lay the groundwork for future researchers interested in this field. Furthermore, this study has explored the usefulness, as well as the drawbacks, of the NNRD when used in drug utilisation research. The variety of designs and methods used in drug utilisation studies in neonates have been pointed out in a systematic review by Rosli et al. (2017), which highlighted the need for future research to identify the best measure in quantifying drug utilisation in this age group (10). For the UK, there were no studies that investigated drug use patterns in neonates on a national level. And since there is still no gold standard to quantify drug consumption in neonates as pointed by Rosli et al., the use of secondary data sources can prov ide an initial step towards exploring drug use in neonatal units in the UK. The results of this study are generalisable as it is a multicentre study and includes data from more than half a million Page | 184 neonates and captured medication use over an eight year per iod. Previous studies conducted in the UK, both prospective, included either a small sample size (one NICU) (29) or had a low response rate from participating units (28). Thus, both had insufficient data to describe drug use in neonatal units in the UK to be generalisable. Another strength is that the present study has sub -analysed drug use across the neonatal population according to different GA, BW, and level of care. This was not observed in the UK studies or drug utilisation studies in the USA that have used a national dataset. Drug utilisation in neonates is dynamic and is prone to changes with different neonatal GA or BW as it was seen from the findings of the current study. This is because each age or BW group of neonates is admitted wit h different conditions and requires tailored neonatal care. In summary, this study lays the groundwork for future research on the use of drugs in neonates. It has identified the most frequently prescribed drugs across neonatal units in England and Wales a nd whether these drugs have changed in frequency of use over an eight -year period. In the UK, one of the main therapeutic gaps that requires research, as identified by previous drug utilisation studies and highlighted by clinicians, is PDA (28). PDA pharmacological management is one of the most challenging areas in neonat al therapeutics . Several studies exist in the literature aiming towards finding the optimal management of this condition that affects preterm neonates. Indomethacin, ibuprofen and more recently paracetamol are the most studied drugs that are used in management of PDA, with several controversies that exist around them in terms of their efficacy and safety. Page | 185 Therefore, I chose to further explore drug use in PDA across the same time period, to look at the prescribing pattern of those three drugs and whether it has changed over time. This will be further detailed in the next chapter (Chapter 4). Page | 186 CHAPTER 4 DRUG UTILISATION IN PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS (PDA) ACROSS NEONATAL UNITS IN ENGLAND AND WALES Introduction Management of PDA remains one of the most debated and challenging areas in neonatal therapeutics. As discussed in Chapter 1, PDA can be managed pharmacologically with indomethacin, ibuprofen, and m ost recently paracetamol. Surgery may, sometimes, be used in case of failure or contraindication of those agents. In Chapter 3, I found that among extremely preterm neonates, 21% were prescribed ibuprofen at least once; this drug was ranked as number 25 in the top 50 drugs ( detailed in 9.19). PDA, although present at birth at all gestation al age , is a condition that mostly adversely affects very and extremely preterm neonates. Delayed closure of PDA in very preterm neonates with intraventricular haemorrhage necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), BPD, and higher mortality (232) . In addition, small to moderate PDA tends to close spontaneously especially in those born over 28 weeks and often left without any treatment (33). In addition to ibuprofen, as shown in Chapter 3, 8% and 25% of very and extremely pret erm neonates respectively were prescribed paracetamol at least once. Paracetamol may have been prescribed either as an analgesic or Page | 187 for PDA treatment although its use as an analgesic is limited as is thought to have a poor effect in postoperative pain and procedures in neonates (233) . In this chapter, I aimed to do an analysis of different treatment modalities used in PDA management in extremely and very preterm neonates across neonatal units in England and Wales and to investigate if their use has changed over time. Study design This was a retrospective pharmacoepidemiologic study to explore drug utilisation in PDA management from 2010 to 2017 across neonatal units in England and Wales. The same dataset National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD) that was used as in Chapter 3. Aim and objectives The aim of this study was an analysis of different treatment modalities used in PDA management in extremely and very preterm neonates across neonatal units in England and Wales and to investigate if their use has changed over time. Five main objectives were set out to approach this aim. Page | 188 Objective 1: What is the prevalence of PDA in <32 weeks neonates across neonatal units in England and Wales , and has it changed over time? Objective 2: What is the prevalence of no treatment in neonates who have a record of PDA, and has it changed over time? Objective 3: What is the prevalence of use of each PDA treatment strategy across neonatal units in England and Wales from 2010 to 2017 and has it changed over time? Objective 4: What is the prevalence of use of paracetamol in neonates with PDA across neonatal units in England and Wales? Objective 5: What is the duration of treatment for the drugs used for treating PDA? Page | 189 Methods A detailed overview of the study dataset is described in the previous chapter of drug utilisation patterns in neonatal units in England and Wales ( Chapter 3). 4.4.1 Study dataset and population characteristics All neonates admitted to a neonatal unit in England or Wales from 01 January 2010 to 31 December 2017 with a GA < 32 weeks (very and extremely preterm neonates only) were eligible for inclusion. This restriction in GA was selected a s PDA mostly affects very and extremely preterm neonates. Neonates who met exclusion criteria as in Chapter 3 were excluded from this analysis too. The population demographics were summarised for the entire cohort, neonates with PDA, neonates without PDA.Page | 190 4.4.2 Specific methods for each objective 4.4.2.1 Objective 1: What is the prevalence of PDA in <32 weeks neonates across neonatal units in England and Wales , and has it changed over time? For this objective, the following steps were undertaken: 1. The Daily dataset was in spected for variables that indicate a record of PDA. This could either involve an actual record of the PDA in one of the diagnosis variables or one of the treatments (record of drugs/ surgery) in one of the variables that indicate a treatment of PDA. Three variables were identified in the daily dataset, and those include the 'diagnosis day' variable, 'treatment for PDA' variable, and the 'drugs day' variable. 2. The Episode dataset was inspected for variables that also could indicate a record of PDA whether from diagnosis or treatment aspects ('diagnosis at admission' variable and the 'principal diagnosis at discharge' variables). 3. Created different binary variabl es for each source of information which were coded as zero and one. ' Zero' was generated to indicate that a neonate does not have a PDA diagnosis record or has not been treated with ibuprofen/indomethacin/surgery at any point of their neonatal stay. ' One' was generated to indicate a diagnosis or a treatment of PDA (drugs/surgery) of a neonate at any point during their neonatal stay. Page | 191 4. Converted the daily dataset into one row per neonate dataset, and only neonates who had a GA of less than 32 were kept. The E pisode dataset is a one row per neonate dataset; therefore, this conversion was not required but neonates who had a GA 32 weeks were dropped from it. 5. Merged the information of the PDA from episode and daily datasets to create a final PDA dataset to iden tify records of PDA that could assist in calculating the prevalence of it. 6. Created variable to merge all the sources of information that indicate a neonate has a record of PDA in one variable based on either diagnosis or treatment variables. Appendix 9.26 details the variables used to calculate the number of neonates who have PDA records based on diagnosis and/or treatment indicating the presence of a PDA. Following these steps, prevalence of PDA was calculated. These steps were also repeated to demonstrat e the PDA prevalence for each GA. Page | 192 4.4.2.2 Objective 2: What is the prevalence of no treatment in neonates who had PDA, and has it changed over time? Neonates included in this analysis were only those with a record of PDA. For this analysis paracetamol was include d as a treatment strategy as it can be used for PDA. Prevalence of any treatment was calculated based on either including or excluding paracetamol as a treatment strategy in addition to other treatment strategies (indomethacin, ibuprofen and surgery). Then for each cohort the corresponding prevalence of no treatment was calculated. Similar variables created for each treatment strategy in the previous objectives ( 2 and 3 ) were used. Page | 193 4.4.2.3 Objective 3: What is the prevalence of use of ea ch PDA treatment strategy across neonatal units in England and Wales from 2010 to 2017 , and has it changed over time? For this objective, neonates who have been identified to have a PDA record from the first objective were analysed only. Then the following steps were followed: 1. Created variables to identify neonates who had records of ibuprofen or indomethacin at least once during their neonatal stay. And this was either identified from 'drugs day' variable or 'treatment for PDA' variable. 2. Created a variab le to identify neonates who had records of surgery from 'treatment for PDA' variable. 3. Counted the variables used to calculate the number of neonates who had any treatment strategy for PDA (detailed in 9.27). 4. The number of neonates receiving any treatment strategy either alone or in combination was counted across the entire cohort and across each GA. 5. The prevalence of each trea tment received was calculated by dividing the number of neonates having a record of each treatment strategy by the total number of neonates admitted each month with a record of PDA. Page | 194 4.4.2.4 Objective 4: What is the prevalence of use of paracetamol in neonates wit h PDA across neonatal units in England and Wales? This was done by first comparing paracetamol prevalence in neonates who had PDA records and those who don't and making the assumption that neonates with any record of paracetamol only (i.e. neonates have no records of indomethacin/surgery/ibuprofen or text diagnosis) does not indicate that a neonate have PDA. This was assumed as only one percent of neonates (n=478) across the entire cohort had a record of ibuprofen or indomethacin or surgery as treatment for PDA without having recorded text diagnosis. Appendix 9.28 details the variables used to extract records of paracetamol across the entire cohort. Then the prevalence in (%) of paracetamol use in neonates with and without PDA was calculated. Page | 195 4.4.2.5 Objective 5: What is the duration of treatment for the drugs used for treating PDA? The analysis was done across the entire cohort (all neonates < 32 weeks) for indomethacin, ibuprofen, and paracetamol. The same codes that were use d in objective three to extract the free text of the drugs were used. Then the following steps were followed: 1. Sorted the data by two variables: anonymised ID of the neonate and the 'daydateanon' variables. The daydateanon, is a variable that shows the time difference between time of birth and each particular date in the database. From this variable the first day of life of each neonate can be estimated, which can be considered as the 'chronological age' of the neonate. 2. Created a variable to identify first day of prescribing of each drug amongst those who were prescribed that drug. 3. The total number of days of prescribing variable was created for each drug. 4. Variables in steps ( two and three ) were kept and all duplicates were dropped. 5. All the steps from one to four were repeated for all daily data files. 6. The created demographic data file was merged into the daily data file to summarise demographics of the neonates for this question.

Of these, 18,181 (30%) had a diagnosis of PDA identified within the database (Table 19). Neonates with PDA records had smaller GA and lower BW when compared to those with no records of PDA. Also, a higher percentage of neonates with PDA records died (11%) before discha rge compared to those without any PDA records (8%).Page | 198 Table 19.

The overall prevalence of PDA in this study period was 30% ( Table 19). Despite month to month variations, overall, the prevalence of PDA has not changed from 2010 to 2017 (Figure 48). A detailed table of neonates who have PDA based on the d iagnosis and/ or treatment indicating a PDA on each month of admission is attached in appendix 9.29. Figure 49 shows the prevalence of PDA by GA weeks and shows that prevalence increased with decreasing GA except in 22 - and 23 -weeks neonates who had a lower prevalence. Page | 200 Figure 48.

In this section, use of indomethacin, ibuprofen, and PDA surgery are presented. Paracetamol use is described in section 4.5.5 . Overall, as shown in Table 21, amongst neonates who have records of PDA, 35% (6,384 neonates) had at least one treatment strateg y. More were treated with ibuprofen (4,926 (27%)) to indomethacin (1,417 (8%)) or surgery (1,037 (6%)). Figure 51 shows the prevalence of use of each treatment strategy across each GA. The use of treatment increased with decreasing GA. Use of treatment strategies in combinations (including paracetamol) in neonates with PDA by GA is given in appendix 9.30. Page | 205 Table 21.

From January 2010 to April 2011 as there was an increase in the percentage of neonates with records of ibuprofen use with a decline in the percentage of neonates with records of indomethacin use. Following Apri l 2011, several fluctuations in the prevalence of use of each modality. Figure 52 shows an overall decline in the use of surgery as treatment strategy over time.

As shown in Table 22, 27% (4,889 neonates) of neonates with PDA had paracetamol use recorded at some point during their neona tal stay. However, only 8% (3,280 neonates) of neonates without PDA had paracetamol use recorded. Table 22.

It has been the subject of numerous clinical trials and its optimal management is an unresolved debate. 4.6.1 The prevalence of PDA In the present study, 30% of ne onates born at <32 weeks gestation had a record of PDA and/or a treatment indicating the presence of a PDA. Previously published reports estimate that on day three of life neonates with GA< 32 weeks the prevalence of PDA is 20 to 50% (234-236). Similar to other reports (237) , I also found tha t the prevalence of PDA increased with decreasing GA (15% at 28 -31 weeks compared to 61% at 22 -27 weeks). Prevalence of PDA was lower at 22 and 23 gestation al age which may be due to lower survival at these gestations or incomplete records. A previous analysis of NNRD data showed that record completeness is much lower for 23 week neonates as compared to those who are more mature (202) . 4.6.2 Change in the prevalence of no treatment over time I found that, in the study period, there was an increase in the percentage of neonates who did not received any treatment for PDA. The ductu s closes without any treatment in most babies especially those who are less immature, have BW > 1000 g, and who do not have respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (237,238) . However, late ductal closure in preterm neonates or those with RDS does not always happen spontaneously and Page | 214 interventions are needed. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that inducing ductal closure in preterm neonates, particularly in the first two weeks after birth, does not improve the long term outcomes (237,239) . 4.6.3 Change in use of ibuprofen and indomethacin over time I found that more neonates with a diagnosis of PDA were treated with ibuprofen as compared to indomethacin and surgery. The popularity of ibuprofen reflects the evidence, published as several Cochrane reviews (59) (45,47,60,240) that show that ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin and is associated with a lower risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and transient renal i nsufficiency when used for PDA closure. I found variations in the use of the three treatment strategies. Use of ibuprofen increased in 2010 -2011 possibly following the publication of the first Cochrane review (59). In April 2011, amongst neonates who had a record of PDA, 40% (79 neonates) had ibuprofen and only 2% (three neonates) had indomethacin. This pattern is however not consistent. My results show several fluctuations in the use of each treatment modality reflecting the continuous debates and the dilemma in the PDA management. Interestingly, use of indomethacin increased again from April 2011 until the mid of 2012 and with a parallel decrease in use of ibuprofen. By this time, other evidence was emerging describing higher risks of BPD with use of ibuprofen as compared to indomethacin. Jones et al. (241) , in a systematic review, reported that IV ibuprofen was associated with approximately 30% increase in the risk of BPD compared to intravenous indomethacin [RR:1.28 (95% CI 1.03 to or placebo [RR 1.29 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.70)]. Further Page | 215 fluctuations with decrease in use of indomethacin and increase in use of ibuprofen from November 2012 continue to refle ct the ongoing debate . The revised Cochrane review (59) reiterated that ibuprofen is the drug of choice for treatment of PDA and that there was no statistically significant increase in the risk of chronic lung disease, a finding that contradicted Jones et al. Thereafter, we see periods of fluctuations but an overall increase in the use of ibuprofen as compared to indomethacin. 4.6.4 Change is use of surgery over time Surgical intervention is generally reserved for those whose ductus fails to close despite pharmacological treatment, those who have contraindications to pharmacological treatment, or those who have a large duct which may pose a greater risk such as poor neurodevelopmental outcome, BPD and severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (235) . I found that only 6% of neonates (n=1,037) with PDA had surgery either alone or in combination with pharmacologic treatment(s). There was a decline in the percentage of neonates with a diagnosis of PDA who had surgery between 201 0 (183 neonates, 9% of those with PDA) and 2017 (79 neonates, 3% of those with PDA). Page | 216 4.6.5 Use of paracetamol Paracetamol can be used as an analgesic as well as for PDA closure. In this study, 13% (n=8,169) neonates out of the entire cohort had paracetamol. Among those who had a record of a PDA, 27% (n=4,889) had paracetamol PDA diagnosis had paracetamol. As it was not possible to link the drug with the indication of use, I am unable to be certain that paracetamol was used for PDA closure or for analgesia. Although limited, evidence suggests that paracetamol has a poor analgesic effect in preterm neonates (242) . Allegaert et al. evaluated the efficacy of paracetamol for postoperative pain in neonates and found three prospective studies. This review concluded that paracetamol h as a very poor analgesic effect when used for postprocedural pain such as heel prick and retinopathy of prematurity screening (233) . My findings support the limited use of paracetamol in preterm neonates as I found very few neonates who did not have a PDA but had use of paracetamol rec orded. In addition, some neonates may have received the paracetamol for PDA closure, but a diagnosis of PDA was not recorded. On the other hand, some neonates with a record of PDA may have had the paracetamol as an analgesic. Assuming that in neonates wi th a record of PDA, paracetamol was used for PDA closure, from March 2015, there is an increase in the number of neonates treated with paracetamol. In March 2015, the first Cochrane review that investigated the efficacy and safety of paracetamol in preterm neonates with PDA was published (243) . It concluded that oral paracetamol is as Page | 217 effective as oral ibuprofen in PDA closure. However, this review also highlighted the importance of assessing the long -term outcomes of paracetamol when used in preterm neonates. Further updates in in 2018 (244) and 2020 (46) had similar conclusions. 4.6.6 Duration of pharmacological treatment The median number of days of indomethacin use was 3 (range 1 -22, IQR 2 - 5). Different dosage regimens of indom ethacin have been used in studies across the literature. A review by Pacifici et al. reported several studies that used indomethacin for three days while others used it for six days (245) . Most studies used three days regimen rather than six days and attained a higher rat e of PDA closure of 91% (246,247) . Interestingly, in my study, there was a neonate who had indomethacin use recorded for 22 days. This was a very preterm neonate with PDA, respiratory distress, and BPD and is likely to be a data entry error. The median number of days of ibuprofen use was 3 (range 1 -55, IQR 2 -4). This supports the approved regimen for PDA treatment with ibuprofen wh ich consists of three doses given 24 hours apart (248) . An extremely prete rm neonate had 55 days of ibuprofen, and following data inspection, this neonate was also diagnosed with BPD at 36 weeks, in addition to PDA, RDS and septicaemia. This is also likely to be a data entry error. The median number of days of paracetamol use w as also 3 (range 1 -101, IQR 1 -7). Singh and Gooding (2016) summarised the available literature on the role of paracetamol in PDA closure including two RCTs and 14 observational studies (249) . The range of paracetamol duration (in days) Page | 218 reported in those studies was 1 to 11 days, with half of the studies ( eight studies) reporting three or 3-6 days as duration of the treatment. The median first day on which indomethacin was given was day eight (range 1-173, IQR 4 -15) at the median corrected GA 27 (range 23 -52, IQR 25 -29) weeks. Ibuprofen, similarly, was given first on day 10 (range 1 -257, IQR 6 - 15) and at the median corrected GA of 27 (range 23 -63, IQR 26 -29) weeks. These results suggest that mo st clinicians deferring the pharmacological treatment of PDA to the second week of life, possibly waiting for spontaneous ductal closure. Ductal closure is delayed in preterm neonates. By day 7, 36% and 32% of 27 - 28 weeks and 25 -26 weeks neonates, respect ively will have spontaneous ductal closure (250) . Another study reported that 75% of 27 weeks neonates (or weighing < 1000 g) with persistent PDA will attain spontaneous ductal closure by hospital discharge (31,32) . The med ian first day on which paracetamol was given was day 56 (6 -8 weeks of life) . This maybe related to neonates receiving paracetamol following immunisation . With high rates of spontaneous ductal closure that discourage the early treatment and the fear of co -morbidities associated with persistent PDA, the optimal time to treat PDA remains a dilemma. A recent retrospective study in Sweden investigated whether the timing of indomethacin or ibuprofen is associated with a higher risk of BPD or secondary PDA surger y or death before three months of age in extremely preterm neonates (252) . This study concluded that the timing of pharmacological treatment with indomethacin or ibuprofen is not associated with death or secondary PDA surgery and also Page | 219 the late start of PDA treatment (beyond seven day s of postnatal age) was associated with a lower risk of BPD. 4.6.7 Limitations and strengths This is the first study to provide an overall picture of PDA prevalence across neonatal units in England and Wales. Also, it has compared the different approaches (no treatment vs . treatment) used to manage this condition in terms of their prevalence and whether they have changed over time. I further extended the analyses to provide an overview of the prevalence of pharmacological agents used for PDA and the change in their pattern of use over time. However, limitations of the NNRD and limited data access hinder full analysis to describe current practice. It was not possible to link the use of drugs with their specific indications. This was not an issue f or indomethacin and ibuprofen, drugs that are exclusively use for PDA closure. For paracetamol, however, I was unable to discern if the neonates who had this drug received it for PDA closure or for analgesia. Also, the increase in the use of paracetamol mi ght be related to neonates being received immunisation during their hospital stay, which often lasts longer due to their prematurity. This is another area that required to be further explored from the data set. The quality of data entered into the NNRD al so raised some issues. The human factor of data entry error cannot be neglected (e.g. indomethacin used for 22 days or ibuprofen for 55 days). Page | 220 Another limitation is that I was unable to gather any information of the dose, regimen, or route of administrati on of the drugs. Also, as I did not have access to results of any echocardiography or other clinical assessment, I have no information on how PDA was diagnosed, basis for decisions to treat or not, and whether the treatment was successful. 4.6.8 Conclusion In summary, this study is a useful overview of how PDA is managed across neonatal units in England and Wales, but further research is needed to define details. Some additional areas for future work which are highlighted in Chapter 7. Although these results show that pharmacological treatment is often used in PDA management, the debate about whether to treat at all continues. In this context, understanding the limitations and dangers of using drugs is an important aspect. Ibuprofen is a ssociated with less risk of NEC and transient renal impairment compared to indomethacin (60,240) but it does have significant side effects. Cochrane and other systematic reviews incl ude RCTs or quasi -experimental randomised trials and mostly focus on the efficacy of the intervention. They report the most known and anticipated adverse effects. These do not give the complete profile of adverse effects of any treatment modality. Several observational studies published in 2012 have reported cases of pulmonary hypertension (51) and GI bleeding (53) associated with ibuprofen use which might lead cli nicians to prefer alternative treatment or no treatment. In the next chapter I present an in -depth systematic review of the adverse effects of ibuprofen when used in preterm neonates with PDA. Page | 221 CHAPTER 5 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META - ANALYSES OF ADVERSE EFFECTS OF IBU PROFEN IN PRETERM NEONATES WITH P DA Introduction 5.1.1 Pharmacological management of PDA and their adverse effects: Is it worth a review? Indomethacin and ibuprofen are pharmacological agents used in PDA management (253-258). Indomethacin has been used since it received' Food an d Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 1985. Ibuprofen lysine was approved by the FDA in 2006. Both are non -selective cyclooxygenase inhibiting nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). They block the biosynthesis of prostaglandin from arachidonic ac id (253) . It is believed that their mechanism of actio n manifest s through the reduction of plasma concentration of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (259) . PGE2 is known to be the most potent circu latory prostaglandin responsible for the patency of the ductus especially in premature neonates (33). The immature ductus in preterm neonates (particularly those < 28 gestational weeks) is more sensitive to the vasodilating effects o f PGE2 (256) . Hence, NSAIDs including ibuprofen may be used for the closure of PDA. The rising frequency of adverse effects such as renal (e.g. oliguria, rise in serum creatinine), gastro -intestinal ( intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) ) (15) associated with indomethacin use in neonates triggered the researchers to Page | 222 use an alternative i.e. ibuprofen. These adverse effects are attributed to the reduction in renal an d mesenteric blood flow caused by indomethacin (261) . Also, indomethacin reduces cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebral oxygenation (260) . Unlike indomethacin, ibuprofen is not associated with a reduction in mesenteric and cerebral b lood flow and has a smaller effect on renal perfusion when compared to indomethacin (262) . Other adverse effects such as hyperbilirubinemia are also cause of a concern. Both ibup rofen and indomethacin are highly protein bound (253) . However, the small dose of indomethacin used in neonates is unlikely to reach drug concentration that displaces bilirubin from albumin binding sites (263) . With ibuprofen, an increase risk of hyperbilirubinemia occurs due to its high percent (99%) of protein binding which can displace bilirubin from albumin (255,264) . 5.1.2 Defining medication harm in neonates: Adapted definitions in this review The definition of medication harm is a challenge (265) . Falconer et al. collated key studies that define or classify terminology used for medication harm. This review concluded diversity in terminology which may hinder appropriate extrapolation and comparison of data (266) . In my study, the terms \"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs )\", \"toxicity\", and \"adverse effects\" are used to describe medication harm. ADR is defined by the WHO as \"a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease, or the modification of physiologic function\" (267) . It can be taken from this definition, that there is a causal relationship between the medication and the Page | 223 reactions. However, in neonates, this may be difficult to apply or assume. This is because ADR def inition -related assumptions (known doses and pharmacology, quantification of interactions, the anticipation of side effects or secondary effects, etc.) cannot be speculated (268) . Hence, further broader definition of ADRs may be better adopted in this population as suggeste d by Allegaert and Anker. They describe ADR as \"an unintended and harmful effect resulting from the use of medications intended for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons (irrespective of the dose)\" (268) . The rationale of using the term \"adverse effects\" in this review is to f ollow the overall framework methodology suggested by Adverse Effects Subgroup of the Cochrane Collaboration (269) . This term was introduced in 1966 to describe harms related to drugs, chemicals or biological agents when used in accepted dosage (270) . Toxicity is a type of ADRs that occur when there is an over ingestion of the drug, elevated blood levels or enhance d drug effects (e.g. impaired metabolism, drug -drug or drug -disease interactions) (271) . The term adverse event is used in clinical trials and covers b oth drug -related and non -drug related events. According to the WHO, an adverse drug event is defined as ' any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a pharmaceutical product but that does not necessarily have a causal relation t o the treatment' (267) . Adverse drug event extends beyond ADRs to include ha rm that is related from medication errors (e.g. under doses, overdoses, etc.) (272) . All ADRs are adverse events but not vice versa (266) . Page | 224 5.1.3 Aim of the systematic review The aim of this systematic review is to identify all the reported adverse effects associated with ibuprofen use for PDA closure in preterm neonates , and to quantify, where possible, their risk per 100 patients. This review aims to be comprehensive, with minimal restriction of language, study design, settings, and include all existing published and grey literature. This review is guided by t he following PICO model (Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcomes) summarised in Table 24. Table 24. Summary of the PICO used in this systematic review Population Intervention Comparator Outcomes Preterm neonates (born at < 37 weeks gestational age) Ibuprofen administered by any route, in any dose regimen as treatment or prophylaxis of patent ductus arteriosus Any conservative, pharmacological or surgical intervention(s) All reported adverse effects Patients and indications for use of ibuprofen There have been several studies that investigated the efficacy of ibuprofen in PDA management. They have compared the use of ibuprofen as a treatment or prophylaxis for PDA closure. In this review, I have considered use of ibuprofen as \"prophylactic\" where it was administered to all neonates with or without PDA diagnosis who were included based on certain criteria (e.g. Page | 225 gestational age (GA) at birth or birth weight (BW) ). Studies where ibuprofen is given only after a confirmation of echocardiographic or clinical diagnosis of PDA is classified as study using ibuprofen \"as a treatment\". Comparators Studies have compared the In addition, some have compared different dose regimens or different modes of administration of ibuprofen (such as intravenous vs . oral). Adverse effects outcomes The specific product characteristics (SPC) of ibuprofen when used in preterm neonates, lists several adverse effects (273) . The most common are related to renal and blood systems (e.g. increase in serum creatinine and thrombocytopenia). Some other adverse effects such as BPD is also classified as possible adverse effect . However, the causality of such adverse effects is hard to determine in preterm neonates as they may be due to prematurity itself. Such effects cannot be differentiated from those that may have been caused by the direct effect of ibuprofen administration. Methods I followed the methodology detailed in Cochrane Collaboration Handbook and systematic reviews of adverse effects frame work (269,274,275) . The adverse effects systematic review framework was developed to provide a detailed approach on conducting systematic reviews of adverse effects. It was structured through a consensus of expert reviewers and members of Page | 226 adverse effects Subgroup of the Cochrane Collaboration. For this study, a protocol was established and registered in Prospero (ID: 67600; registration number: CRD 42018067600). 5.2.1 Search strategy 5.2.1.1 Information sources A systematic literature search was carried out to identify all relevant papers describing the adverse effects or ADRs of ibuprofen in prematu re neonates. The search strategy was developed and tested with the help of the specialised paediatric clinical librarian, Cathryn James, of the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Trust. Eight databases [EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), Cochrane Library, CINAHL, British Nursing Index (BNI), and clinicaltrials.gov] were searched from 1964 to 31 January 2019 without any other limits. This start date was selected because ibuprofen was developed in 1964 (276) . A combination of both 'free text' and Medical subject headings 'MeSH terms' was applied for each database separately to attain a comprehensive literature search. The results of the search were then combined via the End -note software (Thomson Reuters, version X7.7.1) to remove duplications. Duplicates that were not removed by electronic de - duplication were subsequently removed manually. Information on studies in progress, or research reported in the grey literature was sought by searching clinical trials.gov and greylit.org, res pectively. In addition, further attempts to identify studies were made by contacting the authors of published conference abstracts and examining the reference lists of all retrieved articles. Page | 227 5.2.1.2 Search terms Various 'free text' keywords, as well as MeSH terms were used as search terms across the selected databases to provide a comprehensive search. For the population search terms, premature or preterm infants are defined as infants who were born prior to GA of 37 weeks (WHO 2016) (5). Therefore 'prematurity, preterm, premature*, premmie*, preemie*' were used to represent population free text key words search terms. For the intervention free text key words search terms, a combination of both generic and most commonly used brand names of ibuprofen was applied in the search strategy. Most commonly used brand names of ibuprofen were 'ibumetin, motrin, nuprin, advil, nuro fen, brufen'. These were used in addition to the generic name 'ibuprofen'. For the adevrse effects outcomes free text keywords search terms, were as recommended by the Cochrane Adverse Effects Methods Group (CAEM) for systematic reviews of adverse effect s (269) . For example, 'toxicity* or adverse drug reaction* or side effect* or adverse effect*'. All of the previously mentioned free text key words were used in addition to the MeSH terms identified in each database separately. The full search strategy is detailed in 9.32. 5.2.1.3 Study selection Both title and abstracts of the search results were screened independently by two rev iewers for initial inclusion, and any disagreements were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Ms. Janine Abramson (Research Nurse, Page | 228 School of Medicine, University of Nottingham) was the second reviewer and disagreeements were resolved by my supervisor , Dr Ojha. The two reviewers (Ms. Abramson and I) then assessed the full texts for inclusion. 5.2.1.4 Inclusion and exclusion criteria All studies in which ibuprofen is used for treatment or prophylaxis of PDA closure and reported adverse effects/ADRs without an y restriction in the study design and publication type were included. This includes randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ), case reports, case series, and prospective and retrospective cohort studies. Systematic reviews, laboratory studies such as pharmacokin etic or pharmacodynamics (PKPD) evaluations, studies in adults (more than 18 years old of age), studies in the paediatric population but where ibuprofen was used for indications other than PDA closure, studies where information about adverse effects in pre mature neonates could not be extracted separately were excluded. In addition, reviews, editorials, preliminary reports and letters which did not include any primary data on ibuprofen adverse effects when used for PDA closure were also excluded. Conference poster abstracts were assessed for primary data of ibuprofen adverse effects when used in premature neonates, and the authors were contacted by email for more information if those data were relevant to the review question. 5.2.2 Data synthesis and statistical an alysis of the studies All included studies were tabulated (using Microsoft Excel, Version '15' Microsoft Corporation) to summarise the number of neonates who had received ibuprofen and the number of adverse effects reported. Page | 229 The risk of adverse effects per 100 patients was calculated from the RCTs and prospective cohort studies only. The risk was calculated by dividing the number of patients with a particular adverse effect by the total number of patients who received ibuprofen and then multiplyi ng it by 100. This was done following the methodology of previous systematic reviews of drug toxicity (277) . Due to the sufficient number of t he included RCTs, meta -analys es were performed, using RevMan (version 5.3), to obtain an overall measure of the risk of adverse effects. To ensure homogeneity, RCTs were grouped together according to the types of comparators. The risk ratio was calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity was measured using I\u00b2. This statistical test measures the variation across the studies in a percentage figure. Fixed effect model was used in the forest plots where I\u00b2 was less than 50 %, and ran dom effect model was used where I\u00b2 is more than 50% (25). 5.2.3 Quality assessment Two reviewers (Ms. Abramson or Dr Ojha and I) assessed all of the RCTs included in the review independently for risk of bias (ROB) using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (278) . The domains for assessment included the following: Sequence generation (selection bias) Allocation concealment (selection bias) Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) Page | 230 Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) Selective reporting (reporting bias) Any other bias (defined as any bias related to the funding/sponsorship and other issues related to the methodology) Non-randomised trials (observational studies) were assessed by two reviewers (Ms. Abramson or Dr Ojha and I) using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal tools to ass ess the quality of the observational studies (e.g. case reports, cohort studies, case series, etc.) (279) . Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion and adjudication by a third reviewer. However, it is of note that the decisions made by using this tool are subjective and it is recommended that all studies are included after assessing their quality (279) . 5.2.4 Data extraction I extracted all data using a structured proforma. To ensure completeness, al l data extraction was performed in duplicate and a selection (20%) were checked by Dr Ojha. The data extracted includes: All types and number of adverse effects related to ibuprofen administration Route of ibuprofen administration (IV or oral) Dose and frequency of ibuprofen Number of courses of ibuprofen administered Indication of ibuprofen given for PDA (treatment/proph ylaxis) Page | 231 Comparator of ibuprofen used in the study (e.g. placebo, indomethacin, paracetamol, other ibuprofen formulations) Adverse effects that led to discontinuation of ibuprofen, and adverse effects of ibuprofen that resulted in prolonged hospital stay or hospital admission or death. Adverse effects were classified according to the organ system and tabulated with the corres ponding numbers. Page | 232 Results 5.3.1 Description of chracteristics of included studies Initial search returned 2458 titles and abstracts and after exclusions 93 studies were included in the review. Reason of excluded studies and trials are given in appendix 9.33 and 9.34. Figure 54 represents the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analysis (PRISMA) flow chart of the total number of references identified in the searched databases. This included 42 RCTs. Three publications, Pistulli et al., Eras et al. and Oncel et al. (280-282) were follo w up publicaiton of the same RCT reported in Hoxha et al., Gokmen et al. and Oncel et al.

In six RCTs, ibuprofen was used as a prophylaxis (354-357,359,365) and in 35 for treatment (179,262,280 -307,309 -315,363) . Characteristics of the included RCTs and the reported adverse effects is given in appendix 9.37. The next sections summarise the results of the meta -analyses of the adverse effects reported in the included RCTs. 259 | P a g e 5.3.7.1 GI adverse effects NEC was the most frequently reported GI adverse effect among the included RCTs (40 RCTs), followed by GI bleeding (17 RCTs), intestinal/ bowel perforation (15 RCTs), and feeding difficulties (four RCTs) ( Table 27). The meta -analyses for NEC did not show any difference between ibuprofen when compared to placebo/no treatment or when compared to paracetamol. Ibuprofen had a lower risk of NEC ten RCTs) are discussed in section 5.3.7.7 . Higher risk of G I bleeding was found with ibuprofen when compared to placebo/no treatment [three no diffe rence in the risk of GI bleeding when ibuprofen was compared to indomethacin ( Figure 72).

There was no difference in the risk of oliguria when ibuprofen was compared to placebo/no treatment (two RCTs) and when compared to paracetamol (three RCTs). However, lower risk of oliguria with ibuprofen was found 73). Other studies ( eight RCTs) are discussed in section 5.3.7.7 . The pre -defined cut of f for definition of oliguria in this review was < 1 ml/kg/hour. In studies with unclear definition of oliguria or that defined oliguria as urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/hr are also included. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis including only those studies that de fined oliguria as < 1 ml/kg/h was performed for the comparison p<0.0001] and this did not change the outcome. Higher risk of renal failure was found with ibup rofen when p=0.002], and no difference in the risk of renal failure when ibuprofen was compared to placebo (one RCT) or indomethacin (two RCTs). One RCT is described in sec tion 5.3.7.7 . 264 | P a g e Twenty two RCTs reported the absolute levels of serum creatinine following ibuprofen administration (18 RCTs detailed in Table 28, four RCTs detailed in section 5.3.7.7 ). In four RCTs, only the i ncrease in serum creatinine following ibuprofen administration was reported (one RCT detailed in Table 28, three RCTs detailed in section 5.3.7.7 ). 265 | P a g e Table 28.

Other studies ( seven RCTs) are in section 5.3.7.7 . The meta -analyses for IVH (any grad e) did not show any difference between ibuprofen when compared to placebo/no treatment; indomethacin; or paracetamol ( Figure 74). Also, there was no difference in IVH ( grade 3 -4) when ibuprofen was compared to indomethacin .

Pulmonary hypertension necessitating the discontinuation of ibuprofen was reported by a prospective cohort study in 11 neonates (360) .

They are considered the determinant type of reviews in cases where different ef fective treatment strategies exist, or where the controversy includes the option to offer no pharmacological treatment as in the case of PDA management in preterm neonates (366) . Inclusio n of non -randomised studies is the distinctive characteristic of systematic reviews that focus on adverse effects as compared to those that are primarily designed to study the efficacy of an intervention such as the Cochrane reviews for ibuprofen. Unlike n on-randomised (observational) studies, RCTs are known to be less useful in detecting uncommon/rare adverse effects/ADRs . This is due to their restrictive nature in the number of enrolled participants, time frame, and poor reporting of adverse effects/ADRs as most RCTs focus on efficacy outcomes (367) . Among non -randomised studies, prospective study designs (including prospective cohort studies) are ranked higher in the hierarchy of evidence compared to retrospective designs (368) . Both prospective and retrospective cohort studies are set to 303 | P a g e explore the association between multiple exposures and multiple outcomes. However, retrospective cohort studies are limited due to potential incompleteness of records (i.e. ad verse effects in this review). This is because of the nature of retrospective studies in which the outcomes are identified and analysed from previously collected records (369) . Prospective cohort studies involve follow up of cohorts with an objective of investigating the association between exposure and the outcomes that are recorded as they occur and hence there is less chance of mi ssing outcomes of interest (370) . Hence prospective cohort study designs are useful in providing information about the incidence and the risk factors of common adverse effects/ADRs (371-373). Despite these advantages, prospective cohort studies are known to be limited by a loss to follow up and selection bias (367) . New and rare adverse effects/ADRs can be only captured from individual case reports and case series. Their inclusion in any adverse effects systematic reviews is therefore crucial to paint the c omplete picture of potential harm form the use of any medicine (367) . 5.4.2 Summary of the results Adverse effects from randomised controlled trials: The most frequently reported GI and renal adverse effects were NEC and oliguria respectively. The most frequently reported res piratory and nervous system adverse effects cases were BPD, (including all definitions) and IVH respectively. It can be argued that these adverse effects were due to prematurity or were complications of PDA and may not be attributed to the direct effect o f 304 | P a g e ibuprofen . Several reviews pointed that PDA co mplications are due to two main reasons; fluid overload and the steal phenomenon (374) . Prolonged ventilation, needed as a consequence of fluid overload, can lead to an increased risk of BPD and nosocomial infections. The steal phenomenon is a change in the blood flow movement in splanchnic and renal vessels due to left-to-right shunting. This phenomenon can result in an increased risk of NEC, bowel perforation, worsening in renal impairment and even intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)/IVH (374,375) . Adverse effects from non -randomised studies: The majority of adverse effects were captured within the retrospective cohort studies (2,264 adverse effects) as compared to prospective cohort studies (309 adverse effects). Among retrospective cohort studies, there are two studies reporting around 40% of the total adverse effects extracted from all other retro spective cohort studies (1102 adverse effects /2264 total adverse effects) (327,329) . This high number of adverse effects reported can be attributed to the fact that they were large multicentre studies that captured adverse effects, respectively . It is important to highlight that one retrospective cohort study by Gulack et al. reported an ambiguous outcome 'any adverse event' in 802 neonates receiving ibuprofen compared to 3,395 in neonates receiving indomethacin (329) . These data were not included in this review as the nature and type of these adverse effects could not be classified. Another important finding is the dis continuation of ibuprofen because of toxicity which was reported in 56 neonates. The majority of adverse effects that led to discontinuation of treatment in RCTs were GI bleeding and renal 305 | P a g e adverse effects (including renal insufficiency, oliguria and an inc rease in serum Eleven neonates had pulmonary hypertension following ibuprofen administration in a prospective cohort study which necessitate discontinuation of the drug (360) . 5.4.3 Comparison with existing systematic reviews There are three recent Cochrane reviews assessing effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen in preterm neonates with PDA. Two were published in 2018 where ibuprofen was used for PDA treatment with different comparators (47,244) whereas one published in 2019 where ibuprofen was used for PDA prophylaxis (57). There were some differences in the studies included between this systematic review and the Cochrane reviews. Four RCTs that were included in this review and w ere not included in the Cochrane reviews (287,311,312,314) . Those studies with the reasons for their exclusion were not stated in the Cochrane reviews. In contrast, there were 13 RCTs included in the Cochrane reviews and were not included in this review. Reasons for excluding these studies in this review are tabulated below ( Table 41). 306 | P a g e Table 41.

Therefore, it was excluded. BPD, bronchopulmonary dysplasia; BUN, these differences in the number of studies included, the overall meta -analyses result of this review are very similar to those of the Cochrane reviews. With regards to GI adverse effects, the meta -analys es in this review concluded that ibuprofen h as a lower risk of NEC difference in this outcome when ibuprofen was compared to placebo or paracetamol. These results are consistent with the Cochrane rev this review ibuprofen was found to have higher risk of GI bleeding when compared to placebo [ three studies; 140 patients; RR: 2.09, 95% 003] no difference in this outcome when compared to indomethacin. This was similarly reported in the Cochrane reviews when comparing ibuprofen to placebo [5 studies; 282 patients; RR: 308 | P a g e 2.05, 95% 1.19 to 3.51, to 0.69, p <0.001 ] with no difference when compared to indomethacin. Among renal adverse effects, meta -analyses of this review concluded that there was no significant difference of oliguria when comparing ibuprofen to placeb o or paracetamol. However, a significant difference of oliguria was found when ibuprofen was compared with indomethacin, with lower risks in the ibuprofen group [ five studies; 626 0.25 576 patients; RR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.54, p <0.001 ]. Finally, there was no difference in the risk of IVH when comparing the three pharmacological agents in this review and in the Cochrane reviews. 5.4.4 Comparisons with othe r adverse effects systematic reviews Previous adverse effects systematic reviews in paediatrics have highlighted that most adverse effects are reported in prospective cohort studies rather than RCTs (277,388) . For instance, a safety systematic review on the use of lamotrigine in paediatrics identified 12 prospective cohort studies (1,524 adverse effects) and nine RCTs (549 adverse effects) (388) . The other review that explored the safety of use of levetiracetam in paediatrics also reported more adverse effects from 2 0 prospective cohort studies (897 adverse effects) vs . six RCTs (415 adverse effects) (277) . Contrary to these expectations, the present system atic review revealed that most adverse effects were found in RCTs rather than prospective cohort studies. Thirty - nine RCTs reported forty per cent (1,841 adverse effects) of the total number 309 | P a g e of adverse effects whereas only seven prospective cohort studies reported five per cent (232 adverse effects) of the total adverse effects in this review. While different to the trend in paediatric studies, this distribution is similar to other systematic reviews in neonates (389) . A recent systematic review with an aim to investigate the safety of azit hromycin in neonates yielded more adverse effects in RCTs compared to cohort studies. Four RCTs in this review reported 340 adverse effects following azithromycin use compared to three cohort studies that reported only 16 adverse effects (389) . This may be because in neonatal medicine, there is possibly a move towards more RCTs with fewer publications of prospective cohort studies. Additionally, a number of recent RCTs have adopted the recommendation of more carefully reporting adverse effects of the intervention as compared to older RCTs. This is due to the updates on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement to include harms which was published in 2010 (390) . This update has added ten further new recommendations into the original CONSORT statement to address harms -related issues and improve the quality of reporting harms in RCTs (391) . Despite this, change is slow. A recent systematic review highlighted the inconsistency in reporting of harms in RCTs with an obvious heterogeneity between the included studies for each recomm endation (390) . This review pointed out that almost half of health research journals (19/41 (46%)) provided online instructions to authors about the CONSORT guideline without a referral to the CONSORT - harms statement. This would suggest a need for further adherence to the CONSORT -harms by both researchers and editorial team of medical/health journals. 310 | P a g e The improvement in the practice of reporting adverse effects should make an assessment of the toxicity of new drugs easier to perform and more robust. This can be useful when assessing ADRs in neonates (especially premature neonates) where a definite conclusion about the causality of the events as a result of a drug or prematurity might be difficul t to differentiate. The high number of adverse effects captured from retrospective cohort studies in this review is due to the larger number of patients than those included in RCTs. Such large retrospective database derived reports are expected to be publ ished more and more due to the establishment of large neonatal databases of routinely collected data such as the National Neonatal Research Database in the UK. These data, although a wealthy repository of very useful information, must be interpreted with c aution because retrospective studies are more prone to reporting bias when compared to prospective studies. The methodology followed in this systematic review is consistent with the framework proposed by Loke et al. for conducting systematic reviews of adverse effects. A recent systematic review of levetiracetam toxicity in children followed a similar methodological approach (277) . Unlike the levetiracetam systematic review, this review has included all non -randomised studies following quality assessment without any requirements to fulfil certain quality criteria. This is in keeping with the recommendation for using the JBI tool for quality asses sment which has been used here. This assessment is subjective and it is considered appropriate to include all the data of adverse effects from non -randomised studies (279) . Until a validated tool for non -311 | P a g e randomised studies is developed, it is better to include all the non - randomised studies when conducting adverse effects systematic reviews. 5.4.5 Strengths and limitations In addition to inclusion of all types of study designs and a comprehensive documentation of all reported adverse effects of ibuprofen in preterm neonates, the strengths of this systematic review include the clear definition of the research qu estion (using PICO model), and adherence to an explicit protocol that was developed and registered prior to the analysis (Prospero [CRD 42018067600]). The robust nature of the search strategy also added strength to the review. This included expert input in to selecting the search terms, searching several electronic databases and the grey literature, and including all study designs with no restriction of languages. Another strength is that all studies (RCTS and non -RCTs) were reviewed by two reviewers (and a third one where there was a conflict). There are some limitations that need to be highlighted. First, some studies were retrieved in non -English language (Chinese, Turkish, Polish, and Iranian) that could not be translated (384,382,383,381,392,393) . Another limitation is that the tool used for quality assessment of non -randomised studies is no t standardised. However, currently there is no perfect tool for assessment of non -randomised studies and the tool developed by JBI was used. This is used widely to assess the quality of many types of study designs (cohort, case -control, case report) (279) and was therefore selected for this review. A new tool, the ROBINS -I, which is under assessment by Cochrane group, may provide a more rigorous conclusion when assessing 312 | P a g e risk of bias of non -randomised studies compared to the tool used in this review (394) . It must also be noted that this systematic review is limited by the difficulty of assessing adverse effects in preterm neonates. This is due to the fact that those events may be attributed to prematurity or the haemodynamic consequences of PDA or they might have been due to the direct effect of ibuprofen (273) . 5.4.6 Conclusion There are still many unanswered questions about the best available treatment strate gy when managing PDA, especially in extremely preterm neonates who are more resistant to treatment and more prone to harm. This systematic review has identified the most common and some rare adverse effects encountered following ibuprofen administration in preterm neonates with PDA across all study designs, with quantification of their risks in RCTs and prospective cohort studies. This can assist neonatologists and other healthcare providers in their daily clinical judgement making when it comes to weighing the risks and benefits associated with ibuprofen use and prevent unnecessary exposure to ibuprofen in a cohort of neonates who may be managed conservatively and who have a high risk of adverse outcomes. Combined results from RCTs and prospective cohort studies in our review show that oliguria is the most commonly reported adverse effect among the renal adverse effects. However, the high number of rising serum creatinine after treatment from retrospective studies should also be considered when treating pr eterm neonates with ibuprofen for PDA. 313 | P a g e Following the count of ibuprofen and indomethacin adverse effects in retrospective cohort studies that compared both agents, ibuprofen was associated with a smaller number of adverse effects compared to indomethacin (1691 vs . 3586 adverse effects). So, this can highlight the fact that ibuprofen might be favourable to indomethacin in terms of its safety. Paracetamol, a new emerging pharmacological option, might be favoured when compared to ibuprofen as it is found to be associated with less risk of GI bleeding. However, there is a need for more studies that aim towards its' long-term benefits when used in preterm neonates with PDA.Page | 314 CHAPTER 6 REVIEW OF NEONATAL DRUG FORMULARIES AND OTHER PRACTICE GUIDELINES USED IN NEONATAL UNITS IN THE UK Introduction In the previous chapters, I have focussed on the pattern of drug use in neonatal units in England and Wales by applying quantitative methods on data in a national database. These analyses; however, do not give any insight into how these drugs are used, e.g. there is no information in the National Neonatal Resea rch Database ( NNRD ) about the indications and recommended doses for any of these drugs. Quality, which is a determinant of irrational practice, can be assessed through an evaluation of current practices by investigating the use of local guidelines. This wi ll enable us to identify whether prescribing information in the drug formularies and available practice guidelines are consistent across different units. Tools to detect inappropriate prescribing have been developed widely in the elderly. However, there a re few in paediatrics and none in neonates. After scoping the literature, only three tools were found to be developed for the paediatric population (395-397). The first was proposed in France and was named Pediatric: Omission of Prescriptions and Inappropriate Prescriptions (POPI) to identify inappropriate pre scribing in this population (395) . However, the use of this tool would be inappropriate to aid prescribers in neonata l medicine, as most of the criteria are for children, not neonates. Another study in UK and Ireland attempted to develop indicators of potentially inappropriate Page | 315 prescribing in children (PIPc) in a primary care setting (396) , which also have not inclu ded criteria for neonates. The most recent tool in the paediatric population was conducted in the UK by Corrick et al. with the aim of evaluating the applicability of the POPI tool to UK practice and modified, where necessary, to apply it in paediatric pra ctice (397) . This tool is also inappropriate to be used for the neonatal population as it was mainly directed for infants and children. It is worth considering the creation of such a tool to tackle irrational prescribing in the neonatal population, especially with th e inconsistencies that are found across the collected neonatal drug information resources. This study will aim to explore the information held in current neonatal formularies and practice guideline s used in the UK and compare prescribing information extracted from them. The British National Formulary for Children (BNF -C) is considered the standard dosing information that meets the WHO standards for national formularies (28) and is widely used in the UK. However, it is worth exploring if there are any further resources used across neonatal units in the UK and whether prescribing information in those formularies and other clinical practice guidelines is similar or different. Page | 316 6.1.1 Study aim and objectives The aim of this study was to review the neonatal drug formularies and any other existing neonatal practice guidelines used in different neonatal units in the UK. This was a multi -centre observational study conducted over 12 months from 1st April 2018 to 1st April 2019 and set out to address two main questions with the following objectives: Objective 1: Is the prescribing information of the frequently prescribed drugs stated in neonatal drug formularies and or local practice guidelines used in UK neonatal units similar, or do they differ? Objective 2: Is the prescribing information of the drugs used in PDA management (indomethacin, ibuprofen, and paracetamol) stated in neonatal drug formularies and or local practice guide lines used in UK neonatal units similar, or do they differ? Page | 317 Methods 6.2.1 Study design A prospective multi -centre study was conducted over 12 months (1/4/2018 to 1/4/2019) to obtain drug formularies and or practice guidelines used in neonatal units in the UK , or drug formularies that are exclusively aimed for the use of prescribing in older children were excluded. This study was reviewed and approved by the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (FMHS) Research Ethics Committee (FMHS Ref no: 283 - 1803) (attached in 9.40). 6.2.2 Data collection Drug resources were requested electronically via two main networks; the Neonatal and Paediatric Pharmacists Group (NPPG) and t he British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM). NPPG is a professional network formed in 1994, to improve the care of neonates, infants and children by advancing the personal development of pharmacists and the provision of quality pharmacy services. B APM is the UK's leading organisation of clinicians in perinatal medicine and has representation in every neonatal unit in the UK, founded in Bristol since 1976. Data collection was done by the researcher of the study (myself). This was conducted by circul ating an invitation letter electronically to the members of those two networks. A copy of the participation invite letter is attached in 9.41. However, because the NPPG network is an establishment of the UK Page | 318 National Health Service ( NHS ) network, it was necessary to contact a member of the NPPG as an initial step to prompt the post of the invite letter at the NPPG network message board. The initial message was posted by Dr Sharon Conroy (SC) (associate professor at school of medicine, UoN) who is also an active member at the NPPG network. The initial invite letter was posted on 28th April 2018 by SC and resulted in two responses from the members by May 2018. Following this initial step, I then followed the data collection process. Since there were no further responses by June 2018, an attempt was made to contact the NNPG network administrator, Peter Polland, to circulate the invite letter. The invite letter was then ema iled to all NPPG members by the network administrator, which resulted in nine further responses by mid -November 2018. At that time, an email was sent to BAPM to circulate the invite letter to their members; there was no response so a reminder was sent in M arch 2019 and again no response was received. A final contact was made with the NPPG to collate further responses. However, an email received from the administrator indicated that the timing was difficult to resend an email to all members (Figure 79). Page | 319 Figure 79. Data collection during the study period and the responses gained Page | 320 6.2.3 Data extraction and analysis The contents of all collected drug resources were analysed descriptively using Microsoft Excel (version 16, 64 bit). For objective 1: relevant information about the most frequently prescribed drugs were extracted. The drugs were chosen based on the result s of Chapter 3. These drugs were the ten most frequently prescribed drugs identified across neonatal units in England and Wales: benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, caffeine, (IV), flucloxacillin and pulmonary surfactants. However, sodium, p hosphate and iron, which are also amongst the ten frequently prescribed drugs were not included in this analysis, as they are used in neonatal units as supplements. The data extracted from the formularies were the following: Indication of use Dosing regim en Instruction for administration Contraindications Cautions Monitoring for adverse effects Similarly, this was also done for objective 2, with the above categories of information on the drugs used in PDA (ibuprofen, indomethaci n, and paracetamol) extracted. Page | 321 Results 6.3.1 Participating units' characteristics Eleven neonatal units responded to the participation letter during the study period. Only eight units shared their neonatal drug formularies or guidelines or both. The total numb er of shared neonatal formularies/guidelines was nine, as one unit shared two local formularies (Table 42). As can be seen from the table, seven out of eight responding units were from different places in England, and one was from West -Scotland. Four of the units were level three neonatal units (NICUs), while two were level two (LNU) units. However, two particip ants shared the formularies/ guideline of the trust or several hospitals, so the level of the unit cannot be assigned. Most of the units shared electronic links to their formularies/neonatal guidelines. However, three out of eight units shared an electroni c copy of their formularies. A total of nine shared documents that include six drug formularies, and three clinical practice guidelines were received and included for the descriptive analysis. Page | 322 Table 42.

Antibiotics included in the list of ten most frequently prescribed drugs were: benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, and flucloxacillin. 6.3.2.1 most frequently prescribed drugs across neonatal units in England and Wales. This drug was cited across all the collected formularies and practice guidelines as being used for sepsis or meningitis. According to the BNF -C, this antib iotic is prescribed for neonatal sepsis as 25 mg/kg every 12 hours (increased every 8 hours) in those up to 7 days and as 25 mg/kg every 8 hours (increased to 50 mg/kg every 8 hours) in neonates 7 to 28 days (398) . Five out of the nine shared drug resources stated its use in sepsis. However, there are different dose regimens used which varied between 25 to 100 mg/kg either twice or three times per day depending on the severity of the infection and the gestational age of the neonate. Resources from four units have mentioned the dosage regimen according to the postnatal age of the neonate ( Table 43) whereas the fifth unit did not state the specific dose for sepsis. Three units out of four (uni ts 2,3, and 6) use 50 mg/kg twice daily for neonates < seven days and 50 mg/kg three times daily for neonates seven to 28 days. The fourth unit halved the above -mentioned dosage regimens for those ages. Page | 324 Similarly, for meningitis different dose regimens we re cited across the shared drug information resources, which varied between 50 to 100 mg/kg twice or three times per day. The detailed prescribing information of benzylpenicillin obtained from the participating units is in 9.42.Page | 325 Table 43. The dosage regimen of benzylpenicillin in sepsis Unit Indication Neonatal age Dosage regimen Unit 2 Sepsis (suspected at birth) <7 days of age 50mg/kg 12 hourly 7 to 28 days of age 50mg/kg 8 hourly >28 days of age 50mg/kg 6 hourly Unit 3 Sepsis (suspected at birth) <7 days of age 50mg/kg 12 hourly 7 to 28 days of age 50mg/kg 8 hourly >28 days of age 50mg/kg 6 hourly Unit 6 Early -onset sepsis Preterm 50mg/kg/dose 12 hourly Term < 7 days 50mg/kg/dose 12 hourly Term 7 to 28 days 50mg/kg /dose 8 hourly Unit 7 Early -onset sepsis < 7 days 25 mg/kg every 12 hours; change to 25mg/kg every 8 hours 7 to 28 days 25 mg/kg every 8 hours; increased if necessary, to 50 mg/kg every 8 hours in severe infection Page | 326 6.3.2.2 Gentamicin Gentamicin is usually administered with benzylpenicillin for the management of neonatal sepsis, particularly early -onset sepsis (EOS ). According to the BNF-C, the recommended dose is 5 mg/kg every 36 hours in neonates up to 7 days of age, and every 24 hours in neonates 7 to 28 days of age (399) . It was the second most frequently prescribed drug in neonatal units in England and Wales. Four out of nine shared drug information resources stated the use of gentamicin for sepsis, with three of them in EOS. The remaining five indicated the use of gentamicin in infections as general without specifying the type of infection. Also, similarly to benzylpenicillin, various doses were found to be used that ranged between 3 to 5 mg/kg every 24 or 36 hours and started at different gestational ages. However, two units used the same regimen of gentamicin in sepsis for neonates < seven days of age (5mg/kg/dose once every 36 hours) and neonates seven days (5mg/ kg/dose once every 24 hours). Gentamicin requires regular therapeutic drug monitoring due to its potential ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Eight out of the nine information resources stated the gentamicin therapeutic monitoring protocol. All of the eight resources indicated that trough levels should be taken with seven of them stated that this should be before the second dose. Peak levels were required by five out of the eight formularies while three of them indicated that it is required only if there was no response to the treatment (Figure 80). The detailed prescribing information of gentamicin obtained from the participating units is in 9.43. Page | 327 Figure 80. Therapeutic gentamicin monitoring from eight neonatal care units Page | 328 6.3.2.3 Cefotaxime Cefotaxime is a third -generation cephalosporin frequently used among neonates. According to the BNF -C, this antibiotic is used in infections sensitive to Gram -positive and Gram -negative bacteria and severe infections/meningitis. The doses vary according to neonatal age and type of infection, for example, 25mg/kg every 12 hours is prescribed for neonates up to 7 days in Gram -positive and Gram -negative infections and increased to 50 mg/kg every 12 hours in severe infections and meningitis (400) . One out of the nine resources indicated the use of cefotaxime as first -line in late-onset sepsis, three stated its broad term use in infections, four indicated its use in infections and meningitis, and one indicated its use only in meningitis. The doses were stated by seven units and were mostly similar, with six units using it at 50 mg/kg at different hours based on the neonatal age ( Figure 81). The detailed prescribing information of cefotaxime obtained from the participating units is in 9.44. Page | 329 Figure 81. Cefotaxime variability in dosage regimen (stated by seven units) Page | 330 6.3.2.4 Flucloxacillin According to the BNF-C, flucloxacillin is indicated for use in neonates with infections related to staphylococcal (e.g. meningitis) , skin (e.g. impetigo ), and osteomyelitis. The doses vary according to the neonatal age and the type of infection. For instance, the recommend ed dose in neonates up to 7 days of age with osteomyelitis is 50 -100 mg/kg every 12 hours (every 8 hours in neonates 7 to 20 days). Whereas in neonates up to 7 days of age with impetigo, the recommended dose is 25mg/kg every 12 hours (every 8 hours in neon ates 7 to 20 days) (401) . Four out of the nine drug information resources stated the use of flucloxacillin in infections, whereas four were more specific and stated its use in staphylococcal infections, and one indicated its use in skin and systemic infections. The doses of fluclox acillin also varied between units, ranges between 25 to 100 mg/kg administered at different intervals based on different neonatal gestational ages ( Figure 82). The detailed prescribing information of flucloxacillin obtained from the participating units is in 9.45. Page | 331 Figure 82. Number of units using different dosage regimen of flucloxacillin to treat infection Page | 332 6.3.2.5 Caffeine (citrate) Caffeine is a respiratory stimulant used for apnoea of prematurity. As per BNF-C, the recommended dose of caffeine citrate in neonatal apnoea is 20mg/kg (loading dose), then maintenance dose of 5mg/kg once daily (may increase above 20mg/kg) and started 24 hours post the loading dose (402) . As of August 2013 and due to safety information, all licensed preparations of caffeine are required to be labelled as caffeine citrate to minimise the risk of dosing errors as a recommendation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) (193) . All units participating in this study have stated caffeine as caffeine citrate in their formularies and or clinical practice guidelines and had the sa me indication for its use which is apnoea of prematurity. Eight out of the nine resources stated the doses of caffeine citrate as a loading and maintenance dose, whereas one resource did not state any dose recommendation for caffeine citrate. The loading d ose is given as 20 mg/kg in all the participating units. However, the maintenance dose varied between units ( Figure 83). Also, all the resources highlighted the fact th at monitoring of caffeine levels is unnecessary unless adverse symptoms persist, or there is evidence of toxicity. An interesting observation is that caffeine is usually advised to be given via intravenous (IV) infusion as a bolus injection is associated w ith sudden changes in blood pressure. Most of the resources have stated that the direction for its use is via slow IV infusion. However, one practice guideline stated a direction of using bolus infusion of caffeine citrate when given as a maintenance dose. Page | 333 The detailed prescribing information of caffeine obtained from the participating units is in 9.46. Figure 83. Number of units using different maintenance dosage regimen of caffeine citrate Page | 334 6.3.2.6 Morphine (IV) Morphine (sulphate) has a few different indications in the neonatal population. It is used primarily as a sedative and analgesic. Also , it has been used to treat neonates with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), which refers to a collective set of withdrawal symptoms that neonates can develop following birth if their mothers have taken addictive drugs such as narcotics, antidepressants, or potentially addictive drugs. According to the BNF -C, the recommended dose of IV morphine as analgesic is 50 mcg/kg every 6 hours and adjusted later according to response. Whereas, if used for NAS, the recommended dose of morphine is 40 mcg/kg every 4 ho urs (orally), and increased if necessary (403) . Seven resources out of nine have reported the do sage of morphine according to the indication, whereas the remaining two stated general dosing. The dosing for morphine, when used as pre -medication for intubation, was similar in four out of seven resources given as 100 mcg/kg. However, the loading dose of morphine when indicated for analgesia or sedation varied between 50 -100 mcg/kg ( Figure 84). Regarding Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ( NAS), the doses were mostly given at 40 mcg/kg every 4 hours, and morphine was given as an oral preparation in most of the formularies for this indication. The detailed prescribing information of morphine obtained from the participating units is in 9.47. Page | 335 Figure 84. Number of units using a different loading dose of morphine when used as analgesic or sedation Page | 336 6.3.2.7 Pulmonary surfactants Pulmonary surfactants are used primarily in preterm neonates who develop respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) as a result of their lungs' immaturity, which affects surfactants production (196) . Six out of the nine shared documents cited poractant as a pulmonary surfactant used in their units for preterm neonates with RDS. According to the BNF -C, the recommended dose of poractant alfa wh en treating RDS in neonates is 100 -200 mg/kg, then 100 mg/kg every 12 hours if required (404) . The remain ing three units had no information regarding pulmonary surfactants in their shared documents. Doses were similar and ranged from 100 to 200 mg/kg/dose as an initial dose for RDS treatment. The detailed prescribing information of poractant obtained from the participating units is in 9.48.Page | 337 6.3.3 Objective 2: Is the prescribing information of the drugs used in PDA management (indomethacin, ibuprofen, and paracetamol) stated in neonatal drug formularies and or local practice guidelines used in UK neonatal units similar? 6.3.3.1 Indomethacin Five out of nine drug information resources included indomethacin prescribing information when used in PDA . Indomethacin is one of the drugs used in PDA closure. However, BNF -C does not list any doses for its' use in PDA closure. One resource indicated that indomethacin is used as a second -line agent after ibuprofen, whereas another one stated its use as a first-line drug. Three resources out of five listed the dose regimen of indomethacin used in PDA with two of them (UNIT -1 and UNIT 5 -A) using the same regimen of either 100mcg/kg every 24 hours intravenously for six doses or as a short courses regimen deta iled in ( Figure 85). The detailed prescribing information of indomethacin obtained from the participating units is in 9.49. Page | 338 Figure 85. The dosage regimen of indomethacin for PDA treatment as stated in the drug information resources Page | 339 6.3.3.2 Ibuprofen Eight out o f nine shared drug information resources had information about ibuprofen use in PDA. According to the BNF -C, ibuprofen is used in PDA closure at an initial dose of 10mg/kg, followed by 5mg/kg every 24 hours for two doses and the course maybe repeated after 48 hours if necessary (405) . One of the resources indicated the use of ibuprofen as a second -line drug instead of indomethacin for PDA. Interestingly, all of the shared resources had unified dosage regimens for ibuprofen in PDA, which is: three doses given as slow IV infusion of 10 -5-5 mg/kg at 24 hours intervals. Also, they all suggested a repeated course in case the ductus reopens or has not closed after 48 hours after the first course. Monitoring for renal, hepatic function and urine output were amongst the monitoring parameters dur ing ibuprofen treatment that were cited in the shared resources. The detailed prescribing information of ibuprofen obtained from the participating units is in 9.50. Page | 340 6.3.3.3 Paracetamol Only two out of the nine shared resources listed paracetamol to be used for PDA in addition to its use as an analgesic . The other seven resources listed the indication of paracetamol as an analgesic only. In the BN F-C, there are no doses listed for paracetamol when used in PDA. However, there are doses listed when it is used for pain/pyrexia with discomfort. Paracetamol is indicated at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours for neonates of 32 weeks corrected GA and above as IV infusion (406) . The doses were different as one has specified the doses per ne onatal age at the time of the treatment, whereas the other listed one fixed -dose for all age groups (Table 44).Page | 341 Table 44.

This is due to the vast array of neonatal ages and birth weights, in addition to the immaturity of their organs if born preterm that could affect their r esponse to medicines. All of this can add challenges to clinicians when prescribing and requires referral to such resources, in addition to their clinical judgment, to provide the best therapeutic plan to their patients. The results of this study have shown that there are some similarities in the extracted drug information from the obtained resources, as well as some inconsistencies and these are discussed in the following sections. 6.4.1 Antibiotics I found several differences in the prescribing recommendation s for the most frequently prescribed antibiotics, benzylpenicillin and gentamicin. Benzylpenicillin and gentamicin are used as a first line for sepsis and were stated in four resources to be explicitly used for sepsis. The dosage regimen of benzylpenicilli n reported in three out of these four resources was double that recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines for the treatment of early -onset sepsis/suspected sepsis at birth. One unit only had the same do se recommended by NICE, which is 25 mg/kg 12 hourly for neonates less than a week of age and increased to 8 hourly for neonates between 7 and 28 days (407) . Page | 343 The gentamicin starting dose for early -onset neonatal sepsis is 5mg/kg and repeated every 36 hours in which the interval can be shortened depending on the severity of the illness and the results of the blood culture as per NICE guidelines (407) . Four obtained resources from the neonatal units have stated the use of gentamicin for sepsis with two of them indicating the starting dose of 5mg/kg as per NICE guidelines but with different dosin g intervals depending on the neonatal age. All units have stated the use of gentamicin as a once daily dosage regimen, which is supported by the literature. The most recent Cochrane systematic review by Rao et al. conducted with the aim of comparing and sa fety of once -daily regimen to multiple dosage regimen of gentamicin in suspected or proven sepsis (408) . This systematic review has supported the superiority of the 'once -daily regimen' of gentamicin compared to the 'multiple based on the pharmacokinetic profile. PK of gentamicin varies widely in neonat es with a longer half -life and smaller clearance in preterm neonates compared to term ones (409) . The general recommendation is to attain lower troughs and higher peaks to reduce the toxicity and achieve the efficacy. This can be attained by the 'one dosage regimen' with a hig h loading dose to increase the peak concentration (409) . However, the review suggested the need for further studies that investigates the clinical safety and efficacy of gentamicin. Gentamicin is known to be nephrotoxic and ototoxic with severe toxicity seen after 7 to 10 days of use. Hence, a trough concentration level must be measured, which must be less than 2 mg/l to avoid the toxicity. All units have recommended trough levels of gentamicin to be measured and where stated the level was suggested to be < 2mg/l before commenc ing the next dose. Page | 344 Cefotaxime is known to be used for late -onset sepsis (LOS) or meningitis in neonates. The participating units have listed the dosage regimen of cefotaxime for meningitis and severe infections. Only one resource stated the use of cefotaxi me for LOS with a dose of 50mg/kg at different frequencies, according to GA. According to the NICE guidelines on neonatal infections, there is still uncertainty and lack of evidence -based guidelines to treat LOS (410) . However, the BNFc stated the dose of cefotaxime for LOS as 25mg/kg at different frequencies, according to GA. The latest national surveillance from the UK indicated that 95 -97% of isolated organisms from LOS blood samples were susceptible to gentamicin and flucloxacillin/ penicillin (411) . Cefotaxime dosage regimen in neonatal meningitis and severe infections were sta ted in all units per the BNFc and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) as 50mg/kg at different frequencies, according to GA. 6.4.2 Caffeine The prescribing of caffeine as caffeine citrate with a loading dose of 20 mg/kg was standardised acr oss sources. This loading dose is equivalent to the dose used in several studies across the literature, and it is the licensed loading dose as per the summary of product characteristics of caffeine citrate for the treatment of apnoea of prematurity (AOP) (203) . Apnoea of prematurity, defined as a cessation of breathing for 20 seconds or longer or a shorter pause accompanied by bradycardia , cyanosis, or pallor in preterm neonates (194) . The maintenance dose of caffeine citrate varied between units. One resource stated higher maintenance dosage regimen of caffeine of 10 mg Page | 345 twice daily compared the other units stating the maintenance dose of caffeine as once daily. The BNFc stated that the m aintenance dose of caffeine citrate up to 20mg/kg daily can be considered if therapeutic efficacy was not achieved, taking into consideration the toxicity levels (412) . To date, inconsistencies in the dosage regimen for caffeine citrates still exist. A recent review by Moschino et al. summarised the available evidence about the different dosage regimen of caffeine citrate (192). Moschino et al. pointed out that based on the suggestions of the available evidence from recent systematic reviews, a higher dosage regimen of caffeine citrate may be better in improving neonatal outcomes which include reducing episodes of apnoea, extubating failure, and BPD at 36 weeks. However, higher rates of tachycardia were observed. The range of dosage regimen stated in the systematic reviews varied for the loading dose between 10 to 80 mg (or > 20mg) and for the maintenance dose between 5 to 3 0 mg (or > 10mg) (413- 415). What is less clear is the long-term outcomes and safety data on the high dosage regimen of caffeine which may hav e led to the continual use of the standard dosage regimen of caffeine citrate (loading dose: 20 mg/kg, maintenance dose: 5 -10 mg/kg). This dosage regimen has been used in one of the landmarks randomised controlled trials of caffeine when used in preterm ne onates, which is the 'Caffeine for Apnoea of Prematurity' (CAP) (203) . None of the resources indicated the duration of caffeine citrate when used in AOP, but one unit has stated that the treatment should be held for five days before the actual date of the discharge. This is done to allow for the continuous monitoring for the toxicity of caffeine as the half -life of caffeine in neonates is between 60 -140 hours. All units highlighted the importance of Page | 346 labelling and prescr ibing caffeine as caffeine citrate as this can avoid dosing errors. This is due to the fact that the dose of caffeine citrate is equivalent to twice that of caffeine when expressed as caffeine base (193) . 6.4.3 Pulmonary surfactants Pulmonary surfactants are vital in the management of neonates with RDS. There were three different animal -derived surfactant preparations licensed in Europe in 2016. Two are bovine minced pulmonary surfactant (beractant and bovactant), and one is porcine minced pulmonary surfactant (poractant alfa) (416) . Evidence has shown that those preparations also differ in their clinical outcomes. Recent Cochrane Systematic review concluded that poractant alfa is associated with a better survival rate and improved pulmonary o utcomes when compared with beractant (417) . This could explain the us e of poractant alfa as a surfactant and not beractant across the collected resources in the present study. The recent European Consensus guidelines on the management of RDS have recommended the use of poractant alfa as an initial dose of 200mg/kg as it is also found to be associated with better clinical outcomes when compared to the 100mg/kg of beractant or proactant alfa (416) . However, there is uncertainty whether this advantage is related to the dose or the source of surfactant preparat ions. Despite the available evidence and recommendations, only one resource in the present study stated the initial dosage regimen of poractant alfa as 200mg/kg whereas others stated the initial dos as a range of 100 -200mg/kg. A recent systematic review an d meta -analysis by Foligno and Luca (2020) have compared the porcine and bovine surfactant therapy on extra -pulmonary outcomes (418) . Interestingly, Page | 347 this meta -analysis showed a lower risk of PDA with porcine pre paration when other extra -pulmonary outcomes. 6.4.4 PDA drugs Generally, indomethacin and ibuprofen are used in preterm i nfant only as agents to close the PDA. This study demonstrates this consistency. Also, the dosing of ibuprofen was found to be similar in the collected resources and was given as three doses 24 hours apart. This dosage regimen is the recommended and licens ed dose of ibuprofen to be used for PDA (45). The findings from the systematic review of ibuprofen adverse effects presented in this thesis ( Chapter 5) also indicated that nearly all studies have used the same dosage regimen of ibuprofen in PDA. However, the doses of indomethacin varied across the units. This is was not unexpected as the dosage regimen of indomethacin when used in PDA differs widely across the literature (245) . So, until a consensus regarding the optimal dose of indomethacin for PDA closure to be used, the variety in doses used across several drug formularies will remain. Paracetamol was us ed by most of the units as an analgesic rather than for PDA, despite the lack of evidence of using it as an analgesic and the latest evidence of using it for PDA as detailed in Chapter 4. 6.4.5 Limitations of the presented study The study has captured a small n umber of drug information resources. Only eight units (with nine drug information resources) responded to the letter of Page | 348 participation to the study out of approximately 195 neonatal units across the UK (22,23) . This can affect the generalisability of the data and hinder, reaching a definit e conclusion about the actual practice in neonatal unit settings. Even with such small numbers, I found inconsistencies in practice for the use of frequently used medicines. This is of particular note for those drugs that have a potential to cause harm if used inappropriately such as gentamicin and caffeine. In conclusion, despite the limitations of this study, this is an attempt to provide an initial overview of the available neonatal drug formularies and clinical practice guidelin es in the UK. This initiative highlights the need to reach consensus in the prescribing information of some drugs (e.g., benzylpenicillin and caffeine), and reinforces the similarities of others (e.g., ibuprofen in PDA). Future implications of the findings are discussed in Chapter 7. Page | 349 CHAPTER 7 DISCUSSION The main goal of this thesis was to assess the rational use of drugs in neonates admitted to neonatal units in the UK. This was done by exploring the patterns and quality of prescribing. To further explore the complexities of rational drug use in neonates, one example, i.e. patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm neonates was explored further. As a result, several findings of the work presented have emerged. I found some answers but in addition, my work has raised several questions that need to be addressed in future research. These are discussed at the end of each chapter. Here, I provide a summary of my findings and put them together to give a combined view obtained fro m the work and the wider implications of the findings. Summary of findings The complexity of prescribing in neonates necessitates essential measures to ensure safe and effective use of drugs in neonates. Drug utilisation research is considered an explora tive key tool used to investigate the patterns of drug prescribing and the extent to which the drugs are used. This, in turn, will provide an overall picture of the impact of guidelines' implementation and whether they can affect the prescribing behaviour of the clinicians. The up -to-date literature review detailed in chapter two of drug utilisation studies has highlighted the similarities and differences of drug prescribing patterns on a global scale. It has concluded that antibiotics remain the most frequ ently prescribed drugs globally and a need to rationalise the use of those agents worldwide due to the ongoing concerns of anti-microbial resistance. Also, this review found similarities of prescribing Page | 350 patterns in some regions like Europe and highlighted a lack of drug utilisation studies in others such as Africa and China. The review also reve aled the paucity of drug utilisation research in the UK with so far three studies conducted with limitations that hinder an overall conclusion of the prescribing patterns across neonatal units in the UK (28,29,63) . These limitations triggered the need for the study described in Chapter 3, which explored the drug utilisation patterns across the neonatal units in England and Wales. This was done using a retrospective data analysis approach of a national database (NNRD). Several points were highlighted from this study that was either related to the drug use profile or the usefulness of the NNRD database in drug utilisation research. My findings support the evidence from two studies in the US A that similarly utilised large databases in investigating drug utilisation patterns in their NICUs (66,185). All have reported penicillin and gentamicin to be the most frequently prescribed drugs in their NICUs. Consistent with Clark et al., caffeine was amongst the most frequently prescribed drug in preterm neonates (gestational age (GA) < 37 weeks) and the most frequently prescribed drugs in low, very low and extremely low birth weight neonates. Drug use in preterm neonates is challenging due to the burden of co - morbidities that lead to polypharmacy, consequently exposing them to a higher risk of advers e effects. I found a high burden of drug use with extremely preterm and very preterm neonates exposed to a median of 17 and 8 unique drugs, respectively. Interestingly, I found a large group of neonates who were admitted to a neonatal unit but did not have records of having received drugs. These neonates were more mature and had a greater Page | 351 BW at birth and had short er length of stay compared to those who received drugs. This group has not been looked at previously. Drug use over time can undergo change and I found some interesting variations over the study period. Across the entire cohort, ranitidine , domperidone and ocular chloramphenicol benzylpenicillin , gentamicin, amikacin, and pulmonary surfactants increased. Some of thes e changes may be explained by the changing demographics of the population included in the NNRD - from 2010 to 2017 there is an increase in the number of term born neonates whose data are entered into the NNRD which may inflate the number of those who recei ved drugs such as benzyl penicillin. The NNRD, a rich repository of real-life data, allows large national studies such as mine possible. However, it has some limitations and I have discussed them in detail in the chapter. In my exploration of drugs used fo r management of PDA in very and extremely preterm neonates, I found that ibuprofen was the most frequently used . However, a firm conclusion about paracetamol use in PDA could not be reached as NNRD data available to me did not allow me to make a direct linkage between the drugs and its indication for use. It is therefore possible that some use of paracetamol may be for its analgesic effect or its indication for preterm neonates for post -immunisation . Page | 352 The popularity of ibuprofen compared to indomethacin is due to the evidence that ibuprofen is safer to use, However, this relative safety does not preclude the fact that it too has several adverse effects. My systematic review of ibuprofen adverse effects when used in preterm neonates with PDA captured all new and rare adverse effects that are usually found in observational studies rather than randomised trials. I found that half of the total reported adverse effects were in retrosp ective cohort studies. Although results of such studies should be interpreted with caution as they are more prone to bias, these large numbers of adverse effects are worthy of note. As a final step in my journey to explore rational drug use in neonates in the UK, I explored the current neonatal drug formularies and practice guidelines in the UK. Despite the descriptive nature of this study and the small number of the drug information resources I was able to access, the results are interesting. They revealed some inconsistencies in prescribing information most notably in those drugs which have the potential of causing harm such as gentamicin and caffeine. To continue the theme, I also looked at the drugs used in PDA. While the recomme ndations for ibuprofen were fairly uniform, indomethacin doses and regimens varied . The dosing regimen of paracetamol, interestingly, was listed for analgesic in most of the units. Page | 353 Implications of findings and caveats for future research This thesis has r e-asserted the adage that 'it requires much to treat the too little'. The implications of my findings and the caveats for future research can be broadly described below. 7.2.1 Towards a better understanding of drug utilisation research in neonates through the u sage of large databases Drug utilisation research is an eclectic discipline that gathers quantitative and qualitative measures to answer specific questions about drug use in a healthcare setting. In the UK, such large studies can be conducted easily and at low cost by using the NNRD. However, there are some gaps that need to be filled to allow this. Firstly, the way in which prescribed drugs are recorded should be standardised so that clinicians can enter the drug names uniformly. Use of a standardised cla ssification system of the drugs and diseases will allow aggregation of data and meaningful comparison and analysis at national and international levels. The most preferred system is the Anatomic Therapeutic Classification (ATC) as this system provides one unique code for each drug (419) . The application of such a system in neonatal drug utilisation studies has been observed in several studies across the literature (5,420 - 422). However, these studies were all prospective using primary data sources and hence laborious and expensive to replicate. Incorporation of such standardisation into databases such as the NNRD will facilitate DUR without the need for such resource -intensive pros pective studies. A recent expert review published by Allegaert et al., reported that the application of this classification is possible in neonates with the availability of specific Page | 354 indication for each drug (423) . With this step, the data related to the drugs can be aggregated easily . Another system that can be used in the UK to facilitate unified coding of drug nomenclature is the use of an existed unified dictionary of drugs named the 'dictionary of medicines and devices (dm+d)' (424) . This electronic dictionary of unified codes represents medicines and devices in use across the NHS in a consistent way to facilitate sharing of information pertaining to medicines and devices between organisations. This dictionary is contained within a wi dely used database in the UK, the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD), which contains data routinely recorded in primary care. Incorporating such a system into Badger.net, and hence into the NNRD, will aid clinicians in prescribing, sharing informat ion, and facilitating the analysis process when used by researchers through those standardised codes (425) . Another point that can be used to improve the NNRD for drug utilisation research purposes is having records of the timing of the drugs, dosage regimen and concurrent drugs used. This may be achieved by link ing electronic prescribing software with NNRD platforms such as Badger.net. The availability of such information will allow for better evaluation and assessment of the adverse effects of the drugs, especially in preterm neonates, where polypharmacy exists. Record linkage to other electronic databases is another area that could be applied to improve the quality of the NNRD when used in DUR. For example, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), as mentioned in Chapter 3, does not capture any neonatal drug informat ion, but does captures some data items Page | 355 related to a neonate's time in hospital that might be useful for record linkage to the NNRD. This includes NHS maternity statistics, such as data from the Maternity Service Data set (MSDS) (426) which captures records of each stage of the maternity service and have been upda ted lately to include more neonatal data items. Some of those are related to birth complications, admission and transfer dates, and diagnosis details. However, it must be noted that this data captures information in England only. My findings also suggest the importance of establishing neonatal networks in regions such as Africa and Middle East, in addition to those in Europe (e.g. Task Force in Europe for Drug Development for the Young (TEDDY)), with the aim of conducting drug utilisation research to evalu ate the current prescribing practices, to develop and implement guidelines, and finally to monitor their success (10). This suggestion emerged as per the DUR review in Chapter 2 , only two studies were found to be conducted in Africa; one aimed towards exploring most frequently prescribed antibiotics in Zimbabwe (132) whereas the other one was conducted to assess the prevalence of off - label and unlicensed drugs in an Ethiopian NICU (140) . This paucity of research in Africa, known to have the highest neonatal mortality rate warrants further research to explore the pattern of drug use across their NICUs. Similarly, the paucity of drug utilisation studie s in the Middle East was found in Chapter 2 prompting such networks or research groups to be established. Another point to note is that I was unable to include data from Scotland and Northern Ireland. While the data from Scotland were not available to me due to research governance rules, data from Northern Ireland is not included in Page | 356 the NNRD. Also, an additional problem with the current NNRD is that some neonates are transferred between the UK nations for the purpose of receiving care in different units an d this may result in incomplete records of their care in the current database. Any further study claiming to be representative of all of the UK needs to take data from devolved nations into consideration, and research governance around access to these dat a should be streamlined. Some interesting clinical questions also arise from my work. My findings re - iterate the need for improvement in prescribing practices to tackle the high usage of antibiotics across different neonatal settings worldwide. Neonatal sepsis and other severe infections contribute to large numbers of neonatal morbidity and mortality (9). This somewhat justifies the high use of antibiotics in but there remains a ne ed to establish some measures to rationalise antibiotics use to avoid unnecessary drug exposure to vulnerable neonates. The results of my NNRD data analysis and systematic review of global DUR both show that antibiotics are, by far, the largest group of dr ugs given to neonates. Turner et al. (28) highlighted gaps in knowledge of therapeutic treatment of bacterial sepsis, and further work might be useful in this area. There should be an attempt to investigate and monitor the management of sepsis and implement strategies to reduce ir rational use. Several strategies can be implemented, such as anti -microbial stewardship to promote safe and effective use of antibiotics and reduce possible anti -microbial resistance (10). These programs should focus on education, continuous monitoring of the current prescribing and resistance patterns, and antibiotics surveillance to promote the use of antibiotics (4,9,78) . Page | 357 Anoth er area for future research is expanding the use of surfactants. My analyses miss out surfactant use in the delivery suite. In addition, more recently, new methods of administering surfactant such as the least invasive surfactant administration have become popular and such details should be recorded and analysed. The rational use of caffeine in very and extremely preterm neonates also needs attention. Caffeine was entered in three different ways in the database; caffeine, caffeine base, and caffeine citrate. This is concerning, from a pharmacology point of view, ca ffeine base and citrate differ greatly in terms of their dosage, prompting warnings from the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (193) . Caffeine use should, therefore, be standardised and monitored to avoid unintended adverse effects . In research, especially drug utilisation studies, combining both quantitative and qualitative methods, complement each other and enhance the interpretation of the findings. Providing an in -depth understanding of clinicians' prescribing behaviour in neon atal medicine is vital, as prescribing in this population is not only guided by rational decisions but also psychosocial factors (7,427) . This area is rarely explored in drug utilisation research in neonates, and there is scope for qualitative research, including methods such as focus group discussions, open -ended questionnaires, and in-depth interviews to explore these. Page | 358 7.2.2 Pharmacological management of PDA: Room for improvement Taken together, my findings from studies i n Chapters 4, 5, and 6 suggest a need for continued research in PDA therapeutics. Ibuprofen is the preferred agents across neonatal units. I was unable to explore whether the use was as a treatment or prophylactic, or if it was guided by ECHO. Using ibupro fen prophylactically is not recommended (55-58,428) due to the increased risk of adverse effects without any benefit in long term outcomes. The patterns of paracetamol prescribing in PDA could also be analysed in more details if linkage between the drugs, and their indications was available . The systematic review of adverse effects of ibuprofen highlighted in an analytical and quantitative method all the adverse effects of this drug when used in PDA highlighting the need to continue to monitor drug use and the search of alternatives with fewer side effects and trials comparing treatment with no treatment and/or placebo. Further systematic reviews of ibuprofen adverse effects, which take stratification according to different gestational age groups into account, will provide a full picture of ibuprofen adverse effects and will aid neonatologists to weigh the risks and benefits before prescribing ibuprofen. Another future area of research is the causality assessment of adverse effects in neonates. Surprisingly, none of the studies included in this review has assessed the causality of the adverse effects reported. Assessing the causality of adverse effects in neonates is an ongoing challenge , especially in premature ones. This is due to the difficulty in differentiating the 'true' adverse effects from the confoun ding variables (e.g. organ dysfunction and Page | 359 immaturity) in such sub -population of neonates. A new validated algorithm consisting of 13 scored items have been suggested to detect ADRs in neonatal population by Du et al. which may be reliable and tailored to neonates as compared to Naranjo algorithm (268,429) . Although not yet tested in a larger neonatal population, the adaptation of such an algorithm in future neonatal studies would be beneficial . Research questions that could be asked include the factors that affect the response of preterm neonates with PD A to cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, including ibuprofen. There are several predicting factors highlighted in the literature that affect PDA response to COX inhibitors (256) such as gestational age and birth weight, antenatal glucocorticoids, respiratory distress syndrome, and infections. However, there are no large mu lti-centre trials that address this to help avoid unnecessary pharmacological treatment (256) . With the emergence of the perception that paracetamol may be as effective as ibuprofen in PDA management in a recent Cochrane review (244) , a further systematic review with more focus on adverse effects of paracetamol is suggested as a future area for research. 7.2.3 Neonat al formularies Finally, the findings in Chapter 6 has shown inconsistencies in the recommended dosage regimens of indomethacin and paracetamol when used in PDA in the drug information resources. There is a need to reach a consensus in terms of dosage regimen of those agents. This can be possibly addressed by using randomised trial or consensus and expert opinion such as the Delphi method (430) . Even with the small numbers available to me, I Page | 360 found important inconsistencies in prescribing recommendations highlighting the need for a rational prescribing tool for neonates . A larger, more comprehensive review of neonatal formularies could help gather more information to support this. Several tools have been developed for inappropriate prescribing in the elderly population (431) . The fact that many tools have been designed for the elderly is due to th e burden of comorbidities and p olypharmacy in this population (395) , characteristics that the elderly, rather interestingly, share with preterm neon ates. There are few tools to detect inappropriate prescribing in paediatrics and none in neonates (432,433) . A large body of work, including evidence synth esis incorporated into consensus building with the Delphi technique, will be needed to tackle this difficult but essential task. A national, or ideally, international collaboration is required to do this. A summary of all those discussed caveats for future research that came to light following the findings of this thesis is shown in Figure 86.Page | 361 Figure 86.
