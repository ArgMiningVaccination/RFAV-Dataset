The ACT also establishes the ACT Discrimination Commissioner. In the first decade of self-government, the Discrimination Act becomes the primary vehicle for the protection of human rights in the ACT. The Office of the Youth Advocate ACT merges into the Community Advocate. 1994 The ACT Government appoints the first Victims of Crime Coordinator. The ACT becomes the first Australian jurisdiction to recognise the rights of people in de facto and caring relationships. 2002 Gallop report recommends establishing independent disability commissioner. 2003 FEMAG report on review of oversight agencies recommends new disability commissioner sit within merged Human Rights Commission. 2004 The ACT becomes the first jurisdiction in Australia to enact a comprehensive Human Rights Act (HR Act). It also establishes the Human Rights Commissioner in the existing ACT Human Rights Office. The Vardon Report recommends an independent Commissioner for Children and Young People. 2005 The Office of the Community Advocate becomes the Public Advocate. 2006 The ACT Human Rights Office becomes the Human Rights Commission. The Commission includes the Human Rights and Discrimination Commissioner and the Health Services Commissioner.Annual Report 2019-20 5Year Event 2007 New Children and Young People Commissioner; and Disability (and Community Services) Commissioner appointed. 2008 Public authorities in the ACT are required to act in a way that is compatible with human rights, and to properly consider relevant rights in decision-making, under amendments to the HR Act. 2011 The Victims of Crime Act 1994 (VoC Act) is amended to establish a Victims of Crime Commissioner. 2013 The right to education becomes the first economic, social and cultural right to be recognised in the ACT, under amendments to the HR Act. 2014 The Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1997 is amended to improve legal recognition of sex and gender diverse people; to introduce a third legal sex category; and to remove the requirement for persons to undergo surgery before changing their legal sex. 2016 The distinct cultural rights held by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are recognised under amendments to the HR Act. Separate amendments are passed strengthening the right to education. The Discrimination Act is amended to safeguard against discrimination based on a person's subjection to domestic or family violence; accommodation status; employment status; immigration status; and physical features. The amendments introduce intersex status as a stand-alone attribute. People can complain about vilification on the grounds of disability, religion or intersex status. The Human Rights Commission is restructured to include the Public Advocate, the Victims of Crime Commissioner and Victim Support ACT. 2020 ACT's first intermediary program begins operating, supporting vulnerable victims and witnesses. Under amendments to the HR Act, members of the public can complain to the Commission about elder abuse, the abuse or neglect of adults with a disability or vulnerable people. The right to work and workers' rights are also recognised under amendments to the HR Act. These are the second economic, social and cultural right to be enshrined in the HR Act. A charter of rights for victims of crime is tabled in the ACT Legislative Assembly. ACT Human Rights Commission 6 SECTION A: Transmittal certificate Tara Cheyne MLA Minister for Human Rights ACT Legislative Assembly London Circuit Canberra ACT 2601 Dear Minister, 2019-20 ACT Human Rights Commission Annual Report This report has been prepared in accordance with section 7(2) of the Annual Reports (Government Agencies) Act 2004 and in accordance with the requirements under the Annual Reports (Government Agencies) Directions 2019 . I certify that the information in the attached report and information provided for whole of government reporting, is an honest and accurate account and that all material information on the operations of the ACT Human Rights Commission has been included for the period 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020. Section 13 of the Annual Reports (Government Agencies) Act 2004 requires that you present the report to the Legislative Assembly within 15 weeks after the end of the reporting year. However, under section 14, the Chief Minister has granted an extension of the time for the report to be presented by you to the Legislative Assembly. The Chief Minister has granted the extension to 18 December 2020. The annual report must be provided to the Speaker on 18 December 2020 for distribution to each Member of the Legislative Assembly. The annual report must then be tabled in the Legislative Assembly on the next sitting day. Yours sincerely Dr Helen Watchirs OAM President, ACT Human Rights Commission 11 December 2020Annual Report 2019-20 7 Section A: Transmittal Certificate ACT Human Rights Commissioners (from left), Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner, Karen Toohey; Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner, Jodie Griffiths-Cook; President and Human Rights Commissioner, Dr Helen Watchirs; and Victims of Crime Commissioner, Heidi Yates.ACT Human Rights Commission 8From the President and Human Rights Commissioner Dr Helen Watchirs OAM. I would like to thank all Commissioners and staff for their hard work and dedication over the year, which has been particularly challenging with natural disasters and COVID-19. From March 2020 most staff were working remotely from home, but we continued our services which in fact increased in volume and complexity. We: provided 89 formal written legal advices, comments and submissions, including 46 formal comments on draft Cabinet submissions organised 67 community engagement events (this number was lower than previous years due to COVID-19 restrictions) handled over 1,600 enquiries and over 800 complaints provided more than 2,100 victims of crime with assistance received over 500 new applications under the Victims of Crime Financial Assistance Scheme advocated for, or otherwise monitored, over 2,250 people brought to the attention of the Public Advocate.The human rights legal team of two lawyers performed at a very high level by drafting or coordinating formal comments or submissions in 89 instances. The resources allocated for human rights legal work since 2004 has not increased, although the workload has expanded greatly over a 16-year period, especially with the expansion of the size and mandate of the Commission. The Commission made several submissions and appearances before Legislative Assembly committees on various subject matters including COVID-19, workers' rights, policing and child care and protection. COVID-19 restrictions have resulted in fewer community engagement events, as the Commission adapts to broadening modes of communication. For example, we produced a fact sheet on workers' rights, which were added to the Human Rights Act 2004 (HR Act) in May 2020, under the new s 27B. We also published guidelines on COVID-19 and human rights. The guidelines cover a wide variety of issues including discrimination and vilification; policing and public health directions; people experiencing vulnerability, including people with disability and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; aged care and older people; children and young people; family violence; health and mental health; housing and tenancy; and detention. In the reporting period, the Commission focused on three priority areas: raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14 years of age; highlighting the PRESIDENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 9need for external review of care and protection decisions; and working towards the introduction of a charter of rights for victims of crime. On 10 December 2019, International Human Rights Day, the Commission hosted the #Raisetheage forum. The event was preceded by a November 2019 preview film screening of the documentary In my blood it runs (see Section N: Community engagement and support). The Commission considers that the broad discretionary framework under the Children and Young People Act 2008 (CYP Act) to make decisions about a child or young person's care, combined with a lack of appropriate mechanisms to challenge and remedy such decisions (usually to independent tribunals in other jurisdictions), is incompatible with the HR Act. Together with 11 stakeholders and non-government organisations, we wrote a joint open letter to the Minister for Children, Youth and Families calling for urgent legislative reforms to ensure transparency. The Minister committed to working collaboratively with stakeholders in considering external review mechanisms for ACT child protection decisions. Although the Commission welcomed the new workers' rights enacted in May 2020, it highlighted the need for the inclusion of more economic, social and cultural rights such as housing and health. The most pressing reform required for the HR Act is to provide for a complaints mechanism, similar to discrimination matters and such as that included in the new Queensland Human Rights Act. A highlight of the year was the formal launch of the Commission's cultural safety charter in September 2019 to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The charter was launched at a community event at Yarramundi Reach. Members of our reference group which advised on the charter, as well as representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body (ATSIEB) and the United Ngunnawal Elders Council attended. The Commission's cultural adviser Karen Flick was also awarded a Director-General's 2019 Innovation Award for her outstanding work on the charter. Further materials for the community were developed on s 27(2) of the HR Act, which protects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural rights. Paul House was commissioned to translate s 27(2) into Ngunnawal/Walgalu language to celebrate 2019 being the United Nations International Year of Indigenous Languages. In late June 2020, a mandated review under s105A of the Human Rights Commission Act 2005 (HRC Act) began, examining the effectiveness of legislative changes enacted in 2016 to the Commission. These changes saw the Commission merge with the Public Advocate and Victims of Crime Commissioner's offices. Insight Consulting won the tender process administered by the Justice and Community Safety Directorate (JACSD) and began conducting interviews and surveys with stakeholders. Insight Consulting will report to the Minister for Human Rights at the end of 2020. I am proud of the work we have achieved in this difficult reporting period and wish to record my sincere appreciation for my three colleague Commissioners who acted in the President role while I took a significant period of leave for surgery. On a personal note, I was also very honoured and humbled to receive the ACT Senior Woman of 2020 award for International Women's Day. I look forward to the victims' charter being legislated, as well as further expansion of the jurisdiction for Commission complaints handling in the next reporting period. It will be a challenging time with the Commission working in temporary premises, until we move into Allara House under a long-term lease in the second half of 2021.PRESIDENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 10From the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner Karen Toohey. In my role as the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner, my team and I handle all of the Commission's complaint jurisdictions, providing a single point of contact for Canberrans to have their concerns dealt with across a wide range of issues. This provides the ACT community with a comprehensive, free, accessible means of resolving their concerns. It also means the Commission can identify systemic issues and try and address those both through the individual complaint mechanism and by working collaboratively with our colleagues within the Commission, in government and the community. People often use the complaint process when their own efforts to resolve a concern or deal with an issue informally have been unsuccessful. Where possible we facilitate early resolution of complaints by contacting people or organisations to deal with matters informally and quickly. Much of the work we do is to assist Canberrans to resolve real problems affecting their daily lives including access to health services, issues with employment or housing, concerns about services ACT children and young people are accessing, and the safety and wellbeing of older people and people with a disability in our community. Some notable achievements this year included: handling 829 complaints, a 64 per cent increase in complaints received over the past four years receiving over 200 discrimination complaints, a 72 per cent increase over the past four years our conciliation success rate was 68 per cent 83 per cent of people who completed a Commission survey at the closure of a complaint said the process was fair, accessible and understandable 79 per cent of complaints were closed within the KPI of 250 days the number of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people accessing our process rose from nine in 2016-17 to 56 in 2019-20, or 7 per cent of complainants undertaking a range of community engagement activities at libraries, community events, online and in collaboration with key stakeholders to raise awareness of our legislation and the complaint handling process providing training and information sessions with a range of organisations to build capacity in understanding discrimination law and processes. The impact of COVID-19 on the ACT community was also evident in complaints brought to the Commission during 2020. A common theme arising from these complaints was providers in aged care, retirement villages, schools and health services enforcing measures more restrictive than those required by the ACT Chief Health Officer. We received a number of complaints relating to unreasonable limitations on visitors to health services and retirement villages. Concerns were also raised about bans on family visits in aged care facilities and in-home care providers restricting or ceasing services to clients with a disability. DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH SERVICES, DISABILITY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 11We saw an increase in concerns about racism and discrimination against temporary visa holders in accommodation, employment, public places and online. We also had concerns raised by frontline workers and their families about being refused services such as transport or childcare. While telehealth helped keep people safe, the reliance on audio visual technology for health appointments posed a significant barrier for people from culturally diverse backgrounds, people with a disability and older people. In 2019-20 legislative change enabled us to receive complaints about abuse, neglect and exploitation of older people and people with a disability in our community. This provides an informal, accessible, and where appropriate confidential pathway for people to raise their concerns about potential abuse or neglect of vulnerable Canberrans. We are working with key stakeholders such as the Public Trustee and Guardian, the Public Advocate, the Official Visitors and the Older Persons ACT Legal Service on prompt and effective interventions in these matters to keep vulnerable people in our community safe. I look forward to continuing this work in 2020-2021 to promote a safe, inclusive and diverse ACT community.DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH SERVICES, DISABILITY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 12From the Victims of Crime Commissioner Heidi Yates. This has been our busiest year yet. In 2019-20 we helped more victims of crime than ever before. The year has also ushered in establishment of the ACT's ground-breaking Intermediary Program. I am grateful for the remarkable commitment of our staff and volunteers who have continued to deliver outstanding professional services amidst bushfire smoke, hail and COVID-19. Victim Support ACT (VSACT) has once again experienced a substantial annual increase in frontline service demand. Overall, the Victims Services Scheme (VSS): registered 689 new clients for case coordination, a 31 per cent increase on 2018-19 provided a total of 2,159 clients with case coordination, advice, information, counselling, court support and/or justice advocacy services, a 27 per cent increase on last year and a 53 per cent increase on the same data three years ago recorded a 70 per cent increase in new clients in June compared to the same period last year. The June figures included a 127 per cent increase in new family violence matters and a 50 per cent increase in new sexual assault matters.The Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) has also been under significant pressure, receiving 513 applications, a 13 per cent increase on 2018-19 and a 375 per cent increase in comparison to the scheme's first year of operation (2016-17). I am proud that our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program continues to respond to the needs of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, families and children. The program works with and walks alongside Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, providing support in a range of environments including the community, prison and health facilities. This year, the program assisted 186 clients compared with 126 the previous year (a 48 per cent increase). In the final quarter of the year, the impacts of COVID-19 significantly escalated service demand as noted above. Family violence victims reported the damaging impacts of increased social isolation, financial uncertainty and limited access to face-to-face support services. Some said COVID-19 had motivated them to seek help for the first time in the context of long-term violence, as they were unable to shield their home-schooled children from the control of a violent partner. Additional safety and financial pressures reported by clients in the context of COVID-19 were accompanied by a significant increase in FAS applications to meet immediate needs. These applications require urgent processing to assist with relocation, personal security and medical costs. In June 2020, 40 per cent of new applications included a request for immediate assistance compared to only 12 per cent of applications in July 2019. In response to this significant increase in overall demand, the VSACT team has worked intensively to assess and triage matters, ensuring we prioritise the immediate safety needs of clients in crisis, while maximising access to longer -term, intensive support for clients with complex needs. The 100 small business providers who deliver counselling, tutoring and other support to clients via our brokerage model have had a key role in enabling us to remain responsive during this busy time. We thank our providers for the crucial role they play in aiding victim recovery. VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 13Establishment of the Intermediary Program With the strong support of stakeholders, we have worked intensively over the past 12 months to design and implement the Intermediary Program. The program reports to the Victims of Crime Commissioner (VOCC) but operates independently of VSACT. Intermediaries are independent communication specialists\u2014often with training in speech pathology, occupational therapy or psychology\u2014who assist witnesses with communication difficulties to give accurate and complete evidence to police and at court. The program\u2014a recommendation of the Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse\u2014recognises that vulnerable witnesses face significant barriers when giving evidence and are often re-traumatised in the process. Criminal justice stakeholders have worked closely with the intermediary team to design and start the program. The program progresses under the guidance of an oversight body comprising senior representatives from ACT Policing, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), JACSD, Legal Aid, the ACT Law Society, the ACT Bar Association and Child and Youth Protection Services (CYPS). I thank our colleagues for their collaborative engagement, which ensures we are growing the best possible scheme to minimise trauma for vulnerable witnesses and maximise the quality of evidence available to the ACT justice system. Charter of rights for victims of crime Without the evidence of victims, we do not have a criminal justice system. Despite this, victims so often report feeling unheard and re-traumatised by justice processes. A significant achievement this year has been the Commission's intensive work towards the introduction of a legislative charter of rights for victims of crime. Advocacy for this charter has a long history in the ACT. In this regard, I recognise the substantial work undertaken by my predecessors, Dr Robyn Holder and Mr John Hinchey. The charter will secure practical improvements to the lives of victims by protecting their rights to recognition, information, privacy, participation, consultation and respect. For the first time, victims will have the capacity to raise a formal complaint about breach of their rights with the Commission and access a facilitated, restorative conciliation process. The charter will come into effect in early 2021. I am pleased that implementation of the charter will also shift responsibility for the three victim registers, currently administered by Corrective Services, the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT) and Community Services Directorate (CSD), to the Commission. This reform will streamline access to the registers, ensuring victims receive timely information about the management of sentenced offenders. Co-location of the register with other victim services will also facilitate easier access to safety planning, counselling, assistance with parole submissions and other practical support in the context of offender parole or release. The charter will be a significant step towards greater recognition of victim rights, but it is not enough. Priority areas for further reform, include: a pathway for unresolved charter complaints to be referred, like other civil complaints, for independent resolution via ACAT amendment of the HR Act to expressly recognise victims' rights, alongside those of accused. As social justice advocate Arthur Ashe once said: \"Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can.\" In this spirit, we continue to work intensively with our justice sector stakeholders to deliver the practical systemic change so desperately needed to secure justice for victims of crime. VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 14From the Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner Jodie Griffiths-Cook. As the ACT Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner, I am responsible for promoting the rights, protection and participation of Canberrans whose situation or condition makes them potentially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. My responsibilities as Public Advocate are underpinned by a range of functions including advocacy (individual and systemic), representation, investigation, monitoring and oversight. Some of these functions are specific to children and young people, and others encompass people with complex disability needs, including those with mental health conditions and forensic patients. As Children and Young People Commissioner, I focus on designing and delivering ways to empower children and young people by enabling them to have their views heard about issues impacting their lives. Further, I use what I hear to influence government and other stakeholders, and actively encourage colleagues (and the community more broadly) to listen to and take seriously what children and young people have to tell us about what is important to them in their lives. This past year has been challenging, first with the bushfires and severe smoke haze, and then with COVID-19. We have all needed to change the way we live and engage\u2014in the community, at home, at work and in play\u2014and some changes are ongoing.For the children, young people and adults brought to the attention of my office, these challenges have been exacerbated by their experiences of vulnerability. This year, for some, their experience of vulnerability was brought on by these events. I have heard directly from children, young people and adults about how social isolation has negatively impacted their mental health and wellbeing. I have heard stories of strength through adversity and stories of desperation as people have struggled to get their needs met by systems adapting to new ways of operating in response to COVID-19. The common thread in my work is that the experiences that bring people to the attention of my office typically involve their rights being limited in some way, such as the right to family for a child or young person in need of care and protection, or the right to liberty of a person requiring involuntary detention and treatment for reasons of mental illness. The challenges of this past year have changed the way my team and I deliver our services. In the first half of 2019-20, we developed a Decision-Making Framework and an Oversight Framework to guide our practice. These frameworks provide clarity about how we allocate our limited resources to achieve outcomes\u2014both individually and systemically. The implementation of these frameworks, however, will be an evolving process, as we grapple with how best to deliver our services in the context of requirements associated with COVID-19. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, we have worked creatively to ensure our ongoing responsiveness to the needs of children, young people and adults who access our services. In 2019-20, we provided public advocacy services for almost 1,300 children, young people and adults experiencing vulnerability, including direct individual advocacy for nearly 500 individuals. Throughout the year, I have advocated strongly for the minimum age of criminal responsibility to be raised, and for improved supports for children and young people with complex high-level needs. I commend the ACT Government for its commitment to progressing this important work and look forward to seeing services strengthened so that children receive the support they need, instead of becoming caught in a harmful cycle that punishes them for circumstances that are often beyond their control. PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 15This year we also strengthened our oversight of mental health and forensic mental health systems. We looked at both the intent of relevant legislation and how best to use the information available to us to interrogate the operations of these systems and identify themes and trends for further exploration. This work will continue into the next reporting period, and I am confident we will be able to provide a more effective contribution to service improvement because of this work. In 2019-20, we also focused on how best to consolidate and enhance our activities in the disability and complex needs portfolio. In addition to advocacy for people with disability and older persons, this portfolio now includes personal, family and workplace protection matters, oversight of children and young people subject to restrictive practices, and hoarding and squalor matters. This portfolio has evidenced growing demand for public advocacy services and will require ongoing focus in the next reporting period. Following our advocacy both locally and nationally to raise the profile of the unique needs of children and young people who experience family violence, this year we partnered with the Family Safety Hub on the 'Listening and Learning' project, through which we engaged 70 young people aged 13-24 years, to hear and better understand children and young people's experiences of family violence. This consultation used an innovative methodology to engage young people in designing the project, and to understand their experiences and views about how we can improve support and services for them. This work emphasised that children and young people are victims in their own right with recovery and support needs that are not being met. The importance of this work was recognised with an ACT Public Service Award for Excellence in Innovation and a CSD Director-General Excellence Award. The work I do, and the outcomes achieved, would not be possible without the hard work of my team who consistently demonstrate their commitment to upholding the rights and interests of those we represent. I commend their dedication and appreciate being able to work alongside them in the pursuit of improved outcomes for people experiencing vulnerability. I am proud of the way our work contributes to the human rights framework here in the ACT and I look forward to continuing this work in the year ahead.PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 16 SECTION B: Performance B.1 Organisational overview The Commission promotes the human rights and welfare of all people living in the ACT. The Commission is an independent agency established in 2006 under the Human Rights Commission Act 2005 (HRC Act). The Public Advocate and the Victims of Crime Commissioner joined the Commission in April 2016. The ACT is the first Australian jurisdiction to have legislated a human rights act. Four people carry out the Commission's major functions: President, Dr Helen Watchirs Human Rights Commissioner, Dr Helen Watchirs Public Advocate, Jodie Griffiths-Cook Children and Young People Commissioner, Jodie Griffiths-Cook Disability and Community Services Commissioner, Karen Toohey Discrimination Commissioner, Karen Toohey Health Services Commissioner, Karen Toohey Victims of Crime Commissioner, Heidi Yates. The Commission's role under the HRC Act is to: promote understanding of human rights in the ACT identify and examine issues that affect human rights and the welfare of vulnerable groups in the ACT independently handle complaints about discrimination, and complaints between users and providers of prescribed services encourage service improvement and increase awareness of the rights and responsibilities of service users and providers provide advice to government and others about their human rights obligations provide advocacy for children, young people and adults experiencing vulnerability deliver services to victims of crime and advocate for them. The HR Act provides the Commission with the power to review the effect of ACT laws, including the common law, on human rights and make recommendations to the Minister for Human Rights and Attorney-General about systemic human rights issues.Annual Report 2019-20 17 Section B: PerformanceACT Human Rights Commission organisational chart Public Advocacy Discrimination Health ServicesDiscrimination, Health Services and Disability and Community Services Commissioner Karen TooheyPublic Advocate Children and Young People Commissioner Jodie Griffiths-CookVictims of Crime Commissioner Heidi Yates Victim Support ACT Victim Rights and Reform Intermediary ProgramPresident and Human Rights Commissioner Dr Helen Watchirs OAM Human Rights Legal and PolicyCorporate Support ServicesCommunity Engagement Disability and Community Services Children and Young People Engagement and ParticipationACT Human Rights Commission 18 Annual Report 2019-20 19 Section B: PerformanceStrategic plan 2017-2020 Commissioners and Commission staff continued to work together to implement the strategic plan 2017-2020. This report is structured under the four themes of our mission within the strategic plan: delivering accessible services that empower and support people leading positive systemic change providing effective oversight engaging and educating the community. Operations protocol The Commission's first operations protocol continues to guide Commissioners in fulfilling their statutory roles and providing quality services to the community. It is available on the Commission's website.Client services charter 2016-2019 and 2020-2022 The Commission continued to implement its client services charter 2016-2019. The charter is based on the Commission's commitment to human rights and belief that all people deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. It explains what the Commission does, what clients can expect from it, how it provides services and how to offer feedback to help improve its services. Community feedback is reflected in our charter. In late 2019, we put a draft charter for 2020-2022 on the ACT Government's YourSay ACT portal and received input from three organisations. We finalised the charter in January 2020. Two easy English versions of the charter are available on the Commission's website. New social inclusion plan The Commission's social inclusion plan (2019-22) broadens our commitment to creating an inclusive community that respects and realises everyone's rights. Previous disability action plans reflected a longstanding commitment to promoting the rights of people with disability. The current plan is broader, promoting inclusion for other groups that experience discrimination or disadvantage. These groups include people with a disability, LGBTIQ+ people, older people and people from multicultural communities. The plan sets out an active program to promote the rights of these groups.ACT Human Rights Commission 20B.2 Performance 2019-20 highlights This year we: advocated for & or monitored over 2,250 people brought to the attention of the Public Advocatebegan the ACT's first Intermediary Program, facilitating communication with police & courts for over 40 vulnerable witnesses and victimsvictims of crimeassisted more than 2,100 paid over $3.3 million in assistance to victims of crimebegan taking complaints & inquiries about the abuse, neglect or exploitation of older peoplehandled over 1,600 enquiries & over 800 complaints about discrimination, health services, disability services, community services & the treatment of vulnerable people89 written pieces of legal advice, including 46 formal comments on draft Cabinet submissions to the ACT Government, Members of Legislative Assembly & others. Our advice helps ensure that ACT laws & policies are compatible with human rights.provided PRESIDENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 21 Section B: PerformancePresident and Human Rights Commissioner The President is responsible for the Commission's governance, finance, resources and administration, as well as: reporting on the Commission's behalf collecting information about the operation of relevant legislation publishing information about the Commission's operation promoting community discussion about relevant legislation and the Commission's operation advising the minister about any matter in relation to the HRC Act or a related Act. The Human Rights Commissioner's functions include: providing community education and information about human rights reviewing the effect of ACT laws on human rights advising the minister and others on the operation of the HR Act. The Commissioner may also intervene, with the leave of the court, in any legal proceedings related to the application of the HR Act. However, the Commissioner does not have jurisdiction to handle individual cases of human rights breaches. Our mission: leading positive systemic change Working with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community The Human Rights Commissioner is concerned by an increase in threats of destruction and actual damage to unique cultural heritage sites having profound spiritual and personal significance for local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. In August 2019, the Commissioner wrote to the ACT Minister for the Environment and Heritage about two Aboriginal scar trees felled in 2017. She noted her disappointment and the need to work with representative Aboriginal organisations to ensure greater options for protection of Aboriginal heritage sites. An infringement notice scheme for damage to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander heritage objects has since been introduced.Similarly, in June 2020, the Commissioner wrote to the National Capital Authority (NCA) providing advice about the cultural rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples that are recognised in the ACT under s 27(2) of HR Act. This letter sought assurance that the Aboriginal cultural and heritage significance of a proposed Ainslie development site subject to the NCA's approval would be appropriately assessed, and subject to consultation with representative Aboriginal organisations and elders. The Commission nominated our Aboriginal cultural adviser Karen Flick for a 2019 innovation award for her work on our cultural safety charter, which she received from the JACSD Director-General. Cultural safety means providing clients, staff, and colleagues with a safe, nurturing, positive environment where people are respected, and cultural rights are supported by the Commission's values, processes and policies (see also Section N: Community engagement). Commission staff taking part in the smoking ceremony to welcome guests to the Commission's event to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in September 2019 at Yarramundi Reach. PRESIDENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 22Our mission: providing effective oversight Reviewing Cabinet submissions and other human rights consultations The Commission continued to contribute to positive systemic change and effective oversight through its assessment of proposed Territory laws, policies and procedures for their compatibility with human rights and consistency with other standards, principles and policies relevant to our functions. Overall, we provided 89 formal written legal advices, comments and submissions. Among these, in 2019-20, the Commission submitted formal comments on 46 draft Cabinet submissions, having reviewed a significantly larger number. This contrasts with formal comments on 40 draft Cabinet submissions in 2018-19. As draft Cabinet submissions are classified as Cabinet-In-Confidence, we are unable to reveal any more specific information as to the nature and outcomes of our comments. Generally, the Commission was satisfied that draft legislation achieved compatibility with human rights, whether initially or following suggested changes or further justification. We also produced 43 written pieces of formal advice (including advice to agencies, submissions to inquiries and consultations). This work, for example, featured advice to the ACT Government about the human rights compatibility of COVID-19-related emergency measures, in order to ensure that appropriate precautions are being taken to protect human rights during this period and that the human rights of vulnerable people are being properly safeguarded. Such advice also saw the Commission write to the ACT Legislative Assembly's Standing Committee on Justice and Community Safety (legislative scrutiny role) on two occasions where legislation introduced into the Assembly, in our view, raised issues of concern with the HR Act. These issues regarded: in March 2020, exempting university occupancy agreements from certain protections under new residential occupancy laws (in relation to the Residential Tenancies Amendment Bill 2020 ) and whether this approach was consistent with the right to equality and non-discrimination in the HR Act in May 2020, introducing reverse burden offences for targeting elder abuse (in relation to the Crimes (Offences Against Vulnerable People) Amendment Bill 2020 ) and whether this approach was consistent with the right to be presumed innocent in the HR Act.Several ACT Government directorates and agencies directly approached the Commission during the reporting period to ask for advice about the compatibility of draft policy changes and legislative proposals. These comments, provided outside formal consultation processes, included: collaboration with ACT Policing staff in providing advice to government about authorising the expanded use of body-worn cameras by police officers in a way that is consistent with the rights to privacy and fair hearing providing feedback to the ACT Inspector of Correctional Services on draft inspection standards for ACT youth detention places advising the CSD about essential considerations when assessing a child or young person's best interests for the purpose of draft adoption laws providing feedback to ACT Corrective Services about various draft policies and procedures, including COVID-19 measures, like leave from correctional centres and exercising discretion to refer breaches of community orders (e.g. parole, good behaviour orders) to the Sentence Administration Board. The Commission also worked closely with JACSD in developing amendments to the Human Rights Commission Act 2005 , enacted by the COVID-19 Emergency Response Legislation Amendment Act 2020 and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 2020. These amendments: include an accessible complaint mechanism to deal with claims about abuse, neglect or exploitation of vulnerable people (a vulnerable person being a person aged over 60 years who experiences barriers to participation in the community because of a disability or social isolation, or an adult with disability) streamline how the Commission deals with complaints, including allowing complainants to withdraw complaints verbally, allowing a conciliation to be successfully resolved verbally and removing the requirement that a complaint can only be referred for conciliation if it is considered likely to be successful allow for Commission-initiated discrimination matters to be referred to ACAT for determination assist the Commission to deliver coordinated services in compliance with Territory privacy laws, by providing an appropriate legislative authorisation to share information between Commissioners' teams.PRESIDENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 23 Section B: PerformanceCASE STUDY Systemic advocacy around external merits review of child protection decisions The transparency and accountability of child protection decision-making in the ACT has been of longstanding concern to the Commission. The Commission considers that the broad discretionary framework under the CYP Act to make decisions about a child or young person's care, combined with a lack of appropriate mechanisms to challenge and remedy such decisions, is incompatible with the HR Act. We have accordingly prioritised work in the last year to call for legislative reforms that enhance the transparency and accountability of the ACT child protection system. In the ACT, ACAT has limited jurisdiction to review the factual basis of decisions made by CYPS under a care and protection order. ACAT review is presently confined to regulatory decisions such as the refusal to approve an individual as an approved carer, the refusal to authorise a person as a foster carer, and decisions to revoke a person's approval as an approved carer. This approach is significantly out of step with that adopted in most other Australian jurisdictions, which subject a broader range of child protection decisions to external merits review by independent tribunals. Decisions subject to independent review in other jurisdictions include decisions made under care plans, like those relating to a child or young person's placement and contact with their parents, siblings and other significant people in their lives. Other reviewable decisions include, for example, those concerning the child or young person's education, training and employment and health treatments including surgery and immunisation. In October 2019, we made a submission to the Standing Committee on Health, Ageing and Community Services identifying statutory barriers to effective oversight of the child protection system, including the lack of external merits review and highly restrictive confidentiality provisions applying to certain categories of child protection information and to proceedings concerning children and young people. The Commission gave evidence before the Committee in January 2020, reiterating these concerns (see also the section below titled Information sharing in ACT child protection system). The Commission planned to host a stakeholder forum in March 2020 to facilitate community discussion about the need for reform of the child protection system, but the event was cancelled due to COVID-19. Instead, we joined with representatives from 11 stakeholder and community sector organisations to write and publicise a joint open letter 1 to the Minister for Children, Youth and Families emphasising our shared call for urgent legislative reforms to ensure transparency. The Minister's response, which was tabled in late March, committed to working with government and non-government stakeholders to consider introducing external merits review. At the close of the reporting period, the Commission and the Minister were actively discussing further opportunities to work collaboratively in considering the establishment of an external review mechanism for ACT child protection decisions, including planning a virtual roundtable for July 2020. 1 See https://hrc.act.gov.au/open-letter-and-joint-communique-on-reforming-child-protection-decision-making-in-the-act/ . See also 16 experts call out ACT government on lack of action for child protection external merits review www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6843291/australians-should-be-ashamed- act-leaders-call-for-increase-in-age-of-criminal-responsibility/Human rights and policy submissions As part of its commitment to driving positive systemic change at the local level, the Commission has contributed to various local and national inquiries and consultations and relevant ACT judicial and tribunal proceedings. Court interventions Under section 36 of the HR Act, the Human Rights Commissioner may intervene in legal proceedings that involve the HR Act, where granted leave by the court. During the reporting period, the Commissioner was notified of six matters and, at the close of the reporting period, took steps towards intervening in two such matters.From June 2019, the Commissioner prepared submissions relating to a court action brought by a young Aboriginal person detained at Bimberi Youth Justice Centre. The young person alleged breaches of her human rights for having been segregated, as well as having art materials and the Koori Mail newspaper confiscated. The Commissioner's submissions detailed how a public authority must discharge its obligation to consider human rights, including the distinct cultural rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in making decisions under s 40B of the HR Act. The matter was, however, settled by the parties in September 2019 without proceeding to hearing. The ACT Government apologised to the young woman for her experience in custody, and for Bimberi staff removing her Indigenous artwork and copies of the Koori Mail from her cell.PRESIDENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 24In May 2020, the Commissioner was notified of a civil action filed against the Australian Federal Police and two ACT Policing officers relating to the assault of a teenager by two officers in January 2017. As at 30 June 2020, the Commissioner prepared a draft application to the court to seek leave to intervene in these proceedings with representation by counsel. These proceedings, should they progress, offer the opportunity to provide submissions about the relevance and application of a police officer's public authority obligations when exercising a function under a Territory law (ss 40(1)(e) and 40B of the HR Act). Current ACT Policing arrangements In February 2020, a joint submission by all Commissioners provided feedback to an evaluation of current ACT Policing arrangements by the Standing Committee on Justice and Community Safety. Our submission highlighted the longstanding absence of an accessible local means of addressing complaints against ACT Policing officers, including in relation to complaints of unlawful discrimination; an essential mechanism for any community policing model that aims to promote community trust and social cohesion. The Commission similarly queried the current reliance on investigative powers under Commonwealth laws, rather than bespoke local ACT laws. We appeared before the committee in June 2020 to provide further evidence, including options for greater accountability for ACT police in exercising functions under ACT laws. Submission to select committee on COVID-19 pandemic response In May 2020, the Commission highlighted the vital need for human rights to inform all measures taken in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency in a submission to the Legislative Assembly select committee on the COVID-19 pandemic response. In doing so, we outlined the need for adequate consideration, justification and oversight of delegated legislation and public health emergency directions to guard against disproportionate and unintended impacts on individuals. To ensure the predictable and proportionate exercise of enforcement powers by police and other compliance activities, we further recommended publication of related guidance and data. Our submission also queried whether the Australian Government's COVIDSafe contact tracing application contained sufficient legislative safeguards to guard against the use of information collected or received by ACT health authorities in the process of contact tracing (including where that contact tracing has been facilitated by the COVIDSafe application) for non-related purposes. If these safeguards were not sufficient, we queried whether complementary ACT-specific legislation was needed, as this issue had been highlighted in the explanatory memorandum to the federal legislation: Privacy Amendment (Public Health Contact Information) Act 2020 . Several of the Commission's suggestions were adopted as recommendations in the select committee's second interim report. However, unfortunately these recommendations were, with one exception, not accepted in the government's response. Information sharing in ACT child protection system In August 2019, the Commission made a submission to the second part of a Standing Committee on Housing, Ageing and Community Services inquiry into CYPS, regarding information sharing within the ACT's child protection system. The submission raised grave concerns about the highly limited scope of access to child protection information under ACT laws compared to those in other Australian jurisdictions. Our submission outlined possible options for improvement, including the publication of legislative guidelines about how and when CSD will disclose sensitive information and expressly providing for review of decisions to withhold information. It further reiterated the need for the ACT Government to provide for external merits review of child protection decisions and consider mandating the disclosure of information in certain circumstances (e.g. to parents or other significant people; allowing children who have left out-of-home care to access their own records). The Commission gave further evidence before the committee in February 2020. Council of Attorneys-General working group consultation on raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility In February 2020, the Commission reiterated its strong and longstanding advocacy for raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility without exception. There is clear expert consensus\u2014supported by the Australian Medical Association and United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child\u2014that children under the age of 14 years do not have the cognitive capacity or maturity to appreciate the criminal nature of their acts. Our submission to a process of public consultation by the Council of Attorneys -General (CAG) therefore emphasised the compelling legal, human rights, medical and economic arguments for raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility in the ACT and all Australian jurisdictions. At the close of the reporting period, this issue remains under consideration by CAG until mid-2021 at least.PRESIDENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 25 Section B: PerformanceProposed legislative and other responses to elder abuse in the ACT The Commission provided feedback in January 2020 on the government's discussion paper exploring a proposed response to elder abuse in the ACT. Noting the deeply complex and interpersonal dynamics that underlie situations of elder abuse which might dissuade their being reported, our response emphasised that protective measures must be practical, preventative, accessible and effective. Our submission therefore cautioned against favouring reactive criminal justice responses ahead of a more practical civil mechanism for receiving, investigating and resolving allegations of abuse, neglect and exploitation of vulnerable adults, akin to the new NSW Ageing and Disability Commissioner. As a result of this submission and related advocacy by the Commission, including the hosting of a forum in conjunction with Legal Aid ACT, the ACT Government developed and passed amendments enabling the Disability and Community Services Commissioner to receive and handle complaints about abuse, neglect and exploitation of vulnerable adults. The Commission welcomes this new jurisdiction as a proactive and flexible means of protecting people over the age of 60 years, and vulnerable Canberrans, from abuse or neglect. Inquiry into Human Rights (Workers Rights) Amendment Bill 2019 In January 2020, the Commission provided a submission to a Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Justice and Community Safety inquiry into the Human Rights (Workers Rights) Amendment Bill 2020, as introduced in the ACT Legislative Assembly by Ms Bec Cody MLA on 27 November 2019. In this submission, we advocated for the comprehensive inclusion of economic, social and cultural rights in the HR Act, including workers' rights and work-related rights as situated in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). We also argued that a complaint mechanism akin to our discrimination jurisdiction would be more accessible than taking legal action in the Supreme Court, and we recommended the model of Queensland's new Human Rights Act 2019 which has a human rights complaints mechanism. The Assembly passed the bill in May 2020, with amendments to clarify the source of the right to work and work-related rights in the ICESCR and, for the first time, recognise that economic, social and cultural rights in the ACT must be realised progressively.Other comments and submissions Additionally, the Commission provided other formal submissions or comment in relation to the following: Free and equal: an Australian conversation on human rights. This was a national public consultation by the Australian Human Rights Commission about Australia's system of human rights protection, including the need for a federal human rights act. Independent review of legislative provisions designed to target organised criminal activity. A review by Dr Terry Goldsworthy of amendments to crime scene powers under the Crimes Act 1900 as well as other ACT legislative measures designed to target organised crime. Design of justice housing program (advice to ACT Corrective Services about considerations in the design and provision of bail, parole and post-release housing). Human rights advice to MLAs The Commission provided preliminary advice to Ms Bec Cody MLA on her Human Rights (Workers Rights) Amendment Bill 2019 prior to the bill's introduction. Under the parliamentary agreement for the Ninth Legislative Assembly of the ACT, all members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) can seek independent advice from the Commission, including human rights assessments of non-executive bills, without requiring permission from or notification to the Attorney-General.ACT Human Rights Commission 26 DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH SERVICES, DISABILITY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMISSIONERDiscrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner The Commissioner has responsibility for: handling all complaints received by the Commission, including complaints about alleged discrimination, health services, disability services, services for older people, services for children and young people, and treatment of vulnerable people promoting awareness of rights and obligations provided for by the HRC Act, the Discrimination Act and the Health Records (Privacy and Access) Act 1997 (Health Records Act) improving service provision and outcomes for people protected by the Acts using Commission-initiated consideration powers to address systemic issues contributing to legislative and policy development across the jurisdictions administered by the Commissioner. Our mission: delivering accessible services that empower and support people During the reporting period we were able to accept complaints about the following: discrimination, vilification and sexual harassment complaints under the ACT Discrimination Act 1991 health services complaints complaints about access to health records under the ACT Health Records (Privacy and Access) Act complaints about services for people with a disability and their carers complaints about services for older people and their carers complaints about retirement villages complaints about services for children and young people complaints about veterinary surgeons' services complaints about alleged neglect, abuse or exploitation of older people and people with a disability as vulnerable people complaints (May 2020). Other legislative reform will provide us with additional functions in 2021 to further enhance the service we provide. This will enable us to also assist Canberrans with: complaints about breaches of the victims' charter of rights (January 2021) occupancy dispute complaints (February 2021) gender and sexual identity conversion practices complaints (April 2021). In 2019-20, the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner received 1,608 enquiries and 829 complaints. Complaint numbers increased by 21 per cent from the previous year and by 64 per cent over the previous two years. This includes a 72 per cent increase in discrimination complaints from 78 in 2016-17 to 208 in 2019-20.

The conciliation process is subject to statutory confidentiality provisions. Conciliation outcomes may include an apology or statement of regret, explanation of the services provided, acknowledgement of issues with service delivery, or changes to a service provider's policies and procedures to improve the quality of service delivery. Parties can negotiate financial outcomes, such as reimbursement for costs incurred or associated future costs, or compensation for economic or non-economic loss or damage.

In 2019-20, 83 per cent of parties said the complaints process was fair, accessible and understandable. The high level of client satisfaction with the Commission's complaint handling this year reflects the ongoing effort to streamline the process and focus on early resolution of matters. Parties to complaints provided positive feedback about the benefits of the Commission's complaints process: An opportunity to be heard by an independent body. Receiving a fair outcome when the hospital was unable to resolve the issue. The complaint wouldn't have resolved without the involvement of the ACT Human Rights Commission. I thought it was a fair and just system and settled in a timely manner. They resolved my problem with a health provider. Transparent, timely and clear process with a well-developed and apparently fair procedure. It was an opportunity to review our current practices and, with feedback received from HRC, to make improvements. It provided an opportunity to review our policies and practices and to consider the practical impact of them on our clients/tenants. I was able to find a mutually agreeable outcome with the help of HRC. As a family, it meant a lot to us knowing that our voice was heard and our complaint handled sensitively. Commission staff at the 2019 Mental Health and Wellbeing Expo in October 2019. Vulnerable persons In May 2020, the role of Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner was expanded to include a new complaints function for abuse, neglect or exploitation of vulnerable people\u2014a vulnerable person being a person aged over 60 years who experiences barriers to participation in the community because of a disability or social isolation, or an adult with disability. This provides an avenue for people concerned about family, friends or community members to bring their concerns to the Commission's attention. This is a broad jurisdiction filling a gap identified in consultations about improving protections for vulnerable people in the ACT. In the short time we have had the jurisdiction we have been contacted by family members, first responders, service providers, health workers and ACT agencies seeking information or identifying concerns, and we have been responding to those concerns in a customised way given the nature of this jurisdiction. How we handle claims of abuse, neglect and exploitation of vulnerable people Vulnerable people are protected in the ACT from neglect, abuse or exploitation. Anyone who has reasonable grounds to believe that a vulnerable person is subject to, or at risk of, abuse, neglect or exploitation can make an enquiry or report to the Commission. Reporters can be anonymous. Reporters have protections under the law. Reports can be made to the Commission intake team by phone, email or online. Responding to enquiries and reports There are various ways the Commission responds to enquiries and reports: Providing information and support : We can provide information and referral options to the person making a report to us. The report may also be assigned to a staff member who can explore the matter further; this will help us to better understand what actions are needed, and how best to respond. Engaging other professionals : Depending on the nature of the report, we may share part of the report, or information within it, with another agency or service, such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Quality and Safeguards Commission, the Public Trustee and Guardian, the police or the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission.ACT Human Rights Commission 30 DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH SERVICES, DISABILITY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMISSIONER Investigating : We may conduct an investigation. In this case, the Commission would first seek the consent of the adult who is the subject of the report (if appropriate). Following an investigation, we might try to resolve the complaint, refer the matter to another agency or service, or make a public report about the matter. The intention is always to ensure the safety and dignity of the vulnerable person. Health service complaints ACT community members can make a complaint to the Health Services Commissioner about any health service provided in the ACT, including public and private health services, individual practitioners, and health services provided in settings such as aged care facilities, supported accommodation and schools. The Commission's health service complaint process provides parties with a chance to resolve a complaint through conciliation. The complaint handling team responded to 595 health service-related enquiries and received 574 health service complaints. Of these complaints: 366 were made directly to the Health Services Commissioner the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) notified the Commissioner of 202 new matters and the ACT Veterinary Practitioners Board notified the Commissioner of six new matters. As with previous years many complaints relate to communication between practitioners and patients about consent, expectations of treatment and risks associated with particular treatments or procedures. We have also seen an increase in the number of complaints regarding treatment of people with disability by health services, including a lack of involvement of guardians and carers in treatment decisions; and a lack of reasonable adjustments in the provision of health services to accommodate the needs of people with disability in accessing health services on equal terms.

While the primary role of the boards is to protect the public, the boards are also responsible for registering practitioners and students for their professions, as well as other functions. AHPRA supports the national boards in their primary role of protecting the public and works with the Health Services Commissioner to deal with complaints about individual registered health practitioners.The Health Practitioner Regulation National Law 2009 (National Law) requires national boards and the Commissioner to jointly consider how to action complaints against registered health practitioners in the ACT. The boards and the Commissioner jointly decide whether to investigate a practitioner, take regulatory action against a practitioner or close a complaint with no further action. While the complaint process requires joint consideration of matters with the Commissioner, only national boards can take regulatory action against individual health practitioners, such as imposing conditions, requiring a performance assessment, or referral to a tribunal to deregister a practitioner. Practitioners can appeal reviewable decisions to ACAT. Table 8: Outcomes to complaints about health practitioners Outcome Number of complaints No further action 174 Caution 16 Conditions 8 Sanctions 3 Referred to the Health Services Commissioner 25 Total 226 ACT Veterinary Practitioners Board The Commissioner also handles complaints about veterinarian services in the ACT under a co-regulatory model with the ACT Veterinary Practitioners Board. Where appropriate the Commissioner can assist the board by offering to assist the parties to conciliate a complaint to discuss the issues in the complaint and reach an agreement to resolve the complaint. This benefits complainants who have concerns about the treatment of their pet or animals and feel they have not had sufficient information about treatment, adverse outcomes for their pet, or billing queries. This process allows us to facilitate resolution of the issues in the complaint separate to the conduct issues being considered by the board. Six new veterinary matters were received and nine matters were closed in the reporting period.ACT Human Rights Commission 32 DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH SERVICES, DISABILITY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMISSIONERCASE STUDY Treatment of dogs by a veterinary surgeon A person raised concerns about the treatment of three dogs by a veterinary surgeon. Two of the dogs passed away following misdiagnosis. The concerns also included inadequate clinical records and causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. The ACT Veterinary Surgeons Board conducted an investigation which included seeking the opinion of an independent veterinarian. Through the joint consideration process the Commission agreed to the Board's proposal to caution the practitioner and required them to undergo an audit of their clinical records, change their procedure in relation to the aftercare of dogs undergoing surgery and pay a financial penalty. Finalised health service complaints In 2019-20, 327 health service complaints made directly to the Commissioner were closed.

Conciliation is an informal and accessible alternative dispute resolution process in which Commission staff help parties resolve a complaint. The conciliation process is subject to statutory confidentiality provisions. Conciliation outcomes may include an apology or statement of regret, explanation of the services provided, acknowledgement of issues with service delivery, or changes to a service provider's policies and procedures to improve the quality of service delivery. Parties can negotiate financial outcomes, such as reimbursement for costs incurred including associated medical costs, or compensation for economic or non-economic loss or damage.Health case studies Case studies assist the community to understand the types of issues that arise from complaints brought to the Commission and how those matters may be resolved.

The Commission sought a response from the practice and the doctor, as well as third-party information from the specialist. The complaint was jointly considered with the medical board, and conditions were imposed on the doctor's registration requiring the doctor to undergo further training in communication with other health professionals to ensure continuity of care. CASE STUDY Claim that race was a factor in dental treatment An Aboriginal man lodged a complaint regarding dental services saying he presented to a dentist with a dental abscess and consented to having the tooth extracted. After the extraction he continued to experience pain, and several days later another dentist found that the tooth had not been completely extracted. The man said he felt the poor treatment he received was because of his race. The matter was resolved between the parties on a confidential basis. In addition, following joint consideration by the Dental Board and the Commissioner, regulatory action was taken against the dental practitioner.CASE STUDY Guardian's consent for treatment A mother who is the legal guardian of her adult son brought a complaint to the Commission claiming that her son, who has cerebral palsy, had 14 teeth removed under general anaesthetic without her consent. The parties attended conciliation and the matter was successfully resolved whereby the service provider undertook to review and improve the processes for obtaining informed consent. CASE STUDY Laser treatment causes scarring A woman received laser treatment on her back and reported unintended permanent scarring as a result. The parties participated in conciliation and reached a negotiated financial outcome of $10,800, and the provider undertook to review and improve communications and consent procedures, based on the complainant's feedback and experience.ACT Human Rights Commission 34 DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH SERVICES, DISABILITY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMISSIONERCASE STUDY Inadequate procedures for dealing with infectious disease A person said they were asked to make an appointment with their doctor because they had returned a positive test result for whooping cough. On arrival at the practice the person complained that they were not given a mask and not asked to wait in a separate waiting area. The Commission liaised with the Health Protection Service and referred to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) infection prevention and control standards. Following investigation, the Commissioner made formal recommendations to the practice relating to the infection prevention control practices and policies including for patients with a suspected or confirmed infectious disease. The practice reviewed its infection control policies and agreed to amend its process for patients with a disease requiring isolation. CASE STUDY Supports for vulnerable people in hospital A woman raised concern that her brother, who was a vulnerable adult, was not provided with appropriate support during a period of hospitalisation. She also complained that her brother's family was not contacted when his condition deteriorated during his admission. Her brother experienced a serious medical event and subsequently died. At conciliation, the hospital said that it had reviewed the events leading up to the man's death and had implemented changes to processes. The woman was satisfied with the changes made and the apology issued by the hospital.CASE STUDY Technical procedure distracts from patient care A woman said that following a motor vehicle accident, her brother required an invasive procedure which was performed in a patient ward. She said the doctors were so focused on the technical aspects of the procedure they failed to recognise that her brother was in severe pain. The hospital's response acknowledged that the man had been distressed during the procedure. The doctors involved acknowledged the man's pain, but stated that the procedure had been paused to allow for the administration of additional pain relief, which they felt was reasonable. Following joint consideration between the Commission and the Medical Board, regulatory action was taken against both practitioners in relation to patient care. CASE STUDY End-of-life care A man said that medical staff told him that his wife, who had terminal cancer, had a life expectancy of approximately one week. The next day, an infusion with morphine and midazolam had been commenced, and his wife died within 24 hours. The man said that the medication had been started too soon, and that family had not been given sufficient time to arrive from interstate to say goodbye. The response, which included a statement from the doctor who commenced the infusion, said that the woman's condition had deteriorated suddenly, and that she was in significant distress. It said that the infusion had been commenced after discussion with a palliative care specialist and that the man had been notified of the decision. The man was satisfied, as he had not realised the extent of his wife's distress. He was grateful she had not been left in pain.Annual Report 2019-20 35 Section B: PerformanceDISCRIMINATION, HEALTH SERVICES, DISABILITY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMISSIONERNational Code of Conduct for Unregistered Health Care Workers The aim of the National Code of Conduct for Unregistered Health Care Workers is to protect the public by setting minimum standards of conduct and practice for all unregistered health care workers providing health services. The code sets national standards against which disciplinary action can be taken and, if necessary, a prohibition order issued where a health care worker's continued practice presents a serious risk to public health and safety. The Health Services Commissioner participated in public consultation processes in 2018 and 2019 about legislation to enact the code in the ACT and has continued to work with ACT Health to progress this work. We continue to liaise with health complaint commissioners in other states and the Northern Territory about the national approach for implementation of the code. The Health Services Commissioner can deal with complaints regarding unregistered health workers who provide health services under existing health service complaint provisions. The Commissioner is not able to take regulatory action equivalent to other Australian jurisdictions until the code is fully implemented in the ACT. Discrimination complaints The Discrimination Commissioner's role is to handle discrimination complaints, promote equality, examine systemic discrimination concerns, and provide community education and information about rights under discrimination law. The Commissioner also handles sexual harassment, victimisation and vilification complaints and exemption applications. The Discrimination Act is broad, covering many areas of public life (including employment, education, access to premises, accommodation, clubs, and the provision of goods, services and facilities) with a wide range of protected attributes. The Commissioner works with community members, organisations and government to build awareness of rights and obligations under discrimination law and participates in a range of community events, information sessions and committees to promote compliance with discrimination laws, and a safe, inclusive and diverse community. There were 373 enquiries related to discrimination in 2019-20. The Commission also received 42 human rights related enquiries. While the Commission does not have the jurisdiction to handle human rights complaints, these enquiries often relate to equality rights which may be handled as a discrimination complaint or inform systemic, policy or litigation work. There were 208 discrimination complaints lodged with the Commission during the reporting period. This is an increase from 166 in the previous period and a significant increase from 78 complaints in 2016-17. A discrimination complaint can be made on more than one ground and made about more than one area of public life covered by the Discrimination Act.

The Commissioner provides a quick, informal and accessible resolution process. Discrimination complaints are often complex, as they can relate to people seeking to keep their jobs, keeping children in school to access education, and accessing housing or health services which need a timely and skilled intervention to resolve issues before they lead to significant disadvantage such as unemployment or homelessness. CASE STUDY Disability discrimination\u2014 taking an assistance animal to school A child with disability, who required an assistance animal to attend school with her, alleged disability discrimination because of the conditions imposed by the school on the dog's attendance at the school. The matter was resolved in conciliation whereby the school agreed to ensure all staff completed the required disability discrimination training, including specific training in relation to assistance animals, and agreed to put in place communication mechanisms to ensure ongoing communication and resolution of future issues. CASE STUDY Sexual harassment and sex discrimination in employment A woman alleged sex discrimination in her employment due to being paid less than her male colleagues, the way she was treated was less favourable due to her sex and being subjected to sexual harassment. She also alleged she was victimised as a result of raising these issues with her employer, by being excluded, ignored and denied work opportunities. The matter was resolved in a conciliated agreement, with the employer paying $40,000 financial compensation.CASE STUDY Accessing public transport with a guide dog A man with a guide dog was refused public transport. The matter was resolved in conciliation, with the service provider agreeing to follow Territory and federal laws in the provision of their services, and display a sticker advising customers that service animals are welcome on their transport services. CASE STUDY Immigration status discrimination and insurance A woman alleged a private insurance company discriminated against her because of her immigration status, she had been on a student visa but had obtained permanent residency. The company did not allow the cancellation of her insurance policy when she no longer required it and refused to give her a refund. The matter was resolved in conciliation, with the insurance company agreeing to provide a refund, and to coach their employees in relation to this matter. CASE STUDY Disability a barrier to enrolment A faith-based school rejected the application for enrolment of a child diagnosed with mild autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). The child's father reported that the school's principal said they could not enrol his son because of an incident that was deemed violent and because of the need for reasonable adjustments. The parties participated in an early conciliation process and reached agreement. Outcomes included an apology from the school, acceptance of enrolment at a time deemed appropriate to transfer the student from his current public school with minimal disruption, an individualised consultation and learning plan with the disability and inclusion manager, and use of the complainant's impact statement as part of instructional materials for discrimination awareness training for the school leadership.Annual Report 2019-20 39 Section B: PerformanceDISCRIMINATION, HEALTH SERVICES, DISABILITY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMISSIONERSelected ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal referrals If a discrimination complaint is not resolved at conciliation, the complainant can ask the Commission to refer the matter to ACAT for a determination of the issues in the complaint. The Commission referred 31 complaints to ACAT in 2019-20. The following is a selection of matters determined by ACAT in 2019-20. Evans v Dencio (Discrimination) [2020] ACAT 44 (19 June 2020) The applicant, who was a patron of a gym, alleged the respondent, an employee of the same gym and the applicant's personal trainer had discriminated against him in the provision of personal training services because of his sexuality, and had engaged in sexual harassment. ACAT dismissed the matter, not being satisfied the respondent had engaged in unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment. ACAT stated that in order to establish discrimination in the way in which the respondent provided personal training services, the alleged conversation must be more than merely inappropriate and must have some bearing on the manner in which the service to the applicant was delivered. ACAT found it did not. Abraham v Thomas (Discrimination) [2020] ACAT 41 (15 June 2020) The applicant, who was employed as a chef at a local restaurant, alleged the respondent, who was the owner of the restaurant, discriminated against her on the grounds of disability and immigration status. ACAT dismissed the application of discrimination based on disability, but upheld her application of discrimination based on immigration status. ACAT heard that the applicant had been required to work more hours than was specified in her contract and without compensation; and was required to participate in a cash back scheme whereby she paid the respondent $511.40 per fortnight for tax. ACAT found this constituted discrimination based on immigration status because the respondent had threatened to withdraw the applicant's visa sponsorship, meaning she would have to leave Australia if she did not comply. ACAT ordered the respondent to pay the applicant $4,620 (four weeks pay in lieu of notice under the contract), and an additional $13,320 in damages for embarrassment, humiliation and stress. ACAT also ordered the respondent to not repeat such conduct in relation to any future employees.Complainant 201922 v Barac (Discrimination) [2020] ACAT 37 (3 June 2020) The applicant alleged disability discrimination when he attempted to purchase sexual services at a brothel operated by the respondent. The applicant has multiple disabilities causing partial loss of sight and hearing, limited mobility and limited movements in his upper limbs. ACAT accepted that the applicant's vulnerabilities\u2014his inability to defend himself, dress himself, or effectively leave the situation\u2014were, on the balance of probabilities, reasons why the various workers treated him in the unfavourable manner they did, including attempting to coerce him into paying for a service he did not want, demanding more money from him when he had already paid for the service, refusing to refund money despite the service not being provided, imprisoning him in a room for some time, and wheeling him in his wheelchair out into the carpark and leaving him there. ACAT found the respondent was liable for the discriminatory acts of its employees and ordered the respondent to pay the applicant $1,000 in compensation plus a refund of $200. The tribunal noted this was the amount requested by the applicant, and that it was a very modest sum, at the lower end of the range of what might otherwise be ordered by the tribunal. Complainant 201823 v Insurance Australia Group Ltd Trading as NRMA (Discrimination) [2019] ACAT 64 (10 July 2019) The applicant complained that the respondent discriminated against him by refusing to provide him with public liability insurance because of an irrelevant criminal conviction. ACAT found that the respondent refused to provide the service of insurance to the complainant on the basis of a moral assessment and not on the basis of any relevant actuarial considerations, and was satisfied that the respondent discriminated against the applicant by refusing to supply him with commercial insurance because of an irrelevant criminal record. Keightley v ACT Ambulance Service (Discrimination) [2019] ACAT 61 (28 June 2019) The applicant was employed as an ambulance dispatcher in a communication centre. She alleged her employer, the respondent, discriminated against her on the basis of her disability by proposing to transfer her to another work area, and by delaying approval to bring her service dog to work. ACAT found that there were additional reasons beyond the applicant's disability for her proposed transfer, including the respondent's overriding responsibility to the wider community to ensure its employees can perform their critical functions at all times. ACAT also found that while there was a delay by the respondent of about seven weeks in progressing approval for the applicant to bring her service dog to work, this did not equate to unfavourable treatment of the applicant due to her disability.ACT Human Rights Commission 40 DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH SERVICES, DISABILITY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMISSIONERDisability and community service complaints The Disability and Community Services Commissioner has responsibility for handling complaints about services for older people and their carers, disability services, services for children and young people and retirement villages in the ACT. As of May 2020, the Commission also handles complaints where a person believes a vulnerable person is subject to or at risk of abuse, neglect or exploitation\u2014a vulnerable person being a person aged over 60 years who experiences barriers to participation in the community because of a disability or social isolation, or an adult with disability. In 2019-20, the Commissioner continued a proactive community engagement program to raise the Commission's profile as a complaint handling body resolving concerns for the Canberra community across a wide range of service systems. The Commission also continued to provide training and education sessions for organisations and community groups to build understanding of the complaint handling process. In 2020, these have primarily been delivered online. Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner, Karen Toohey, and Minister for Justice, Shane Rattenbury, taking part in a facebook live event about human rights in the time of COVID-19, in April 2020.

Complaints about services for older people The Commissioner's jurisdiction includes considering complaints about services for older people. Complaints may concern: organisations providing specialised services for older people and their carers, such as retirement villages, personal and home care services, and respite care care support workers, such as people providing personal and home care assistance, home maintenance or transport community support organisations providing services, such as food services, advocacy or employment. In some cases, complaints from older people have been dealt with under other jurisdictions, such as age discrimination, health or disability services, and now under the vulnerable people complaints function. Retirement villages In July 2019, the Retirement Villages Legislation Amendment Act 2019 introduced amendments to allow individuals to make a complaint to the Commission in relation to a service provided by the operator of a retirement village under the Retirement Villages Act 2012. These amendments have enabled the Commission to try to resolve a matter through conciliation and refer a matter to ACAT where it is not able to be resolved through conciliation. This is an enhancement of the Commission's current powers to take complaints about services for older people. Complaints about retirement villages can also be made as an age discrimination complaint or a complaint about services for older people. Fortunately, we receive few complaints about retirement villages. However, since March 2020 we have received several enquiries regarding village operators imposing significant restrictions on residents due to COVID-19, equivalent to those authorised by the Chief Health Officer relating to residential aged care facilities. Although operators may have been seeking to protect residents, some of these restrictions also had the effect of increasing anxiety and fear in the residents who contacted the Commissioner directly. Where possible, these matters were resolved informally through direct contact with the operators. Complaints about services for children and young people The Commissioner also deals with complaints about services for children and young people. Complaints may involve any service provided to children and young people, including education, sport, child protection, out-of-home care, disability services such as respite or transport services, child-specific health services such as mental health services, and youth justice.

She said she was denied financial assistance for a young person in her care because he had turned 18 years of age. The Commission contacted the service provider, who advised it was an oversight that their policy regarding support and assistance for people aged over 18 years had not been considered or applied, and agreed to consider an application made under that policy. The woman later informed the Commission she had been reimbursed by the provider for the costs she had been seeking assistance with.CASE STUDY Enrolment obstacles A mother raised concerns about the decision of a public high school principal to rescind an offer of enrolment for her son because she was unable to produce the correct documentation regarding their residential address. The woman was in the process of purchasing a property in the catchment area, but the purchase had not been finalised due in part to a delay related to injuries she had sustained in the bushfires. The woman said that the school did not adequately take into consideration her personal circumstances. Following the review, the child's enrolment was reinstated and the matter was resolved. Our mission: leading positive systemic change Commission-initiated considerations A Commission-initiated consideration can be conducted where there is concern about a systemic problem\u2014for example, where: several complaints or notifications about a particular practice or organisation are received a complaint is made anonymously raising concerns within the Human Rights Commission's jurisdiction someone with a grievance does not have personal standing, capacity, involvement or authority to make a complaint the community raises an issue, such as in the media or through community organisation representations. In these circumstances, the Commissioner becomes the complainant and matters are investigated as a complaint. In a Commission-initiated consideration, the Commissioner will work with organisations to resolve any issues identified during the investigation process. This may include recommending an organisation update policies or practices, undertake staff training or education, and recommendations to improve service delivery or compliance with relevant standards. The Commissioner can make formal recommendations, and in those cases will seek evidence of compliance or will revisit the issues with the organisation after an agreed review period. The Commissioner can now also take discrimination Commission-initiated considerations to the tribunal for determination. In 2019-20, the Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner began eight new Commission-initiated considerations and closed nine. At 30 June 2020, there were eight open Commission-initiated considerations in disability services, vulnerable people concerns, health services and discrimination jurisdictions.

The Commission commenced a Commission-initiated consideration and referred part of the matter to the ACT Health Protection Service, which conducted an investigation. As a result, the clinic was required to implement several new procedures and undertake corrective and preventative actions under the Medicines, Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 2008 including: improving staff immunisation rate and records ensuring equipment and products are within their expiry date using an instrument-grade detergent for cleaning instruments improving cleaning procedures improving the testing and monitoring of equipment updating policy and procedure manuals. The Health Protection Service was satisfied that the issues identified were unlikely to have posed a risk to the patients, but warranted attention by the clinic. CASE STUDY Palliative care services in the ACT The Commission received a complaint from a woman about the end-of-life palliative care services provided to her relative. The complaint raised concerns of possible systemic issues, so a Commission-initiated consideration into palliative care services in the ACT was commenced. The investigation is focused on ensuring that human rights obligations are properly factored into the development, implementation and evaluation of palliative care policies and procedures for all government-funded health services in the ACT. The matter is ongoing at the time of writing. CASE STUDY Oral health services in the Alexander Maconochie Centre A Commission-initiated consideration was commenced in response to recommendations made by the ACT Inspector of Correctional Services, Neil McAllister, in his report Healthy Prison Review of the Alexander Maconochie Centre 2019. The report identified extensive wait-times for less urgent dentistry at the Alexander Maconochie Centre (AMC) as a matter of significant concern, and noted that this was a missed opportunity for preventative interventions. Recommendation 52 of the report is that the Health Services Commissioner review the provision of dental health services at the AMC. The matter was ongoing at the close of the reporting period.ACT Human Rights Commission 44 VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONERVictims of Crime Commissioner The Victims of Crime Commissioner (VOCC) functions are set out in the Victims of Crime ACT 1994 (VoC Act), the Victims of Crime (Financial Assistance) Act 2016 (VoCFA) and the Victims of Crime Regulation 2000 . The functions of the VOCC include: advocating for the interests of victims of crime monitoring and promoting compliance with the governing principles responding to concerns related to victims' experiences of the criminal justice system ensuring the provision of efficient and effective services for victims promoting reforms to meet the interests of victims developing educational and other programs to promote awareness of the interests of victims ensuring victims receive the information and assistance they need providing oversight of services provided by the Victim Services Scheme (VSS) and the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS).In addition, the VOCC is the ACT Domestic Violence Project Coordinator as outlined in the Domestic Violence Agencies Act 1986. The work of the coordinator is assigned by the Domestic Violence Prevention Council. The coordinator's functions in relation to reducing the incidence of family violence include: monitoring and promoting compliance with the policies of the ACT and Australian governments assisting government and non-government agencies to provide services of the highest standard facilitating cooperation among agencies and organisations assisting in the development and implementation of policies and programs. The VOCC is also responsible for administering the ACT's Witness Intermediary Program under Chapter 1B of the Evidence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1991. The VOCC is responsible for establishing and maintaining a panel of qualified intermediaries who provide independent advice to police, and at court, about a witness's communication needs.

VSS aims to promote recovery and support people's ongoing participation in the social, economic and cultural life of their community. The VSS team works closely with other agencies to ensure victims have access to a range of supports and can access help when and how they choose. Many people who experience violent crime do not seek help immediately and may never report to police. Importantly, no time limits apply to seeking help under the VSS and support can be provided regardless of whether the crime has been formally reported. All new VSS clients are assigned a case coordinator who works with them throughout their time with the service, providing continuity and a stable point of contact. Case coordinators offer information about what to expect after a crime, including what to expect from the justice system. They can link clients with funded counsellors and other therapeutic supports as well as advocating for their interests in the justice system. Case coordinators also support clients to resolve a broad range of other problems the crime may have caused, such as access to safe housing or appropriate medical care. This year, VSS responded to a large increase in the volume of clients seeking to access counselling and other therapeutic supports. Overall, VSS registered 689 new clients for case coordination, a 31 per cent increase on 2018-19. A total of 2,159 clients accessed case coordination, advice, information, counselling, court support or justice advocacy services, a 27 per cent increase on last year and a 53 per cent increase on the same data three years ago. In the final quarter of 2019-20, COVID-19 led to a significant surge in demand. In May and June, VSS responded to 446 enquiries and referrals, a 49 per cent increase compared to the previous year. In June alone, there was a 70 per cent increase in new VSS clients compared to the same period last year, including a 127 per cent increase in new family violence matters and a 50 per cent increase in new sexual assault matters. The VSS team worked closely with partner agencies and our valued VSS providers during this time to provide cohesive safety supports to those experiencing violence, including ongoing face-to-face contact where required. The Commission's stall at SpringOUT Fair Day in November 2019. During the year, VSS renewed the tender process for counsellors and other therapeutic providers who are approved under the Victims of Crime Regulation 2000. The VSS provider panel remains open and we warmly welcome queries from interested community providers. Throughout the year, VSS team member Kristy Capper also initiated a range of activities to improve visibility and access to our service for people with disabilities. This included visiting residential homes, networking with disability support agencies, contributing to the implementation of the disability justice strategy and drafting an easy English booklet about our service. A specialist disability organisation is also providing training to our panel of providers about best-practice approaches to working with people who have intellectual or learning disabilities. We continue to look for ways to improve our service for victims with a disability and their families. VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 47 Section B: PerformanceCASE STUDY Sarah's story Sarah had experienced violence at many different times in her life. She was sexually assaulted by a family member as a teenager and was recently assaulted by her ex-partner. Sarah is now in her late twenties and has a four -year-old son. She has recently been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) relating to the assaults and has difficulties with her memory and cognitive functioning due to a brain injury she received in a car accident a couple of years ago. Sarah was referred to VSACT by the Domestic Violence Crisis Service (DVCS). Her case coordinator undertook a range of tasks to assist and support Sarah, including: supporting Sarah to access emergency accommodation liaising with Housing ACT to support Sarah's transition to longer term accommodation liaising with RSPCA to obtain care for Sarah's dog as the emergency accommodation did not allow pets working with DVCS to develop, implement and review safety planning with Sarah providing advocacy and support for Sarah with police, the DPP and courts in relation to the assault charges against her ex-partner and working to ensure that these agencies understood Sarah's memory issues and could give Sarah information she needed in ways that she could understand organising a VSACT volunteer to help Sarah prepare a victim impact statement in relation to the assault charges, and support Sarah at court so she could obtain a final family violence order assisting Sarah to complete a FAS application to access an immediate needs payment for a removalist and a recognition payment participating in case conferencing with CYPS and assisting Sarah to access parenting support, including via a referral to the Child and Family Centre circle of security parent group liaising with advocacy agencies to secure support for Sarah relating to the functional impact of her brain injury linking Sarah with a funded counsellor to assist her in managing the symptoms of her PTSD and working through other impacts of the violent relationship and sexual assault. Sarah and her son have found more suitable accommodation and have been able to bring their dog back to live with them. Sarah says that the support of her case coordinator made a big difference when she had to deal with police, the courts and CYPS.

Highlights for FAS include the following: FAS received 513 new applications, an increase of 13 per cent compared to 2018-19 (453 applications) and a 375 per cent increase compared to the scheme's first year of operation (108 applications). There were 298 applications related to family violence, a 40 per cent increase compared to 2018-19. Family violence applications made up 58 per cent of all FAS applications received this year. Additional safety and financial pressures reported by clients in the context of COVID-19 led to a significant increase in the number of applications with an immediate need component. Such applications required urgent processing to assist with relocation, personal security and medical costs. In May, there was an 85 per cent increase in immediate need applications compared to the same period last year. Overall, there was a 32 per cent annual increase in immediate need applications.

This year, 12 per cent of applications were received from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander applicants. VSACT's multicultural outreach program also appears to have contributed to an increase in the number of applications received from Canberra's culturally and linguistically diverse communities during 2019-20, increasing from 10 per cent to 14 per cent in the past year. Applications from people with disabilities also increased to 9 per cent, up from 6 per cent the previous year.

There are two different recognition payments that can be made for acts of violence that occurred before 1 July 2016. Certain sexual offences If the act of violence occurred in the context of sexual offences pursuant to sections 51 to 62 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT), the maximum recognition payment is $50,000. Of the total number of FAS applications received in 2019-20, 9 per cent related to historical sexual offences (i.e. sexual offences before 1 July 2016). In 2019-20, there were 37 recognition payments made to applicants in this situation\u2014some of whom applied in 2019-20 and some of whom applied in earlier years\u2014totalling $1.85 million.

An extremely serious injury results in a permanent impairment of a bodily function, a permanent loss of a bodily function, a permanent disfigurement, a permanent mental or behavioural disorder or the loss of a fetus. There was one payment totalling $30,000 made in 2019-20 for extremely serious injury under section 203(4) (b) of the VoCFA. Funeral expenses A person is eligible to apply for a funeral expense payment if the person has paid, or is required to pay, the costs of a funeral for a primary victim who has died as a result of homicide. In 2019-20, there was one payment of $8,000 for funeral assistance. Review of Victims of Crime Commissioner's decisions Decisions made by the VOCC under the FAS can be reviewed internally or by ACAT. In 2019-20, the VOCC reviewed four decisions, confirming one and varying three.

With her ex-partner in custody for another family violence offence, Rebecca made the difficult decision to relocate her family interstate to feel safer and be closer to family support. Rebecca used a removal company to help move some of her belongings to her new location and place them into storage until she found a new home. Rebecca received an immediate need payment from FAS to cover the costs of the removalist and storage. Once Rebecca secured new accommodation, she had her goods removed from storage and delivered to her new property. Several of Rebecca's household items had been damaged by her ex-partner, which meant she was able to apply for relocation assistance to purchase some basic household items like a refrigerator and new beds for her children. Rebecca suffered both physical and psychological injuries as a result of the violence. She also received financial assistance to attend a specialist for assessment and minor surgery related to a broken nose. CASE STUDY James' story After a night out with friends, 19-year-old James was waiting for a taxi home when he was approached by a group of young men. He was punched in the face and fell to the ground, where he sustained blunt force trauma to his head and bleeding on the brain. James underwent surgery and endured a period of hospitalisation. Suffering from post-traumatic amnesia, James needed intensive rehabilitation including physiotherapy, speech pathology and occupational therapy. James was unable to return to his casual construction job for six months after the incident. In addition to a recognition payment relating to the assault, James received financial assistance for his lost earnings over this period.ACT Human Rights Commission 54 VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONEROutreach programs From the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program responds to the needs of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, families and children in the ACT and surrounding areas. We recognise and respond to the diversity of communities that meet and live on Ngunnawal land. The program aims to work with and walk alongside Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, bearing witness to the harm and trauma within our communities, from colonisation to the present. Through bearing witness and truth-telling, healing and nation-building becomes possible. This understanding enables us to support our people in a range of environments and situations, including those who are in prison or in health facilities as well as those living in the community. The goal is to work within the community in the way in which they request. This will necessarily change as we respond to different situations and needs. Over the past 12 months, the program has facilitated therapeutic yarning circles for women in the AMC and in the community, and provided individual counselling/ trauma work for men, women and children in a broad range of environments. The program has actively supported women, men and children in the justice system\u2014including sitting with our people while they write and speak victim impact statements or provide evidence as witnesses in criminal and/or family violence order matters. The program has provided active support with applications for family violence orders and worked closely with the Aboriginal liaison officers at ACT Policing. The program has also provided women and children with practical and emotional support at the point of leaving a violent relationship, including advocating for, and securing, safe accommodation. The program has also supported many of our community to put in complaints to the Human Rights Commission when they experienced discrimination from services or racism from the broader community. We actively build capacity for people to access the many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services in the ACT\u2014 recognising the fundamental right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to develop and run their own health and wellbeing services\u2014assisting with the ongoing nation -building for our people. Knowing that many of our community intersect with mainstream services, the program focused through the year on building strong relationships with services, such as the Education Directorate, Canberra Health Services and ACT Housing. These organisations will now contact us directly to refer families and children for support; and ask us to work directly with schools and other environments to assist them to develop structures and processes that are culturally responsive and safe. The program will continue this focus into the next year of our work in the spirit of collaboration and for the wellbeing of our communities. This year the program assisted 186 clients compared with 126 the previous year (47.6 per cent increase). However, this number does not reflect the stories or the reality of working in community. Many of our interactions, our yarns, our reaching out and connecting a cousin, aunty or bub to a service is not recorded in this way. Program workers, Tanya and Barbara aim to be a consistent, responsive, respectful and meaningful presence in the community, holding a deep sense of responsibility for the country on which they work, the community in which they live and each other. Figure 5: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients 0306090120150 Torres Strait IslanderAboriginal B: PerformanceMulticultural outreach program VSACT employed its first cultural liaison officer, Zouheir Dalati, in March 2019. Since then, VSACT has established a multicultural outreach program aimed at increasing access to our service for people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. The program has been working to strengthen our working relationships with key stakeholders across Canberra's diverse cultural communities. We have also consolidated referral pathways with key multicultural agencies including the Australian Red Cross, Migrant and Refugee Settlement Services, the Multicultural Hub, Companion House and the ACT Office for Multicultural Affairs. Another key aim of the program is to strengthen our team's ability to offer culturally responsive services, and ensure that our services meet the needs of clients from a broad range of cultural and religious backgrounds. We have been working to grow the number of VSS providers who speak a language other than English, including online access to counsellors outside of the ACT if there isn't a local provider who speaks the client's preferred language. Earlier in the year, Mr Dalati also worked with the ACT Inspector for Correctional Services to administer the detainee survey for the ACT's first healthy prison review at the AMC. Mr Dalati's contribution supported the active participation of detainees from migrant backgrounds, ensuring their experiences and perspectives informed the review.At a national level, Mr Dalati has also contributed as one of 10 people on a national expert panel for the Fathering Across Cultures project developed by the Migration Council of Australia. This project contributes to the implementation of the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and Their Children 2010-2022. The project increases men's involvement in achieving gender equality and reducing violence, with a specific interest in engaging men as fathers. In 2019-20, 204 VSS clients were born in a country other than Australia. Of the 70 countries reported, the top five are listed below.

Julio was referred to VSACT after he was assaulted in front of his wife and young children. The incident damaged Julio's relationships with his wife and children, and the entire family no longer feel safe in Canberra. The family did not initially seek help after the assault, concerned about the possible impact on their visas if they reported the incident to police and became witnesses in a criminal matter. The injuries and trauma related to the assault left Julio unable to work and provide for his family. The family became homeless in late 2019, vacating their private rental property when they could no longer cover the rent. The multicultural liaison officer contacted Julio to offer him a range of services which Julio warmly accepted. Over several months, the multicultural liaison officer advocated successfully for Julio to: be allocated a three-bedroom public housing property receive Centrelink payments access ongoing trauma counselling make a FAS application receive regular food basket deliveries. The multicultural liaison officer also referred the family to a number of multicultural agencies that could connect them with employment services, social activities and playgroups. VSACT will remain engaged with the family as they work towards feeling safe again in the Canberra community.ACT Human Rights Commission 56 VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONER VSACT cultural liaison officer, Zouheir Dalati (second from right), with community members at the Parliament House launch of National Unity Week in October 2019. Volunteer court support program VSACT's volunteer program is delivered by highly skilled, trained volunteers who help victims of crime navigate the ACT court system. In 2019-20, volunteers provided 310 hours of court support to 73 clients and 251 hours of work to support victims with FAS applications and related matters. Support provided by volunteers includes: court orientation and familiarisation with court processes and court etiquette support at meetings with the DPP and ACT Policing support when giving evidence in the courtroom, in remote witness rooms and at sentencing hearings support when accessing Legal Aid ACT to apply for a family violence or personal protection order, and to attend preliminary conferences and final hearings in relation to such an order help to complete FAS applications or to write a victim impact statement provision of research and administrative support to the VOCC and FAS teams.During 2019-20, the volunteer program also: worked collaboratively with the DPP witness assistance service to check-in with vulnerable witnesses at court and to provide them with information about VSACT services including financial support, counselling and other therapeutic services liaised with court support operations staff to facilitate safe entry and exit from the court for vulnerable witnesses provided support for witnesses, particularly young people, who reside in the ACT but have been required to give evidence in interstate matters using the remote witness suite.

He helped me get through it.\" Volunteer support during COVID 19 Face-to-face volunteer support was suspended between March and May 2020 due to COVID-19 when many court matters were delayed or conducted remotely. During this period, the volunteer coordinator provided information and support to clients by phone, continuing to connect them to the Legal Aid protection unit or the Domestic Violence Crisis Service (DVCS) court advocacy program to apply for protection orders by phone and/or to attend preliminary conferences and final hearings in person. The provision of face-to-face support resumed in June, utilising social distancing requirements. The VSACT volunteer coordinator provides all volunteers with ongoing tailored support and de-briefing. Volunteers can also participate in: ongoing training: volunteers attended a range of training and information sessions to further their understanding of the criminal justice system and better support VSACT clients volunteer quarterly meetings: these meetings provide an informal opportunity for volunteers to meet, debrief and share their experiences over lunch. During the COVID-19 period, these meetings were conducted online to maintain engagement and support for volunteers.ACT Human Rights Commission 58 VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONERIntermediary Program In June 2019 the ACT Government committed $5.8 million over four years for the VOCC to establish and administer the Intermediary Program in the ACT, which commenced in January 2020. Intermediaries are communication specialists. They assist witnesses with communication difficulties, such as children, to give their most accurate and complete evidence to police and in court. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse recommended the introduction of intermediaries in all Australian states and territories. It recognised that vulnerable witnesses face significant barriers when providing evidence about alleged sexual assault perpetrated against them. The introduction of intermediaries in the ACT in January 2020 required close collaboration between criminal justice stakeholders regarding necessary law reform, appropriate referral systems, stakeholder training and much more. In July 2019, the program team was created within the Commission. Two full-time intermediaries were engaged, each with experience working with vulnerable children and young people and one with significant experience operating as an intermediary in NSW. A program oversight body called the implementation monitoring group was created. It is chaired by the VOCC and comprises senior representatives of ACT law and justice organisations including ACT Policing, DPP, JACSD, Legal Aid, the ACT Law Society and the ACT Bar Association. CYPS is also represented. This group met monthly in the second half of 2019, providing invaluable guidance during the program establishment phase. Detailed processes, procedures and referral pathways were designed by the program team working with criminal justice stakeholders including representatives of ACT Policing and the court. These processes are captured in the Intermediary Procedural Guidance Manual, which is publicly available on the Commission website. A range of allied health professionals and other suitably qualified specialists undertook the comprehensive intermediary training and accreditation process. A total of two in-house intermediaries and 13 external panel intermediaries successfully completed the accreditation process in December 2019. Intermediaries' professional backgrounds include speech pathology, occupational therapy, social work and psychology. The intermediary training process was led by barrister and law professor Penny Cooper, who is an internationally recognised expert in the work of intermediaries. Continuing professional development courses have been designed for the intermediaries to ensure they maintain their skillsets. Professor Cooper also led in-depth training and information sessions for criminal justice system stakeholders and civil society organisations, including for Supreme Court judges, associates and sheriffs, police officers in the Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Team (SACAT), members of the DPP, Legal Aid, ACT Law Society, ACT Bar and CYPS. Information sessions were also provided to the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre, the Public Trustee and Guardian and other organisations and individuals interested in the work of intermediaries. The program operates under the VOCC but is not a part of VSACT. Police In January 2020, intermediaries commenced working with ACT police officers from SACAT. At the request of police, intermediaries were made available seven days a week, including outside of standard business hours. Intermediaries primarily provide their communication facilitation services at police stations, but at the request of police also attend schools, hospitals, secure mental health facilities, domestic residences and nursing homes as required. Court In March 2020, the law commenced, permitting intermediaries to facilitate communication of witnesses in Supreme Court criminal matters. The law ensured that the court considered intermediary appointments for child complainants in sexual offence proceedings, and child witnesses in serious violent offence proceedings involving the death of a person. The court may also appoint intermediaries for other witnesses with communication difficulties, including defendants with communication difficulties. The law also permitted the Supreme Court to hold special hearings in the course of criminal proceedings, called ground rules hearings. At a hearing, the court considers the communication needs of the witness and decides how to conduct the criminal proceedings fairly and effectively, taking into consideration the witnesses' particular communication needs. The program commenced providing intermediaries at the Supreme Court's request in May 2020. Service provision statistics The program received a total of 45 referrals for the period 31 January - 30 June 2020, including 42 police referrals and three court referrals. Two of the court referrals from the Supreme Court were in relation to criminal proceedings; and one referral was in relation to a family violence related matter before the Magistrate's Court. All referrals were met VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 59 Section B: Performancewith appropriate intermediary services (see the infographic below titled Intermediary Program data). The types of communication difficulties witnesses presented with included ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, language disorders, cognitive impairment, cerebral palsy and trauma. The young age of witnesses was also a common communication difficulty among witnesses referred. COVID-19 COVID-19 presented considerable challenges during the program's start-up phase. It impacted the operations of both the program and the work of criminal justice stakeholders that the program engages with. Nonetheless, the program team continued uninterrupted service delivery together with stakeholder partners, including while operating as a remote workforce.

The child will attend Winchester Police Station within the hour, to provide her evidence during interview. The only information I have about the child's communication needs is her young age. I prepare my intermediary resources. I think about the child's age, considering what items she might find interesting while assisting me to assess her communication capabilities. I take a number of aids and games, selecting items that will help me build rapid rapport and allow me to include the police officers in activities, to assist their own rapport building. I include extra aids, in case she has other communication difficulties, such as ADHD, autism or learning delays. When I arrive at the police station I introduce myself to the child witness and her parents. With their consent I conduct a communication assessment with the child, which takes approximately 30 minutes. I assess the child's understanding of time concepts and her abilities to sequence events and provide information in narrative form. During the communication assessment I identify what question forms will assist police communication with the child. I learn a lot about her communication style in a short time, including her ability to focus and her understanding of prepositions such as on, in, under and outside. I establish the child's counting abilities through a ball catching game, which incidentally assists rapport building through a police officer's active involvement. After the communication assessment, I meet with the interviewing officers to provide an overview of my assessment observations and recommendations about what might support this young witness to give her best evidence in the police interview. My recommendations include using simple language and short, direct questions. I advise avoiding the use of figurative language and recommend using drawing to assist the child's understanding, as needed. I sit in the interview room alongside police and the child while the evidence-in-chief interview is conducted. The child has chosen her favourite distractor item from my resource kit to take into the interview, which she uses throughout to alleviate her feelings of stress. Communication successfully occurs during the interview, which takes over two hours with a number of breaks included for the child's benefit. Following the interview, I participate in a quick debrief with the lead interviewing officer and we discuss the recommendations they found most useful when communicating with the child witness. Intermediary Program team members.VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 61 Section B: PerformanceCASE STUDY Working with the court: a day in the life of an intermediary The Supreme Court has appointed me as the intermediary in a criminal proceeding with a child witness who needs help communicating his evidence. I must undertake a detailed communication assessment of the child to prepare a report with communication recommendations for the court. During the communication assessment I explore the child's language and attention skills. For example, how does the child understand concepts of time and speech, such as the prepositions in, on, under, inside and outside? I consider what question forms the can child understand, and the breadth of his vocabulary. Is the child's speech able to be understood? How often may the child require a break? I use toys and games and lots of chatting. (For the older teens, I have chats where they divulge the ways of Instagram, Snapchat or something else of interest to young people.) I may also review the recorded evidence -in-chief interview to study the child's communication. The court report I prepare details all the child's communication needs and makes recommendations for questioning of the child at trial. The communication report is submitted to the court. I then attend what is called a ground rules hearing at court. There the judge and counsel ask me questions regarding my communication recommendations. The judge then decides which recommendations will be followed at trial. On the day of the trial, I will be in a remote room with the child where they will be cross-examined via CCTV. Children do not have to be present in the actual court room. I bring communication pictures that the child may need, including cards for him to indicate ' I don't understand' . Distractor toys help combat his stress. During the child's questioning I sit nearby, monitoring each question asked by counsel as well as the child's emotions. A unique part of my role is my ability to intervene during the cross-examination if communication breaks down. I raise my hand to indicate this to the court and recommend how communication with the child can be improved. If the child loses concentration or becomes fatigued or distressed, I may recommend a short break so he can take time to stretch, have a drink, eat or run around and burn off some energy. The child witness can then sit still for further periods of questioning and give their best evidence. In summary, is an extraordinary job which I consider a privilege. ACT Human Rights Commission 62 VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONEROur mission: leading positive systemic change Victim rights and reform The VOCC is tasked under section 11 of the VoC Act to promote reforms to meet the interests of people affected by crime. The VOCC works directly with victims to advocate for improvements to the criminal justice system. The experiences of victims, along with contemporary research, inform our advice to the ACT Government and other agencies to advance positive, systemic improvements for people affected by crime in the ACT. Raising concerns with the VOCC The governing principles set out in section 4 of the VoC Act outline how victims should be treated in the criminal justice system. Under section 11, the VOCC has responsibility for monitoring and promoting compliance with these governing principles as well as ensuring that concerns regarding non-compliance are dealt with appropriately. The VOCC has broad information gathering powers that aid the resolution of victim concerns. In administering these responsibilities, the VOCC and the victim rights and reform team work directly with victims to understand their concerns and communicate with justice agencies to resolve them. Individual concerns often highlight issues which, in turn, inform the VOCC's recommendations for systemic reform. The entire VSACT team regularly assist clients to resolve a high volume of minor concerns about breaches of the governing principles. More complex matters are escalated to the VOCC. In 2019-20, the VOCC and the team assisted approximately 50 victims of crime with their concerns about agency non-compliance with the governing principles and broader service issues. Advocacy and assistance provided by the VOCC and the team has included: raising concerns with ACT Policing about reasonable adjustments for a person with disability reporting to police liaising with the Acting Chief Magistrate about special interim family violence orders and their ability to provide protection between the end of criminal proceedings and commencement of civil proceedings appearing in ACAT to represent the views of persons affected by a crime where the offender has been found not guilty by way of mental impairment liaising with ACT Policing about delays in investigation and the provision of updates and information advocating for an ex-gratia payment for a victim who cannot access compensation via civil proceedings or FAS advocating for a victim to obtain legal advice and representation in relation to the issuing of subpoenas in a criminal matter that raised privacy concerns advocating for a victim of family violence for priority housing with Housing ACT liaising with ACT Corrective Services to obtain information about an offender's sentence required for a victim's safety and wellbeing liaising with ACT Policing for access to information regarding offences that were reported in the ACT prior to the establishment of ACT Policing. Law and policy reform Charter of rights for victims of crime A primary focus of 2019-20 has been leading the Commission's advice to the ACT Government regarding the charter of rights for victims of crime, which will commence in January 2021. The charter will be the most comprehensive, legislated set of rights for victims of crime in Australia. It will be a significant step forward in strengthening the ACT's human rights framework to better uphold the rights and interests of those affected by crime. While all ACT citizens are rights holders under the HR Act , the charter will detail how human rights apply specifically in situations where a citizen is the victim of a crime. The criminal justice system requires victims to come forward to report crime and provide evidence. Explicitly defining victim rights is a significant step forward in acknowledging the essential role of victims in the criminal justice process. Victims often report that their experience of the criminal justice process is prolonged, complex and traumatic. Importantly, the charter will assist victims to maintain choice and control over their interactions with the criminal justice system by providing specific rights relating to: respect, privacy and safety access to support services and other forms of assistance provision of information about criminal justice processes updates about investigations, proceedings and decisions made throughout the criminal justice process participation and the right to be heard as a victim at different stages of criminal justice proceedings. Those whose rights are breached will be able to raise a complaint with the justice agency directly, the VOCC, or the Disability and Community Services Commissioner, who may initiate a formal conciliation process between the victim of crime and the justice agency concerned. Other policy and law reform work During 2019-20, the VOCC has provided advice to the ACT Government and other agencies about a broad range of issues affecting people affected by crime. For example, the VOCC provided advice to the ACT Government on:VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 63 Section B: Performance the review of the Family Violence Act 2016 to ensure that the Act best protects the safety of those who are experiencing or are at risk of family violence rights in the Mental Health Act 2015 (MH Act) for persons affected by crime, where the offender was found not guilty by way of mental impairment, to attain information about the offender for their safety and wellbeing and to have their views presented in ACAT proceedings the COVID-19 Emergency Response Bill, which included early release under the Corrections Management Act 2007 and management of administrative sanctions for minor breaches by community-based offenders civil and criminal responses to elder abuse and neglect in institutional and private settings, including new specific offences and circumstances of aggravation judicial directions in response to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse section 44 of the Bail Act 1992 to ensure that the Act operates as a safeguard to protect victims of crime and the community in the context of serious offences or family violence offences which raise significant safety issues. The VOCC also provided advice to: the ACT Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Health, Ageing and Community Services, on information sharing in the care and protection system in accordance with the CYP Act the ACT Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Justice and Community Safety on the evaluation of current ACT Policing arrangements, including the role of ACT Policing in relation to family violence orders and policing response to sexual assault matters and people with diverse needs the DPP on the development of victim engagement policies which implement recommendations made by the Royal Commission the Sexual Assault Reform Program regarding spent convictions for juvenile sexual offenders the Australian Government Attorney-General's Department, via JACSD, on the policy paper regarding the national framework for family violence information sharing between family law and criminal justice and child protection systems. Boards and committees The VOCC works closely with justice stakeholders on a range of boards and committees to ensure victim rights and interests are upheld across the ACT. The VOCC chairs the Family Violence Intervention Program . The program coordinates the ACT's response to family violence matters that proceed through the criminal justice system, with the aim of maximising victim safety. Members include ACT Policing, the DPP, ACT Law Courts and Tribunals, Corrective Services, DVCS, Legal Aid, Canberra Rape Crisis Centre, JACSD Coordinator-General for Family Safety, CYPS and Canberra Health Services. The Family Violence Intervention Program's work in the reporting period included: continuing to collect data to identify the use of face-to-face support for interim family violence order applicants; this data has prompted several initiatives to increase access to supports in response to COVID-19, development of a new pilot case-tracking program to improve information sharing and risk-assessment in family violence matters that present outside of the criminal justice system. The VOCC also chairs or participates in the following: Victims Advisory Board: the board supports the ACT Government to promote the interests of and achieve better outcomes for victims of crime in the ACT. In 2019-20, the board's focus was on providing advice to government regarding the charter of rights for victims of crime. National Victims of Crime Working Group: the VOCC was appointed chair of the group for 2019. The group involves victims of crime commissioners from each state and territory. Members share information relating to their frontline services, policies, practices and legal frameworks, to promote innovation and best practice. Domestic Violence Prevention Council: as a member of the council and the ACT Domestic Violence Project Coordinator, the VOCC supports the council's ongoing work to prevent domestic and family violence across the ACT. Liquor Advisory Board: The VOCC's participation on this board provides an important opportunity to advocate for the interests of victims in the context of preventing and responding to alcohol-fuelled violence. PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 64Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner The Public Advocate and the Children and Young People Commissioner (PACYPC) are two separate statutory roles held by a single officeholder. The PACYPC has a range of functions including but not limited to: advocating for children, young people and adults in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) whose condition or situation makes them potentially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation monitoring and fostering the provision of services for persons experiencing vulnerability providing oversight in respect of systems that support and respond to the needs of persons experiencing vulnerability engaging with and listening to children and young people to ensure their voices are heard on issues that affect them improving services for all children and young people. In 2019-20, the PACYPC finalised a Decision-Making Framework and an Oversight Framework outlining how the PACYPC operationalises its functions. Our mission: leading positive systemic change Although the functions of the Public Advocate (PA) and the Children and Young People Commissioner (CYPC) are separately legislated, in practice it is difficult to separate the performance of these functions within the context of leading positive systemic change, so these are presented jointly below. Systemic advocacy Minimum age of criminal responsibility A key focus for the PACYPC in 2019-20 was advocating to increase the minimum age of criminal responsibility to at least 14 years, in line with the recommendation of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. Both national and local advocacy was undertaken on this issue, including facilitating an expert panel on International Human Rights Day 2019, providing a submission to the Council of Attorneys- General Working Group, and issuing media releases and writing letters to the Attorneys -General of both Australia and New Zealand on behalf of the Australian and New Zealand Children's Commissioners and Guardians (ANZCCG). Pleasingly, the ACT Government recently indicated in-principle support for raising the age, indicating interest in analysing the system changes required to ensure appropriate supports for children aged 10 to 13 years.External merits review of child protection decisions The PACYPC also advocated for establishing a mechanism for the external merits review of child protection decision -making. Many care and protection decisions are currently non-reviewable, an approach that is out of step with approaches in most other Australian jurisdictions. This was highlighted in the Commission's submission to the ACT Legislative Assembly's Inquiry into Child and Youth Protection Services (Part 2)\u2014Information sharing under the care and protection system and the PACYPC appeared before the relevant committee; in addition, the PACYPC commenced discussions with the Minister and CSD. On behalf of the Commission, the PACYPC is now leading discussions with CSD to determine an appropriate model for external merits review. COVID-19 response With the rapid onset of COVID-19 and the impact this has had on the ability of oversight agencies to maintain line -of-sight to systems supporting the safety and wellbeing of children and young people, the PACYPC used the Children and Young People Oversight Agencies Group as a forum through which members could exchange information, coordinate activities and explore innovative ways to maintain oversight and adapt statutory functions under the restrictions. The PACYPC also provided input to the Commission's submission to the ACT Select Committee on the COVID-19 response, highlighting the increase in mental health presentations and challenges in access to tribunal hearings, and calling for more age-appropriate information for children and young people. Concerns about the impact of the pandemic on children and young people were also shared nationally through the PACYPC's membership of the ANZCCG. In seeking to promote and protect the wellbeing of children and young people during and after COVID-19, the ANZCCG wrote a letter to the Minister of Health requesting the Australian Government take steps to address the longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on young people's wellbeing. Children and young people with complex high-level needs Following on from research undertaken on behalf of the Children and Young People Oversight Agencies Group into systemic issues impacting children and young people with complex high-level needs, the PACYPC developed a proposal to establish an intensive therapeutic response for children and young people in the ACT whose circumstances PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 65 Section B: Performance(including complex behaviours) heighten their vulnerability due to the imminent risk of significant harm to themselves or others. The PACYPC presented the proposal to the Human Services Cluster Inter-Directorate Committee, which provided in -principle endorsement, and CSD agreed to work jointly with the PACYPC on this. The work was put on hold due to the COVID-19 but will be revisited in 2020-21. Boards and committees In 2019-20, the PACYPC held membership on numerous boards and committees with responsibility for effecting policy development and/or systemic reform. The PACYPC's contribution to these discussions focused on ensuring appropriate regard for human rights and furthering systemic change to facilitate improved outcomes for persons experiencing vulnerability. The PACYPC participated on the following boards and committees: 1800Respect National Sector Advisory Group ACT Human Rights Commission Cultural Safety Reference Group Australian and New Zealand Children's Commissioners and Guardians Australian Guardianship and Administration Council Best Start for Canberra's Children\u2014First 1000 Days Reference Group Children and Young People Death Review Committee Children and Young People's Mental Health Community of Practice Children and Young People's Participation Reference Group Countering Violent Extremism Steering Committee Department of Defence Joint Cadet Executive Board Department of Defence Youth Safe Advisory Board Disability Justice Reference Group Domestic and Family Violence Expert Reference Group Elder Abuse Prevention Network Family Violence Interagency Committee Integrated Services Response Governance Group Inter-Directorate Committee for Mental Health and Wellbeing Litter Act Code of Practice Working Group Mental Health Inter-Directorate Committee for Mental Health and Wellbeing National Coalition on Child Safety and Wellbeing Official Visitor Board Playgroup Australia National Advisory Group Royal Commission Working Group. The PACYPC also participated in the ACT Mental Health Consumer Network review of the 'My Rights, My Decisions' information kit. Consultation and submissions The PACYPC provided advice and comment on a range of issues in 2019-20, including by tendering independent submissions to the following: Canberra Health Services Draft model of care for the Adolescent Mental Health Unit and Adolescent Day Service . This input focused on supporting the rights of young people in mental health facilities and promoted the use of least restrictive practices Canberra Health Services Draft Operational Procedure: Discharge of a person from a [Mental Health, Justice Health, Alcohol and Other Drugs Service] adult inpatient unit\u2014sharing information with carers, advocating for appropriate consideration for Gillick competency in making decisions about children and young people ACT Legislative Assembly's Inquiry into youth mental health in the ACT, which prioritised early intervention support, trauma-informed care, and the need for development of an integrated collaborative service system. The PACYPC also contributed to numerous Cabinet submissions, and led or contributed to the development of submissions jointly tendered by the Commission in response to the following: Council of Attorneys-General Working Group's Review of the age of criminal responsibility National framework for family violence information sharing between family law and criminal justice and child protection systems policy paper Review of the Mental Health (Secure Facilities) Act 2016 ACT Legislative Assembly's Inquiry into Child and Youth Protection Services (Part 2)\u2014information sharing under the care and protection system Review of the Family Violence Act 2016 Justice and Community Safety Discussion Paper\u2014 Proposed response to elder abuse in the ACT Australian Government's Review of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Act and the new NDIS participant service guarantee Standing Committee on Justice and Community Safety's Inquiry and review of current ACT Policing arrangements and practices ACT Legislative Assembly's Select Committee on the COVID-19 response.PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 66Public Advocate Statutory public advocacy Statutory public advocacy seeks to ensure that services and systems do what they are supposed to do in the way they are supposed to do it, and ideally in a timely and responsive manner. This involves the Public Advocate (PA) undertaking specific legislative functions to provide a person-centred, robust, preventative and comprehensive system of independent oversight for vulnerable cohorts in the ACT. The PA's oversight of services and systems draws upon various functions to develop, maintain and improve line -of-sight to the way in which services and systems operate. The PA uses a combination of activities to inform our oversight: individual advocacy; systemic advocacy and review; investigations and reviews; inspections and visits; compliance monitoring; participation and engagement; and service development and improvement. The PA provides services across three portfolio areas: children and young people mental health and forensic mental health complex needs/disability, inclusive of protection matters. Key performance indicators During the 2019-20 reporting period, 2,254 people were brought to the PA's attention. Many were identified through documentation that, by law, must be provided as part of the PA's statutory oversight and compliance monitoring of child protection, mental health and forensic mental health systems. Others were referred due to their vulnerability or made direct requests for advocacy. Direct advocacy was provided for 493 people, 22 per cent of those brought to the attention of the PA, and documentation reviews were undertaken for 57 per cent. Performance in 2019-20 was impacted by the complexity of individual matters, staffing matters, and changes to the operating environment due to COVID-19. In 2019-20, the PA undertook two stakeholder satisfaction surveys with a combined overall satisfaction rating of 71 per cent; comments received include the following: Thanks for your continued advocacy for children, especially children and young people in out-of -home care, LGBTIQ+ and gender diverse children and young people, and children and young people with disabilities. Responsiveness in the complex area of understanding, supporting and negotiating Protection Order matters is most appreciated by the Conferencing Unit at the Magistrates Court. Highly skilled, professional, knowledgeable and approachable staff\u2014pleasure to work with.The resourcing challenge for the PA was recognised by some respondents: I feel for this service as they seem to have an enormous responsibility with very little resources to support their good intentions. I think if the PA was afforded more resources and funds this would enable the organisation to have more time to collaborate and expand. The Commissioner in this job is remarkable and goes above and beyond and is required to cover a broad range of very important issues with little resources. Pleasingly, the PA was funded to recruit two additional staff in 2019-20, which will assist in meeting statutory responsibilities and responding to service demand. Public Advocate\u2014Children and young people Our mission: delivering accessible services that empower and support people Individual advocacy Children and young people usually come to the attention of the PA through documentation received in accordance with statutory reporting requirements in the Children and Young People Act 2008 (CYP Act) . Where a review of documentation indicates a need for intervention, the PA then initiates an advocacy response. The PA also acts in response to issues raised by community members and other stakeholders. In 2019-20, 924 children and young people were brought to the PA's attention, of which documentation review was undertaken for 538. Overall, the PA provided 2,409 occasions of advocacy, including 352 occasions of direct advocacy for 155 children and young people. Individual advocacy was provided in response to a range of issues impacting the rights, protection and participation of children and young people, including: ensuring discharge meetings for young people involuntary detained through the mental health system to enable continuity of care upholding the right of children and young people to education advocating for children and young people's views to be considered in decision-making (including decisions about contact with family for those in out-of-home care, and everyday decisions, such as about shopping and meal planning, for those in residential care)PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 67 Section B: Performance improving safety and standards of care for children and young people in out-of-home care enabling continued case management support for young people who exited care. The PA's advocacy in respect of such matters typically draws attention to the rights of children and young people so these considerations are appropriately upheld in decision -making. CASE STUDY Empowering young people A young person contacted the PA because they were concerned about their standard of care and safety after being removed from their parent and placed in residential care, which was affecting their mental wellbeing and attendance at school. The PA advocated for a safer, more nurturing placement, yet the young person continued to feel unsafe. The young person left residential care and self-placed with a relative but felt their life chances had been seriously compromised. To support the young person to have their grievances heard in a way that met their needs, the PA successfully advocated for the CSD Director-General to provide the young person with independent legal counsel under the Bennett principle. This enabled the young person to initiate legal action against the Director -General to address their grievances and obtain some resolution. CASE STUDY Right to education A young person in out-of-home care with a significant trauma history and regular contact with the mental health and youth justice systems had not had a regular and structured educational environment for three years. The PA, who was closely monitoring their situation, was concerned that the care team process had not resulted in any meaningful change to uphold the young person's right to education. The PA subsequently raised a community services complaint against the Education Directorate on the young person's behalf, which enabled the PA to obtain agreement to call a meeting of senior managers from both the directorate and CYPS should the young person's circumstances not be adequately responded to. With the PA's intervention, the young person is now involved with distance education and has greater structure to their education, including regular face-to-face engagement with teaching staff.Individual advocacy at Bimberi Youth Justice Centre The PA maintains a regular presence at Bimberi to ensure appropriate regard for the human rights of young detainees. Throughout 2019-20, the PA attended Bimberi more frequently\u2014generally weekly\u2014to increase accessibility and ensure young people could raise concerns and have them attended to promptly. In 2019-20, the PA advocated for young people in Bimberi across a range of matters including: human rights concerns on behalf of two young people concerns about transition/exit plans back to community allegations that staff used inappropriate language towards young people young people's health concerns not being satisfactorily dealt with parents advising they were not getting adequate information about their child's behaviour requests to have food in cabins when young people were in lockdown or secured for the night. The director of Bimberi investigated each of the issues raised by the PA. With the young person's permission, the director met with the PA and the young person to address their concerns directly. Matters requiring a response from Forensic Mental Health Services were also responded to promptly. Court attendance In the 2019-20 reporting period, the PA attended court on 87 occasions: 62 times in relation to emergency action, 16 times in relation to other care and protection matters, and nine times in relation to youth justice matters. The PA's attendance at court supports the performance of their oversight functions and enables them to ensure due consideration for the rights, protection and participation of children and young people. Our mission: providing effective oversight The PA uses a range of mechanisms to achieve their oversight functions. In addition to the oversight activities detailed below, the following forums support the PA's oversight functions: Children and Young People Oversight Agencies Group (bimonthly) Bimberi Oversight Group (bimonthly) ACT Together (senior managers) and PA meeting (monthly) Official Visitors, PA and ACT Together residential services meeting (monthly) Uniting and PA meeting (monthly) PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 68 Senior Advocate and Official Visitors meeting (monthly) PA and Murrumbidgee Education and Training Centre meeting at Bimberi (weekly). Oversight and monitoring of Bimberi Youth Justice Centre Inspection of registers The PA has a statutory responsibility to review and inspect the registers of searches and use of force at least once every three months. On 22 October 2019, in response to registers not being available to review when requested and inconsistent referencing on documents, the PA expressed concern that their ability to oversight Bimberi was being hindered. The PA is pleased to report that significant work has since been undertaken to bring registers up to date and the PA has been able to review all paperwork for this reporting period. Use of segregation In 2019-20, there were 36 segregation directions issued (contrasting with only two in 2018-19). Of these, 25 related to health segregations and 11 were for safety and security reasons. Use of lockdown In 2019-20, due to staffing shortages, Bimberi implemented a series of rolling operational lockdowns, notably between August 2019 and March 2020 (inclusive), resulting in young people spending a minimum of 54 per cent and up to nearly 85 per cent of hours each month in lockdown.

Use of force In 2019-20, there were 265 occasions of use of force, over twice as many than in 2018-19.

Subsequently, the Commission's 2019 report into Bimberi identified a downward trend in use of timeout from 2015 to 2017 and indicated the methods governing the use of timeout were sufficient. However, there has been a significant increase in the use of timeout over the past two years, which may suggest a need to strengthen the regulation of this practice. Figure 9: Use of CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 70Comparative practice analysis Throughout the period of rolling lockdowns, there was increased use of force and timeout. Segregation was also at higher levels, though only a third occurred for safety and security reasons. Figure 10 compares the use of force, timeout and segregation against the proportion of time spent in lockdown. Figure 10: Use of force, timeout and segregation against lockdown (2019-20) 01020304050607080 Segregation Timeout Use of forceJun May Apr Mar Feb Jan Dec Nov Oct Sep Aug JulOccasions of use Proportion of time in lockdown 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90% Proportion of month in lockdown Despite attempts to provide ongoing education, the staffing shortages and resulting lockdowns significantly impacted young people's ability to engage with education and other activities. At times, this resulted in a decrease of up to 75 per cent in young people's participation in education. Young people regularly advised the PA that they viewed lockdowns as punishment, indicating they felt it was unfair to not be attending class in the education centre or accessing sport and other activities to the same level as previously. Anecdotal evidence suggests there could be a correlation between the level of lockdown and the use of force and timeout (and to a lesser degree segregation) as a response to behavioural incidents involving young people. Critical incidents There were 148 critical incidents reviewed in the incidents register.

Three of these strip searches were carried out after young people set fire to cabins. Oversight and monitoring of child protection services Emergency action (section 408 reports) In accordance with section 408 of the CYP Act, the PA receives notifications from CYPS about all emergency action taken to remove a child or young person from their family's care. During this reporting period, the PA received notifications of emergency action taken in relation to 87 children and young people. Table 26: Presenting concern for emergency action Reasons for emergency action Number Substance abuse 45 Family violence 38 Neglect 36 Mental health 26 Physical abuse 5 Emotional abuse 4 Emergency action revoked 1 Other 3 Allegations of abuse in care (section 507 reports) Under section 507 of the CYP Act, the PA must be informed when CYPS undertake an appraisal of an abuse in care allegation for a child or young person. In 2019-20, the PA received 47 notifications, 36 per cent of which were substantiated. Table 27: s507 notifications to the months 13 0 35 1 10 4 3-6 months 40 3 39 11 31 11 7-9 months 6 0 0 0 6 2 10-12 months 9 0 0 0 0 0 1-2 years 5 0 0 0 0 0 2+ years 1 1 0 0 0 0 Total 74 4 (5%) 74 12 (16%) 47 17 (36%) Consistent with past reporting periods, the largest number of reports in 2019-20 related to children in kinship placements (75 per cent). This trend was flagged in the 2018-19 annual report as requiring further investigation to ensure appropriate assessment of, and support for, kinship carers. Table 28: Placement type, s507 concern in last three reporting periods (2017-18 to 2019-20) Care arrangement type 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 Total number of notifications 74 55% A section 879 request was issued on 10 February 2020 seeking information to enable the PA to investigate this issue; however, the first phase of information was not received until July 2020, outside the 2019-20 reporting PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 72period. The information will therefore be reported in next year's annual report. PA investigations (section 879 requests) Under section 879 of the CYP Act, the PA may ask for information and documents in relation to the physical and emotional welfare of children and young people to enable investigation of concerns. In the 2019-20 reporting period, the PA made 67 section 879 requests.

In 2019-20, the PA also raised concerns directly with the Director-General about the welfare of a young person who had approached the PA due to concerns about CYPS not appropriately responding to persistent conflict between them and their parent, who had not provided adequate protection from abuse. This case was symptomatic of other similar matters brought to the PA's attention around the same time and the PA felt it appropriate to ensure the Director-General's awareness about such matters. The PA also used the section 879 process to request information from the Education Directorate to inform a systemic review on the use of seclusion in educational settings. The response to this request was received outside the 2019-20 reporting period.Annual review reports (section 497 reports) Section 495 of the CYP Act requires the Director-General to prepare an annual review report (ARR) for all children and young people under a reviewable care and protection order. Under section 497, a copy of every ARR must be provided to the PA. Annual review report timeframes During 2019-20, the PA received 731 ARRs from CYPS. The timeframes for receipt of ARRs by the PA has improved from previous reporting periods, with 47 per cent of reports provided in less than three months post completion. PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 73 Section B: PerformanceFigure 12: Timeframes for receipt of ARRs in periods (2017-18 to 2019-202018-192017-18 quality review framework In the 2019-20 reporting period, the PA continued to use their quality review framework to monitor ARR compliance. ARRs should provide an accurate child-centred account of the child's or young person's life in care, outlining their circumstances and living arrangements, including whether existing arrangements support their best interests. A representative sample of ARRs are selected for review. Demographics Of the 130 ARRs reviewed: 65 per cent were for children and young people case managed by ACT Together (with a further 5 per cent jointly case managed by ACT Together and OzChild), and 30 per cent were case managed by CYPS 53 per cent of children and young people were residing in kinship care, 38 per cent in foster care, 2 per cent each in residential placements and self-placements, and a further 5 per cent had been in a combination of kinship, foster and residential placements 38 per cent were for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and 22 per cent were for children and young people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.

Case managers consulted 77 per cent of children and young people in preparing their ARR. Of the 23 per cent not consulted, 60 per cent were cited as being too young to participate, and no reason was given for not consulting the other 40 per cent. In four instances, the ARR stated that children and young people had been consulted, but the reports indicated their views were not provided through direct participation. Case managers most often indicated they sought the views of children and young people through observations and home visits. The survey program ViewPoint was used for 10 per cent of ARRs. 12 per cent of children and young people specifically declined the use of ViewPoint. Consent from the child or young person to share the report with others was documented in 16 per cent of ARRs. While consent may have been provided verbally in other cases, improvements are required to ensure consent is always documented. The majority of ARRs are written in a way that is non-judgemental, child-focused and strength-based and many reports included information about broader wellbeing such as development, social relationships and involvement in community. However, greater emphasis could be placed on consulting with family, significant others, and community leaders/elders to get a better sense of how relationships could be strengthened. One of the more significant gaps in ARRs was a consistent lack of information about whether supporting documentation had been completed, particularly in relation to therapeutic safety plans, risk management and child-at-risk plans. While this information may not be necessary for all children and young people, where warranted it supports a more holistic understanding of their experience in care. Transition from care panel ACT Together continues to run a fortnightly panel to review and monitor all transition from care plans. The PA is represented on this panel, as is a representative from the CREATE Foundation, the national consumer body representing the voices of children and young people with an out-of-home care experience. Over this reporting period, ACT Together strengthened the panel's operations by designating a staff member to assume responsibility for organising meetings and ensuring staff produce the transition plans to be presented to the panel. PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 75 Section B: PerformancePublic Advocate: mental health and forensic mental health Our mission: delivering accessible services that empower and support people Individual advocacy The PA undertakes individual advocacy with a forward focus to promote and ideally facilitate a response that upholds an individual's rights, promotes the development and implementation of appropriate protections and safeguards, and takes the views of the person into account in decision-making. The PA provided direct advocacy for mental health consumers in the community, at inpatient facilities and for forensic consumers at the Alexander Maconochie Centre (AMC) and the Dhulwa Mental Health Unit (Dhulwa). In the 2019-20 reporting period, the PA assisted 294 people: 27 children and young people, 32 individuals involved with the justice system and 235 other adults, undertaking 997 occasions of advocacy across a range of matters. These included issues relating to the care, support and treatment received by consumers, and mental health orders made by ACAT. Individual advocacy, Alexander Maconochie Centre The PA recommenced regular visits to the AMC in October 2019 and made six visits to the AMC between October and February 2020. During these visits, the PA assisted 30 individuals with 42 occasions of advocacy. Issues raised with the PA during visits to the AMC included: access to mental health services and medication, which the PA addressed by liaising with mental health professionals working for either ACT Corrective Services or Forensic Mental Health Services access to health and dental services, addressed by liaison with ACT Corrective Services staff and referrals to the Health Complaints Team within the Commission support in preparation for release from the AMC, addressed by liaison with ACT Corrective Services staff other concerns that resulted in referrals to Prisoners Aid, Legal Aid and the Commission.Representation at ACAT mental health hearings The PA attended 136 mental health hearings before ACAT for 113 persons. Attendance at hearings was prioritised for applications for involuntary electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) hearings regarding young people and hearings for individuals involved in the justice system. As required by legislation, the PA is provided with notice of applications for mental health orders by ACAT. While these notices are provided by ACAT within the legislated timeframes and often well in advance, the PA has noted that, on occasion, psychiatric reports submitted to support these applications are not made available to the individual, their representatives or ACAT with sufficient time to allow for adequate consideration of the reports and preparation for hearings. On some occasions, the psychiatric reports have not been provided by the mental health treating teams until the same day as the scheduled hearing. In the next reporting period, the PACYPC will investigate this further to understand the reasons for delay in the provision of reports. The use of interpreters at mental health hearings for individuals with limited English proficiency is necessary given the challenges faced by these individuals, the complexity of matters being heard and the extensive impact on an individual's life when a mental health order is made. The PA has attended hearings in which interpreters were used and is satisfied that, when this has occurred, the individual was provided the best chance to participate in decision-making with respect to their mental health treatment. Applications for ECT submitted to ACAT in 2019-20 often involved tribunal members seeking additional information before making an ECT order despite having reviewed the psychiatric reports provided. The PA notes that reports submitted in support of ECT applications appeared to lack sufficient information to meet the intent of legislative requirements. For example, most of the reports did not address in adequate detail whether all other reasonable forms of available treatment had been tried, nor whether ECT would likely result in substantial benefit to the person. The PA considers that improvement in these reports is required to enable the individual, and their representatives, to give due consideration to these applications and to assist in preparation for ACAT hearings. This is important given the intrusive nature of ECT and, further, that most individuals on whose behalf the applications were made did not want to undertake ECT.PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 76My Rights, My Decisions project The PA continued to support the 'My Rights, My Decisions' project, which enables mental health consumers to document their views and preferences about their future care, treatment and support and to have their rights upheld as set out in the Mental Health Act 2015 (MH Act). In 2019-20, the PA mailed out 'My Rights, My Decisions' information kits to 240 consumers whose involuntary mental health orders were revoked or allowed to expire. The PA also participated in an educational workshop about the project, which was hosted by the ACT Mental Health Consumer Network. Our mission: providing effective oversight The PA undertakes oversight of government mental health services provided to individuals residing in the community, and at inpatient facilities, the AMC and Dhulwa. The PA uses a range of mechanisms to achieve their oversight functions, including representation at oversight meetings, visiting inpatient and forensic facilities, and reviewing mental health compliance documentation provided to the PA in accordance with the MH Act. In addition to the oversight activities detailed below, the following forums support the PA's oversight functions: Canberra Health Services Safewards Oversight Steering Committee Canberra Health Services Seclusion and Restraint Working Group Canberra Health Services Mental Health Consumer and Carer Advisory Committee. Operationalising the Oversight and Decision Making frameworks Following the finalisation of the PACYPC's Oversight Framework and Decision-Making Framework, a design project was undertaken to review the activities of mental health advocates to ensure that future work plans align with these frameworks. Meetings were held with professionals working in the mental health sector to advise of the development of these frameworks and to discuss how these would direct the future work of the PA. Further work will be undertaken in the coming year to embed these new directions in standard operating procedures and in forward strategic planning. Liaison with Official Visitors for mental health matters Regular meetings were established with the Official Visitors responsible for mental health visitation in the community, at inpatient facilities and at the AMC. These meetings provided additional oversight information regarding the issues of concern to individuals and their carers, and the functioning of facilities that provide services to people with mental health issues. Oversight of community and inpatient facilities The PA regularly attended the Adult Mental Health Unit (AMHU) and other wards at the Canberra Hospital to oversight mental health services provided to patients and meet with patients to discuss issues they had regarding their care and treatment during their admissions. The PA was represented at AMHU consumer meetings and oversight meetings regarding mental health services provided at the Canberra Hospital, including the AMHU seclusion and restraint meeting. Forensic mental health services Following discussions with AMC management, and after undertaking the required security training, the PA recommenced regular clinics at the AMC in October 2019. These clinics enabled detainees with mental health conditions and disability to raise concerns about services provided at the AMC. Clinics were also held with women detainees to address individual or systemic issues. The visitation program was suspended briefly during the November 2019 lockdown of the AMC and is currently suspended as a response to COVID-19. The PA also visited Dhulwa and the Dhulwa Extended Care Unit to meet with staff and consumers, and was represented at monthly Dhulwa seclusion and restraint meetings. Meetings with professionals from both Dhulwa and the Dhulwa Extended Care Unit are ongoing. Review of mental health documentation The MH Act requires the PA to be provided with all mental health documentation regarding involuntary detention, restraint, involuntary seclusion, forcible giving of medication, applications for psychiatric assessments and mental health orders, and documents related to mental health treatment plans. In 2019-20, the PA was provided with 7,179 mental health documents relating to 1,233 consumers. Unfortunately, the database used in the 2019-20 reporting period cannot run reports showing the proportions of different compliance documents received. To provide a representative analysis, the PA manually analysed the 484 mental health documents received in December 2019. This showed that documents related to involuntary detention were the most common, and documents regarding mental health treatment plans were the least common (Figure 15). It is anticipated that our new database will be able to run similar reports for the full reporting period. PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 77 Section B: PerformanceFigure 15: Mental health documentation analysis, December 2019 Mental health applications and orders 141 Restrictive practices 50 Treatment plans 73Involuntary detention 220Review of restrictive practices notifications A data capability project was undertaken in November and December 2019 to enable comparison of restrictive practice notifications received by the PA with the registers of restrictive practices held by Canberra Health Services. This enhanced capacity has enabled a detailed analysis of restrictive practice notifications received by the PA for the six months from January to June 2020. This capacity for analysis will be further developed into the next reporting period to enable the Commission's new Resolve database to support this work on an ongoing basis. An initial comparison of notifications indicated notable differences. Further project work is planned to enable a greater analysis of these differences and to support the improved provision by Canberra Health Services of notifications to the PA as required by legislation. Information received by the PA and obtained from reviewing Canberra Health Services registers from January to June 2020 showed 299 occurrences of seclusion for 92 individuals, and 321 occurrences of physical restraint of 118 individuals (Figure 16). This information was analysed by gender using an age and stage approach (Figures 17 and 18). Figure 16: Seclusion and restraint occurrences, January to June 2020 020406080100 Physical restraintSeclusion Jun May Apr Mar Feb Jan85 5391 33415378 68 30 152944Occurrences Figure 17: Proportion of total occurrences of seclusion by age and gender, January to June 2020 PEOPLE COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 78Figure 18: Proportion of total occurrences of physical restraint by age and gender, January to June 2020 Canberra Health Services registers of forcible giving of medication between January to June 2020 listed 111 occurrences for 73 individuals. During the same period, the PA received an additional 58 notifications describing a seclusion occurrence where both physical restraint was used and medication was given. It is not possible to determine from the documentation received whether these notifications refer to medication given voluntarily or forcibly. In the next reporting period, the PA will further investigate the reporting process for occurrences of forcible giving of medication.Restrictive practices notifications provided to the PA were analysed to determine the reasons provided by Canberra Health Services staff for each occurrence. There were 180 notices reviewed relating to occurrences of seclusion and 238 relating to occurrences of physical restraint. The notifications often provided more than one reason for the use of restrictive practices and usually specified either 'Risk of harm to others' or 'Risk of harm to self', or both. Often notifications also provided further information regarding the reasons for the use of restrictive practices. Table 30: Reasons for use of restrictive practices, January to June 2020 Reason for restrictive practice Number of times the reason was referenced Reasons\u2014risk of harm Risk of harm to others 267 Risk of harm to self 60 Reasons\u2014additional information Threats to staff 216 Violence to staff 79 Declining medication 54 Threats to consumers 29 Not following staff direction 21 Property damage 17 Violence to consumers 10 In the next reporting period, the PA will continue to monitor the use of seclusion, physical restraint and the forcible giving of medication for mental health consumers and forensic mental health consumers. This monitoring will focus on efforts to minimise and eliminate the use of these restrictive practices.PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 79 Section B: PerformancePublic Advocate: complex needs/disability, including protection matters Our mission: delivering accessible services that empower and support people Individual advocacy for people with disability In 2019-20, individual advocacy was provided for people with complex needs whose circumstances indicated a high degree of risk and/or vulnerability. The total number of people with disability provided with advocacy in 2019-20 was 110, across 518 occasions of advocacy. The 2019-20 figures reflect significant growth in demand for advocacy services for people with disability compared to the previous reporting period. Table 31: Provision of individual advocacy Indicator 2018-19 2019-20 Total number of individuals provided with disability advocacy55 110 Total number of occasions of disability advocacy222 518 Individual advocacy was provided in response to a range of issues impacting the rights, protection and participation of people with disability and/or complex needs, including: interpersonal violence among co-tenants in supported accommodation supporting older people to have their views and wishes communicated in ACAT hearings assisting those with complex mental illness to self-advocate for service access (e.g. housing). CASE STUDY Supporting and empowering self-advocacy W transitioned out of supported accommodation and into an ACT Housing tenancy. Soon after moving in, W was told the previous tenants had been producing illicit substances at the property. Concerned about the possible presence of toxic chemicals and associated health and safety risks, W purchased a home chemical testing kit and contacted ACT Housing to advise their concerns. ACT Housing advised W to vacate the property immediately so professional testing could be undertaken that day. Several days after being told to vacate and with no follow-up, W contacted the PA advising they were now couch-surfing due to the delay and that the impact on their mental health and wellbeing was not being taken seriously. The PA investigated the matter; however, despite W's caseworker and ACT Housing reporting that everything was progressing as quickly as possible, delays continued. The PA supported W to escalate the issue until testing was undertaken and results communicated. Without the PA's intervention, W would have waited much longer, further exacerbating W's mental health and wellbeing and increasing the potential for other risks. Individual advocacy for older persons The PA undertakes regular visits to the Older Persons Mental Health Unit at Calvary Hospital to provide information to consumers about mental health hearings, assist in providing advice in plain English, and advocate in hearings (where required). The restrictions brought in during COVID-19 resulted in major changes to how PA services were delivered, including using phone and video conferencing to reduce risk to consumers while ensuring continuity of service. The PA benefited greatly from support provided by the Clinical Nurse Consultant (CNC), and Medical, Nursing and Allied Health teams to facilitate these changes. PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 80CASE STUDY Participation in decision-making W's treating team had made an application for a six-month treatment order however W felt their views had not been adequately considered by the treating team. During the hearing, the PA supported W to participate and raise their views about the proposed order, enabling W's views to be taken into account in decision-making. Family violence, personal violence and workplace protection orders The Family Violence Act 2016 and Personal Violence Act 2016 enable the Magistrates Court to refer young people and people with impaired decision-making to the PA for advocacy assistance. There has been a significant increase in notifications to the PA this reporting period from 46 matters in 2018-19 to 71 matters in 2019-20, 33 of which concerned children or young people. Associated with the 71 individuals referred, there were approximately 120 documents requiring review. Illustrating the increasing amount of advocacy in this area, the PA provided 219 occasions of advocacy including attending court conferences and hearings; convening meetings with treating teams, legal representatives, school staff and community agencies; and issuing correspondence to various parties. The increase in referrals related primarily to a request for the PA to be notified about all protection matters involving children and young people. Of note was the high number of protection orders between school students, which can have significant impacts for children and young people accessing education. The PA will continue to monitor this in the next reporting period. To support improved outcomes for people experiencing vulnerability, the PA participates in the family violence interagency meeting. This provides an opportunity to work with other legal and judicial agencies and community agencies to improve responses to violence experienced by vulnerable groups.Collaboration with government health agencies, and nongovernment and welfare agencies The PA met regularly with Official Visitors for disability to discuss matters of concern, coordinate responses, and facilitate referral pathways for high-risk and complex matters. This has become an effective avenue for collaborating to find solutions and linking up different agency responses. A close working relationship continues with colleagues at the Public Trustee and Guardian. Both agencies share a considerable client cohort, so it is important to ensure effective collaboration and coordination. The PA also worked with the Office for Disability, particularly in relation to several complex cases. In this reporting period, concerns were raised about the right to education given an increasing number of children and young people with complex needs either not attending school or on reduced timetables. Our mission: providing effective oversight The PA proactively monitors settings that support children, young people and adults who have complex needs. While this occurs mostly through individual advocacy, the PA also provides oversight through processes such as the Management Assessment Panel (MAP). In addition to the oversight activities detailed below, the PA attends the Restrictive Practices Oversight Steering Group to maintain oversight. Management Assessment Panel The PA coordinates the MAP, a voluntary service that seeks to facilitate improved cross-agency collaboration in service delivery for people with disability and/or complex needs. In 2019-20, three individuals accessed MAP services, with six MAP panels convened and 26 occasions of advocacy provided.PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 81 Section B: PerformanceCASE STUDY Complex case coordination One matter referred to the MAP involved accommodation and service coordination for a group of siblings with cognitive disability. The siblings participated in the MAP, and as they became comfortable with the MAP process, they revealed they were experiencing sexual abuse perpetrated by a known individual. The NDIS Support Coordinator reported the allegations and arranged for the siblings to provide statements to police. The perpetrator was subsequently charged and received a custodial sentence. Through the MAP process, a suitable property was identified for the siblings and appropriate supports were put in place. In the absence of the MAP and the support of a trusted individual, their abuse may have continued indefinitely. The PA will review the MAP in the next reporting period to ensure it continues to be well-positioned to address presenting case coordination concerns and support proactive monitoring and oversight. Section 16 referrals from the senior practitioner Section 11(2) of the HR Act provides every child with the right to additional protections simply by virtue of being a child. To give effect to this, section 16 of the Senior Practitioner Act 2018 (SP Act) includes a provision enabling an additional layer of oversight by the PA regarding restrictive practice use for children and young people. This oversight also aligns with the PA's responsibility under the HRC Act to monitor the provision of services for the protection of children and young people. Pursuant to section 16 of the SP Act, registered positive behaviour support plans for children and young people must be submitted to the PA, enabling the provision of individual and/or systemic advocacy where indicated. Since the commencement of the SP Act in 2018, the PA has received 20 positive behaviour support plans, 16 of which were referred during 2019-20. A review of these plans highlighted the use of seclusion in some ACT schools. In June 2020, the PA commenced a systemic review of the use of seclusion in schools, initially focusing on Black Mountain School. The findings of this review will be reported in 2020-21.Hoarding and squalor case management The PA participates in the Hoarding Case Management Group, which facilitates an integrated and coordinated interagency approach to the management of complex hoarding and domestic squalor matters in the ACT. The group meets on a bimonthly basis (and out of session as required) and involves several ACT Government directorates and a community agency. Case coordination and oversight for approximately six matters is undertaken each year with a lead agency assigned to each to facilitate the implementation of action plans and the multidisciplinary response for each matter. The PA was lead agency for two matters this reporting period, with one of these matters requiring 13 occasions of advocacy over an eight-week period. This included attending meetings with legal representatives and regulatory agencies and providing direct advocacy support to the person during property inspections. PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 82Children and Young People Commissioner Role and functions The role of the Children and Young People Commissioner (CYPC) is to: engage with and listen to children and young people to ensure their voices are heard on issues that affect them improve services for all children and young people. The CYPC is also the Public Advocate, but this section discusses the role of CYPC. Our mission: delivering accessible services that empower and support people Learning from children and young people about domestic and family violence In 2019-20, the CYPC partnered with the Family Safety Hub on the 'Listening and Learning' project, to hear from children and young people about their experiences of living with family violence in the ACT. From the outset, young people were involved in designing the project and helping to ensure it would be meaningful, relevant and safe. The project priorities were established with 'sounding boards' of over 20 young people, and young people pilot- tested all consultation materials, information brochures and forms. An expert reference group was established to oversee the project, bringing in additional expertise in ethics, child -inclusive practice and protection, and domestic and family violence. A total of 70 young Canberrans aged 13-24 years took part in consultation sessions (either in groups or individual interviews), 35 of whom had direct experience living with family violence. What children and young people said should challenge services and systems across both government and community to make changes to what they do and how they do it.Quotes from young people include: When I was really little, my stepdad used to beat the shit out of my mum every night. There's been times where I had to go to school with a black eye from Mum ... then you get all the questions from the teachers\u2014how'd it happen? I didn't tell them. I couldn't. I guess the main thing is that people need to listen a lot more to children and to the actual children that are experiencing stuff. Key themes from young people's experiences and views have been brought together into a booklet titled Now you have heard us, what will you do? , which is being disseminated across government and community and includes questions to prompt change. A short, animated video was also commissioned to help ensure young people's perspectives are accessible by a wide audience. A project report will also be publicly available, documenting the project methodology and findings. The importance of this work was recognised with an ACT Public Service Award for Excellence in Innovation and a CSD Director-General Excellence Award. Young Thinker forum The Young Thinker forum was launched during Children's Week in October 2019. The forum invites young people in the ACT to make submissions to the CYPC, expressing their thoughts or opinions about issues of importance to them. Submissions can be provided in any format or through any medium. The forum also provides an avenue for the CYPC to commission the views of children and young people on specific issues. With the permission of the child or young person (and that of their parents where appropriate), submissions will be published and disseminated, and/or used in reports or PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 83 Section B: Performancesubmissions. Most importantly, the views and opinions received through the forum will inform future directions and projects for the CYPC. Talking Practice 2019 The CYPC worked with a small group of young care-leavers to support their participation in a panel discussion at CSD's Talking Practice 2019 forum. The young people had both positive and negative experiences and were keen to contribute in a way that identified supportive practices and mitigated against other children and young people going through similarly negative experiences. The CYPC worked with the young people ahead of the forum to identify the key messages they wanted to communicate to care and protection staff, and then facilitated the panel discussion to enable each young person to highlight the things that made them feel valued during their care experience, and the things they would like to see improved. Mentoring the Youth Advisory Council's Social Inclusion Focus Group Ahead of what would have been the 2020 Youth Assembly, the Youth Advisory Council approached the CYPC to request mentoring support for its Social Inclusion Focus Group. The CYPC worked with a subgroup of the Youth Advisory Council to guide their exploration of the topic and the design of their approach to workshopping the issue at the Youth Assembly. The Social Inclusion Focus Group completed the design and development of their approach and presentation; however, due to COVID-19, the Youth Assembly did not proceed. Our mission: providing effective oversight Child-safe, child-friendly organisations The CYPC commends the ACT Government for continuing to progress the development of a framework for regulating Child Safe Standards, including through consultation with key community stakeholders. A fundamental priority for the CYPC in 2019-20 was to continue activities to support the implementation of Child Safe Standards in the ACT. This included collating a range of community resources to support capability development by relevant sectors once implementation commences. The CYPC seeks to ensure that the evolution of child-safe practice in the ACT recognises and gives effect to the important protective factor that comes with children and young people having their views heard and considered in decision-making. In the year ahead, the CYPC will continue to explore and identify how best to support the ACT to become a child-safe, child-friendly community. In the words of a young person who responded to the ANZCCG survey about issues that are important to them: Keep kids safe\u2014implement the recommendations of the royal commission and get better at information-sharing to protect young people. A wish from an Ainslie School student made during 2019 celebrations for the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. ACT Human Rights Commission 84B.3 Scrutiny During 2019-20, the following recommendations were relevant to the Commission: Recommendation 56 from the Legislative Assembly's Standing Committee on Justice and Community Safety, report on inquiry into domestic and family violence, policy approaches and responses, August 2019 Recommendation 19 from the outcomes of the ATSIEB hearings, September 2019 Recommendation 1 from the Legislative Assembly's Standing Committee on Justice and Community Safety, report on annual and financial reports from the 2018-19 period, March 2020. Table 32: Recommendations relevant to the Commission Summary of recommendations Action Status 56. The committee recommends that the ACT Government consider instigating an intermediaries program (similar to programs in England and Wales) to ensure age-appropriate questioning during children's evidence utilising psychologist's advice, as currently being trialled in NSW and via remote location. The Commission established an Intermediary Program in January 2020 to assist police and the courts to engage with vulnerable witnesses in criminal matters.Complete 19. ATSIEB recommends that the Commission develop and implement an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community engagement plan for the Commission, in line with ATSIEB's protocols for working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The Commission has progressed the development of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community engagement plan. In progress 1. The committee recommends that JACSD complete the victims of crime charter of rights, and explicitly provide for and include women in the target groups to be engaged in the charter process. The Commission liaised closely with JACSD to progress the development of the victims of crime charter of rights and to explicitly include women in the target groups to be engaged in the process.Complete B.4 Risk management The Commission's risk register is a living document and is considered by Commissioners at their monthly meetings. The Commission approved its new business continuity plan on 9 January 2020. B.5 Internal audit JACSD's internal audit policies and procedures apply to the Commission. See the JACSD annual report 2019-20. B.6 Fraud prevention There were no reports or allegations of fraud directed at the Commission in 2019-20. JACSD's fraud control policies and procedures applied to the Commission. Compliance is detailed in the JACSD annual report 2019-20. B.7 Work health and safety The Commission was not issued with any improvement, prohibition or non-disturbance notices under Part 10 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 . During the reporting period the Commission operated according to JACSD work health and safety (WHS) policies and procedures. The Commission monitored and improved on WHS by including it as a standing agenda item at monthly Commissioner and staff meetings, reviewing, identifying and resolving potential hazards. B.8 Human resources management The ACT Government's shared services portal and JACSD's people and workplace strategy branch assisted the Commission with recruitment in 2019-20. The Commission independently manages staff retention, support and training. In 2019-20 the Commission employed 67 staff, the majority of whom were female.

Commission staff delivered training and presentations to ACT public sector agencies and the community throughout the reporting period, ranging from general presentations to tailored workshops on human rights and discrimination. Due to the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 public health emergency, we are increasingly adopting new modes of engaging and educating the community. For example, we have recently published community education materials about COVID-19 and human rights, and the new right to work and work-related rights in s 27B of the HR Act. These are available on the Commission's website2. Human rights training The Commission delivered tailored training sessions on the Human Rights Act to public authorities including: ACT Corrections recruits (two sessions: September 2019 and November 2019) ACT Policing staff (one session: October 2019) Bimberi youth workers (three sessions: November 2019, and January and May 2020). #Raisetheage forum On 10 December 2019, International Human Rights Day, the Commission hosted a lunchtime forum on raising the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14 years of age, with keynote speaker, President of the Law Council of Australia, Arthur Moses SC. Commission President, Dr Helen Watchirs chaired the event. Justice Minister, Shane Rattenbury MLA, opened the forum, and a panel discussion facilitated by Children and Young People Commissioner, Jodie Griffiths -Cook, included Shahleena Musk from the Human Rights Law Centre, Simon Tatz from the Australian Medical Association, and Dr Justin Barker from the ACT Youth Coalition. 2 https://hrc.act.gov.au/humanrights/guides-and-publications/covid-19-and-human-rights/More than 70 people attended the event. There was also widespread media coverage of the forum and the issue of minimum age of criminal responsibility, including a national Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV report. The event was one of several Commission initiatives focused on the priority area of advocating for raising the age of criminal responsibility.

Preview of award-winning film In November, the Commission held a preview screening of the award-winning documentary In my blood it runs. Told through the eyes of Dujuan, a 10-year-old Arrente and Garrwa boy, Dujuan's story shows the vital importance of keeping Aboriginal children connected to culture and kin, and out of the child protection system. This theme accords with protection of cultural rights under s 27(2) of the ACT Human Rights Act. The Commission co-hosted the screening and panel discussion to highlight the fact that in the ACT and all other Australian states, children as young as Dujuan can be charged, sentenced and locked up in youth detention centres. Together with the filmmakers, the Commission called on the ACT Government to raise the age of criminal responsibility and stop incarcerating children. ACT Attorney-General Gordon Ramsay MLA opened the screening, which was attended by more than 70 people.

PRESIDENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONERACT Human Rights Commission 92First cultural safety charter In September 2019, the Commission held a community forum to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the launch of the Commission's first cultural safety charter. The charter was launched by Karen Flick, the Commission's cultural adviser and developed under the guidance of a reference group of strong leaders and members of the Aboriginal community, including Pat Anderson, Di Collins, Nekol Stuart, Ashley Johnson, Tamara Murray and Rod Little. At the launch, there was an open and forthright discussion with our forum co-hosts, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body (ATSIEB) represented by Deputy Chair Jo Chivers and member Maurice Walker, also with members of the United Ngunnawal Elders Council including Aunty Ros Brown, and other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community leaders and members. Laura Burr from YWCA Young Women's Council also spoke about her experience at the 2019 session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.At the forum, it was also acknowledged that government, authorities and service providers in the ACT also have a long way to go to actively respect the cultural rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, as protected under s 27(2) of the HR Act. In September 2019, the Commission also screened the documentary The Final Quarter , featuring AFL footballer Adam Goodes, to facilitate a discussion among staff about racism in Australia. Murriny murrindyarr marambul : information on cultural rights available in language The Commission published and distributed information about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural rights under s 27(2) of the Human Rights Act in Ngunnawal/ Walgalu language. The material was translated for the Commission by respected custodian Paul House. Making this information available in language is part of the Commission's commitment to people's rights, and to respecting the living culture and languages of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It also implements in practice at the local level the United Nations International Year of Indigenous Languages in 2019, which supports cultural resurgence and helps shape our national identity. You've got rights under the ACT Human Rights Act Contact us for more information or to make a complaint about discrimination: Ngu Torres Strait Islander peoples hold distinct cultural rights and must not be denied the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their culture, and to have their traditional connections with land, waters and resources recognised and valued.

Commission staff were asked to use the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) language map to find two things of interest about the people, language or country where they were born, grew up or holidayed. Staff then shared these recollections with colleagues. The Commission was also active on social media every day of the week, including posting a welcome video from Commissioner Heidi Yates. NAIDOC family day In July 2019, the Commission ran a stall at the annual NAIDOC week family day at the University of Canberra. This is a popular day with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members and families. Commission staff were able to provide information to attendees about a range of Commission services, and about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural rights, as protected under section 27(2) of the HR Act. Seeding interest at Multicultural Festival Staff and volunteers lent a hand at the Commission's stall at Multicultural Festival on 23 February. The annual stall at the Festival is an important way for Commission staff, and volunteers from Victim Services ACT, to talk to the community about our services and advocacy. This year, in light of the devastating summer bushfires, the Commission had a popular give-away of vegetable and native flower seeds with the theme Grow human rights. A staff member and a volunteer at the Commission stall at Multicultural Festival. Media coverage The Commission has a strong media presence and featured in close to 80 substantial media reports in mainstream media outlets. This represented a 40 per cent increase on media coverage from the previous year. Commissioners were vocal on a range of issues including detainee conditions and rights, the AMC, Bimberi, family and domestic violence, child protection, aged care, health and wellbeing of children and young people, out-of-home care, minimum age of criminal responsibility, data on complaints and the types of issues about which people complain to the Commission. In the early stages of the COVID-19 shutdown, media outreach (media releases and published opinion pieces) and messaging on social media was also increased. This enabled the Commission to continue providing the community information about complaints and other Commission services and supports available during the shutdown. ACT Human Rights Commission 94Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner The Discrimination, Health Services, Disability and Community Services Commissioner's team works to ensure the ACT community is aware of the services it can access through the Commission and how the laws we administer can help them resolve issues or barriers they experience to equal participation in the ACT community. We participate in community events, provide training and information sessions to increase community awareness of our services. We engage with key community organisations and other stakeholders to ensure easy referral pathways and build community capacity to address individual and systemic issues by using our services. We deliver free community information sessions on discrimination law, health records and privacy, the complaint handling process and conciliation across the ACT on a regular basis and on request. In the second half of 2019-20, the delivery of our services was constrained due to COVID-19, but we moved our community information sessions online, and we now offer training online as well as face to face with appropriate arrangements in place. This year, we delivered and participated in community information events with: ACT Medical Board ACT Council of Social Service Council of the Ageing LGBTIQ Ministerial Advisory Council Canberra Together Forum Health Care Consumers Association COVID-19 community forum Women's Legal Service Daramalan College Goodwin Aged Care Capital Health Network Youth Justice Services Veterinary Practitioners Board The Law Council. The team also participated in Commission-supported community events such as the 2019 Multicultural Festival, Spring Out and NAIDOC family day 2019. Victims of Crime Commissioner Family violence perpetrator intervention forums In August 2019, the VOCC collaborated with CSD's Coordinator-General for Family Safety to run a series of forums aimed at strengthening work with family violence perpetrators to reduce recidivism and increase victim safety. The forums drew on the expertise of national experts and included: a workshop to up-skill frontline government, community and child protection workers who work directly with men who use family violence an executive stakeholder forum with over 60 representatives from key directorates, criminal justice agencies and non-government organisations to discuss best-practice approaches to working with family violence perpetrators a briefing of ministers and heads of agencies on the delivery of effective, evidence-based interventions. The VOCC will continue to work with the coordinator- general to implement learnings from the forums, including developing ACT service standards for perpetrator behaviour change programs and expanding access to best-practice perpetrator intervention services in the Territory.

DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH SERVICES, DISABILITY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES COMMISSIONER VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONERAnnual Report 2019-20 95 Section N: Community engagement and supportResponding to elder abuse in the ACT In February, the Commission and Legal Aid ACT co-hosted a forum on responding to elder abuse in the ACT. Chaired by the VOCC, the forum engaged four expert panellists in a discussion about the ACT Government's plans to reform the justice system to combat elder abuse. Commissioner Karen Toohey joined Jane Campbell, Deputy CEO, Legal Aid ACT, Elizabeth Samra, Older Persons Legal Service at Legal Aid ACT and Kathryn McKenzie, Director of Operations, NSW Ageing and Disability Commissioner to discuss government proposals for a specific elder abuse criminal offence and civil options for responding to elder abuse-related disputes. Intermediary Program information and training sessions The program team have provided information and training sessions to a range of agencies in the program's first year of operation. These include: Public Trustee and Guardian Supreme Court Sheriffs DPP Legal Aid ACT ACT Law Society CYPS. Community presentations VSACT engages in a wide range of activities to raise community awareness of victims' rights and the services available at the Commission for persons affected by crime. We also work closely with a range of frontline service providers to ensure they can warmly link clients with VSACT. Services we presented to this year include: St Vincent de Paul ACT Policing Onelink CYPS Woden, Civic and Belconnen public libraries Legal Aid ACT. Easy English resource on help for victims of violent crime VSACT has developed an easy English resource to help people with communication difficulties understand our services and how we can help if someone is affected by crime. We are grateful to local community organisation Advocacy for Inclusion for their assistance with the production of this resource. Justice reimagined conference The VSACT director presented at the 2019 Australian and New Zealand Society of Criminology conference, entitled Justice reimagined: The intersection between academia, government, industry and the community. The presentation explored the key role of statutory victim advocates and was delivered in collaboration with the South Australian Commissioner for Victims' Rights and the Western Australian Commissioner for Victims of Crime. VICTIMS OF CRIME COMMISSIONERPUBLIC ADVOCATE AND CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COMMISSIONER ACT Human Rights Commission 96Children and Young People Commissioner 30th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child The 30th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) was marked on 20 November 2019. The CYPC supported Year 6 students at Ainslie School to increase their understanding of the convention and design a range of fun activities to build awareness and understanding in their fellow students about children's rights. During their planning activities, the students shared the view that all rights were equally important, and that what is important to one child in a certain situation may be very different to what is important to another. The activities on the day stimulated the thinking of students, demonstrated by a question from one student who asked: What happens when rights collide? Like what if one child is using their right to play while other kids are using their right to learn, and the child who is playing is making it hard for other children to learn. The discussion that ensued provided a great opportunity for the CYPC to talk about rights existing within context, and how context is often a key consideration in identifying whether one particular right may have precedence over another. An artwork done by an Ainslie School student, during celebrations for the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.Engaging children and young people in policy development and service reform workshops In 2019-20, the CYPC continued to build community capability and awareness in respect of child-safe, child-friendly practice and, particularly, child and young person participation. The CYPC held a series of capability development workshops with ACT Government staff. The workshops provided guidance on several key areas including: how to engage children and young people in policy development and service reform Child Safe Standards promoting enhanced understanding about children's rights enhancing capability for direct consultation with children and young people informing the development of child-safe and child -friendly approaches to engaging with children and young people. Participant evaluations and the high level of interest (including an extended enrolment waiting list) demonstrate the success of these workshops. The CYPC is currently reviewing workshop content and aims to have an advanced product in the latter half of 2020. This workshop will assist in the progression of Child Safe Standards. Annual Report 2019-20 97 Section N: Community engagement and supportCareers Xpo 2019 At the 2019 ACT Careers Xpo, the CYPC provided young people with information about human rights and the services of the Commission, talked with young people about career pathways into human rights organisations, and sought the views of young Canberrans about peer support through an online survey that received over 500 responses. Many young people also contributed to a community artwork celebrating young people's dreams for the future. Commission staff at the 2019 Careers Xpo. Children's Week awards 2019 In Children's Week each year, the CYPC presents an award to a child or young person whose contribution to their peers or community reflects strong social justice values. In 2019, CYPC Jodie Griffiths-Cook presented her award to Mischa Warwick. Mischa's impressive volunteering and fundraising in support of animal welfare and young children with complex medical needs, alongside her initiative in taking action to support sustainability, made her a well-deserving recipient of the CYPC award. Mischa Warwick (left) and CYPC, Jodie Griffiths-Cook. COVID-19 creative messaging In seeking to ensure the CYPC was able to continue communicating with children and young people throughout the COVID-19 lockdown period, the CYPC produced several video messages including: an Easter message in the form of a poem reassuring children and providing advice about how to seek help a message to parents for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Facebook Live about supporting mental health and wellbeing in children and young people two video messages in support of celebrations for IDAHOBIT Day\u2014the international day against homophobia, biphobia, interphobia and transphobia; one message was for primary school aged children, and the other for young people and the broader community. Launch of the 2020-2021 Australian Children's Laureate In February 2020, the CYPC partnered with the Australian Children's Laureate Foundation, Northside Community Service and Libraries ACT to host the first public event of the Australian Children's Laureate for 2020-2021, writer Ursula Dubosarsky. At the event, pre-school children were able to engage in a range of activities designed to foster an interest in reading, and interact directly with Ursula, who read one of her stories and spent time talking with them about storytelling and the power of imagination.

The survey was completed by 488 children and young people aged 5-24 years, 314 of whom were from the ACT. The five areas of most importance to respondents were education and development, health and wellbeing, giving voice to children and young people, safety and violence, and climate change. The responses gave insight into what children and young people consider to be important; for example: Let children have a say and actually start the practice of incorporating their ideas into making new laws linked to youth and child safety, child health and other aspects of children's lives. To try and understand the changing times and be understanding that we are growing up in a different generation. A children and young person friendly version summary4 of the report was also developed. The Year 7 Health Check: consultation with Gold Creek Senior School Year 8 students The CYPC published a report5 detailing the outcomes from a consultation with senior students from Gold Creek School about the proposed Year 7 Health Check. The report provides key insights into what young people considered to be important considerations in the design and implementation of the Year 7 Health Check, including their thoughts and feelings about the nature of and approach to privacy considerations. Young people indicated that a Year 7 Health Check would need to: be safe and feel safe for young people be flexible enough to respond to individual needs ensure informed consent is an active process provide information and results to both students and parents. One of the young people, in discussing the importance of privacy across the various dimensions of the proposed health check, said: They would want to know that their info is safe with the school and no one will have the info. 3 https://hrc.act.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/20200628-FINAL-ANZCCG-survey-report.pdf 4 https://hrc.act.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Original-size-TELL-US-WHAT-YOU-THINK-ANZCCG-Report-1.pdf 5 https://hrc.act.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Year-7-Health-Check-Report-FINAL.pdfAnnual Report 2019-20 99 SECTION O: Justice and community safety O.1 Bushfire management The Commission did not own or manage Territory land during the reporting period.

Section 15 of the HRC Act requires the Commission to act in accordance with human rights when exercising its functions. A commitment to human rights is fundamental to all aspects of the Commission's work. Additionally, as a public authority under section 40B of the HR Act, when making decisions the Commission must act consistently with human rights and properly consider human rights. The Commission met these obligations in the following ways: provided new staff with copies of the HR Act as well as brochures about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural rights under the HR Act reviewed our privacy policy (full and summary versions) for compatibility with human rights developed a safety and security plan, which is compatible with human rights, including the rights to privacy, security and equalityACT Human Rights Commission 100 developed a social inclusion plan which is compatible with human rights, including the right to non -discrimination and the rights of minorities developed an information poster on the cultural rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Ngunnawal/Walgalu and English languages. The poster was distributed in the community, shared on social media and published on the Commission's website. The Commission also launched its new Cultural Safety Charter (see Section N: Community engagement and support) highlighted human rights issues in proposed ACT Government policies and legislation through government consultation processes, Legislative Assembly inquiries, and responses to Cabinet submissions and draft bills. In 2019-20, the Commission submitted formal comments on about 46 Cabinet submissions, having reviewed a larger number. The Commission also wrote to the ACT Legislative Assembly's Standing Committee on Justice and Community Safety on two occasions when legislation raised issues of concern with the HR Act under section 36 of the HR Act, the Human Rights Commissioner may intervene in legal proceedings that involve human rights issues when granted leave by the court. During the reporting period the Commissioner was notified of six matters, and at the close of the reporting period was actively considering intervening in two such matters (see Section B.2: Performance) provided training to ACT Government agencies on their human rights obligations (see Section N: Community engagement and support\u2014human rights training) delivered speeches and presentations on human rights to community groups and forums, and took part in public forums on issues relevant to the remit of each commissioner (see Appendix A) discussed a range of human rights issues with agencies as part of the Commission's community education and engagement program responded to requests from ministers and MLAs for human rights advice on specific topics.O.4 Legal services directions During the reporting period, the Commission complied with all legal services directions issued under section 11 of the Law Officers Act 2011.Annual Report 2019-20 101 P.1 Culture and behaviour The Commission's strategic plan 2017-2020 expands on the ACT Government's code of conduct.
