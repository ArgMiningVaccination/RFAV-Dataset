It can be caused by many different things, ranging from a tickle in the throat to allergies, acid reflux, asthma, or other factors. Keep reading to learn more about dry coughs, from they really are to the best dry cough remedies for kids. 8 Types of Coughs in Children, Toddlers, and Babies Does My Child Have a Dry Cough? Wondering how to tell if your child has a dry cough? Look for the following symptoms: Coughing without mucus or phlegmHacking sound that may appear forcefulSensation of tickling in the throatA cough that lingers for weeks after an illness subsides Dry Cough vs. Wet Cough A wet cough produces mucus or phlegm, and it often signals a bacterial or viral infection. On the other hand, a dry cough doesn't produce mucus, and it's usually triggered by irritation along the upper respiratory tract. What Causes Dry Cough in Kids? In both toddlers and older kids, a dry cough can have numerous causes. Check out this list and ask your doctor for a definitive diagnosis. Acid Reflux or GERD During an episode of acid reflux, stomach contents release into the esophagus, triggering a dry, irritation-induced cough. Chronic acid reflux, which is called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), could cause persistent dry cough in kids or babies. Other symptoms of GERD include heartburn, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, regurgitation of food into the throat, stomach pain, choking, bad breath, and chest pain. Allergies Allergies happen when your immune system considers a foreign substance (like pollen or pet hair) to be a threat. Your body responds by producing antibodies and histamine, which can cause a range of symptoms\u2014including increased mucus production. This mucus can travel down your throat as cough-inducing postnasal drip. Other allergy symptoms include red itchy eyes, sneezing, ear congestion, and sinus pressure. How to Decode Your Baby's Cough Asthma Asthma is a common cause of chronic dry coughing. This disease causes a child's airways to swell when exposed to a trigger (dust, pollen, illness, etc.) Asthma can lead to lung inflammation and symptoms like dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest congestion. COVID-19 COVID-19 has a host of symptoms, but dry cough seems to be relatively common. Other symptoms might include fever, shortness of breath, body aches, loss of smell or taste, runny nose, sore throat, and gastrointestinal issues. Wet cough is also possible. Contact your health care provider if you think your child has COVID-19. Croup Croup is a viral infection that inflames the vocal cords and larynx. It targets children under age 5, often in late winter. One telltale sign is a baby dry cough that's harsh, barking, and gets worse at night. Your child may also have noisy breathing or a hoarse voice. Types of Toddler Coughs and How to Treat Them Environmental Irritants Some children are extra sensitive to irritants in the environment, such as dust, car exhaust, smoke, pollutants, and mold. Exposure can bring on a dry cough, especially if the air lacks moisture. It can turn into a chronic dry cough with prolonged exposure to the irritant. Upper Respiratory Infection (Cold or Flu) Influenza and the common cold can both present with many symptoms, which might include a wet cough. But after the virus leaves your body, a persistent dry cough (caused by residual mucus) can stick around for days or weeks. Other viral infections associated with dry cough include pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Post-viral coughing is a pretty common phenomenon; one study found that it's one of the most common respiratory symptoms worldwide. Whooping Cough Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious infection of the upper respiratory tract. It often starts with cold-like symptoms, then turns into a persistent cough with \"whooping\" sounds, loss of appetite, and low-grade fever. Whooping cough isn't very common now because there's a vaccine for it. That said, it's particularly dangerous in young babies who can develop serious complications like pneumonia. Other Causes of Dry Cough in Kids Still not sure what's triggering your child's dry coughing? Here are some additional dry cough causes in toddlers and kids. Inhaling food or a small toy. A kid will often have a dry and wheezing cough when there's a blockage in the airway. If they can still breath fine, try releasing the item with pats on the back, then visit a doctor if it doesn't dislodge. Call 9-1-1 and dislodge the object immediately if your child is in obvious distress, is making throat-grabbing motions, or has pale or blue skin. A \"habit\" cough with no particular cause. Side effect from medications, such as ACE inhibitors. Stas_Uvarov/Getty Images Dry Cough Remedies for Kids Wondering how to get rid of dry cough at home? First things first, avoid giving cough syrups and cough medicine to young children. The American Academy of Pediatrics says there's no evidence that cough medicine is effective for children younger than 6, and it can have dangerous consequences for those under 4 years old. Instead, consider using the following home remedies for dry cough. To treat a dry cough at night, put a cool mist vaporizer or humidifier in your child's room. The moisture helps open the airways to relieve dry cough. Lift your child's bed for elevated sleeping, which could help dry cough from GERD or postnasal drop. Serve your child warm liquids, like decaffeinated tea or chicken broth. Warm liquids loosen up mucus and create a soothing sensation. Consider giving your child cough drops or throat lozenges (as long as they're old enough to suck on them without swallowing). These products contain throat-soothing ingredients like menthol and honey, which may serve as a dry cough treatment. To ease throat irritation, older kids can take a hot shower. Younger kids can sit in a steamy bathroom with their parents for about 20 minutes. Types of Toddler Coughs and How to Treat Them When to See a Doctor for Dry Cough In most cases, a toddler dry cough, baby dry cough, or child dry cough will go away on its own. But you should visit the pediatrician if the coughing lasts longer than 2 to 3 weeks, since it could indicate a chronic condition like asthma or GERD. Also see the doctor if your child is younger than 4 months or has any of the following symptoms: A dry cough that turns into a wet cough with blood or green mucus A wheezing cough, which could indicate bronchiolitis Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent dry cough with fever Dry cough treatment will depend upon the underlying cause. The doctor will first ask, \"What does the dry cough mean?\" before making a treatment plan. For example, those with asthma may need an inhaler, while those with GERD might need to implement diet and lifestyle changes. Your doctor may also prescribe antibiotics or antihistamines in certain cases. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!
