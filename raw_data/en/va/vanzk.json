Furthermore, quality of life is often impaired in cancer patients, for instance due to uncertainty about the progression of the disease or side effects from cancer treatment. Therefore, supportive psychosocial interventions are recommended to increase cancer patients' quality of life. Research shows that a variety of intervention techniques, such as counseling, stress management, relaxatio n and meditation can have beneficial effects on cancer patients' quality of life. Access to such interventions, however, can be limited, for instance due to a lack of treatment providers, impaired mobility of patients or lack of awareness of such interventions. To overcome such barriers to the access, the use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions has been recommended. mHealth interventions use mobile devices such as smartphones to deliver an intervention. Due to a large and continuously growing number of smartphone users, mHealth interventions can potentially reach a large number of patients. However, compared to research investigating more traditional face- to-face interventions, research on mHealth interventions is sparse. To bridge this gap, the aim of this thesis was to evaluate the feasibility of a mindfulness- and relaxation-based app interventions for cancer patients. We first conducted a systematic review where we summarized results from mindfulness- and relaxation-based interventions that were delivered through modern technologies such as the internet and aimed at patients with medical conditions. Second, we conducted a mindfulness- and relaxation-based app study for cancer patients. The study was guided by the RE-AIM evaluation framework, which assesses the following evaluations dimensions: Reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. We collected patient reported outcomes as well as data on app usage over the course of 20 weeks. Additionally, we conducted semi-structured interviews with patients and health professionals. Our results showed that a substantial number of patients regularly used the app over the course of 20 weeks. Patients' and health professionals' feedback in general was favorable and we received helpful feedback regarding possible improvements. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that over the course of the 20-week mHealth intervention, anxiety, distress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, quality of life, and mindfulness improved significantly. However, since our study did not have a control group, the effectiveness of the intervention needs to be tested in a future randomized controlled trial.

In Switzerland, there are an estimated 42 '500 new cancer cases and 17'000 cancer death s per year (Krebsliga, 2021). A cancer diagnosis and its treatment can lead to a variety of physical and mental problems with a negative impact on quality of life. Cancer patients have an elevated risk for depression, oftentimes experience high distress due to the uncertainty of their prognosis and usually suffer from various physical health problems due to the cancer treatment (Krebber et al., 2014; Mehnert et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2011; Quinn, Gon\u00e7alves, Sehovic, Bowman, & Reed, 2015). These mental and physical health problems can also affect recovery and the adherence to cancer treatment (DiMatteo, Lepper, & Croghan, 2000; Van Cleave, Egleston, & McCorkle, 2011). Consequently, a variety of treatments have been suggested to increase cancer patients ' quality of life. Since the appearance of psycho- oncology in 1977 (Holland, 2002) a variety of psychosocial interventions have been suggested to support cancer patients and many of these interventions are effective in increasing cancer patients ' quality of life and well-being. However, not all distressed cancer patients seek help in form of psychosocial interventions. Additionally, the adherence of cancer patients to psychosocial interventions, which are usually delivered by health professionals, is often limited (Brebach, Sharpe, Costa, Rhodes, & Butow, 2016). Therefore, there has also been an increasing interest in developing self-care interventions for cancer patients (Dodd & Miaskowski, 2000; McCorkle et al., 2011). One possible way to deliver self-care interventions is through e-and mHealth interventions, which is the use of web or mobile device applications (Gunther Eysenbach, 2001; Heerden, Tomlinson, & Swartz, Jadad, 2005). e- and mHealth interventions are promising due to a variety of characteristic. Oftentimes such interventions provide a low-threshold access, since a growing number of people have access to the internet and own a mobile device such as a smartphone (Luxton, McCann, Bush, Mishkind, & Reger, 2011; Rowland, Fitzgerald, Holme, Powell, & McGregor, 2020). Therefore, an increasingly large number of people can access e- and mHealth interventions. Additionally, technological advances in the last couple of years allow for more sophisticated interventions using e- or mHealth interventions (Paglialonga, Patel, Pinto, Mugambi, & Keshavjee, 2019) . However, since these technological advances are rather recent, e- and especially mHealth studies are not as numerous as studies investigating standard treatments such as face- to-face therapy (Ali, Chew, & Yap, 2016; Marcolino et al., 2018). 2 Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to evaluate the feasibility of a mindfulness and relaxation mHealth intervention for cancer patients. First, we summarized the findings of mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth intervention for medical conditions in a systematic review. In a subsequent study, we evaluated the feasibility of a mindfulness and relaxation research app for cancer patients according to the RE-AIM evaluation framework (Glasgow, Vogt, & Boles, 1999). This framework assesses five dimensions, namely Reach (i.e. number of individuals participating in a intervention), Effectiveness or Efficacy (i.e. impact of an intervention on relevant outcomes), Adoption (i.e. number of settings and intervention agents who are willing to adopt an intervention), Implementation (i.e. extend to which an intervention is delivered as intended), and Maintenance (i.e. extend to which an intervention is sustained over time) (Glasgow et al., 1999). 3 A. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 1. Epidemiology and treatment of cancer Cancer is highly prevalent worldwide: in 2018 it was estimated that there were 18.1 million new cancer diagnoses (Bray et al., 2018). The five most common cancers are lung cancer with 2.094 million new cases worldwide in 2018, followed by breast cancer (2.089 million cases), colorectal cancer (1.850 million cases), prostate cancer (1.276 million cases) , and non-melanoma skin cancer (1.042 million cases) (International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2018b). An estimated 9.6 million people worldwide died of cancer in 2018, making it the second leading cause of death globally (World Health Organization, 2018). The most common causes of cancer death in 2018 were lung cancer (1.761 million estimated deaths), colorectal cancer (880.729 estimated deaths), stomach cancer (782.685 estimated deaths), liver cancer (781.631 estimated deaths), and breast cancer (626679 estimated deaths) (International Agency for Research on Cancer, 2018a). In Switzerland, there are an estimated 42'500 new cancer cases per year (Krebsliga, 2021). The most common treatment of cancer is surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone therapy, stem cell transplant (National Cancer Institute, 2015). Since these treatments are highly invasive and targeting only cancer cells is difficult, treatments also negatively affect the overall health of a patient. The cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment can therefore lead to a variety of physica l and psychological problems such as fatigue and anxiety, which is described in more detail in the next chapter. The high prevalence and the far-reaching consequences of a cancer diagnosis and its treatment are also recognized by institutions like the Swiss Cancer League, which provides information and counseling regarding various aspects of cancer related issues and cancer treatment. The Swiss Cancer League furthermore supports research in four different areas, namely basic, clinical, psychosocial, and epidemiological research. This project was conducted within the domain of psychosocial research. 4 2. The impact of cancer on quality of life 2.1 Quality of life in cancer patients Quality of life is often defined as a multi-dimensional construct, consisting of physical, mental, social, and spiritual aspects of well-being (Ferrell & Down, 1997; McDonough, Eliott, Neuhaus, Reid, & Butow, 2019). In cancer patients, many aspects of well-being are affected, leading to an overall diminished quality of life. In some cases, this impairment can be long- lasting, despite a successful cancer treatment (Ander et al., 2016; Hopman & Rijken, 2015; Koch, Jansen, Williams, Jackson, Beeken, Steptoe, & Wardle, 2016; Wu & Harden, 2015). For instance, cancer survivors - usually defined as cancer patients still living five years after a cancer diagnosis (Feuerstein, 2007; Foster, Wright, Hill, Hopkinson, & Roffe, 2009) - may face various symptoms such as pain, fatigue, gastro-intestinal problems or depressive symptoms long after a completed treatment (Brearley et al., 2011; Harrington, Hansen, Moskowitz, Todd, & Feuerstein, 2010). Furthermore, cancer is not just affecting the diagnosed patient, it can also have a negative impact on the quality of life of the patients' partners Klitzing, 2015). Cancer patients' diminished quality of life can have additional negative consequences. For instance, poor quality of life in cancer patients is associated with reduced adherence to recommended lifestyle behavior changes such as physical activity or smoking cessation (Blanchard, Courneya, Stein, & American Cancer Society's, 2008). Moreover, lower levels of quality of life can also have a negative impact on cancer patients' adher ence to medical treatments (DiMatteo et al., 2000). Preliminary research also indicates that quality of life in cancer patients may have an impact on survivorship (Kypriotakis, Vidrine, Francis, & Rose, 2016). Regarding health care, cancer patients with reduced quality of life can cause higher healthcare costs, since they require more care (Mausbach, Yeung, Bos, & Irwin, 2018). These issues indicate that cancer, in and of itself a severe and potentially life-threatening illness, can have far-reaching negative effects. The subsequent sections elaborate in more detail on aspects of physical, mental and social well-being in cancer patients, which can be associated with reduced quality of life. 2.1.1 Impact of cancer on physical well-being 5 Cancer treatment can lead to a variety of physical symptoms, which can negatively impact patients' well -being and therefore goes along with reduced quality of life(Quinn et al., 2015). Symptoms in cancer patient s which are associated with cancer treatment include for instance diarrhea (Klee et al., 1999), nausea and vomiting (Rhodes, Johnson, & McDaniel, 1995). Furthermore, cancer patients often report sleep disturbances (Coles et al., 2018). Problems associated with sleep disturbances are fatigue, leg restlessness, insomnia, and excessive sleepiness (J. R. Davidson, MacLean, Brundage, & Schulze, 2002). A large number of cancer patients also suffer from pain during or after cancer treatment (Andersen & Kehlet, 2011; Gartner et al., 2009) , which has also an impact on patients' well -being. Another common side effect of chemotherapies is alopecia (loss of hair), which is ranked by patients to be amongst the most troublesome side effects of the chemotherapy (Lemieux, Maunsell, & Provencher, 2008). In addition, several cancer types are associated with weight loss, while in other cancers weight gain is typical (Helms, O'Hea, & Corso, 2008). In some cases of breast cancer, surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) is necessary, which leads to a visible change of the patients' body appearance (Helms et al., 2008). These changes in a patients' physical appearance can also have a negative impact on the patients' well -being (Kalaitzi et al., 2007). Oral complications, which is common in head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy, can also negatively affect quality of life (Epstein, Robertson, Emerton, Phillips, & Stevenson-Moore, 2001). Physical well-being can also be affected after cancer treatment. For instance, undesirable physical symptoms such as infertility (Schover, 2005; Ussher & Perz, 2019) weight gain dysfunction (Ewer, Swain, Cardinale, Fadol, & Suter, 2011) can occur after treatment. Furthermore, cancer-related fatigue can also persist for severa l month after a successful cancer treatment (Berger, Gerber, & Mayer, 2012; Bower, 2005). Research indicates that cancer patients with more physical symptoms or side effects are at greater risk of being distressed (Jim, Andrykowski, Munster, & Jacobsen, 2007; Walker et al., 2017). Therefore, physical symptoms in cancer patients can have a negative impact on mental well-being as well, which will be outlined in more detail in the next section. 2.1.2 Impact of cancer on mental well-being Many cancer patients report elevated levels of psychological distress (Mehnert et al., 2018). Various factors, such cancer stage and type of cancer diagnosis (Subramaniam et al., 6 2018; Zabora, BrintzenhofeSzoc, Curbow, Hooker, & Piantadosi, 2001) can have an impact on the prevalence of distress and therefore impact quality of life. Furthermore, research indicates that the diagnosed cancer type can also make a difference on patients' level of distress. In a study by Bergerot and colleagues, patients diagnosed with a rare cancer report poorer quality of life compared with patients diagnosed with a more common cancer (Bergerot et al., 2018). In addition, patients with multiple primary cancers have an even more reduced quality of life compared to patients with a single cancer location (Belcher, Hausmann, Cohen, Donovan, & Schlenk, 2017). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends screening all cancer patients regularly for distress (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2020). This recommendation is warranted since studies have shown that distress is often not recognized by oncological staff (Jacobsen et al., 2005). Therefore, distress in cancer patients is oftentimes untreated, which can have various negative impacts (Carlson et al., 2004). Elevated levels of distress in cancer patients are for instance associated with poor health status, low adherence to treatment recommendations, and increased pain and fatigue (Mehnert et al., 2018; Okuyama, Jones, Ricklefs, & Tran, 2015). Distress in cancer patients does not only occur shortly after diagnosis or during the treatment, but can also be present post-treatment (Henselmans et al., 2010). A study by Hoffman and colleagues (Hoffman, McCarthy, Recklitis, & Ng, 2009) showed that long-term cancer survivors are at increased risk for psychological distress. A simple and popular way of measuring distress is the use of the distress thermometer, which was developed by Roth and colleagues Roth et al. (1998). The distress thermometer is a visual analogue scale, ranging from 0 (no distress) to 10 (extreme distress) (Roth et al., 1998). This distress thermometer has been used in a large variety of oncological patient groups and shows good predictive validity (Jacobsen et al., 2005; Mitchell, 2007). Research indicates that a score of 5 or higher is of clinical relevance (Jacobsen et al., 2005). More specifically, cancer patients can be affected by anxiety and depression. In comparison to the general population, cancer patients have elevated levels of depression and anxiety (Mitchell et al., 2011; Mosher, Winger, Given, Helft, & O'Neil, 2016). A meta-analysis show ed that estimates of depression in cancer patients differ, with percentages ranging from 8% to 24 % (Krebber et al., 2014). Several factors like type of instrument used to measure depression, cancer type and treatment phase can have an impact on the prevalence of depression in cancer patients (Krebber et al., 2014). Cancer patients have elevated prevalence rates of depression compared to the general population, where prevalence of about 7% has been 7 reported (Mausbach & Irwin, 2017). A study by Mausbach and Irwin also showed that depression in cancer patients goes along with more annual visits of healthcare providers that were not mental health experts (Mausbach & Irwin, 2017). Furthermore, patients with advanced cancer have a higher risk for developing a major depressive episode compared to the general population (Meyer, Fletcher, Prigerson, Braun, & Maciejewski, 2015). Major depression in cancer patients can adversely affect treatment adherence, quality of life, and survival in cancer patients (Meyer et al., 2015; Pinquart & Duberstein, 2010). Cancer patients have also an increased risk of committing suicide (Ahn et al., 2015). A study reported that high-risk cancer patients for committing suicide are often older (over 55 years) white male patients (Massetti, Holland, Jack, Ragan, & Lunsford, 2018). Another study found that depression, pain, and medical comorbidities can be additional suicide risk factors in cancer patients (Aboumrad, Shiner, Riblet, Mills, & Watts, 2018). Yet another common mental disorder in cancer patients is adjustment disorder (Geue et al., 2018) . Regarding mental health in different care settings, a meta-analysis (Mitchell et al., 2011) reported that the prevalence of depression, anxiety, or adjustment disorder d id not differ in palliative vs. non-palliative setting. For cancer survivors, a meta-analysis showed that anxiety is higher in long-term cancer survivors compared to the general population, whereas depression has a similar prevalence rate (Mitchell, Ferguson, Gill, Paul, & Symonds, 2013). A further common psychological factor affecting mental well-being and subsequently quality of life in cancer survivors is the fear of a recurring cancer (Hartl et al., 2003; Reed et al., 2018; Simonelli, Siegel, & Duffy, 2017; Vickberg, 2003). Although a consensual definition is lacking (Simard et al., 2013), a typical characteristic of fear of recurrence is the fear or worry that the cancer will reoccur in the same or another body part (Vickberg, 2003). In 2013, three systematic reviews reported that fear of recurrence is a widespread problematic and one of the most prevalent unmet needs of cancer survivors, even five or more years after treatment (Crist & Grunfeld, 2013; Koch, Jansen, Brenner, & Arndt, 2013; Simard et al., 2013). The majority of cancer patients report low to moderate levels of fear of recurrence through survivorship and the data so far suggests that fear of recurrence remains stable over time (Simard et al., 2013). Therefore, it is not surprising that cancer survivors with a clinical level of fear of recurrence are more likely to consult health ca re providers and to take psychotropic drugs (Champagne, Ivers, & Savard, 2018). 2.1.3 Impact of cancer on social well-being 8 Cancer can also have an impact on a patients ' social life. A variety of social problems, such as problems with health and welfare services, financial burden, employment, and relationship can occur after a cancer diagnosis , which can negatively impact patients' social well-being (Fenn et al., 2014; Wright, Kiely, Lynch, Cull, & Selby, 2002). Sexuality is in many cases also altered after a cancer diagnosis, which can lead to a reduced quality of life in both cancer patients and their partners (Tierney, 2008). Furthermore, research also shows that partners of cancer patients can experience fear of recurrence as well (Cohee et al., 2017), which can additionally burden a relationship. However, a functioning relationship can be of importance, since a supportive spouse can buffer the stressful impact of cancer (Regan et al., 2015). Furthermore, young adults with cancer oftentimes face problems with employment, education, or financial stability, which can have a negative impact on patients' well -being a nd subsequently result in reduced quality of life (Warner et al., 2016). 9 3. Treatments to improve cancer patients ' quality of life The previous chapters highlight ed that cancer patients oftentimes face reduced well- being. Since factors influencing patients ' well-being, such as distress, anxiety, and depression are common in cancer patients and are associated with reduced quality of life, treatment adherence and socio-economic consequences , dealing with these factors has become an additional goal in the treatment of cancer patients. One of the first efforts to tackle also the psychological burdens of cancer patients was made with the establishment of psycho-oncology in the mid-1970s in the USA, providing psychosocial interventions (Holland, 2002) as a complement to standard medical treatments. Since then, a variety of interventions have been the focus of research and are suggested to increase patients' well -being, such as cognitive behavioral treatments and psychoeducation (Kash, Mago, & Kunkel, 2005) . 3.1 Psychosocial interventions for cancer patients Psychosocial interventions range from counseling, coping and communication- enhancing intervention, psychoeducational intervention, cognitive -behavioral stre ss management, meaning-making interventions, art and music therapy, to meditation and relaxation interventions (Daniels & Kissane, 2008; Faller et al., 2013; Tao, Jiang, Liu, Aungsuroch, & Tao, 2015). However, results regarding the effectiveness of such interventions have been mixed (Faller et al., 2013). In a meta-analysis including 198 randomized controlled trials, Faller et al. (2013) reported that individual psychotherapy had a positive medium effect on distress, anxiety, depression and quality of life immediately after the treatment. These effects -although less pronounced - were still present up to 6 months after the intervention and for quality of life, a positive effect w as reported more than 6 months after the individual psychotherapy. Group psychotherapy had a small to medium effect size on distress, anxiety, depression and quality of life post-treatment and the effects, although reduced, were sustained 6 month or longer after the treatment, except for quality of life. For couple therapy, a small effect was found post-treatment for distress, which was not significant anymore up to 6 month or more after the treatment. For relaxation interventions, small to medium effects were reported on distress, anxiety, depression and quality of life post-treatment. Large effects for relaxation interventions on anxiety and quality of life were reported for the time period of up to 6 months after the intervention. However, sensitivity analyses indicated that 2 studies led to the large effect size and if those studies were excluded from the analyses, the effect turned non- significant. Psychoeducation had small effect on distress, anxiety, depression and quality of life 10 post-treatment, which were also present up to 6 months after the treatment, with the exception of quality of life. However, effects of psychoeducation more than 6 months after the treatment were only found for quality of life. Positive effects were also reported in other meta-analyses. Osborn and colleagues (2006) conducted a meta-analysis, where they summarized the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) and patient education on cancer patients depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Their analyses showed that CBT had positive effects on cancer patients ' depression, anxiety and quality of life directly after the intervention and quality of life was improved at short and long term (R. L. Osborn et al., 2006). However, patient education did not have an effect on the outcomes of interest (R. L. Osborn et al., 2006). Another meta-analysis focusing on the effect of psychosocial interventions on anxiety and distress in cancer patients showed that the interventions had small positive effects on the outcomes of interest (Sanjida et al., 2018). However, other factors than the intervention can influence the results and therefore need to be taken into account. Faller et al. (2013) on the one hand state that publication bias (i.e. publishing of mainly positive results) may lead to an overestimation of the effects of psychosocial interventions. On the other hand, Sanjida et al. (2018) cla im that low baseline distress as one of the main reasons for the small effect sizes found in their meta-analysis. Therefore, the results from these meta-analyses should not be considered as conclusive evidence. In the following chapters, three exercises, namely mindfulness meditation, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation are described in more detail. These exercises can be part of different treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (Tatrow & Montgomery, 2006) or a mind-body medicine program (Carlson et al., 2017) and were the basis of this research projects intervention. 3.1.1 Mindfulness-based interventio ns Mindfulness meditation is rooted in Buddhist and Zen practices (Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, & Burney, 1985; Speca, Carlson, Goodey, & Angen, 2000). In mindfulness meditation, the practitioner pays attention to the present moment in a nonjudgmental way (Kabat-Zinn et al., 1985) . Although many variations of mindfulness meditation exist it is often practiced in an upright sitting position and awareness to the present moment is oftentimes achieved by focusing on the sensation of breathing (Bishop et al., 2004). Effects of mindfulness 11 meditation have been studied extensively and empirical studies indicate that regular practice of mindfulness meditation can have beneficial effects on well-being and relieve stress (Goyal et al., 2014; Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, & Walach, 2004; Hilton et al., 2017). Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, empirical evidence indicate that several mechanisms such as body awareness, attention and emotion regulation induce the positive effects of mindfulness meditation (Boccia, Piccardi, & Guariglia, 2015; Gu, Strauss, Bond, & Cavanagh, 2015; H\u00f6lzel et al., 2011). The application of mindfulness meditation in clinical setting largely gained interest after the introduction of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a structured 8-week program originally developed for patients with chronic pain in the 1970s. MBSR has been studied for different clinical and medical diagnoses, such as cancer, coronary artery diseases, chronic pain, anxiety, or depression (Grossman et al., 2004). Due to the success of the MBSR program, a variety of adaptations were made for specific patient populations. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) was initially developed as a group skills-training for relapse prevention in patients with depression (Teasdale et al., 2000). As the name implies, MBCT combines elements from MBSR and cognitive behavioral therapy. Another adaptation of MBSR specifically for cancer patients is the program mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) (Carlson et al., 2016). MBCR is a group-based program that includes mindfulness practices (e.g. mindful breathing, body scan), psychoeducation tailored towards cancer patients, and yoga exercises (Carlson & Speca, 2011). The effects of mindfulness meditation on a variety of outcomes have been summarized in various meta-analyses. Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt, and Oh (2010) summarized in a meta- analysis with 39 studies and a total of 1140 participants the effects of mindfulness-based therapies on anxiety and depression. The results showed that the interventions were moderately effective in improving anxiety and depressive symptoms in the overall sample. Focusing on patients with anxiety and mood disorders, mindfulness-based therapies yielded larger effects. Another meta-analysis (Khoury et al., 2013) reported comparable positive effect of mindfulness-based therapies on depression and anxiety. A further meta-analysis summarized the effects of MBSR on depression, anxiety, and distress in patients with chronic medical conditions (Bohlmeijer, Prenger, Taal, & Cuijpers, 2010). In total, 8 RCT were included in the analyses, which showed small effects of MBSR on depression, anxiety, and distress (Bohlmeijer et al., 2010). A meta-analysis focusing on the effect of mindfulness-based interventions for adults with chronic pain reported the combined effects of 38 RCTs. Small effects were found for pain when comparing the mindfulness intervention to treatment as usual 12 (Hilton et al., 2017) . Furthermore, mindfulness-based interventions were associated with statistically significant improvement in depression and quality of life (Hilton et al., 2017). However, the authors also stated that many of the included studies had methodological issues (e.g. small sample sizes, lack of power calculation), which is why more well-designed and larger RCTs are needed to determine more precisely the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions (Hilton et al., 2017). As became apparent with the adapted MBCR program, mindfulness-based interventions were also implemented into cancer care. A meta-analysis conducted by Piet and colleagues (2012) summarized the effects of MBSR and MBCT on anxiety and depression in cancer patients. This meta-analysis included 22 studies, of which 9 where RCTs and 13 were nonrandomized studies. The overall results of the included studies showed a significant reduction of depression and anxiety in cancer patients, which participated in a mindfulness- based treatment (Piet, Wurtzen, & Zachariae, 2012). In another meta-analysis by Zhang et al. (2019) the effectiveness of 14 MBSR studies for breast cancer patients was summarized. The analysis revealed positive effects of MBSR on reducing anxiety, depression, fatigue and distress in cancer patients. Furthermore, the included MBSR studies showed improvements in mindfulness, cognitive function as well as emotional well-being and physical function (Zhang, Zhao, & Zheng, 2019). Although an increasing body of research indicate that mindfulness meditation can have beneficial effects, research on mindfulness interventions has also been criticized. Methodological concerns (e.g.. inappropriate use of statistics, use of unvalidated measures, lack of control variables) in mindfulness research were stated already in 2002 (Bishop, 2002). More recent studies conclude that a variety of methodological issues in mindfulness-based intervention studies still exist. For instance, the lack of validated mindfulness measures and challenges in operationalizing mindfulness as well as a strong reliance on self-reported outcomes have been reported (Van Dam et al., 2018). A systematic review aimed to assess if mindfulness research has improved methodologically (Goldberg et al., 2017). The authors concluded that the quality of mindfulness research has only improved modestly over time. For instance, sample sizes and treatment fidelity assessment increased marginally whereas no improvements regarding the lack of active control conditions or follow-up assessments were found (Goldberg et al., 2017). Therefore, effects of mindfulness interventions should currently be interpreted with caution, since reported effects in mindfulness studies might overestimate an actual benefit due to the aforementioned methodological shortcomings. To solve some of the existing methodological challenges, the use of mobile technology to deliver mindfulness-based 13 interventions has been recommended (R. J. Davidson & Dahl, 2018), which is in line with this PhD project. This mode of delivery has the benefit of a standardization of an intervention and the potential (R. J. Davidson & Dahl, 2018)to recruit large sample sizes. 3.1.2 Guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that uses stories or narratives to create images in the practitioners' mind which can lead to beneficial emotional and physical effects (Ha rt, 2008). The stories or narratives are often combined with background music (Hart, 2008) and can be delivered in a face- to-face or group setting by a therapist or an audio recording (Roffe, Schmidt, & Ernst, 2005). Besides visual images, Guided Imagery can also induce the perception of sounds, smells, tastes, sensory or affective feelings (Roffe et al., 2005). Guided Imagery has been used in a variety of patient populations with various medical conditions, such as cardiac surgery, cardiology, oncology, stroke rehabilitation, and pain management (Van Kuiken, 2004). Research on Guided Imagery indicates that it can have beneficial effects on quality of life, depression, anxiety, and pain (King, 2010). Roffe et al. (2005) reviewed studies for cancer patients that investigated Guided Imagery treatments. In this systematic review, six RCT's were included, of which only four full texts were available to the authors. Three studies reported significant effects for anxiety and comfort or emotional response to cancer therapy in the guided imagery group when compared to a control group. In a review on the effects of guided imagery on pain in cancer patients, King (2010) summarized the effects of five studies. In three studies, a decrease of pain intensity or pain-related distress was reported in the Guided Imagery group compared to a control group (King, 2010). A further study reported that Guided Imagery can have positive effects on chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (Hosseini, Tirgari, Forouzi, & Jahani, 2016). Another frequently used relaxation exercise is Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR). PMR was introduced by Jacobson in the 1920s (Sims, 1987). During PMR, different muscle groups are progressively tensed and relaxed and attention is paid to the different feelings while relaxing and tensing the muscles (Sims, 1987). PMR has shown beneficial effects in patients with tension headache, insomnia, and chronic pain in patients with inflammatory arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome (McCallie, Blum, & Hood, 2006). PMR has also been studied as a supportive treatment for symptom management in cancer patients (Satija & Bhatnagar, 2017). A systematic review by Pelekasis, Matsouka, and Koumarianou (2017) summarized the results of 5 PMR studies for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The authors concluded that 14 PMR can reduce discomfort and anxiety as well as chemotherapy side effects, except for vomiting (Pelekasis et al., 2017). However, the authors also reported that the quality of the included studies were low, e.g. due to missing reports of random allocation, blinding, and sample size determination (Pelekasis et al., 2017). Another systematic review (Tian et al., 2020) summarized the effects of PMR in alleviating nausea and vomiting in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. This systematic review included six studies which indicate that PMR can have positive effects on nausea and, contrary to a systematic review by Pelekasis et al. (2017) also on vomiting (Tian et al., 2020). Other studies also indicate that PMR can have beneficial effects on quality of life (Cheung, Molassiotis, & Chang, 2003; Paras-Bravo et al., 2017) as well as depression and anxiety (Zhou et al., 2015) in cancer patients. Research so far suggests that guided imagery and PMR can have beneficial effects on well-being and quality of life in cancer patients. However, those relaxation exercises are oftentimes used in combination with other exercises or treatments. Some studies also investigated the effectiveness of interventions for cancer patients combining guided imagery and PMR. A systematic review by (Kapogiannis, Tsoli, & Chrousos, 2018) summarized findings of seven randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of an intervention combining guided imagery and PMR for cancer patients. In summary, research so far indicates that the combination of guided imagery and PMR is effective in reducing anxiety and depression as well as side effects such as nausea and vomiting in cancer patients (Kapogiannis et al., 2018). 3.1.3 Barriers for uptake and adheren ce of psycho-social interventions The previous chapter highlighted that cancer patients ' mental and physical well-being is oftentimes reduced, which in turn leads to a decreased quality of life. Several psychosocial interventions can improve cancer patien ts' well -being and quality of life and therefore have been suggested as supportive treatments. However, uptake of such interventions is moderate (Brebach et al., 2016). Barriers for uptake can be stigma concerning seeking help (Cohen et al., 2018) , patients' believe that their distress is not severe and therefore does not require treatment (Clover, Mitchell, Britton, & Carter, 2015; Faller et al., 2016), lack of information about such treatments, difficulties to travel or inconvenient location of service providers (Dilworth, Higgins, Parker, Kelly, & Turner, 2014), or lack of standardized screening of distress in cancer patients (Pirl et al., 2007). 15 Studies also showed that higher levels of distress in patients does not always lead to higher uptake of psychosocial interventions (Clover et al., 2015; Tondorf et al., 2018). This is problematic, since especially patients with high levels of distress would benefit if they could reduce their distress level, due to the negative mid-term consequences of elevated levels o f distress. The lack of uptake of psychosocial interventions stands in contrast to unmet needs reported by cancer patients. Many cancer patients state that their needs in psychosocial domains oftentimes are not met (Willems et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2018). Furthermore, more unmet needs in cancer patients are correlated with lower quality of life (Willems et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2018). To tackle this discrepancy between need and uptake of psychosocial interventions , amongst others, digital self-care interventions have been proposed, which is the topic of the next chapter. 16 4. Digital interventions Digital interventions are programs using digital technology such as mobile apps, social media, and interactive websites which aim to foster behavior change to improve the health of professionals, patients, or the general public (Michie, Yardley, West, Patrick, & Greaves, 2017). Digital interventions aiming at improving health are also labeled eHealth interventions. Although a precise definition of eHealth is lacking, the majority of definitions describe eHealth as the use of technology (e.g. the internet, information and communication technologies) to improve health (Oh et al., 2005). Access to digital technology like the internet and the ownership of digital devices like smartphones have increased largely over the last couple of years (Dugas, Gao, & Agarwal, 2020; McKay et al., 2018).Therefore, digital interventions have been proposed as a mean to improve health behaviors and health care, although research in this field is still preliminary (Michie et al., 2017). Digital interventions have been proposed for a variety of medical conditions and research indicates that such interventions can be effective. For example, digital interventions for hypertension patients have been shown to significantly lower patients' blood pressure when compared to usual care (McLean et al., 2016). In addition, digital interventions show promising effects in glycemic control and self-management in patients with diabetes (Liang et al., 2011) can also help overweight and obese adults to lose weight (Beleigoli et al., 2019) and have been found to be helpful for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (Widmer et al., 2015), smoking cessation (Graham et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2017). Furthermore, digital interventions can also be effective in improving mental health. A meta-analysis conducted by Firth and colleagues indicates that digital interventions compared to a control condition can significantly reduce depressive symptoms (Firth et al., 2017). Digital interventions can also be effective in reducing anxiety (Deady et al., 2017; Firth et al., 2017). People diagnosed with a cancer diagnosis might also benefit from digital interventions. A review by Escriva Boulley et al. (2018) concluded that digital interventions with psychosocial components (e.g. psychoeducation, psychological support, coping strategies) show promising effects in cancer patients as well as cancer survivors. However, the methodological quality of most studies was judged to be poor and hence evidence for efficacy is still limited (Escriva Boulley et al., 2018; Marcolino et al., 2018). Positive effects were for instance reported in a RCT conducted by Willems et al. (2017), in which a web-based computer-tailored intervention with principles from problem solving therapy and CBT reduced depression and fatigue and 17 increased the emotional and social functioning in cancer survivors. These findings are supported by a review by Seiler, Klaas, Troster, and Fagundes (2017) that also found beneficial effects of a variety of digital interventions (e.g. educational programs, CBT- or MBSR-based) on fatigue and depression and health related quality of life in nine studies. Another RCT investigating a web-based self-care intervention for cancer patients reported beneficial effects on depressive symptoms (Fann, Hong, Halpenny, Blonquist, & Berry, 2017). Furthermore , some studies also investigated online mindfulness-based interventions for cancer patients. In a pilot RCT, 46 cancer patients in the intervention group receiving a 6-week online mindfulness- based intervention were compared to a control group with 23 cancer patients (Russell et al., 2019). The results of this study indicate that the severity of fear of cancer recurrence (one of seven domains of the fear of cancer recurrence inventory) significantly improved in the intervention group compared to the control group. However, no significant differences were found in other domains of the fear of recurrence inventory (e.g. psychological distress, functional impairment) or in other measures assessing rumination, mindfulness, worry, and perceived stress (Russell et al., 2019). Another RCT with three arms (treatment as usual, group face- to-face or individual internet-based mindfulness-based cognitive therapy) investigated long-term effects of mindfulness-based interventions for cancer patients (Cillessen et al., 2018). Results showed that in both intervention groups distress, rumination, mental health and quality of life improved significantly, wher eas patients in the online intervention group reported lower distress at follow-up compared to patients in the group intervention (Cillessen et al., 2018). In addition to those effects, the acceptability of digital interventions seems high. In two studies measuring acceptability, 72% and 57 % of cancer patients judged the respective digital intervention to be helpful (Damholdt et al., 2016; Russell et al., 2019). However, research indicates that it is important that the intervention is delivered at the right stage of the cancer treatment and that the intervention content is specifically matched to the patients changing needs (Corbett et al., 2018). 4.1 mHealth interventions A subcategory of eHealth is mHealth, which is defined as the use of mobile technologies (e.g. smartphones, tablets) for the delivery of health services (Kay, Santos, & Takane, 2011). A major advantage of mHealth interventions compared to web-based interventions is the accessibility. Since a mobile device such as a smartphone is used, the intervention can be accessed at any place. Furthermore, the number of smartphone owners has grown rapidly 18 worldwide (Finances Online, 2020; Pew Research Center, 2019), which increases the possible access to mHealth interventions also to hard- to-reach populations. In Switzerland, it is estimated that 90% of people own a smartphone (Statista Research Department, 2020) and most people access the internet today through their smartphone (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik, 2020). Whittaker, McRobbie, Bullen, Rodgers, and Gu (2016) defined advantages of using mobile interventions as convenience, ease, cost effectiveness, scalability, personalization, and the ability to send time-sensitive messages with. Another advantage of a mobile phone is the possibility to send and receive reminders, for instance in form of short message service (SMS). Marcolino et al. (2018) showed evidence, that SMS reminders significantly enhanced attendance rates and improved adherence to therapy which is one of the key points when it comes to the successful implementation of an intervention. However, beside of all the above-mentioned advantages, also some disadvantages and limitations have to be considered. Disadvantages of mHealth interventions include for example unequal access to or limited knowledge of information and communication technology, which can negatively impact the uptake of an mHealth intervention (Hamine, Gerth-Guyette, Faulx, Green, & Ginsburg, 2015). Further limitations can occur due to privacy regulations, which can hinder the implementation of mHealth interventions (Vogel, Combs, & Kessel, 2017). Current rapid technological advances also inhibi t timely evaluation of new mHealth developments since rigorous research is time-consuming (Goldfine, Lai, Lucey, Newcomb, & Carreiro, 2020) . Furthermore, a large number of mHealth interventions are continuously released and the majority of openly available mHealth apps are developed by the software industry and lack scientific evidence (Donker et al., 2013; Lau et al., 2020; Marcolino et al., 2018). Therefore, health professionals as well as patients might have difficulties in finding an appropriate and effective mHealth intervention. Despite these limitations and possible disadvantages, mHealth interventions show similarly to eHealth interventions promising results on health outcomes. For instance, studies report positive effects of mHealth interventions on mental health (Wang, Varma, & Prosperi, 2018), smoking cessation, weight loss, increase of physical activity (Flores Mateo, Granado- Font, Ferre-Grau, & Montana-Carreras, 2015), medication intake, and diabetes (Tabi et al., 2019). mHealth interventions are also promising in cancer patients. One randomized controlle d study conducted by Rosen, Paniagua, Kazanis, Jones, and Potter (2018) investigated the effect of a 8 week mobile app-delivered mindfulness training on quality of life in 112 women 19 diagnosed with breast cancer. They found that as compared to the waitlist control group, the app group reported a higher quality of life after 8 weeks of training. This effect was still present after 4 weeks. Also in breast cancer survivors, mHealth interventions were successfully applied. Lengacher et al. (2018) for example provided 15 breast cancer survivors with a 6 weeks mobile mindfulness-based stress reduction for breast cancer program. From baseline to post 6 weeks beneficial effects in the following parameters were showed: depression, state anxiety, stress, fear of recurrence, sleep, fatigue and quality of life. Although the sample was rather small, hence they concluded, that the effects of a mHealth intervention on several psychological and physiological parameters might be promising. However, research on mHealth for cancer patients is sparse and partially showing mixed results. In a systematic review summarizing studies to support self-management for adult cancer survivors and their outcome on pain, psychological distress, fatigue, or sleep outcomes, only seven studies were included of which only two were RCTs (Hernandez Silva, Lawler, & Langbecker, 2019). Although research so far indicates that mHealth intervention for cancer survivors can improve pain, fatigue, and sleep outcomes, further studies are necessary to confirm the effectiveness of mHealth interventions, as well as to determine limitations of such interventions (Hernandez Silva et al., 2019). Other studies show that mHealth interventions can be beneficial in improving cancer patients ' quality of life, although results so far on the effect of psychological outcomes such as distress are inconclusive (Jongerius, Russo, Mazzocco, & Pravettoni, 2019; J. Osborn, Ajakaiye, Cooksley, & Subbe, 2020) 20 B. EMPIRICAL STUDIES 1. Aims of the PhD project The aims of this thesis was to evaluate the feasibility of a mindfulness- and relaxation- based app intervention for cancer patients. To achieve this, we first conducted a systematic review where we summarized results from relaxation-based eHealth studies for patients with a medical condition. Second, we conducted a mindfulness- and relaxation-based app study for cancer patients. In this prospective observational study, all enrolled cancer patients received access to the app and patient reported outcomes as well as data on app usage were collected over the course of 20 weeks. We used a mixed-methods design and therefore collected and analyzed quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data comprised self-reported health outcomes, which we assessed with paper and pencil questioners and partly electronically with the app. Additional quantitative data were app usage data. Qualitative data were assessed with semi-structured interviews, which we conducted with patients and health professionals. The study was guided by the RE-AIM evaluation framework, which assesses the following evaluations dimensions: Reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. This research project was funded by the Swiss Cancer League (funding ID: KLS-3564-02-2015) and was conducted at the Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich. 2. Methods 2.1 App Intervention For this research project a mindfulness and relaxation app for cancer patients was developed. The app built on previously developed relaxation study-apps of an affiliated group (Blodt, Pach, Roll, & Witt, 2014) which were designed for patients with chronic low back pain (Relaxback) and chronic neck pain (Relaxneck). The app was developed by the software company Smart Mobile Factory GmbH (Berlin, Germany). After thorough testing, the app was released in June 2016 on the Apple iTunes store and on the Google Play Store for Android devices. After the final release, the content of the app was not changed. The app could be publicly downloaded for free, however, an individual access code was needed to start the app. 21 This access code exclusively known by the study team was distributed to study participants after a screening for eligibility and a subsequent inclusion into the study. The app consisted of three main features: (1) guided audio mindfulness and relaxation exercises, (2) a notification feature, and (3) a brief questionnaire. The first feature comprised three different exercises that were audio recordings of mindfulness meditation, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation exercises (see Fig. 1). Each audio file was about 15 minutes long and voiced either by a male or a female narrator. The second feature of the app was an optional notification feature, which could be used to get a reminder to practice daily. The reminder popped up as a push notification on the mobile device every day at the time set by the patient according to his individual preferences (see Fig. 2). If the patients considered the daily reminder as too stressful, this feature could also be deactivated. The third feature of the app was a weekly questionnaire, which assessed distress levels and user satisfaction with the app (see Fig. 3). All features were accessible through the app menu (see Fig. 4). Figure 1. Screenshots of the CanRelax App exercises 22 Figure 2. Screenshots of the CanRelax App notification feature. Figure 3. Screenshots of the CanRelax App questionnaire. 23 Figure 4. Screenshots of the CanRelax App menu. 2.2 Measur es In our study we used a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. For quantitative data, we used several questionnaires to assess quality of life and health related outcomes. Furthermore, our research app generated a logfile in which patients' time spent using the app exercises was recorded. For qualitative data, we conducted semi- structured interviews with cancer patients and health professionals. 2.2.1 Assessment of quantitative data In this research project, we used a variety of questionnaires to assess quantitative date over the course of 20 weeks. The matrix of measures with a list of all questionnaires is depicted in figure 3. These questionnaires are outlined in more detail in the methods section of our publications. 25 about topics that were relevant to them. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and then thematic coding for structuring the interviews was applied using the software MAXQDA (Version 11, VERBI Software, Berlin Germany). Thereafter, for analysis, content analysis according to Mayring (2010) was used. 26 3. Published studies The above mentioned research aims resulted in three published manuscripts (Mikolasek, Berg, Witt, & Barth, 2018; Mikolasek, Witt, & Barth, 2018, 2021). The first manuscript was a systematic review with the aim to summarize the current state of knowledge about the effectiveness of mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth interventions for patients with medical conditions. The latter two manuscripts evaluated the feasibility of our research app for cancer patients. One addressed the three evaluation dimension reach, adoption, and maintenance of our mindfulness and relaxation self-care app for cancer patients and the other highlighted the effects and the implementation of the same intervention app. The content of the three manuscripts is described in full detail in the subsequent paragraphs. 27 3.1 Effectiveness of mindfulness-and relaxation-based eHealth interventions for patients with medical conditions: a systematic review and synthesis This article was originally published in: Mikolasek, M., Berg, J., Witt, C.

Witt1,2,3&J\u00fcrgen Barth1 Published online: 27 July 2017 #International Society of Behavioral Medicine 2017 Abstract Purpose This systematic review aims to summarize eHealth studies with mindfulness- and relaxation-based interventions for medical conditions and to determine whether eHealth in- terventions have positive effects on health. Method A comprehensive search of five databases was con- ducted for all available studies from 1990 to 2015. Studies were included if the intervention was mainly technology delivered and included a mindfulness- or relaxation-based intervention strategy and if patients with a medical condition were treated. Treatment effects were summarized for different outcomes. Results A total of 2383 records were identified, of which 17 studies with 1855 patients were included in this systematic review. These studies were conducted in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, cancer, chronic pain, surgery, and hypertension. All but one study were deliv- ered online through a web-based platform; one study delivered the intervention with iPods. The studies indicate that mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth interventions can have positive effects on patients 'general health and psycholog- ical well-being. No effects were found for stress or mindfulness. Only five studies reported economic analyses of eHealth inter- ventions without any clear conclusion.Conclusion There is some evidence that mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth interventions for medical conditions can have positive effects on health outcomes. Therefore, such interventions might be a useful addition to standard medical care. No app studies were retrieved, even though a vast num- ber of smartphone apps exist which aim at increasing users ' health. Therefore, more studies investigating those health apps are needed. Keywords Mindfulness .Relaxation techniques .eHealth . Smartphone .Patients .Study quality Introduction eHealth is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) asthe use of information and communication technologies for health [ 1]. The number of eHealth studies is increasing, and eHealth interventions are effective at improving patients ' health [ 2]. One of the most important advantages of eHealth is its high accessibility due to the well-established access to the Internet by the majority of people worldwide, which also allows remotely located people or those with reduced mobility access to care [ 3]. Another advantage of eHealth interventions is reduced healthcare costs, since relatively few economic and personnel resources are needed for delivery compared to face- to-face interventions [ 2]. eHealth interventions can use a va- riety of intervention strategies to improve patients 'health, such as education, feedback, exercise, and verbal support with a therapist or other patients [ 4]. Changing patients 'cognition and behavior can be regarded as the underlying working mechanism for such interventions. In recent years, setting up and maintaining an eHealth intervention were greatly facili- tated due to technological advances like Web 2.0 [ 5].*Michael Mikolasek michael.mikolasek@usz.ch 1Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Sonneggstrasse 6, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland 2Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9 -Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany 3Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USAInt.J. Behav. Med. (2018) 25:1 -16 DOI 10.1007/s12529-017-9679-7 28The mode of delivery and format of eHealth interven- tions vary considerably. For instance, audio, video, or text can convey educational information or various exercises, while an eHealth intervention might incorporate contact with a therapist (e.g., via e-mail, chat, telephone) or with other users (e.g., via forum). Also, a variety of platforms like PCs, tablets, or smartphones can be used to deliver an eHealth intervention, making eHealth a broad topic with numerous different definitions [ 6]. Aconsiderable number of eHealth studies also incorporate mindfulness- and relaxation-based intervention strategies. The rationale for this might be the evidence of many studies with a beneficial effect of mindfulness- and relaxation-based inter- ventions in a face-to-face setting for patients with medical conditions [ 7-10]. The practice of mindfulness is rooted in Buddhist traditions [ 11] and has been implemented into Western healthcare interventions, independent of a religious and cultural context [ 12]. Mindfulness consists of intentional attention in the present moment and an openness and accep- tance towards this experience [ 13]. The non-judgmental expe- rience of body sensations is often part of mindfulness inter- ventions. It is hypothesized that this experience leads to in- creased self-regulation and emotional, cognitive, and behav- ioral flexibility [ 12]. The underlying mechanism is therefore an adaptation to the present moment by reducing the impact of wearing information through acceptance. On the contrary, traditional relaxation interventions such as progressive muscle relaxation [ 14] are rooted in Western society and focus directly on relaxation by means of exercises (e.g., progressive muscle relaxation) or imagina- tion (e.g., guided imagery) [ 15]. The underlying mechanism is a physiological response (e.g., decreased heart rate and blood pressure) by body exercises or the manipulation of thoughts [16,17]. Despite those differences, both mindfulness practices and relaxation methods elicit a relaxation response (i.e., decreased psychophysiological arousal) [ 15,18]. These similar responses are congr uent with findings indicating that mindfulness- and relaxation-based interventions are effective in reducing distress in patients with hard-to-treat or chronic medical conditions [ 19-21]. Mindfulness- and relaxation-based interventions can also be delivered in meth- odologically similar ways (e.g., multi-week and multimodal clinical interventions) [ 22]. In addition, both kinds of in- terventions are effectively used to increase patients 'self- care [ 23,24] and, compared to other stress-reducing in- terventions such as biofeedback [ 25], no additional equip- ment is required. Mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth interventions might be a good alternative or addition to face-to-face inter- ventions for patients with high psychological burden, since eHealth interventions are low threshold (i.e., patients do not need to leave their home for the intervention) [ 26]. Therefore,eHealth interventions as an addition to standard care might be particularly suited for patients with a high frequency of med- ical visits or impaired mobility. Two recent reviews [ 27,28] summarized the effects of mindfulness-basedeHealth interventions, indicating that these eHealth interventions can contribute to improve outcomes such as stress, depression, and anxiety. However, both reviews included studies with a large variety in the population, ranging from healthy volunteers (i.e., mainly student population) to patients with medical or psychological conditions. Patients with medical conditions often suffer from increased rates of depression, anxiety, and distress, as well as a reduced quality of life [ 29-32]. Therefore, a focused perspective on eHealth interventions for patients with medical conditions is advisable to allow conclusions for such users. To draw more conclusive findings for patients with medical conditions, the aim of this syst ematic review was to summarize the effectiveness of mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth studies for patients with medical conditions. Since we were interested in summarizing the effectiveness (i.e., effects in a routine clinical setting) of mindf ulness- and relaxation-based interventions, we included studies which combine various types of interventions. Method Eligibility Criteria Studies were included if they conducted a pre- and post- assessment of a health outcome of interest (general health, depression or anxiety, stress, mindfulness, satisfaction with the intervention, self-efficacy or self-care, pain or other health-related outcomes) for an eHealth intervention in adult patients with medical conditions (e.g., cancer, hypertension, fibromyalgia). Studies were excluded if patients suffered sole- ly from mental disorders (i.e., 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (IC D-10) diagnosis codes F01 - F99), which also led to the exclusion of addiction or substance abuse (ICD-10 diagnosis code F10 -F19). Studies with pa- tients suffering from disorders which could be considered ei- ther a medical condition or a mental disorder (e.g., sleep dis- orders: ICD-10 code F51 or G47) were excluded. In each study, a mindfulness or relaxation intervention strategy had to be a substantial part of the intervention (see Table 1). Studies with various intervention strategies (e.g., mindfulness meditatio n, relaxation, patient educa- tion, and biofeedback) were only included if the ratio of mindfulness or relaxation intervention strategy to the total number of intervention strategies was at least 1 to 5. Furthermore, the intervention had to be mainly technolo- gy delivered. We considered an intervention as technology2 Int.J. Behav. Med. (2018) 25:1 -16 29delivered if it was accessed via the internet or a smartphone app, if face-to-face meetings between patients and the study team were restricted to data collection, and if the contact with a therapist was restricted to one face-to-face contact. However, we included studies if they comprised online, e-mail, or phone contact with the therapist as part of the intervention (see Table 1). The studies had to include at least pre- and post- assessments of any kind of health-related outcome (e.g., qual- ity of life, stress), but the design did not have to be controlled (i.e., including a comparison group). We included all journal publications published in any language between 1990 and April 2015. The reason for this timeframe for inclusion is that during the 1990s, the internet was established for public use [6]. During the screening process, we excluded dissertations due to limited access to unpublished work and a lack of clarity regarding peer review. Search Strategy and Study Selection For the literature search, we used three databases in EBSCO (PsycINFO, CINAHL, and AMED) and two additional data- bases (EMBASE and Medline). We searched for the following terms (full list of keywords in Appendix ):Bapp or online context ^AND Bmindfulness or relaxation ^AND Bintervention or rct or treatment. ^For exclusion, the following terms were used: Babuse or alcohol or addiction. ^ Our team consisted of four researchers, who were trained with a screening manual for study inclusion. We based the screening manual on previous systematic reviews performed by our group and adapted it to the specific require- ments (e.g., inclusion criteria, outcomes) for this systematic review. Three researchers conducted the abstract screening (JB, JoB, IM), and three researchers conducted the full-text screening (JB, JoB, MM). After the literature search and after the removal of duplicates, all abstracts were screened accord- ing to a structured manual. Subsequently, the full texts of included articles were screened using the same predefined eligibility criteria.Data Extraction All researchers involved in the data extraction (JB, JoB, MM) were trained using the extraction manual with five studies for training purposes. During the training, we discussed the re- sults and clarified any terminological ambiguity. After the training, all studies were extracted in duplicate (JoB, MM) and the extraction of data was done in Excel according to a standardized extraction manual. In cases of disagreement re- garding the extracted data, consensus was reached with a third researcher (JB). We extracted general information about the study (first au- thor and publication year), data on patients (number of pa- tients in intervention and control groups, inclusion and exclu- sion criteria), intervention (mode of delivery, intervention strategy, dose, and length of intervention), comparators, out- comes, and study design. For the extraction of interventio n strategies, we prespecified the following categories: mindfulness, relaxation, patient edu- cation, biofeedback, cognitive intervention, exercise (including Yoga, Tai Chi), imagination or visualization, and meditation other than mindfulness. As outcomes of interest, we pr especified the following categories: general health (defined as measures assessing physical functioning, disability or quality of life), depres- sion or anxiety, stress, mindfulness, satisfaction with the intervention, self-efficacy or self-care, pain, or other health-related outcomes. The effectiveness of the eHealth intervention was evaluated by a vote counting approach, in which the number of studies with positive effects was compared to the number of studies with negative effects [33]. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a signifi- cant effect was defined as superior effectiveness if the results favored the intervention group. A non-significant effect was defined as equal effectiveness. A significant effect was de- fined as inferior effectiveness if the results favored the control group. For pretest-posttest studies without a control group, a significant change over time was considered a positive re- sponse. Insignificant improvement over time was consideredTable 1 Operationalization of technology-delivered, mindfulness- and relaxation- based interventionsTechnology-delivered interventionThe intervention must be accessed through an online-login (e.g., accessing a web browser program) or smartphone app. Face-to-face meeting between patients and study team is restricted to pre-, post-, and follow-up data collection. Supplementary communication between patients and therapist is restricted to face-to-face contact only once. Online, e-mail, or phone contact is allowed if supplementary to the online intervention. Mindfulness- and relaxation-based interventionAll interventions based on aspects of mindfulness and relaxation are included. This means that standardized courses like mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is included, as well as intervention based on other meditation practices (e.g., metta meditation), mind-body awareness, and relaxation techniques.Int.J. Behav. Med. (2018) 25:1 -16 3 30no response, and deterioration over time was considered a negative response. pvalues lower than .05 were considered significant. We report standardized mean differences between groups which are either reported by the authors or derived from information given in the publication by transformation routines. Quality Assessment For the assessment of risk of bias, two researchers (JB, MM) assessed the adequate random sequence generation ( =0 . 7 0 ) and allocation concealment 0.86) for each study accord- ing to Cochrane standards [ 33] in duplicate. In cases of dis- agreement, consensus was reached in a discussion between the two researchers. Blinding of the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool [ 33] was not rated, since blinding might be considered inadequate according to Cochrane standards in all studies with self-report measures, which is the gold standard in this type of research. We did not assess completeness of outcome assess- ment in a regular way, but we extracted the number of drop- outs, which reflects the feasibility of the interventions. We defined dropouts as the number of patients who were allocated to the eHealth intervention or control group but did not com- plete the post-treatment assessment. For the assessment of the external validity of each study, we used one item of the checklist by Downs and Black [ 34], namely if the patients in the study were representative for the entire patient population (i.e., patients comprise the entire source population, an unselected sample of consecutive pa- tients, or a random sample) ( = 0.61). Two researchers (JB, MM) rated the items individually for each study. In cases of disagreement, the same researchers reached consensus in a discussion. Data Synthesis We pooled the findings of the studies according to the six outcomes and stratified for the type of control condition (usual care, waitlist vs. active control, attention control). The find- ings were summarized in a vote counting approach, with all non-significant findings being reported as a null effect, which is a quite conservative approach. We used this approach since the outcomes of the studies and the underlying medical con- ditions vary substantially between studies and homogeneity in effects cannot be expected in a pooled meta-analysis. Results Study Selection Through the literature search, a total of 2703 records were identified. After removal of 323 duplicates, titles and abstractswere screened in 2383 records. Subsequently, 2257 studies were excluded because they did not match our inclusion criteria. The full texts of the remaining 126 studies were screened; of these, 109 did not meet our inclusion criteria. Finally, a total of 17 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in this review (Fig. 1). Study Characteristics An overview of the 17 included studies [ 35-51]i sp r e s e n t e di n Table 2. Three studies [ 41,42,51] were published between 2000 and 2005, a further three studies [ 38,47,50]w e r ep u b - lished between 2006 and 2010, and 11 studies [ 35-37,39,40, 43-46,48,49] were published between 2011 and 2015. Regarding the study designs, 15 studies [ 35,37-45,47-51] were randomized. One study [ 36] used a control group without randomization, and one study [ 46] used a pretest-posttest de- sign. Patients in the studies suffered from eight different med- ical conditions. Five studies [ 35,45,47-49] conducted an eHealth intervention for irrita ble bowel syndrome, three studies [41,44,51] for headache, two studies [ 37,39] for cancer, two studies [ 38,42] for chronic pain, two studies [ 40,45] for fibro- myalgia, one study [ 43] for surgery, and one study [ 50]f o r hypertension. All but one study were delivered online (i.e., access through a web browser). One study [ 43] delivered the eHealth intervention with iPods (i.e., relaxing music). The study-specific charact eristics are summarized in Table 3. The included studies involved a total of 1855 patients, with a range from 18 to 368 patients per study. The duration of the eHealth interventions ranged from 10 days to 10 weeks. Congruent with our inclusion criteria, all studies had at least an intervention strategy consisting of mindfulness (11 studies [35-37,39,40,42,45-49]) or relaxation (9 studies [ 36-39,41, 43,44,50,51]). Three of those studies [ 36,37,39] used both mindfulness and relaxation inte rvention strategies. The major- ity of studies included additionally patient education (14 studies [35,37-42,44-49,51]) or cognitive intervention (13 studies [35,37-42,44-49]) as an intervention strategy. Less common- ly used intervention strategies were biofeedback [ 41,50], other meditation techniques than mindfulness [ 36,37], and imagina- tion or visualization [ 36,39]. None of the studies used body exercise as an intervention strategy. Furthermore, 11 studies used additional intervention strategies which were not included in our classification (e.g., e xposure treatment, writing exercises). Except for one [ 43], all studies used more than one inter- vention strategy according to our classification. Two studies [37,39] used six intervention strategies, ten studies [ 35,36, 38,40,41,44-48]used four intervention strategies, three studies [ 42,49,51] used three intervention strategies, and one study [ 50] used two intervention strategies. The intervention strategies in the active control groups were online chat forum [ 35], online symptom management4 Int.J. Behav. Med. (2018) 25:1 -16 31program [ 36], information via website [ 37], health tips [ 40], online diary [ 41], online pain management with psychoeducation [ 42], internet-delivered stress management [48], and internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy with exposure [ 49]. Quality of Studies Concerning the quality of the sequence generation, 11 studies of the 15 RCTs [ 37-40,42,44,45,47-49,51] had a low risk of bias and four studies [ 35,41,43,50] had an unclear risk of bias. The allocation concealment was performed well in ten studies [ 37,40,42,44,45,47-51] with a low risk of bias, and five studies [ 35,38,39,41,43] had an unclear risk of bias. In 12 studies [ 35,37-39,42-45,48-51], the subjects were rep- resentative of the population; in four studies [ 36,40,41,47], they were not, and in one study [ 46], representativeness could not be determined (see Table 4).The assessment of the risk of bias items was not applicable for one study by Ljotsson et al. [46], which was a pretest-posttest study without a control group. Effectiveness of Mindfulness-Related eHealth Interventions The most common outcome was general health, which was assessed in 13 studies [ 36,37,39-41,44-51]( s e eT a b l e 5). Depression or anxiety was assessed in 11 studies [ 37,38,40-43,46-49,51]. Pain was assessed in nine studies [ 38, 40-44,46,47,51]. Self-efficacy or self-care [ 38-40,43, 44], stress [ 37,48], and mindfulness [ 36,42], and satisfaction with the intervention [ 38,39]w e r el e s sc o m m o n l ya s s e s s e d . Most studies used validated questionnaires for the assessment of outcomes of interest (see Table 5). Exceptions were scales developed by investigators or modified items [ 40] and diaries [40,44,47,51] which were used to complement questionnaires. Twelve of 13 studies with general health as outcome were RCTs. Eight studies used an active control group, of which five studies [ 40,41,45,47,48] reported superior effectiveness of the eHealth intervention. One study re- ported equal effectiveness [ 37] for the eHealth interven- tion and control group, and two studies reported inferior effectiveness of the eHealth intervention [ 36,49]c o m - p a r e dt oi n t e r v e n t i o ns t r a t e g i e s ,w h i c hs e r v e da st h em o s t beneficial active comparator in the study (meaning that the eHealth intervention was considered as control condi- tion). In the remaining four RCTs with general health, patients in the control group received treatment as usual. All four studies [ 39,44,50,51] showed equal effective- ness of eHealth interventions and control groups. One study [ 46] used a pretest-posttest design indicating a pos- itive response of the eHealth intervention. Out of the 12 studies assessing depression or anxiety, seven studies used an RCT design with an active control group. Two studies [ 40,47] reported superior effectiveness of eHealth Fig. 1 PRISMA flow diagramInt.J. Behav. Med. (2018) 25:1 -16 5 32intervention. Four studies [ 37,41,42,48] reported equal effec- tiveness. One dismantling study [ 49] reported inferior effective- ness of a mindfulness-based eHealth intervention if compared to a more comprehensive online program. This can be consid- ered the most promising treatmen t, since an effective treatment component (i.e., exposure for irritable bowel syndrome pa- tients) was added to an otherwise similar mindfulness-based intervention. Four studies assessing depression [ 38,43,45, 51] used an RCT design with a treatment-as-usual control group, of which one showed superior effectiveness [ 45]a n d the remaining three showed equal effectiveness. One study [46] used a pretest-posttest design without a control group and showed a positive response.Out of the nine studies assessing pain, four studies used an RCT design with an active control group. Two studies [ 41,47] showed superior effectiveness. The remaining two studies [ 40, 42] showed equal effectiveness. Four studies assessing pain used an RCT design with treatment-as-usual control groups. One study [ 51] showed superior effectiveness and the remain- ing three studies [ 38,43,44] reported equal effectiveness. One study [ 46] used a pretest-posttest design without a control group and showed a positive response. Out of the five studies assessing self-efficacy, one study [40] used an RCT design with an active control group, reporting superior effectiveness. Four studies assessing self- efficacy used an RCT design with treatment-as-usual controlTable 2 Overview of studies reviewed Number of studies Study ID number Year ,S 1 1[ 4 7 ] ,S 1 2[ 4 5 ] ,S 1 3[ ,S 1 1[ 4 7 ] ,S 1 2[ 4 5 ] ,S 1 3[ mindfulness- and re laxation-based eHealth interventions Source Sample characteristicsDuration and mode of delivery Interven tion Intervention components Control S1 Andersson et al.

Two studies [ 37,48] with an RCT design using an active control group assessed stress and reported equal effectiveness. Similarly, two studies [ 36,42] with an RCT design using active control groups assessed mindfulness and reported equal effectiveness. Patients 'satisfaction with the eHealth intervention was assessed in two studies [ 38,39]. In one study [ 38], the major- ity of patients considered the intervention to be helpful, found the intervention program easy to navigate, and would recom- mend the intervention to others. In another study [ 39], global satisfaction with the intervention was high and patients con- sidered the interventions a good tool for their medical condi- tion (breast cancer) and would recommend the intervention to a friend with a similar diagnosis. These results are summarized in Table 6,i nw h i c ht h ee f - fectiveness of mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth interventions is listed for the outcomes of interest stratifiedfor the type of control group: inactive control groups (i.e., treatment as usual or wait list) or active control groups. Discussion This systematic review found evidence that eHealth interven- tions with mindfulness- or relaxation-based strategies might be effective for increasing patients 'general health and well- being. More than half of the studies reported positive effects on general health (i.e., physical functioning, disability, quality of life), depression, anxiety, or self-efficacy. Fewer studies reported positive effects of eHealth interventions on pain, and no study reported positive effects on stress or mindful- ness. Overall, these findings are of clinical relevance since all studies used eHealth interventio ns for difficult-to-treat or chronic medical conditions. These patient populations are particularly relevant for eHealth, for instance, due to their mobility limitations.Table 5 (continued) Medical condition Outcome measures Effectiveness and effects Outcome-specific effectiveness S14 Ljotsson et al.

[ 27] and a recent meta-analysis by Spijkerman et al. [ 28], which summarized the effects of mindfulness-based eHealth interventions. Fish et al. [ 27] as well as Spijkerman et al. [ 28] found positive effects of mindfulness-based eHealth interventions on anxiety and depression. Also, our findings support the positive effects of mindfulness-based eHealth interventions on well-being similar to Spijkerman et al. [ 28]. In contrast to our findings, Fish et al. [ 27] and Spijkerman et al. [ 28] also reported posi- tive effects of eHealth interventions on stress and mindfulness. This discrepancy might be explained by different study pop- ulations. Our review included studies with patients, whereas in the review of Fish et al. [ 27], the three studies with positive effects on stress were conducted in healthy students [ 52-54]. Similarly, the four studies with positive effects on mindfulness in the review by Fish et al. [ 27] were conducted in healthy students [ 54-56] or in patients with recurrent depression [ 57] and were therefore not included in our systematic review. Similarly, in the review by Spijkerman et al. [ 28] with a total of 15 included studies, the majority of studies on stress (7 of 9 studies) or mindfulness (6 of 10 studies) were conducted in healthy subjects. Compared to a face-to-face deliver y of interventions, eHealth interventions may have the disadvantage of neglecting the potential of the therapeutic a lliance, which is associated with larger treatment effects in psychological interven- tions [ 58,59]. Current research indicates that eHealth in- terventions with therapist involvement show comparable effects to face-to-face interventions [ 60-62], but eHealth interventions without therapist involvement have lower effects [ 63]. So far, more patients prefer a face-to-face delivery over internet de livery of an intervention [ 64], which might change in the near future. eHealth interventions have some advantages. First, eHealth interventions are low-threshold since the intervention can be accessed at home or on the move [ 26] and stigmatization due totheblaming forusing specific intervention might belowered [ 65]. Second, eHealth interventions can reach a lot ofpatients since eHealth interventions can be conceptualized without a dedicated therapist, which leads to a smaller limita- tion regarding attendance of the intervention [ 65]. The flexi- bility of such interventions is taken a step further with mHealth interventions, which use mobile devices to deliver an intervention [ 66]. Interestingly, only one study [ 43]d e l i v - ered the intervention through a mobile device and no study used an app-based intervention (i.e., delivery through a smartphone). Limitations This review has a number of limitations. First, we did not extract data on symptom reduction for each specific medical condition, since the treatment response might largely differ between health conditions. Nevertheless, such information might be of importance to medical specialists in order to esti- mate the effects of eHealth interventions for a specific medical condition. However, the advantage of our approach is that our predefined outcomes, such as general health and psychologi- cal well-being, might allow comparisons across medical conditions. Second, we looked at adherence using the number of drop- outs from time points of allocation to post-intervention assessment. More precise indicators for adherence might be the time spent using the eHealth intervention program or the completion rate of intervention modules. However, such information was only reported in a few studies [ 37, 40,42,47]. Third, mindfulness- and relaxation-based interventions are treatments which can be part of more comprehensive treat- ment approaches or being used as main intervention strategy. For our systematic review, we used a pragmatic way for the inclusion of studies: if the ratio of mindfulness or relaxation intervention strategies to the total number of intervention strat- egies was at least 1 to 5, we included the study. Therefore, we might have excluded studies for this systematic review withTable 6 Effectiveness of studies with an inactive or active control groupvs. inactive control vs. active control Total +o - +o - +/o/- General health 0 4 0 5 1 0 5/5/0 Depression or anxiety 1 3 0 3 2 0 4/5/0 Pain 1 3 0 2 2 0 3/5/0 Self-efficacy or self-care 2 2 0 1 0 0 3/2/0 Stress 0 0 0 0 2 0 0/2/0 Mindfulness 0 0 0 0 1 0 0/1/0 Study S2 [36] and S15 [49] were excluded since the eHealth intervention must be considered as control co ndition, which was compared to an active comparator with a more comprehensive intervention strategy +superior effectiveness of eHealth intervention, oequal effectiveness, Med. (2018) 25:1 -16 39related intervention strategies, but with a minor importance of mindfulness and relaxation in the overall program. The aforementioned systematic re views by Spijkerman et al. [28]a n dF i s he ta l .[ 27] summarize mindfulness-based eHealth interventions from a slightly different angle, and the included number of studies (Spijkerman N=1 5 ,F i s h N= 10, our review N= 17) and the content of the inter- ventions differ substantially. As an example, the review by Spijkerman et al. [ 28] included three studies [ 67-69] with an internet-delivered acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) [ 70] for patients with a medical condi- tion. These three studies were not included in the review by Fish et al. [ 27] or in our review. We did not include eHealth ACT studies per se since ACT is a form of be- havioral psychotherapy which incorporates only singular elements of mindfulness prac tices, for instance, cultivat- ing a non-judgmental presence example inte rvention is difficult and, in turn, a clear description of intervention strategies and their relevance for the intervention at a glance would be of help. Fourth, we summarized the effectiveness of mindfulness- and relaxation-based interventions and therefore included studies which combine various types of interventions, includ- ing mindfulness or relaxation. Hence, this summary provides information about mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth interventions in clinical relevant settings. However, due to the multitude of intervention types, a conclusion about active components of mindfulness- and relaxation-based interven- tions cannot be drawn and should be addressed in efficacy studies. Fifth, we did not include gray literature in this systematic review, which could lead to a biased summary of the effec- tiveness of eHealth studies due to publication bias. Recommendations for Future Research The results regarding the effectiveness of eHealth studies were heterogeneous, with some studies showing positive effects across a variety of outcomes and some studies showing no effect. This heterogeneity might be caused by differences in the treatment dose between studies. One part of the treatment dose is the practice of exercises by the patients. Meditation and relaxation interventions are most effective when the exer- cises are practiced regularly [ 72,73]. Therefore, future re- search should investigate adherence in greater detail and also possible ways of increasing adherence to an eHealth intervention. We also recommend a more standardized assessment of cost-effectiveness, which would allow a comprehensive eval- uation about healthcare benefits of this new technology com- pared to face-to-face interventions. Only five studies includedin this review estimated cost-effectiveness [ 35,41,45,46,51] with different assessments, preventing a comprehensive eval- uation of cost-effectiveness. The rationale to use eHealth in- terventions is also based in economic reasons. Therefore, rig- orous cost-effectiveness analyses of eHealth studies might be needed to convince stakeholders to consider eHealth interven- tions as an appropriate intervention strategy for medical care. As mentioned in the results, mindfulness- and relaxation- based eHealth studies often included oftentimes additional intervention strategies. The most common were cognitive and psychoeducation intervention strategies, which are in and of themselves effective intervention strategies for var- ious medical conditions [ 74]. This leads to the question of whether mindfulness and relaxation intervention strategies have an additional benefit in cognitive and psychoeducational interventions, which should be addressed in upcoming dis- mantling studies. Also, the comparison to the recent reviews by Fish et al. [ 27] and Spijkerman et al. [ 28]indicated that mindfulness-based eHealth interventions showed positive effects in stress and mindfulness in healthy subjects but not in patients with medical conditions. However, this difference might be the result of absent studies of patients with medical conditions: only two studies included in our review assessed stress [ 37,48] and mindfulness [ 36,42]. To determine whether patients with medical conditions similarly benefit in stress and mindfulness outcomes from mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth studies, such outcomes should be investigated in upcoming studies. If more studies about this topic are available, a formal meta- analysis can be conducted to explore moderators (e.g., dose) and biases (e.g., study quality). This systematic review was not able to summarize ev- idence from mHealth studies which contradicts the vast number of available mHealth apps. In 2015, more than 45,000 mHealth apps were published [ 75]. Therefore, fu- ture studies should also use mHealth technology and as- sess feasibility and effectiveness. Conclusion There is evidence that mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth interventions for me dical conditions can have positive effects on general h ealth, as well as depression and anxiety. Therefore, eHealth interventions can be rec- ommended as an addition to standard medical care, espe- cially if the medical condition is linked with high psycho- logical stress or burden and if patients 'access to face-to- face interventions is limited.

Smartphone apps are readily available and therefore seem promising to deliver distress-reducing interventions such as mindfulness and relaxation programs. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a mindfulness and relaxation app for cancer patients. We looked at characteristics of participating patients in a mobile health (mHealth) study, including adherence to the app intervention, predictors for adherence, and patients' feedback regarding the app. Methods: In this prospective observational study with a mixed-methods approach, cancer patients received a mindfulness and relaxation self-care app. Cancer patients were recruited online and through hospitals in Switzerland. We assessed self-reported measures (eg, quality of life, anxiety, depressive symptoms, openness to experience, resistance to change) at baseline, and the app gathered data on patients' practicing time. With 8 semistructured interviews, we obtained patients' feedback about the app and recommendations for improvements. We looked at 3 dimensions of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework (reach, adoption, and maintenance) and analyzed data for adherence for the first 10 weeks of the app intervention. We report descriptive statistics for patient characteristics and app use. For the prediction of adherence, we used Kaplan-Meier analyses with log-rank tests and a Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Data from 100 cancer patients (74 female) showed that 54 patients were using the app exercises continuously until week 10. In continuous app users, the median number of exercises per week dropped from 4 (interquartile range, IQR 1-7) at week 1 to a median of 2 (IQR 1-4) at week 10. Our analyses revealed 4 significant predictors for better adherence: female gender, higher openness to experience, higher resistance to change, and more depressive symptoms. Interviews revealed that the patients generally were satisfied with the app but also made suggestions on how to improve it. Conclusions: Our study indicates that a mindfulness and relaxation mHealth intervention for cancer patients is feasible with acceptable adherence and largely positive feedback from patients. Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register Mhealth Uhealth 2018 | vol. 6 | iss. 12 | e11271 | p. 1 https://mhealth.jmir.org/2018/12/e11271/ (page number not for et al JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH XSL\u00b7FO RenderX45Introduction Background Cancer is highly prevalent worldwide, with an estimated 14 million newly diagnosed patients per year [ 1]. According to the World Health Organization, cancer is the second leading cause of death, with an increasing economic impact over recent years [2]. For patients, the diagnosis of cancer and subsequent treatment (eg, radiation or chemotherapy) can cause high levels of distress [ 3,4]. About every second cancer patient has clinically relevant distress, with elevated levels of depression or anxiety [5]. However, psychological support of patients is often not implemented in standard medical care [ 6-8]. In addition, many patients neglect their distress and do not seek psychosocial support [ 9]. However, untreated distress can reduce quality of life as well as lower adherence with recommended medical care and, therefore, negatively affect patients' recovery [ 8,10]. Thus, a variety of treatments such as counseling and Mind Body Medicine (MBM) interventions have been suggested to reduce cancer patients' distress during initial care and rehabilitation [11-13]. MBM focuses on the interactions between psychological and biological processes and their impact on health [ 14,15] and has shown beneficial effects in reducing cancer patients' distress [13,16]. MBM usually combines a variety of interventions, such as exercise, Qigong, relaxation, and mindfulness meditation [14]. Some of these interventions, for example, mindfulness and relaxation, are also commonly used on their own and have been studied extensively with promising effects in both healthy and patient populations [ 15,17-20]. In addition, an increasing number of cancer patients are interested in or use mindfulness or relaxation interventions [ 21]. Regular practice is crucial for the effect of mindfulness and relaxation-based interventions, which can be difficult to achieve due to lack of motivation, time constraints, as well as limited access to interventions [ 22]. Further restrictions for regular practice and access-limiting factors include geographical distance, financial constraints, lack of treatment providers or lack of knowledge thereof [ 8,9,23]. For cancer patients, regular practice might additionally be hindered due to restrictions caused by cancer (eg, fatigue and nausea) and its comprehensive treatments. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions might overcome some of the restrictions of face-to-face interventions. The access to interventions can be easier due to a large and increasing number of smartphone owners [ 24]. In 2017, more than 32% of the world population and more than 60% of the population in Western Europe and North America owned a smartphone [ 25]. In addition, mHealth interventions have some specific advantages compared with face-to-face interventions. These advantages include easy and pervasive access to information (ie, psychoeducation), engaging audio and/or visual material, potential customization of the app according to client's preferences and needs, provision of regular feedback, reminders, and reduced perceived stigmatization due to potentially less therapist contact [ 24,26]. mHealth interventions can also be a good support for patients' self-care [ 26]. Such self-careinterventions can have beneficial effects on cancer patients' distress and quality of life [ 27] and can be implemented via an app using audio instructions. To date, mHealth interventions using a mindfulness or relaxation intervention strategy have been under-researched, with the focus of studies primarily on Web-based electronic Health (eHealth) interventions [ 28]. For eHealth interventions, studies indicate that mindfulness- and relaxation-based interventions can have beneficial effects on health outcomes in various populations, including cancer patients [ 28-30]. Beneficial effects of eHealth were reported for stress, well-being, anxiety, depression, and mindfulness. The majority of available primary studies in these reviews focused on eHealth interventions, with a partial emphasis on Web-based patient-therapist interactions. However, less is known about the feasibility and effectiveness of mHealth interventions, and certain disadvantages (eg, technical problems, concerns about data security) are well known [ 26]. Eysenbach [31] coined the term \"law of attrition, \" which emphasizes that early and rapid attrition rates are an inherent problem in technology-delivered interventions. Especially in self-care interventions with regular exercises, good adherence itself often becomes an intervention goal. Although recent eHealth studies report acceptable rates of adherence (eg, 60% completed 4 or more out of 6 modules [ 32] and 71% practiced more than 50% of the days during 8 weeks [ 33]), little is known about the adherence to mindfulness and relaxation mHealth programs for cancer patients. Therefore, when setting up a self-care mHealth intervention, it is important to know which factors might influence the patient adherence. Objective The aim of this mHealth study, then, was to evaluate the feasibility of a mindfulness and relaxation app for cancer patients and its impact on health outcomes according to the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework [ 34]. In this analysis, we looked at the characteristics of patients who participated in this mHealth study, adherence and predictors for adherence, as well as patients' feedback regarding the mHealth intervention from interviews. Methods Study Design We performed a prospective observational study using a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data consisted of 4 paper-and-pencil questionnaires sent to cancer patients at baseline, weeks 4, 10, and 20. Qualitative data consisted of semistructured interviews with 8 cancer patients. Corresponding to the principles of theoretical sampling [ 35], we recruited the interviewees based on the sample distributions of gender and intervention dropouts versus continuous app users. We conducted individual qualitative interviews over the telephone with these patients; selecting 4 of them who used the app on a regular basis and 4 who did not use the app regularly. We conducted qualitative interviews with these patients; 4 of them used the app on a regular basis and 4 did not use the app regularly. This study was guided by the RE-AIM evaluation framework [ 34], which consists of the following 5 dimensions: JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2018 | vol. 6 | iss. 12 | e11271 | p. 2 https://mhealth.jmir.org/2018/12/e11271/ (page number not for et al JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH XSL\u00b7FO RenderX46reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. For this analysis, we focused on 3 dimensions, namely reach, adoption, and maintenance during the first 10 weeks of the intervention. The dimensions effectiveness and implementation as well as results about the entire 20 weeks will be reported in an upcoming paper. The cantonal ethics committee granted ethical approval for the study (BASEC-Nr. 2016-00258) in April 2016, and the study was positively audited within the regular ICH-GCP audit of the University Hospital Zurich in August 2016. We registered the study in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00010481). Eligibility Criteria We included female and male cancer patients (18 years or older) with any cancer diagnosis at any stage of cancer, who owned either an iOS- or Android-based smartphone with at least a weekly connection to the internet. We excluded patients if they had suicidal ideation or insufficient German language skills. Furthermore, patients who intended to move to another country and patients with insufficient knowledge on how to use a smartphone were excluded. Recruitment We recruited cancer patients in 2 different settings: (1) cancer patients who participated in a supportive MBM treatment (either as individual session or as a 10-week group treatment) or (2) cancer patients without an MBM treatment. For setting 1, cancer patients were recruited at the Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University Hospital Zurich (ICI). All available cancer patients in an MBM group treatment (between June 2016 and December 2017; 12 groups with a total of 81 patients) were invited at the third session of the course to participate in the study. Therefore, enrolled patients from setting 1 were using the app partially in parallel to the MBM group treatment. In addition, we asked the health professionals of the ICI to distribute leaflets during individual MBM consultations with cancer patients. For setting 2, patients were recruited through the University Hospital Zurich (ICI, cancer center, Department of Radiotherapy, and University Hospital Facebook page), University Hospital Basel, and the Cantonal Hospital Aarau. Cancer patients were informed of the study using leaflets in the waiting areas or during consultations. In addition, we informed cancer patients through the Swiss Cancer League via leaflets and their Facebook page, as well as through the Cancer League of Zurich. Interested patients initially contacted a researcher at the ICI by phone or email and made an appointment for a 10-min telephone screening interview. During the screening interview, the researcher explained the study and assessed the eligibility of the patient. In addition, the researcher recommended that the patient carry out 1 of the 3 exercises of the app at least once a day on 5 different days per week during the 20-week intervention. However, the researcher also stated that patients were free to choose when, where, and how often they practiced. After the researcher provided all information and if the patient met the eligibility criteria, the researcher asked for contact details of the patient. Subsequently, the patient received thewritten study information with the informed consent form, as well as the first questionnaire by mail. We sent an email to every included patient with a code to activate the app. Thereafter, patients were able to use the app free of charge. The date of the code distribution was considered as the start of the intervention for each patient. No other verbal contact between the researcher and the patients took place after inclusion of patients. Intervention The mindfulness and relaxation app comprised 2 main features: (1) mindfulness and relaxation exercises guided by audio instructions and (2) a notification feature. The first feature of the app contained 3 exercises and was the main component of the app. The exercises were mindfulness meditation, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation audio files with a duration of about 15 min each. Every exercise was guided by a narrator with either a male or female voice. The second feature of the app was a notification feature, which reminded the patient to practice daily. The patient could set the time of notification according to individual preferences. The reminder to practice popped up as a push notification on the mobile device every day at the time set by the patient. The concept of the app built on previously developed relaxation study apps of an affiliated group [ 36], which were designed for patients with chronic low back pain (Relaxback) and chronic neck pain (Relaxneck).The app was developed by the software company Smart Mobile Factory GmbH (Berlin, Germany). After thorough testing, the app was released in June 2016 on the Apple iTunes Store and on the Google Play Store for Android devices. After the release, the content of the app was not changed. Screenshots of the app are available in Multimedia Appendices 1 and 2. Outcomes Reach For the dimension reach, we looked into which and how many cancer patients participated in the study. We present baseline characteristics to describe participating patients: type of cancer, status of cancer treatment, sociodemographic data (gender, age, and highest education), distress (Distress-Thermometer [ 37,38]), quality of life (FACT-G, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [ 39]), and anxiety and depression (HADS, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [ 40]). The Distress-Thermometer consists of 1 item with a scale from 0 to 10 and assesses experienced distress in the past week. A score between 5 or higher is considered as clinically relevant distress [ 41]. The FACT-G consists of 27 items, which assess the subscales: item is rated on a 5-point scale (0-4), resulting in a score range of 0 to 108, with a higher score indicating a better quality of life. The HADS consists of 14 items, with 7 items for each subscale, that is, anxiety (Cronbach alpha=.787) and depression (Cronbach alpha=.667). Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), leading to a maximum score of 21 for each subscale. A score between 0 and 7 is considered normal, whereas JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2018 | vol. 6 | iss. 12 | e11271 | p. 3 https://mhealth.jmir.org/2018/12/e11271/ (page number not for et al JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH XSL\u00b7FO RenderX47a score between 8 and 11 is considered as borderline, and a score above 11 as caseness. Adoption For the dimension adoption, we looked at indicators of patients' adoption of the app intervention into their regular life, adherence, and information about barriers and facilitators for regular use. For this purpose, we analyzed the use of the app during the first 10 weeks. We derived app use data from tracking the practicing time with the audios (start and end time and type of exercise used). This information was visible only for the research team (as an XML log file through the backend) and was not displayed to users. In addition, we analyzed results from interviews with patients regarding their adoption of the app intervention. As a first indicator for app intervention adoption, we report the number of completed app exercises per week. We considered an exercise as completed if the patient used the exercise for at least 10 min (out of 15 min). As a second indicator, we report the number of intervention dropouts versus number of continuous app users per week. Intervention dropouts were defined as enrolled patients who never completed an exercise or did not complete an exercise during 4 consecutive weeks after initial practice. A patient counted as an intervention dropout in the first of the 4 weeks, in which he or she did not complete any exercise. According to our definition, a patient who never completed an exercise is an intervention dropout at week 1. Patients not classified as intervention dropouts were defined as continuous app users. Consequently, continuous app use was defined as at least weekly use of 1 or more app exercises. We also report results from 8 semistructured patient interviews, in which we inquired about patients' general impression regarding the app, app usage, and suggestions for improvements (for interview guideline, see Multimedia Appendix 3 ). Maintenance For the dimension maintenance, we looked into predictors for continuous app use. First, we assumed that patients with higher openness to experience are more often continuous app users. Second, we assumed that patients with higher resistance to change are less often continuous app users. In addition, we tested in explorative analyses if quality of life (FACT-G), anxiety (HADS anxiety), depression (HADS depression) at baseline and sociodemographic data (gender and age), as well as setting are associated with continuous app use. During the interviews, we also explored possible reasons for continuous app use and intervention dropout. We measured openness to experience with the respective subscale of the NEO 5-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI [ 42]) using the 5-item short version (Cronbach alpha=.755). Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0-4), leading to a score with a range from 0 to 20. A higher score indicates greater openness to experience. We also used the Resistance to Change (RTC) Scale [43], which consists of 17 items (Cronbach alpha=.839). Each item is rated on a 6-point scale (1-6), resulting in a score with a range from 17 to 102. A higher score indicates greater resistance to change.Sample Size In this feasibility study, the sample size is an outcome in itself (ie, dimension reach in the evaluation framework). Therefore, we did not perform an a priori sample size calculation, but the aim was to recruit about 100 patients to conduct explorative analyses about the feasibility of the app with sufficient precision. Data Analysis Quantitative Data Trained researchers entered data from printed case report forms using REDCap electronic data capture tools [ 44] hosted at the University Hospital Zurich. Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY , USA) [ 45]. For the reach analyses, we used descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages for categorical and dichotomous variables, mean and SD for continuous variables) for baseline data on sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, and education), health status (type of cancer, status of cancer treatment, FACT-G, HADS, and Distress-Thermometer), and the setting of the enrolled patients. For the adoption analyses, we used boxplots to report median and interquartile range (IQR) of the number of completed exercises per week (week 1 to 10) for all enrolled patients, as well as for continuous app users during the 10-week intervention. In addition, we used a Kaplan-Meier plot to visualize the number of dropouts per week. For the maintenance analyses, we used Kaplan-Meier analyses with a log-rank test to compare continuous app users (ie, reversed rate of attrition) according to different baseline variables. As predictors, we used the following categorical variables: gender, setting, age groups (18-40, 41-55, 56+), high versus low well-being (FACT-G median split at 76.83), high versus low openness to experience (NEO-FFI-O median split at 17.00), high versus low resistance to change (RTC median split at 51.00), normal versus suggestive or higher anxiety or depression (HADS anxiety or depression scores of 0-7 vs 8 or higher). Subsequently, we performed a Cox proportional hazards regression with all significant predictors in the log-rank test in the Kaplan-Meier analyses. For missing data, we used multiple imputation to conduct the Cox proportional hazards regression with a full dataset. We carried out imputations for the sum scores of FACT-G, as missing single items are already considered in the calculation of FACT-G sum scores (FACT-G sum scores are not calculated if there are more than 50% items missing in a subscale). For HADS, NEO-FFI-O, and RTC, we imputed all items with 1 or more missing values. For all other analyses (ie, descriptive analyses for the dimensions reach and adoption, Kaplan-Meier analyses for the dimension maintenance), we used complete datasets. Qualitative Data For the interview analyses about the adoption and maintenance of the intervention, we transcribed the recorded interviews verbatim and used thematic coding for structuring the interviews using MAXQDA 11 (VERBI Software, Berlin, Germany). Thereafter, we used content analysis according to Mayring [ 46].

All of the 118 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria and received the informed consent form. By the end of December 2017, 100 patients signed and returned the informed consent form and were enrolled in the study (see Figure 1 ). Baseline characteristics of all enrolled patients (N=100), as well as of continuous app users (54/100, 54%) and intervention dropouts (46/100, 46%) are presented in Table 1 . The majorityof patients (83/100, 83%) were recruited independent of the MBM treatment (setting 2). Patients were 74% (74/100) female, and the mean age of all patients was 53.24 (SD 11.55) with a range of 23 to 84 years. The most common diagnosis was breast cancer (39/100, 39%). The majority of participants had completed higher education, whereas 41% (41/100) had completed secondary education and 33% (33/100) had obtained a university degree. The Distress-Thermometer indicated that the enrolled patients reported, on average, elevated and clinically relevant distress levels. The HADS scores indicated that the enrolled patients had, on average, normal scores of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Continuous app users and intervention dropouts differed in their gender, with 85% (46/85) female continuous app users versus 61% (28/61) female intervention dropouts. Figure 1. Patient flowchart.

Adoption The number of app exercises completed within the first 10 weeks of the intervention across all patients is presented in Figure 2 . During the first week, the median of completed exercises was at 2 with an IQR of 0 to 6, that is, 50% of patients completed 2 or more exercises per week. Over the course of 10 weeks, the median dropped to 0 with an IQR of 0 to 2.5. The median of app exercises completed across the first 10 weeks of the intervention for continuous app users is presented in Figure 3 . During the first week, the median of completedexercises was 4 (IQR 1-7) and dropped down to a median of 2 (IQR 1-4) in week 10. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve of continuous app users is presented in Figure 4 . During the first week, 14/100 (14%) patients never started or stopped using the app exercises on a regular basis and were categorized at week 1 as intervention dropouts. At the end of the intervention, 54/100 (54%) patients were using the app exercises on a regular basis, and between week 1 and week 10, the decline can be regarded as continuous without any specific sensitive weeks to drop out.

Kaplan-Meier survival curve of all enrolled patients (N=100) over 10 weeks. Maintenance The Kaplan-Meier plots for intervention dropouts by gender, setting, age groups, and well-being are presented in Figure 5 . The Kaplan-Meier plots for intervention dropouts by openness to experience, resistance to change, anxiety, and depression are presented in Figure 6 . Log-rank tests indicated 4 significant predictors for continuous app users, namely gender, openness to experience, resistance to change, and depression. At week 10, 62% (46/74) of the female patients were still using the app continuously, whereas only 31% (8/26) of the male patients were using the app continuously. Therefore, females had a better adherence to use the app continuously over time than men ( P=.005). In the high openness to experience group (NEO-FFI-O), 67% (28/42) of patients still used the app continuously through week 10. In the NEO-FFI-O low openness group, 44% (24/54) used the app continuously through week 10. Thus, patients with high openness to experience had a better adherence than patients with low openness to experience over time ( P=.044). In patients with normal HADS depression values, only 49% (39/80) used the app exercises continuously compared with 75% in the HADS suggestive or higher In patients with high RTC, 65% (28/43) used the app exercises continuously, but in the low RTC group, only 44% (23/52)of patients used the app exercises continuously through week 10. Therefore, patients in the high RTC group had a better adherence in continuous app use ( P=.03). For the factors setting, age groups, well-being (FACT-G), anxiety (HADS anxiety), log-rank tests did not result in significant group differences. The 4 significant factors of the univariate log-rank test (gender, NEO-FFI-O, RTC, HADS depression) for the prediction of continuous app users went into the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. The multivariate analysis indicated solely gender as an independent factor for continuous app use, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.16 (95% CI 1.09 to 4.27), with a higher chance for attrition in male cancer patients ( P=.01). The 3 other factors (NEO-FFI-O, RTC, and HADS depression) did not contribute significantly in this analysis after controlling for gender: high openness to experience was associated with lower odds for attrition (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04; P=.30); high RTC with lower odds for attrition (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.01; P=.17); more depressive symptoms lower odds vol. 6 | iss. 12 | e11271 | p. 8 https://mhealth.jmir.org/2018/12/e11271/ (page number not for AND UHEALTH XSL\u00b7FO RenderX52Figure 5.

Interviews were conducted between October 2016 and April 2017 and lasted on average 23 min. The qualitative analysis of the interviews yielded 4 themes which were as follows: (1) general feedback regarding the app, (2) suggestions for improvement, (3) personal preferences, and (4) reasons for app use and nonuse. General feedback about the app was predominantly positive. The interviewed patients appreciated the simplicity of the app and the easy-to-use interface. One patient stated the following regarding the design: It was great. It was very simple, very self-explanatory. You didn't need to look around a lot and it also looked good. Yes, in any case, well designed. [Female, 35 years old] Two patients who attended an MBM course evaluated the app as a good addition to the face-to-face MBM course. The feedback about the number of exercises was mixed: Some patients regarded the implemented 3 exercises as sufficient, whereas others would welcome a larger selection of exercises. Most patients interviewed used and appreciated the reminder in the app. Some patients mentioned that they would have been less compliant without the reminders and, therefore, perceived the reminder as helpful for a continuous app use. For instance, 1 patient stated the following: Yes, [the reminder function] was very good. A couple of times this was very good. I would have forgotten it a couple of times, if I wouldn't have had this reminder. [Female, 63 years old] Patients offered various suggestions for improvement. Several patients mentioned that they would like exercises with background music. One patient explained it as follows: I think it is also precisely the high art of meditation or relaxation that you can relax as much as possible while not falling asleep. Some need chimes, while others need absolute silence to be able to do this. And I realize that when it is absolutely silent, either I fall asleep or I start to contemplate. When I have some music or chimes, it works better for me personally. [Female, 42 years old] As stated above, some patients also would welcome a larger variety of exercises (eg, autogenic training) or variations in the duration of exercises. Another patient stated also that the recordings of the exercises were too clean (ie, no noises from breathing), as the exercises were recorded in a studio. This led to the patient being startled when the narrator continued with the instruction after a moment of silence. One patient mentioned she did not set up the reminder during the first time she used the app and later forgot about the reminder function. Therefore, this patient suggested that the reminder function could be placed more prominently in the app instead of the options menu. The interviewer also inquired if the patients would appreciate a feedback system in the form of exercise statistics. The majority of interviewed patients had the opinion that such a feature wouldnot be helpful. Some patients stated that statistics might even be stressful, as it might lead to a guilty conscience if the patient is not using the exercises as often as planned. One patient suggested that statistics might be added to the app as an optional feature. Only 2 patients thought that such a feature might be helpful. The third topic that emerged from the qualitative analysis was personal preferences. Most interviewed patients mentioned that they developed some form of preference regarding the app use (eg, preference for a specific exercise, gender of narrator, time of day when using the exercises) during the intervention while they were trying out what suits them best. One patient stated the following: Right at the beginning I tried [to do the exercises] before I went to bed. But I'm not a fan of having my cellphone, when I fall asleep, next to my head for the entire night. For this reason I changed it to lunchtime. [Female, 31 years old] The fourth topic that emerged from the qualitative analysis involved reasons for app use and nonuse. As a reason for using the app, patients mentioned that the exercises were beneficial and helped them to relax. One patient stated the following: [The app exercises] have been good for me. I will continue to do my exercises. [...] I believe I benefit [from the exercises]. It also makes you happy. [Female, 63 years old] As reasons for nonuse, 3 patients mentioned that they had previous experience with meditation or relaxation exercises. Therefore, these patients were already used to exercise routines, which differed from the instructions or the manner in general of the app exercises. One of these patients mentioned that she had learned and was used to silent meditation, and therefore the guided exercises in the app were more distracting than helpful to her. Another patient mentioned that she had experience in guided meditation and relaxation exercises, which differed linguistically and in form of conduct compared with the app exercises. This patient mentioned that she was unable to get used to these new exercises and was repeatedly comparing the app exercises with the already known exercises. Therefore, this patient could not relax as intended during the app exercises. A third patient mentioned that she was used to exercises with more guidance and described her experience with the app as follows: Maybe because [the instructions in the app exercises] were different from what I was used to do by myself, where [the exercise] was guided the entire time. [...] I did consider it more bothersome that...[...] your thoughts drift away because you get the feeling that [the exercise] should continue. [Female, 49 years old] As a further reason for nonuse, 1 patient mentioned that she was distracted by the choice of words and expressions in the app exercises. This patient mentioned that she had studied linguistics and had learned to closely scrutinize language. This caused her to be distracted during the app exercises, which is why she stopped using the app. Another patient mentioned that she suffered from cancer-related fatigue and that she was not able to complete an exercise when she was unduly fatigued.

Discussion Summary of Findings mHealth interventions with the aim of reducing distress in cancer patients seem promising due to easy access and potential positive effects for patients. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies looking in detail at characteristics of users, adherence rates, and possible predictors for adherence in a mindfulness and relaxation mHealth study for cancer patients. This feasibility study showed that adherence to the mHealth intervention during the first 10 weeks was acceptable, with 54% of patients still using the app regularly in week 10 with a median of completed exercises ranging from 2 to 4 per week. Therefore, our study does not confirm the concern that adherence in mHealth interventions is in general poor, which would limit treatment implementation. The adherence of our patients is also comparable with recent research on adherence to e- and mHealth interventions for cancer patients [ 32,33]. A study by Beatty el al [32] reported that 60% of cancer patients completed 4 or more modules of an eHealth intervention with 6 modules, which aimed at reducing distress in cancer patients. A mindfulness app study for cancer patients and caregivers [ 33] reported that 71% of the participants practiced with the app on more than half of the days throughout 8 weeks. The uptake of our intervention was good, with 117 screened and eligible patients, of whom 100 patients returned the informed consent form. In addition, 74%, mainly female, patients enrolled in this study, which is consistent with characteristics of mHealth users in other studies with 84% female patients [ 47] and 54% female patients [ 48]. The mean age of participating patients was 53 years; this is comparable with other face-to-face mindfulness and relaxation interventions [49] or Web-based interventions for cancer patients [ 32]. The interviews showed that the patients were satisfied with the app in general. However, several and sometimes contradictory suggestions were made for improving the app, such as less versus more guidance in the exercises and larger variety in exercises versus the notion that 3 exercises are sufficient. Predictors for Adherence Of a total of 8 investigated predictors for continuous app use, 4 turned out to be statistically significant. The strongest predictor was gender, with higher adherence in female cancer patients. Beyond the higher interest of female cancer patients to participate in this mindfulness and relaxation mHealth study, they were also more adherent after starting with the exercises. This result is in line with a study by Ruland et al [ 50], in which an analysis of use patterns in an eHealth intervention to support cancer patients' illness management revealed that female patients used the system almost twice as often as male patients. However, a study by Duman-Lubberding et al [ 51] investigated the feasibility of a Web-based self-management app and did not find a gender difference in adherence. Therefore, it seems likely that the type of intervention (eg, relaxation and mindfulness meditation) might be relevant for gender differencesin adherence, which is also in line with studies about the use of complementary and alternative medicine, where users tend to be more often female [ 52,53]. A second predictor for continuous app use was the personality trait openness to experience, whereby higher openness to experience predicted more continuous app use. This result fits with previous research, which has shown that openness to experience predicts the use of complementary and alternative medicine, including mindfulness and relaxation [ 54,55]. Our study confirms that higher openness to experience still predicts the adherence to a mindfulness and relaxation intervention, even if the intervention is delivered through an app. A third predictor for continuous app use was a higher score in resistance to change. This finding is contrary to our hypothesis, as we assumed that higher resistance to change would be associated with less adherence as the intervention promotes a new health behavior. However, our results indicate the opposite. When a patient has decided to follow a new exercise routine (ie, mindfulness and relaxation mHealth intervention), a higher resistance to change actually promotes continuous app use. To our knowledge, the Resistance to Change Scale had not previously been used to predict adherence to mHealth interventions for cancer patients. However, a study conducted in China by Deng et al [ 56] showed that resistance to change is negatively related to the intention to use mHealth services. Another study showed that resistance to change is negatively related to perceived usefulness of mHealth in elderly people in China [ 57]. Therefore, on the one hand, resistance to change might be a barrier for the uptake of an mHealth intervention, but on the other, it might be supportive in adhering to a new commitment, such as the regular use of a mindfulness and relaxation app. A fourth predictor for continuous app use was higher depressive symptoms. This finding is surprising, as depressive symptoms are associated with decreased motivation and reduced activity [58]. In line with these corollaries, a study investigating a mindfulness-based cancer recovery program [ 49] reported a negative correlation of depressive symptoms and practicing time of yoga at home. Another study [ 59] reported that moderate to severe depressive symptoms predicted lower adherence to adjuvant cancer therapies. However, a study by B\u00f8r\u00f8sund et al [60] found that high levels of depression were associated with high use of components of a Web-based illness management program in breast cancer patients. As depressed patients are oftentimes troubled with motivational deficits and face difficulties to stay active, the development of effective interventions with a good adherence in depressed patients is highly relevant. Our study indicates that mindfulness and relaxation mHealth interventions seem a feasible tool as supportive interventions for cancer patients with elevated depressive symptoms. This finding might also indicate that some patients adhere better to mindfulness and relaxation (ie, patients with higher depressive symptoms), whereas other patient groups with lower levels of distress are not in need of such interventions or might prefer other intervention types. JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2018 | vol. 6 | iss. 12 | e11271 | p. 11 https://mhealth.jmir.org/2018/12/e11271/ (page number not for et al JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH XSL\u00b7FO RenderX55Limitations This study has some limitations. First, the number of potentially interested patients for this intervention could not be assessed. Therefore, we were not able to calculate the rate of the total number of eligible cancer patients compared with the number of cancer patients with interest in a mindfulness and relaxation mHealth intervention. Second, for our definition of continuous app, we had no empirical data because the necessary dose for clinically significant improvements is still unclear for this kind of mHealth intervention. Instead, we opted for a clinical and rational justification, in which the term \"continuous\" use was operationalized as an at least weekly use of 1 or more app exercises. Third, the use of generated categories for age and the median split for other variables as predictors can be challenged. For age, we chose 3 age categories that represent patients of younger (18-40), middle (41-55), and older (56 plus) age. The use of median split variables has been critically discussed in the literature (see eg, Iacobucci et al [ 61]), with a major critique being the loss of information. In our case, the loss of information can be justified with the illustrative capacity of Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the following use of a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. Fourth, as the sample size was an outcome in itself, we did not perform an a priori sample size calculation. With a sample size (N) of 100, we had a power of 0.63 in the Cox proportional hazards regression for the main effect (OR 2.16) of gender as a predictor. For a power of 0.8, a sample size (N) of 150 would be necessary. Conclusions and Future Research The acceptable adherence to the intervention and the generally positive feedback by patients indicate that this app interventionis feasible. Suggestions for improvement by patients indicate that patients' needs are heterogeneous, which should be taken into account when developing other mHealth interventions. Due to the acceptable adherence and positive feedback by cancer patients, mindfulness and relaxation mHealth interventions might be promising supportive interventions, also for cancer patients with elevated depressive symptoms. To further prove the importance of mindfulness and relaxation mHealth interventions for cancer patients, future research needs to investigate their effectiveness. As the dose potentially influences the effectiveness of mindfulness and relaxation interventions, future research should also look into dose-response relationships between the time spent exercising with the app and health outcomes. Knowledge of such a dose-response relationship could be of use to guide subsequent studies regarding intervention duration and practice recommendation for patients. This study suggests that variability across patients in weekly app use is large. About half of the patients used the app exercises continuously over 10 weeks and therefore adhered to the intervention. These interindividual differences in the use of app exercises underline the importance to take adherence into account when analyzing effectiveness data. Furthermore, these interindividual differences on adherence bring up the question if mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth interventions are better suited for specific patient groups (eg females, patients with higher depressive symptoms). In turn, male patients or patients with less distress might not be in need of such interventions or might require additional motivational interventions.

Therefore, a variety of supportive nonpharmacological treatments have been suggested to reduce distress in patients with cancer. However, not all patients use these interventions because of limited access or lack of awareness. To overcome these barriers, mobile health may be a promising way to deliver the respective supportive treatments. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects and implementation of a mindfulness and relaxation app intervention for patients with cancer as well as patients' adherence to such an intervention. Methods: In this observational feasibility study with a mixed methods approach, patients with cancer were recruited through the web and through hospitals in Switzerland. All enrolled patients received access to a mindfulness and relaxation app. Patients completed self-reported outcomes (general health, health-related quality of life, anxiety, depression, distress, mindfulness, and fear of progression) at baseline and at weeks 4, 10, and 20. The frequency of app exercise usage was gathered directly through the app to assess the adherence of patients. In addition, we conducted interviews with 5 health professionals for their thoughts on the implementation of the app intervention in standard medical care. We analyzed patients'self-reported outcomes using linear mixed models (LMMs) and qualitative data with content analysis. Results: A total of 100 patients with cancer (74 female) with a mean age of 53.2 years (SD 11.6) participated in the study, of which 25 patients used the app regularly until week 20. LMM analyses revealed improvements in anxiety ( P=.04), distress (P<.001), fatigue ( ( P=.03), and mindfulness ( P<.001) over the course of 20 weeks. Further LMM analyses revealed a larger improvement in distress ( P<.001), a moderate improvement in anxiety ( P=.001), and a larger improvement in depression ( P=.03) in patients with high levels of symptoms at baseline in the respective domains. The interviews revealed that the health professionals perceived the app as a helpful addition to standard care. They also made suggestions for improvements, which could facilitate the implementation of and adherence to such an app. Conclusions: This study indicates that a mindfulness and relaxation app for patients with cancer can be a feasible and effective way to deliver a self-care intervention, especially for highly distressed patients. Future studies should investigate if the appeal of the app can be increased with more content, and the effectiveness of such an intervention needs to be tested in a randomized controlled trial.

However, adequate psychological support for patients with cancer is often lacking in standard medical care [ 5,6]. Therefore, a variety of supportive treatments have been suggested to reduce distress in patients with cancer, such as mind-body medicine (MBM) [ 7]. MBM combines various effective treatments such as mindfulness meditation, relaxation, yoga, and tai chi [ 7,8]. Such MBM treatments can have beneficial effects on cancer-related symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance [ 9-11]. Furthermore, MBM treatments can have beneficial effects on the quality of life of patients with cancer [ 12-14]. These treatments can be provided through guided MBM programs for patients with cancer, where the patients learn various exercises (eg, physical exercises, relaxation, and stress reduction) and are encouraged to practice these newly learned exercises at home [ 15,16]. However, the uptake of supportive treatments in distressed patients with cancer is moderate [ 17]. Barriers for the uptake of such treatments include stigmatization, unawareness of such interventions, or limited access [ 18,19]. This is problematic because untreated, elevated levels of distress can lead to additional negative effects, such as reduced quality of life, daily functioning, and lower adherence to medical treatment [ 20,21]. Access can be restricted, for instance, because of geographical distance, lack of treatment providers or knowledge thereof, and financial constraints [ 22-24]. To overcome these limitations in access, eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been proposed. eHealth is defined more broadly as the delivery of health services or information through the internet and related technologies [ 25], whereas mHealth uses mobile technologies such as smartphones for the delivery of health services [ 26]. So far, research indicates that eHealth interventions with mindfulness or relaxation components can have beneficial effects on health outcomes in various patient populations [27-29]. However, eHealth studies focusing on patients with cancer have shown inconsistent results [ 30,31]. Nonetheless, eHealth interventions seem promising because they can have positive effects on the well-being of patients with cancer [ 31]. Although mHealth interventions have some advantages over web-based eHealth interventions (eg, more flexible access because of mobility, the possibility of reaching a large number of patients because of the large popularity of smartphones), little is known about the best practices for the implementation of mHealth interventions [ 32,33]. In addition, mHealth research so far indicates that the adoption of mHealth interventions by health professionals and patients can be inhibited by various factors, such as perceived usefulness and ease of use [ 34,35]. Furthermore, there is a lack of mHealth studies with mindfulness or relaxation-based interventions [ 27]. Therefore, we developed a research app to conduct a feasibility study of a mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth intervention for patients with cancer [ 36]. The app included 3 exercises, namely, mindfulness meditation, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation.Objectives The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of this mHealth intervention using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) evaluation framework, which was developed for the evaluation of public health interventions [ 37]. Although the results for the reach of the dimensions, adoption over the course of 10 weeks, and maintenance were published elsewhere [ 36], the present analyses focus on the 3 dimensions of effectiveness, adoption, and implementation over the course of 20 weeks to assess the pre-post effects of the app on a variety of health outcomes and adherence to the app intervention. In doing so, we investigate whether such an app may be a beneficial, supportive care tool for patients with cancer. Methods Study Design For this feasibility study, we used a mixed methods approach. For quantitative data, we assessed 4 paper-and-pencil questionnaires that were sent to patients with cancer at baseline and at weeks 4, 10, and 20. Demographics and patient characteristics were assessed at baseline, and health outcomes (physical, mental, and social health, health-related quality of life, anxiety, depression, distress, mindfulness, and fear of progression) were assessed over the 4 time points. Qualitative data consisted of semistructured interviews with 5 health professionals. In those interviews, we inquired about health professionals' perspectives on a mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth intervention for patients with cancer and its implementation in standard medical care. To receive feedback from different health professionals, we conducted 2 face-to-face group interviews (1 interview with 2 nursing experts and the second interview with 2 psychologists providing MBM treatment for patients with cancer) and 1 individual interview with an oncologist. All interviewees received access to the app before the interview and could test the app. The interviewer also demonstrated the app and its content to the interviewees before the interview started. To assess the feasibility of our mHealth intervention, we used the RE-AIM implementation science framework [ 37]. Ethical approval for the study was granted in April 2016 by the cantonal ethics committee Zurich (BASEC-Nr. 2016-00258), and we registered the study in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00010481). Participants Patients were eligible if they (1) had any cancer diagnosis at any stage of cancer, (2) were aged 18 years or older, and (3) owned either an iPhone (Apple Inc). or an Android-based smartphone with at least a weekly connection to the internet. Patients were excluded if they had suicidal ideation or insufficient German language skills, if they intended to move to another country, or if they had insufficient knowledge on how to use a smartphone. The patient recruitment process is described in detail elsewhere [ 36]. For the interviews with health professionals, we invited experts (an oncologist, nursing experts, JMIR Cancer 2021 | vol. 7 | iss. 1 | e16785 | p. 2 https://cancer.jmir.org/2021/1/e16785 (page number not for citation purposes)Mikolasek et al JMIR CANCER XSL\u00b7FO RenderX63and psychologists) from the University Hospital Zurich, who provide health care for patients with cancer. App Intervention All enrolled patients received the mindfulness and relaxation app, which was specifically developed for this study and only available for patients participating in the study. The app could be downloaded in the Apple iTunes store and Google Play Store for Android devices and accessed with a code, which was provided to the patients after study inclusion. The app offered 3 exercises: mindfulness meditation, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation. The exercises were included in the app as audio files with a duration of approximately 15 minutes each, and the patients could choose between a female or male narrator. Patients were free to choose which exercises they wanted to use and how often they wanted to practice. However, we recommended to the patients to use an exercise of their choice on a daily basis, ideally 5 times per week. To help patients practice regularly, the app included an optional notification feature that patients could set up to receive a daily push notification on the mobile device, reminding them to practice at an individually set time. Information about the use of exercises (exercise type, date, and start and end times) was saved in the backend and was only accessible to the researchers as an XML log file. More information about the app is presented in a previously published paper [ 36]. Outcomes Effects As we conducted a single-arm study without a control group, we were not able to assess the effectiveness of the app intervention. Therefore, for the RE-AIM dimension effectiveness, we looked into pre-post effects in a variety of health outcomes relevant to patients with cancer. We assessed physical, mental, and social health using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS 29) [38]. PROMIS 29 is a 29-item scale assessing health domains: physical function (Cronbach =.81), =.85), anxiety (Cronbach =.81), ability to participate in social roles and activities (Cronbach =.88), and sleep disturbance (Cronbach =.86) with 4 items, each on a 5-point scale, and pain intensity with a single item on a 10-point numeric rating scale. For the assessment of health-related quality of life for patients with cancer, we administered the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap y\u2014General (FACT-G) [ 39,40]. measured with 27 items on a 5-point scale. A higher score indicates a better quality of life. For the assessment of distress, we administered the Distress Thermometer [ 41]. The Distress Thermometer is a numeric rating scale, ranging from 0 to 10. A score of 5 or higher is considered to indicate clinically relevant distress [ 42].For the assessment of mindfulness, we administered the short version of the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) [ 43]. The FMI (Cronbach =.87) assesses mindfulness with 14 items on a 4-point scale, with a higher score indicating higher mindfulness. We measured anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS assesses 7 items for the subscales =.79) and depression (Cronbach =.67) on a 4-point scale, with a maximum score of 21 for each subscale. A score of up to 7 is considered normal, a score between 8 and 11 is considered borderline, and a score above 11 is considered caseness [ 44]. For the assessment of fear of progression, we administered the Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form (FoP-Q-SF) [ 45]. The FoP-Q-SF (Cronbach =.81) consists of 12 items with a 5-point scale. A higher score indicates a greater fear of progression. We assessed PROMIS 29, FACT-G, and FMI at baseline and at weeks 4, 10, and 20 and HADS, FoP-Q-SF, and Distress Thermometer at baseline and at weeks 10 and 20. We defined a continuous app user as a patient who regularly used the app exercises (at least one exercise per week). We counted an exercise as completed if the patient played the exercise audio file for at least 10 minutes of the total time of 15 minutes. We defined an intervention dropout as a patient who stopped using the exercises for 4 consecutive weeks because regular practice might be a prerequisite for a beneficial intervention. We defined the first week when the patient stopped using the exercises as a dropout week. A patient who never used an app exercise was counted as a week 1 intervention dropout. Adoption For the RE-AIM dimension adoption, we looked at the number of completed app exercises over 20 weeks and app exercise preferences. We reported the median of completed app exercises by all enrolled patients per week as well as the median of completed app exercises by continuous app users. For exercise preferences, we reported frequencies of used exercises for all enrolled patients, stratified by gender of the patient and the narrator. Implementation For the RE-AIM dimension implementation, we reported results from interviews with health professionals regarding their opinion on the implementation of the app intervention in addition to standard medical care. In the interviews, we inquired about the general impression regarding the app, implementation of the app as an addition to standard medical care, and suggestions for improvements. Sample Size One aspect evaluated in our feasibility study was the characteristics and number of patients with cancer who participated in the study (evaluation dimension reach), which was reported previously [ 36]. Therefore, we did not perform an a priori analysis to determine the required sample size for adequate power. However, we aimed to recruit at least 100 patients, which is sufficient to achieve 80% power for a JMIR Cancer 2021 | vol. 7 | iss. 1 | e16785 | p. 3 https://cancer.jmir.org/2021/1/e16785 (page number not for citation purposes)Mikolasek et al JMIR CANCER XSL\u00b7FO RenderX64two-tailed t test with an level set at .05 and a small effect size of Cohen dof 0.28. Data Analysis Quantitative Data All printed case report forms were entered by trained researchers into the electronic database REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), which was hosted at the University Hospital Zurich. All analyses were carried out in SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp). For baseline characteristics of patients, we used descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and mean and SD for continuous variables). For the analyses of pre-post effects, we used linear mixed models (LMMs) to analyze changes over time (baseline, week 4, week 10, and week 20) in health outcomes as well as differences between continuous app users and intervention dropouts in health outcomes. All patients who provided baseline data were included in the analyses, and because we used LMMs, patients with missing data in weeks, 4, 10, and 20 questionnaires were included. The dependent variables were the 7 PROMIS 29 domains, FACT-G, HADS subscales anxiety and depression, Distress Thermometer, FMI, and FoP-Q-SF. Furthermore, we looked at the changes in the respective health outcomes for subsamples with high distress (Distress Thermometer score 5), high anxiety (HADS anxiety score of 8), and high depression (HADS depression score of 8). As a covariance type, we used an autoregressive covariance structure (AR1). Time wasincluded as a fixed effect. For group analyses, (continuous app users vs intervention dropouts), we added group and time-by-group as fixed effects. Hedge geffect sizes were calculated as mean differences (baseline and week 20) divided by pooled SDs for each health outcome of interest. Qualitative Data For the dimension implementation, we recorded the interviews and transcribed the interviews verbatim. We used thematic coding for structuring the interviews using MAXQDA 11 (VERBI Software), and we used content analysis according to Mayring [ 46]. Results Patient Characteristics Between June 2016 and December 2018, we were able to recruit 100 patients with cancer, all of whom provided baseline information. At week 20, 72 (72%) patients completed questionnaire 4 ( Figure 1 ). Baseline characteristics of all enrolled patients (N=100) as well as subsamples of patients with high distress (62/100, 62%), high anxiety (35/100, 26%), and high depression (20/100, 20%) are summarized in Table 1 . Most patients (74/100, 74%) were female. The mean age of all patients was 53.24 (SD 11.55) years, ranging from 23 to 84 years. Patients predominantly owned an iPhone smartphone (67/100, 67%), whereas 30 patients (30/100, smartphone, and a few (3/100, 3%) owned both. Figure 1. Flowchart.

Effects The health outcome values at baseline and at week 20 as well as effect sizes for the total sample and the high distress, high anxiety, and high depression subsamples are presented in Table 2. Baseline distress was 5.29 (SD 2.31); therefore, patients were on average above an assumed clinically relevant threshold of 5, with 62% of patients (62/100) reporting a distress level of 5 or higher. At week 20, distress decreased to an average of 4.1 (SD 2.12; Hedge g=0.53). The mean HADS anxiety score at baseline was 6.88 (SD 3.50) and dropped to 6.31 (SD 3.78; Hedge g=0.16) at week 20. Overall, 35% (35/100) of patientsreported an elevated HADS anxiety score ( 8) at baseline (mean 10.71, SD 1.95), which dropped to 8.85 (SD 3.50; Hedge g=0.68) at week 20. For HADS depression, the mean score at baseline was 4.96 (SD 2.78) and dropped to 4.55 (SD 3.31; Hedge g=0.14) at week 20. Overall, 20% (20/100) of patients reported an elevated HADS depression score ( 8) at baseline (mean 9.00, SD 1.12), which dropped to 8.85 (SD 3.50; Hedge g=0.61) at week 20. For the remaining measures without a proposed threshold (PROMIS, FACT-G, FMI, and FoP-Q-SF), changes from baseline to week 20 were small, with Hedges g effect sizes ranging from 0.04 to 0.33.

Adoption According to our definition, 25% (25/100) of all enrolled patients used the app continuously (ie, at least one completed exercise per week) at week 20 of the intervention. The average number (median) of completed exercises during the 20-week intervention for all patients as well as continuous app users is presented in Figure 2 . Across all patients, the median of completed exercises was 2 during the first week and droppedto 0 at week 9. For continuous app users, who completed an app exercise at least once per week until week 20, the median of completed exercises at week 1 was 6. For the subsequent weeks up to week 20, the median of completed exercises varied between a median of 3 and 5 for the continuous app users. The percentage of completed exercises is presented in Figure 3. All patients together completed 3526 exercises. Mindfulness meditation was used most often, with a total of 1633 completed JMIR Cancer 2021 | vol. 7 | iss. 1 | e16785 | p. 7 https://cancer.jmir.org/2021/1/e16785 (page number not for citation purposes)Mikolasek et al JMIR CANCER XSL\u00b7FO RenderX68exercises (46.31%), followed by guided imagery with 1077 completed exercises (30.55%). Progressive muscle relaxation was used least frequently, with 816 completed exercises (23.14%). In both mindfulness meditation and guided imagery, the female narrator voice was preferred. Furthermore, female patients showed a preference for exercises with a female narrator (1935 completed exercises with a femalenarrator vs 1031 completed exercises with a male narrator). However, male patients preferred exercises with a male narrator (389 completed exercises with a male narrator vs 171 completed exercises with a female narrator). The probability of choosing the same sex in audio files is therefore increased for women by 87% and for men by 127%, which corresponds to a 2-fold higher preference for the same sex as the narrator.

JMIR Cancer 2021 | vol. 7 | iss. 1 | e16785 | p. 8 https://cancer.jmir.org/2021/1/e16785 (page number not for citation purposes)Mikolasek et al JMIR CANCER XSL\u00b7FO RenderX69Implementation A total of 5 health professionals took part in an interview: 2 female nursing experts (one from an inpatient unit and the other from an outpatient oncology unit), 2 female MBM psychologists, and 1 male oncologist. Interviews were conducted between January and March 2018 and lasted for an average of 45 minutes (SD 9.54). The qualitative analysis of the interviews yielded 4 themes: (1) general impression of the app, (2) suggestions for improvement, (3) implementation in standard care, and (4) experience with recommending the app to patients. Overall, the general impression of the app was positive. For instance, the oncologist summarized his impression of the app as follows: I think [the app] is a very helpful thing because it is relatively easy [to use]. You can test it. You can try it and if you like it, you can integrate it relatively easy into everyday life. I think it is very practical. It is a practical thing and if patients are interested, I also see that they take it up willingly. All health professionals perceived the app as appealing, clearly structured, and as a helpful supportive tool. In addition, the MBM psychologists liked the app as an addition to the 10-week face-to-face MBM course and appreciated the app as a good self-help tool complementing the course. The oncologist also stated that many patients with cancer look for something they can use to add to standard care and an app can provide a low threshold aid. As a negative aspect, a nursing expert stated that a smartphone is required and not every patient possesses such a device. All health experts made various suggestions for improving the app. A shared opinion was that the content of the app (ie, number and variety of exercises) could be increased, as over an extended period, patients might get bored with a choice limited to 3 exercises. A nursing expert suggested that a new exercise could, for instance, be unlocked after completing the same exercise several times. An MBM psychologist suggested that every week, a different selection of exercises could be activated with alternating topics such as meditation, relaxation, self-compassion, or body exercises. In addition, the inclusion of exercises with different degrees of complexity was suggested. An MBM psychologist stated that exercises for beginners (eg, more detailed instructions, fewer moments of silence) as well as exercises for patients experienced in mindfulness and relaxation could be added. MBM psychologists and nursing experts also recommended that some exercises should be accompanied by soothing background music because longer periods of silence might be uncomfortable for some patients. They also recommended exercises with various lengths of time so that patients had more flexibility if they were facing time constraints or if they were too impatient for longer exercises. The oncologist mentioned that adding exercises specifically for sleep disorders might be a good addition to the app, especially for inpatients, because poor sleep in hospitals is very common. As an additional topic that could be added, he mentioned body exercises such as yoga. An MBM psychologist mentioned that an app mirroring the MBM course more closely would be great:If I could make a wish, then I would say, it would be totally cool to have an accompanying Mind Body Medicine app. That is to say that a lot of exercises\u2014not all of them\u2014b ut a lot of exercises we do [could be added to the app]. Possibly also guided body exercises. That would be totally cool. The interviewees mentioned several factors that could influence the implementation of a mindfulness- and relaxation-based app into standard care. Both nursing experts and one of the MBM psychologists stated that the time point when the information of the app is delivered to the patient might be important. These health professionals mentioned that the patients were bombarded with information during the first consultation or during the first day when a patient enters the hospital and additional information about the app might overwhelm some patients. The outpatient nursing expert also mentioned that they are often limited because of time constraints during consultation hours: On the one hand there are the concerns of the patients, which you have to discuss. But you also have a little bit of pressure, [to tell them] all relevant information. [...] And sometimes it's already two minutes before the end [of the consultation]. [...] And you can't just hand out the flyer. You also need to say a few words [about the app] and that's why I sometimes forgot [to mention the app]. Due to shortage of time. The nursing experts also mentioned that the nurses oftentimes forgot about the app because it is not part of standard care. Therefore, the nursing experts stated that it might be helpful to better inform the nurses about the app and setting up standards regarding the communication about the app, for example, when to inform the patients and how. In addition, the nursing experts stated that it might be helpful if they had a demonstration device at the oncology unit so that they could better explain the app to the patients. All interviewed health professionals further mentioned that patients with cancer are very diverse and that although some patients are very eager to try out various treatments, others are not. One MBM therapist also stated that not all patients perceive relaxation as important and that those patients might need some additional information which indicates why relaxation is good for them. All health professionals also stated that implementing such an app does not result in a lot of additional work for them and they appreciate the app, which they could recommend to suitable patients. Regarding their experience with recommending the app to patients, health professionals shared the opinion that female patients are more drawn to mindfulness and relaxation exercises. Furthermore, the MBM therapists stated that patients who already practiced some form of relaxation or meditation often did not participate in the study. The MBM therapists also noticed that the composition of the MBM group had an influence on how many patients were willing to try out the app. For instance, if one patient was very motivated and expressed interest in the app, hesitant patients sometimes followed suit and were willing to try the app as well. One MBM therapist also noticed that many older people were willing to use the app: JMIR Cancer 2021 | vol. 7 | iss. 1 | e16785 | p. 9 https://cancer.jmir.org/2021/1/e16785 (page number not for citation purposes)Mikolasek et al JMIR CANCER XSL\u00b7FO RenderX70I was surprised that so many older patients had the app on their phone and also used the app regularly [...]. I had the impression, that it appeals to the young. [...]. But oftentimes, the older people have more time, because they don't work anymore. Discussion Principal Findings In this study, we explored the feasibility of a mindfulness- and relaxation-based self-help app for patients with cancer. To evaluate the feasibility, we used the RE-AIM framework [ 37], and in this analysis, we focused on the framework dimensions effectiveness, adoption, and implementation. Our findings support the feasibility of this mHealth intervention. The results indicate that the intervention might have beneficial effects on patients' distress and quality of life. Furthermore, the mHealth intervention is accepted by the target population as well as by health professionals. For the dimension effectiveness, we looked into pre-post effects. Our results suggest that the app might have the potential to reduce distress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and anxiety as well as improve health-related quality of life and mindfulness. This is in line with a recent pilot study [ 47], in which a mobile mindfulness-based stress reduction program improved, among others, stress, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, quality of life, and mindfulness in patients with breast cancer with small to large effects. Furthermore, a recent randomized controlled trial conducted by Kubo et al [ 48] assessed the feasibility of a commercially available mindfulness program in which they targeted patients with cancer and their caregivers. This program leads to an increase in quality of life in patients with cancer with a medium effect size [ 48]. Similar to these findings, Rosen et al [ 49] reported that the quality of life of patients with breast cancer improved with a small effect size using a commercially available mindfulness course when compared with a control group. As depressive symptoms and anxiety were not significantly reduced in the total sample in our study, we also looked at subsamples with higher HADS scores. In the high anxiety and high depression subsamples, anxiety and depression, respectively, decreased significantly over time. This might indicate that a mindfulness and relaxation mHealth intervention is especially beneficial for patients with cancer with higher emotional distress. This is also in line with a study by Barth et al [50], where highly distressed patients benefited most from psycho-oncological interventions. However, we did not find any group effects when comparing continuous app users with intervention dropouts. This might indicate that our definition of users and dropouts is not precise enough or that another variable than time spent practicing is responsible for changes in outcomes. For adoption, our results showed that at week 20 of the intervention, 25 of 100 patients were using the app continuously. With 54 of 100 continuous app users at week 10 [ 36], this leads to a dropout rate of approximately 50% every 10 weeks. The 25 continuous app users practiced on average 3 to 5 times per week (median), which comes close to our initially statedrecommendation of 5 exercises per week. We consider this a good adoption of the mHealth intervention because the intervention was set up as a self-care intervention without the involvement of a therapist or health professional. Mindfulness was the preferred exercise, followed by guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation. However, mindfulness meditation exercises were also presented as the first choice in the app, whereas guided imagery was placed at the second position, and progressive muscle relaxation was placed at the third position. Therefore, the preference for mindfulness meditation could also be caused by the placement of the exercises in the app. These results regarding adoption are comparable with those of a study conducted by Kubo et al [ 48], in which patients with cancer received access to the commercially available mindfulness app Headspace (TM). In this study, 40 of 54 patients with cancer allocated to the intervention group completed the 8-week study, and 20 patients with cancer used the app on at least 50% of the days [ 48]. The results from the interviews with health professionals provide some insights into the implementation of a mindfulness and relaxation mHealth intervention into standard care. In general, all interviewed health professionals perceived the app as a helpful addition to standard care. The health professionals also suggested some improvements, which might increase the acceptance and long-term use of such mHealth interventions by patients. A suggested improvement shared by all health professionals is the increase in the content of the app, such as additional exercises or variations of the exercises. A statement about the implementation of the mHealth intervention given by several health professionals was the adequate provision of information. One of the interviewed MBM psychologists as well as the nursing experts stated that patients with cancer are, on the one hand, flooded with information, especially when they start their treatment. However, the provision of some information to the patients about a mHealth intervention is necessary, at least to let the patients know about the existing intervention. On the other hand, nursing experts also mentioned that nurses often forgot about the intervention, although they approve this kind of intervention. Therefore, a standardized procedure for informing patients about the mHealth intervention might facilitate the implementation of the intervention. In addition, health professionals such as nurses might have to be informed regularly about such interventions because it is not part of their standard treatment; therefore, they might forget about it, as seen in this study. Regarding the recruitment process, the health professionals made the observation that female patients were more interested in this mHealth intervention. This is also reflected by the gender ratio in this study's sample, with 76 female and 24 male patients with cancer, which is typical for complementary and alternative treatments [ 51-53]. This gender difference raises the question of whether an effort should be made to better recruit male patients with cancer for such an intervention. A nursing expert, for instance, mentioned during the interview that a focus on more technical aspects or facts could be more appealing to male patients. Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions This study has several strengths and limitations. A strength of the study is the collection of objective data in the form of JMIR Cancer 2021 | vol. 7 | iss. 1 | e16785 | p. 10 https://cancer.jmir.org/2021/1/e16785 (page number not for citation purposes)Mikolasek et al JMIR CANCER XSL\u00b7FO RenderX71logging the exercise use for each patient over the course of 20 weeks. Therefore, data on using the app exercises were not biased through self-report. Another advantage of this study was the use of a mixed methods approach, which is recommended for the development of digital interventions [ 54]. A limitation of the study is that we did not have a control group. Therefore, the effectiveness of the app cannot be determined in this study because regression to the mean could have an impact on the improvement of well-being. Furthermore, we used paper-and-pencil questionnaires, which might have led to more missing data compared with web-based questionnaires [ 55]. However, this was compensated by using LMM analyses, which take into account all patients who provided baseline data. Another limitation is that we did not assess whether patients were practicing mindfulness and relaxation exercises without the app, which could have an effect on the assessed outcomes. Therefore, future studies should investigate this topic with a randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of a mindfulness and relaxation mHealth intervention. Our study provides some insights regarding the effects that might be expected in a similar study, which will be helpful to power future studies sufficiently. We also looked at aspects of implementing an mHealth intervention. All interviewed health professionals perceived such an mHealth intervention as ahelpful addition to standard care, but as described earlier, they also stated barriers to the implementation of such an intervention, which should be investigated in future studies. Future studies could also investigate an mHealth intervention with more content than in this study app, as suggested during the interviews by health professionals. For instance, audio files with background music or exercises with variations in their duration could be added. In addition to mindfulness and relaxation exercises, physical exercise programs could be added. Physical exercise can have beneficial effects on symptoms of patients with cancer [ 56], and physical exercise has already been implemented in mHealth apps for patients with cancer [57]. Conclusions The results of this observational feasibility study indicate that a mindfulness and relaxation app can be a feasible and an effective way to deliver a self-care intervention for patients with cancer. Our results indicate that such an intervention might be especially beneficial for highly distressed patients with cancer. The appeal of such an app could be increased with more diverse content, which might also positively affect the adherence of patients to such an intervention. The effectiveness and further aspects regarding the implementation of such an mHealth intervention should be investigated in a future randomized controlled trial.

This goal was tackled by summarizing results from empirical studies in a systematic review. A second aim of this PhD thesis was to evaluate the feasibility of a mindfulness- and relaxation app for cancer patients. For this purpose, we conducted a prospective observational study with cancer patients using an app to practice mindfulness and relaxation exercises. The results obtained in each study are discussed in detail in the included manuscripts. This section summarizes the key findings of every study and integrates our findings into the current research context, and highlights future directions for practice and research. 1. Summary of findings We first conducted a systematic review in which we summarized mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth interventions for patients with medical conditions and the interventions' effects on health. We carried out a comprehensive literature search and included all available studies that were published between 1990 and 2015. We found 17 studies that matched our inclusion criteria, namely mindfulness- and relaxation-based eHealth intervention for patients with medical conditions that were mainly technology delivered with pre- and post-assessment of a health outcome. Out of these studies, 11 used mindfulness, 6 relaxation, and 3 studies both intervention strategies. The interventions were delivered for patients with irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, cancer, chronic pain, surgery, and hypertension. All in all, the majority of studies assessing the respective outcomes reported positive effects on general health (physical functioning, disability, quality of life), as well as depression, anxiety, or self-efficacy, and pain. No studies reported positive effects on stress or mindfulness. After the systematic review, we conducted a prospective observational study, where we provided cancer patients a mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth app and we gathered date over the course of 20 weeks. In our study we used a mixed-methods design to evaluate the feasibility of our mHealth intervention and applied the RE-AIM evaluation framework. We presented the results for the dimensions reach, adoption, and maintenance in 77 our second paper and the results for the dimensions effectiveness and implementation in our third and final paper. For the dimension reach, we reported that we were able to screen 117 eligible cancer patients of which 100 returned the informed consent form and were included in the study. The mean age of all enrolled patients was 53 years and the majority were female (n=74). With 39 cases, the most common cancer diagnosis was breast cancer. The majority of patients had completed higher education: 41 patients completed secondary education and 33 patients had a university degree. Regarding their well-being, patients reported on average elevated levels of distress at baseline, whereas anxiety and depression scores were on average normal. Since we designed our study with an intervention group only, i.e. without a control group and randomization, we were not able to examine the effectiveness of our mHealth intervention. Instead, we reported effects for our predefined health-related outcomes by analyzing changes over time. Our analyses revealed that over the course of the 20 week mHealth intervention, anxiety, distress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, quality of life, and mindfulness improved significantly. We also analyzed effects in subsamples with high depression, anxiety, and distress values and in every subsample the according outcomes improved significantly. We did not find any significant changes in physical functioning, depression, ability to participate in social roles and activities, and fear of progression. For adoption, we looked at the number of app exercises completed per week as well as the number of continuous app users (at least weekly use of one or more app exercises) vs intervention dropouts. Overall, the average of completed app exercises per week was quite low with a median of 2 exercises at week one, which dropped to a median of 1 at week 5 and 0 at week 9. When we however made a distinction between continuous app users and intervention dropouts, the numbers looked much more favorable for continuous app users. Over the course of the first 10 weeks of the intervention, 54 patients used app exercises regularly up until week 10. These continuous app users completed on average (median) 4 exercises in week 1 and 2 exercises in week 10. We furthermore looked at the app usage over the course of the entire 20 week, where we identified 24 (24%) continuous app users. These patients used on average (median) 6 app exercises in week 1 and 4 app exercises in week 20. To evaluate the implementation of the mHealth intervention, we conducted interviews with 5 health professionals. All health professionals perceived the mHealth intervention as a helpful addition to standard care. Furthermore, the interviewed health professionals made suggestions to increase the acceptance and long-term use of the mHealth app, which can be of 78 help for the implementation. The health professionals suggested to add more content (e.g. additional exercises or variations of the exercises), as well as increasing the awareness of the app for patients and health experts. For the dimension maintenance, we looked at predictors for adherence. Our analyses revealed that being female, higher scores in openness to experience, resistance to change, and depression significantly predicted continuous app use over the course of 10 weeks. 79 2. Discussion and integration of findings 2.1 Dimension Reach The evaluation of the dimension reach (i.e. which and how many cancer patients participate in the study) revealed that the majority of patients who were interested in participating (n=117) also enrolled in the study (n=100). However, since we used a variety of recruitment strategies such as distribution of leaflets at hospitals and social media, we do not know how many cancer patients we had been able to inform about the study. Therefore, we could not make an estimate which percentage of cancer patients are potentially interested in such an intervention. Our evaluation showed furthermore that the majority of enrolled patients were female (74%). This is congruent with other e- or mHealth intervention. For instance, in an online interventions for cancer patients (Beatty et al., 2017), out of 191 participating patients 84% were female. Another study looked at user characteristics of a meditation app and i n this study with more than 10'000 users, 79.94% were female (Huberty et al., 2019). In a further study with an mHealth mindfulness intervention for cancer patients, out of 97 patients 69% were female (Kubo et al., 2019). Regarding age, patients in our study were on average (mean) 53.24 years old and their age ranged from 23 to 84 years. Other e- and mHealth studies also reported similar age means and large ranges. A study by Beatty and colleagues (2017) examined the uptake of an online intervention for cancer related distress and reported that the mean age was 56.32 years. A study by Kubo an colleagues (2019) investigated a mHealth mindfulness intervention for cancer patients, where the mean age of participating patient was 59.3 years. This is contrary to the concern, that an age-based digital divide (i.e. limited access to information and communication technologies by older adults) exists in mHealth (Fox & Connolly, 2018), which might impair access to such intervention for older patients. Regarding patients' education, the majority of enrolled patients completed some form of higher education, with 41% of patients who completed secondary education and 33% of patients who had a university degree. This is also in line with a study conducted by Loquai and colleagues (2017) in melanoma patients, where higher education was associated with the use of complementary and alternative medicine, which also includes relaxation and mindfulness meditation. Another smartphone-based mindfulness study similarly reported that 80 participants were predominantly well-educated, with 41.3% of a sample of 121 having a postgraduate-level education (Howells, Ivtzan, & Eiroa-Orosa, 2016). Baseline values of mental health related outcomes showed on the one hand that distress was on average high with a mean of 5.9, which is considered as clinically relevant (Jacobsen et al., 2005). On the other hand, depressive symptoms and anxiety was on average not elevated. However, subsample analyses revealed that a substantial proportion of our sample reported elevated anxiety (35%) and depressive symptoms (20%). These baseline values are similar to a study by Kubo and colleagues (2019), a mHealth mindfulness intervention for cancer patients, in which the authors also used the distress thermometer and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. In this study, cancer patients reported on average a baseline distress of 4.9. Also similar to our study sample, anxiety was more prevalent than depressive symptoms. Another study investigating a mHealth physical activity intervention to increase quality of life and distress in cancer patients also applied the distress-thermometer (Mayer et al., 2018). In this study, cancer patients reported lower baseline distress with an average of 3.36 in the control group and 2.98 in the intervention group (Mayer et al., 2018). This might indicate that mindfulness- and relaxation- based interventions are appealing to distressed cancer patients. Overall, these findings indicate that age is not a barrier for the uptake of an mHealth intervention, as stated by some researchers (Byambasuren, Glasziou, 2020; Wildenbos, Jaspers, Schijven, & Dusseljee-Peute, 2019). Furthermore, patients participating in the study had on average elevated levels of distress, indicating that patients showing signs of clinically relevant distress are willing to participate in a mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth intervention. However, being male and having a lower education have been reported as a barriers for the uptake of e- and mHealth interventions, which is also in line with our findings. 2.2 Dimension Effectiveness Regarding the dimension effectiveness, we reported effects over time and found significant improvements in anxiety, distress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, quality of life, and mindfulness with small to medium effect sizes. Subsample analyses reveled significant improvements with large effects on distress in high distress subsample (62% of patients), anxiety in the high anxiety subsample (35% of patients), and depression in the high depression subsample (20% of patients). These findings are in line with other comparable 81 studies. A single group pilot study tested the feasibility of a mobile mindfulness-based stress reduction (mMBSR) for breast cancer program (Lengacher et al., 2018). Fifteen breast cancer survivors were recruited and all of them received access to a mMBSR program, which consisted of 6 weekly 2-hour sessions delivered through an iPad. After six weeks, cancer patients showed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, stress, fear of recurrence, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life with medium to large effect sizes. However, due to the small sample size and single group design, these preliminary result have to be interpreted with caution. Another study by Rosen and colleagues (2018) aimed to assess the efficacy of a commercially available mindfulness-app on quality of life in breast cancer patients. In this study, 112 cancer patients were randomized to the app intervention group or a waitlist control group. Analyses showed that cancer patients in the app intervention group reported higher quality of life as well as higher mindfulness scores from baseline through follow-up compared to the patients in the wait list control group. A further study assessed the feasibility of a mHealth mindfulness intervention for cancer patients (Kubo et al., 2019). Out of 97 patients, 52 were allocated to the intervention group and received access to the commercially available app Headspace for 8 weeks. Compared to the control group, patients in the intervention arm had significantly greater improvements in emotional well-being and overall well-being between baseline and post-intervention. To conclude, current research indicates that mindfulness- and relaxation based- intervention can have positive effects in cancer patients. However, only a few studies have been published in this field of research. Furthermore, some of these studies had small sample sizes and therefore low statistical power, which increases the likelihood of a type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) and reduces the likelihood that a significant results reflects a true effect (Button et al., 2013). Furthermore, our study as well as other studies used a single group design. Due to the lack of a control group and random allocation, unambiguous inferences about the interventions' effectiveness cannot be made. Therefore, randomized controlled trials with large enough sample sized to achieve adequate power are needed to determine the effectiveness of mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth interventions. 2.3 Dimension Adoption For the dimension adoption we looked at the adherence of cancer patients to the app intervention. Our results showed that on average the enrolled cancer patients did not adhere to our recommendation of conducting 5 exercises per week. During the first 4 weeks of the intervention, the enrolled patients completed on average 2 exercises per week and the average 82 completion of app exercises dropped to zero in week nine. However, since the range of completed exercises was large amongst the patients, we furthermore created user subgroups by classifying patients as continuous app users and intervention dropouts, who stopped using the app at some point during the intervention. Theses analyses revealed that over half of the patients used the app exercises regularly (at least one completed exercise per week) up until week 10. However, these continuous app users did not reach our recommended 5 exercises per week either, since these patients completed on average between 4 and 2 exercises per week. Looking at continuous app use until week 20, we were able to categorize a quarter of all enrolled cancer patients as continuous app users. Therefore, the number of patients who were committed to use the app regularly for the first 10 weeks was moderate and dropped further until week 20. However, patients still using the app in week 20 showed overall a good adherence to the app intervention, with the number of completed app exercises per week varying between 3 and 6 exercises. These numbers indicate that although the majority of patients stopped using the app after a while, with a quarter of all enrolled patients a considerable number of patients were using the app over a prolonged period. This is insofar promising, since our intervention did only involve minimal patient contact and a respectable number of patients therefore used the app self-reliantly according to our recommendations. Furthermore, once an app intervention is established, it can be distributed easily to a large part of a desired population. Comparing the adherence to other studies is restricted since different mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth interventions can vary substantially (e.g. varying intervention duration and complexity) and adherence is oftentimes defined differently. However, recent studies with comparable intervention strategies report promising results regarding patients' adherence to a mindfulness- or relaxation based-eHealth intervention. A randomized controlled trial by Beatty and colleagues (2017) investigated the uptake and adherence to a self-care CBT online intervention, aiming to reduce cancer-related distress. The intervention consisted of a 6-week internet application which was divided into 6 modules. These modules covered different topics such as coping with physical symptoms and emotional distress and included amongst others relaxation and meditation exercises (Beatty, Kemp, Wade, & Koczwara, 2015). The authors reported an acceptable adherence, with 60% of patients completing 4 or more modules and 40% completing all 6 modules (Beatty et al., 2017). Another randomized controlled trial by Kubo and colleagues (2019) also looked at the adherence to an mHealth mindfulness intervention for cancer patients, which aimed to reduce distress and improve quality of life. The intervention group received access to the 83 commercially available Headspace app for 8 weeks. Among the patients who completed the intervention, 50% practiced mindfulness with the app at least at 50% of the days and 32.5% of patients practiced at least at 70% of the days with the app. In summary, the results obtained from early eHealth studies, indicating that low adherence is an inherent problem in e- and mHealth interventions (G. Eysenbach, 2005; Kelders, Kok, Ossebaard, & Van Gemert-Pijnen, 2012) do not hold up in more recent research. Furthermore, our results indicate that further analyses with subgroups of users (e.g. continuous users and intervention dropouts) provide a more accurate and optimistic picture regarding the adherence to an mHealth intervention. We found in our study that adherence varies substantially between patients and only looking at mean scores of practicing time or number of exercises across the entire sample leads to a biased depiction of adherence. Our subsample analyses showed that although the majority of patients did not adhere to the intervention, a substantial proportion of patients used the app exercises regularly, even over a prolonged time of 20 weeks. 2.4 Dimension Implementation For the dimension implementation we interviewed health professionals who work with cancer patients and who were also involved in recruiting patients for our study. Overall, the interviewees perceived the app as an appealing and helpful complementary tool. The acceptance of a new mHealth intervention by health professionals is a relevant prerequisite for the implementation in a clinical setting. This is in line with the results from a study which investigated the prescription of mHealth apps in general practice, where on the one hand general practitioners stated that they need to be convinced of the benefits of mHealth apps in order to recommend them to patients and on the other hand patients stated that they rely on doctors recommendations (Byambasuren et al., 2020). Our interviewees mentioned another relevant factor, namely that recommending and explaining the app to patients did not result in a lot of additional work for them. The amount of additional work can play an important role in the implementation of a new mHealth intervention, since health professionals treating cancer patients have a high work load and therefore added burden during the recruitment process can negatively affect the enrollment of eligible patients (Gupta, Ocker, & Chow, 2020). The health professionals mentioned several aspects which they perceived to have an impact on the implementation of a mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth intervention. One issue raised was the right timing of recommending a mHealth intervention, since cancer 84 patients are flooded with information during their first consultation or entry into the hospital. Therefore, the additional information about the mHealth intervention might get forgotten amongst all the other information. Hence, it might be advisable to inform patients about the intervention outside regular consultation hours and instead use an additional visit for this purpose. Another aspect mentioned by nursing experts was that nurses themselves oftentimes forgot about the mHealth intervention since it is not part of their regular routine of care. Therefore, it might be helpful to implement guidelines when additional information about an mHealth intervention can be provided. In addition, awareness about the intervention could be increased amongst nurses for instance by mentioning such new complementary treatments during advanced trainings or during information events. In line with these suggestions, Gupta and colleagues (2020) stated that the coordination with clinical staff is an important factor influencing the implementation of mHealth interventions for cancer patients in a clinical setting. The authors highlighted the importance of understanding the work flow in a clinic and communication with key clinic staff for a successful recruitment of cancer patients (Gupta et al., 2020). Furthermore, the nursing experts in our study also mentioned that it might be helpful to have a dedicated mobile device where the app could be demonstrated. In addition, the provision of such a device might also help to remind the nurses about the existence of mHealth interventions. The interviewees also mentioned that adding more content to the app (e.g. more exercises) might increase the attractiveness of an mHealth intervention and therefore appeal to a larger number of patients. However, the ease of use of an mHealth app can also impact the acceptance of an app (Byambasuren et al., 2020) and a mHealth app that is perceived as too complex or difficult to use might be off-putting to patients and health professionals. Therefore, it has also been recommended to adapt a user-centered approach when developing a digital intervention, where stakeholder will be involved throughout the development process (Michie et al., 2017). With such an approach it seems more likely that a right balance between complexity or amount of content and usability will be reached. Another aspect that was mentioned in our interviews is that during the recruitment phase the health professionals observed that female patients were more interested in the mHealth intervention, which is congruent with the gender distribution in our study sample. As mentioned in the discussion regarding the dimension reach, this gender difference is also comparable to findings in other e- or m-Health studies with mindfulness and relaxation intervention strategies. To counter this gender bias during recruitment, a nursing expert mentioned in our interviews that maybe male patients could be motivated more to use a mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth intervention with slightly adapted recruitment strategies (e.g. focusing more on technical 85 aspects and facts while explaining the study to male patients). However, future studies will have to investigate if different recruitment strategies can lead to an increase of male participants and if so, which strategies are most promising. Another aspects with a potential impact on the implementation of a mHealth intervention which was not mentioned in our interviews but is discussed in other studies are privacy and data safety issues. However, results regarding privacy and data safety concerns so far are inconclusive (Byambasuren et al., 2020; del R\u00edo-Lanza, Su\u00e1rez-V\u00e1zquez, Su\u00e1rez-\u00c1lvarez, & Iglesias-Arg\u00fcelles, 2020), requiring further research. To summarize, several aspects can influence the implementation of a mHealth intervention into standard care. Acceptance by health professionals and patients of an intervention are important aspects, as well as structural aspects like daily routine of health professionals. 2.5 Dimension Maintenance For the dimension maintenance we investigated potential predictors for continuous app use and during patient interviews we inquired possible reasons for continuous and discontinuous app use. Our analyses revealed that being female, higher scores in openness to experience as well as a higher resistance to change score, and higher depressive symptoms predicted continuous app use. Our interviews gave further insights about factors influencing the continuous use of the app. As reasons for a long-term use of the app exercises, continuous app users stated that they perceived the exercises as beneficial and that the exercises helped them to relax. Interviewed intervention dropouts mentioned various reason for a discontinued use of the app. Some patients stated that they had previous experience with relaxation or meditation exercises and that these routines differed from the ones in the app. These differences were perceived as distracting and the patients stated that they could not get used to the new instructions, which is why these patients stopped using the app. Other patients mentioned different distraction such as peculiar sounding instruction or fatigue, which led to a discontinued app use. One patient also mentioned technical problem with his smartphone, which prevented a continuous use of the app. These results indicate that for a prolonged use of a mindfulness- and relaxation-based app, a variety of different interindividual reasons can have an impact. Several distracting factors or different preferences for instance can lead to noncompliance to a specific app intervention. Therefore, setting up an app intervention with some variety might appeal to a larger number of patients. 86 So far, studies investigating possible predictors for continuous mHealth app use of cancer patients are sparse. Furthermore, these studies oftentimes investigate different potential predictors for continuous app use and use different definitions of app use, which impedes comparisons across studies as well as generalizing the results. A study by Psihogios and colleagues (2021) evaluated possible predictors for engagement (i.e. frequency of app use) with a self-care mHealth app for adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. This study investigated a variety of potential predictors: demographic variables (e.g. sex, age), disease factors (e.g. cancer type, cancer treatment), psychological factors (e.g. goal motivation, health beliefs) as well as other characteristics such as type of phone and time of year. Contrary to our findings, the authors of this study reported that lower depression predicted higher mHealth engagement (Psihogios et al., 2021). Apart from that, uninterrupted app access, iPhone (vs. Android-based smartphone) ownership, receiving the intervention in summer months predicted a higher app engagement (Psihogios et al., 2021). A systematic review examined the feasibility of mindfulness-based e- and mHealth interventions for cancer patients (Matis, Svetlak, Slezackova, Svoboda, & umec, 2020) and summarized - amongst others - predictors of adherence. In line with our study, a pilot study of a web-based mindfulness-based cognitive therapy intervention reported that being female was a predictor for continuous use of the program (Everts, Van Der Lee, & de Jager Meezenbroek, 2015). However, contrary to our results, in the study by Everts and colleagues (2015) lower depressive symptoms at baseline was associated with a continuous use of the online program. Other predictive factors for continuous program use were higher education, employment, and previous experience with mindfulness (Everts et al., 2015). Furthermore, some studies did not find any significant predictors for continuous program or app use (Matis et al., 2020). To conclude, some preliminary results regarding factors that contribute to continuous app use in mHealth intervention have been reported. However, current results are heterogenous and sometimes contradictory. Therefore, future studies will have to investigate in which situation contradicting results (e.g. depressive symptoms) are associated with continuous app use. In addition, due to the low number of studies, current consistent findings for continuous app use predictors (e.g. female sex) need to b e replicated and investigated in different setting. 87 3. Implications 3.1 Implications for Practice Our studies provide at least three main implications for practice. The first implication concerns the uptake of and adherence to an intervention, which are important prerequisites for effective health interventions. However, both factors have been reported as shortcomings in e- and mHealth interventions. Our research contributes to the current mHealth literature by indicating possible factors which can influence the uptake of and adherence to a mHealth intervention. These findings can help health professionals to identify suitable patients for an mHealth intervention. In regard to uptake of e- or mHealth interventions, early research indicated that age can be a potential barrier for the uptake of such interventions. Contrary to such previous findings, our research indicates that age is not a barrier for mHealth uptake, which is also congruent with other more recent research in this field. Since cancer patients' age varies considerably and cancer patients in all age groups report reduced well-being, it is important to reach all age groups with effective health care services. According to our findings, a mindfulness- and relaxation mHealth intervention is similarly appealing to different age groups and therefore, health professionals should not see age as a contraindication for recommending such an intervention to older patients. However, our results indicate that male sex and a lower education seem to be barriers for the uptake of a mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth intervention since more often females and patients with higher education participated in our study. This is also in line with research on psychosocial interventions as well as complementary medicine, which shows that women are more likely to use such interventions. Furthermore, our results also indicate that female patients are more adherent to a mindfulness- and relaxation mHealth intervention. These results can help health professionals to identify patients who are more likely to use a mindfulness and relaxation mHealth in the long run. In turn, these results can also be helpful to identify patients who are more likely to stop using an app and therefore might require a health professional to continuously motivate the patient. A second implication of our research is that more features in an app can potentially increase its appeal to a larger number of patients, which might also positively effect uptake of and adherence to an mHealth intervention. However, the balance between the quantity and complexity of features and the easiness to use has to be considered during the app development. 88 Our results showed that patients had in general a positive impression about the mindfulness- and relaxation-based app developed for our study. Some patients who disliked the app and stopped using it mentioned factors such as dislikable language during the exercises or lack of variety of exercises, which lead them to cease using the app. For a better adherence, more features could be implemented in a mHealth apps to satisfy different needs across potential users. One problem however with additional features will be the increasing complexity of the app, which can decrease the ease of use and therefore impede the development of an acc essible design (Azhar & Dhillon, 2016; Pach, Rogge, Wang, & Witt, 2021) . Therefore, upcoming apps will have to achieve a balance between a large as possible appeal by the implementation of more features while still maintaining an acceptable usability of the app. A third implication of our research is that for a better implementation of a new mHealth intervention, health professionals' awareness of the intervention needs to be increased, for instance during advanced trainings or team meetings. Our results indicated that the interviewed health professionals had in general a positive impression of the app and perceived it as a helpful tool for their patients. Interestingly, although health professional rated the app favorably, only a few were able to recommend the app to patients. Our inquires in the interviews showed that nurses faced difficulties to recommend the app due to time constraints and the large amount of information they already need to provide to patients about their regular treatment. In addition to that it also became apparent during our interviews that health professionals oftentimes are in situation where they would like to have access to a tool like our app, which they could recommend to patients with elevated levels of distress. However, since the app was a new and unfamiliar tool, some health professionals oftentimes forgot to recommend the app in suitable situations. Therefore, for an adequate implementation of a new mHealth intervention it seems necessary to adequately inform stakeholders in healthcare (e.g. nurses) about existing mHealth app. In addition, implementing guidelines about the provision of information regarding mHealth interventions could also help to disseminate such an app because simply informing health professionals about the existence of a new intervention will most likely lead to a small impact, which became apparent in our study. 3.2 Implications for Research Since we did not conduct a randomized controlled trial, we were not able to make any inferences about the effectiveness of our mHealth intervention. Therefore, additional randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth interventions. However, our results showed positive pre-post effects 89 in different health-related domains and the reported effect sizes can help future trials to adequately power the study. Currently, as a follow-up to our feasibility study a multicenter RCT is being set up (funded by the Swiss Cancer League). This upcoming study aims to determine the effectiveness of a mindfulness- and relaxation app for patients with elevated levels of distress by comparing the intervention group to a waitlist group. Since effectiveness studies investigate an intervention in normal clinical conditions, a challenge will be addressing potential confounding variables such as cointerventions and comorbidities of patients. Future research should also look in more detail into predictors for adherence, which will be helpful to identify suitable patients for a mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth intervention. Sub-sample analyses of our data (Siebenh\u00fcner, Mikolasek, Witt, & Barth, 2021) for instance showed that patients' level of distress might have an impact on adherence. These results showed that a decrease in patients' distress was associated with lower adherence, whereas patients with moderate distress as well as patients with an increase in destress over time adhered better to the intervention. However, a current problem in mHealth adherence research lies in different reporting of adherence across studies, which reduces generalizability and comparability of results. A standardized reporting of adherence across mHealth interventions is hardly possible, since interventions vary sometimes substantially in their characteristics (e.g. duration of the intervention and exercises, number of exercises or modules). Future research should therefore aim to report clearly their assessment of adherence assessments, with as many data as available (e.g. completed exercises or modules, time spent with the app. Finally, a common problem with current mHealth research is the knowledge transfer from research into clinical practice. Currently, a lot of commercial apps are available on the market with little scientific support (Lau et al., 2020). However, evidence-based research apps are only available for a limited time (i.e. study duration) and access is oftentimes restricted to study participants. A possible way to tackle this problem is currently implemented in Germany by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte; BfArM). The BfArM established an application procedure in which medical devices, such as mHealth apps, can be submitted for the inclusion in the directory of reimbursable medical devices. Following a submission, the BfArM will assess several product qualities (e.g. data protection, user friendliness, effectiveness). If the requirements are met, the medical device will be listed in the directory of reimbursable medical devices. These medical devices then can be prescribed by physicians and psychotherapists as part of the treatment, 90 whereby the cost of the medical device will be covered by the health insurance (Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, 2021). Such a procedure can potentially help in making evidence-based apps accessible to the general population and therefore could be an example for other countries as well. 4. Strengths and limitations This thesis has several strengths and limitations. We first conducted a systematic review, which is a good way to summarize the current evidence in the field of interest. A strength of our systematic review was the extensive literature search in several databases. Another strength was the development of a standardized manual for data extraction, which was done by two reviewers independently. However, since we included studies with different mindfulness- and relaxation-based intervention strategies for a variety of medical conditions, we were not able to perform a meta-analysis. Therefore, our systematic review provides a narrative synthesis of the literature, but due to the lack of a meta-analysis, a statistical estimate of effectiveness could not be reported. Another limitation of our systematic review was that mindfulness or relaxation can be one out of several treatment strategies in a complex intervention, which can impede comparisons between different studies. We therefore defined as an inclusion criteria that the ratio of mindfulness or relaxation treatment strategies to the total number of intervention strategies had to be at least 1 to 5. Therefore, studies might have been excluded from our systematic review, if an intervention had a multitude of different intervention strategies besides mindfulness or relaxation. This is also highlighted by a comparison of our work with a systematic review (Spijkerman, Pots, & Bohlmeijer, 2016) that summarized mindfulness-based interventions for improving mental health. In this work by Spijkerman and colleagues (2016), three studies were included which used online acceptance and commitment therapy interventions that also included mindfulness exercises. Because of our above-mentioned inclusion criteria, we did not include these studies, which illustrates that depending on the set criteria for inclusion, the study selection can differ. Another general limitation of systematic reviews is that by time of publication, new studies have most likely emerged, which are not included in the review. This seems especially true in fields like e- and mHealth, where a lot of studies were done in the last couple of years. The mHealth study that we conducted afterwards has also some strengths and limitations. A strength of our study was that we collected objective data for app use, namely through logging the exercises use for each patient. This method of data collection overcomes possible biases 91 that can occur in self-reports and is very precise, since the exact practice time is logged. Another strength of our study was the applied mixed-methods approach, which has been recommended for the development and evaluation of digital interventions (Michie et al., 2017). We assessed a variety of quantitative data (i.e. health-related outcomes and data on app use) and we conducted qualitative interviews with patients as well as health professionals. This mixed- methods approach allowed us to assess the feasibility of our mHealth study more diversely. Finally, we conducted an intervention with a duration of 20 weeks, which provides a more conclusive picture about the adoption of the intervention compared to shorter studies. Our mHealth study had also several limitations. First, for the evaluation of the intervention adoption, we had to define continuous app users and app non-users. Since we did not have any empirical data regarding a clinically impactful dose of such an mHealth intervention, we defined a continuous app user as a patient, who used at least one app exercise per week. Second, we did not conduct a randomized controlled trial, since we were uncertain if we would be able to recruit enough patients for an adequately powered study. Therefore, we were only able to report within group changes over time for our outcomes of interest. Although these analyses provide information about possible effect, estimates about the effectiveness of the intervention could not be provided. Third, we did not assess if cancer patients were practicing mindfulness or relaxation exercises outside the app or if they did yoga etc., which might be an important confounding variable. 92 5. Conclusions A large body of research shows that a cancer diagnosis, its' treatment and recovery oftentimes lead to considerable amount of psychological distress and reduced quality of life. Although this is recognized and increasing cancer patients' quality of life is an additional desired outcome in cancer patients' treatment, health professionals and patients are confronted with several barriers. To overcome such barriers (e.g. geographical distance to treatment providers, lack of adequate treatments) e- and mHealth interventions have been suggested. The present work makes a valuable contribution in this field of research by summarizing the effectiveness of relaxation-based eHealth interventions and evaluating the feasibility of a mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth app for cancer patients. In our systematic review we concluded that relaxation-based eHealth interventions can be effective in increasing patients' quality of life. However, at the time we conducted the literature search, we did not find any mHealth studies. Therefore, our subsequent mHealth feasibility study contributed to close this gap. In our study, cancer patients received access to a mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth intervention. Our results showed that adoption of the intervention was acceptable and a substantial number of patients used the mHealth interventions over a prolonged period of time. Preliminary results also showed that such an intervention can have positive effects on a variety of health outcomes. Furthermore, patients as well as health professionals rated the app favorably but also gave insightful suggestions for improvement. To conclude, the results of this dissertation demonstrate that a mindfulness- and relaxation-based mHealth app can be a feasible way to deliver those interventions for cancer patients with the aim to increase their quality of life. Since we used a single group design in our study, the effectiveness of mindfulness-and relaxation-based mHealth studies needs to be addressed in future RCTs. Furthermore, we looked at possible predictors for adherence. However, current research regarding predictors for adherence in mHealth interventions is inconclusive. Since adherence is an important prerequisite for an effective intervention, future studies should therefore evaluate this in more detail. 93 References Aboumrad, M., Shiner, B., Riblet, N., Mills, P.
