Finding a good energy bar, granola bar, or a healthy bar, in general, to snack on can be a daunting task. There are a few really great energy bars out there, but many are loaded with sugar. A good general rule with any snack bar (and what I tell my clients looking for nutrition advice) is to look for one with less than 10 grams of sugar, more than four grams of fiber and more than five grams of protein on the nutritional label. The newest whole food trend is energy bars made with few ingredients. I have seen fig and nut bars at organic and gourmet food stores in New York City. With only a few ingredients, organic and gourmet fig bars are easy enough to make. After one trip to Trader Joe's and some experimentation, a three-ingredient energy bar was created. The product resembles a cross between [Gu Energy Gel](http://guenergy.com/store.html/?___SID=U), an energy gel that is popular among endurance athletes and a [Clif Bar](http://www.clifbar.com/). This recipe uses frozen figs, dried figs, sliced almonds and a lot of chia seeds to make a healthy energy bar that is low in sugar and carbohydrates (only two servings!), but high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids. Because the three-ingredient energy bar also contains one-third of your daily recommendation of fiber and plenty of healthy fats, they are the perfect post-workout snack. Alternatively, you can wrap it to carry on the go or serve as a dessert to impress your friends. This recipe can be adjusted to use more almonds and chia seeds to the ratio of figs to make an even lower carbohydrate bar. The only sugar in this recipe comes from the frozen and dried figs. The frozen and dried figs are also sticky to hold the bar together. Serving Size: One 2-inch square Makes: 20 bars 1. Crush sliced almonds by pounding bag with fist. 2.

Tip: If serving this as a dessert, sprinkle some raw cacao powder on top for a chocolate taste without added sugar. For breaking news and live news updates, like us on [ "}
