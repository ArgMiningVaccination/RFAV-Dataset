Pneumococcal vaccination is a method of preventing a specific type of lung infection ( [pneumonia](https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_facts/article.htm)) that is caused by the pneumococcus ( [Streptococcus](https://www.medicinenet.com/streptococcal_infections/article.htm) pneumoniae) bacterium. There are more than 80 different types of pneumococcus bacteria -- 23 of them covered by the [vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm). The vaccine is injected into the body to stimulate the normal immune system to produce antibodies that are directed against pneumococcus bacteria. This method of stimulating the normal immune system to be directed against a specific microbe is called immunization. Pneumococcal vaccination is also referred to as pneumococcal immunization. Pneumococcal vaccination does not protect against [pneumonia](https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_quiz/quiz.htm) caused by microbes other than pneumococcus bacteria, nor does it protect against pneumococcal bacterial [strains](https://www.medicinenet.com/sprained_ankle/article.htm) not included in the vaccine. It is reassuring to note that of the 80 different serotypes, the vast majority of infections are caused by the 23 serotypes contained in the vaccine. In children, especially under 2 years of age, a special conjugated vaccine has been developed to stimulate less-developed immune systems. Originally only covering seven serotypes, the newer vaccine released in 2010 now covers 13 serotypes of the pneumococcus ( [Prevnar pneumococcal vaccination? Pneumococcal vaccination should be considered by people in the following groups: - Adults 65 years of age and older - People > 2 years of age with chronic [heart](https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_how_the_heart_works/article.htm)or lung disorders, including [congestive heart failure](https://www.medicinenet.com/congestive_heart_failure_chf_overview/article.htm), disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease/article.htm)( [COPD](https://www.medicinenet.com/copd_chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease/article.htm)), or [emphysema](https://www.medicinenet.com/emphysema_lung_condition/article.htm) - People > 2 years of age with spleen dysfunction (such as [sickle cell disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/sickle_cell/article.htm)) or lack of spleen function (asplenia), [multiple [kidney failure](https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_failure/article.htm), organ transplantation, or immunosuppressive conditions, including [HIV](https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm)infection - Alaskan natives and certain American Indian populations - If elective surgical removal of the spleen (splenectomy) or immunosuppressive therapy is planned, the vaccine is given two weeks prior to the procedure, if possible. Who should not receive pneumococcal vaccine? What about pregnancy? The [pneumococcal vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumococcal_vaccine-injection/article.htm) should not be received by people with a prior history of hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine. The safety of the pneumococcus vaccine for [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) women has not yet been studied. There is no evidence that the vaccine is harmful to either the mother or the fetus, but pregnant women should consult with their doctor before being vaccinated. Women who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease should be vaccinated before becoming pregnant, if possible. What are side effects of pneumococcal vaccine? Pneumococcal vaccine uncommonly causes side effects. Reported side effects include The adverse effects are similar and minimal, main soreness at the injection site, [fatigue](https://www.medicinenet.com/fatigue/article.htm), [headache](https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm), [chills](https://www.medicinenet.com/chills/symptoms.htm), and diffuse achiness. How is pneumococcal vaccine administered? The pneumococcal vaccine is given as a single injection in adults. The vaccine is injected as a liquid solution of 0.5 mL into the muscle (intramuscular or IM), typically deltoid muscle, or under the skin (subcutaneous or SC). The area injected is typically disinfected by rubbing [alcohol](https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_metabolism/article.htm) onto the skin prior to the injection. - The conjugated Prevnar 13 vaccine is given as a series of four injections in children. - People vaccinated prior to age 65 should be vaccinated at age 65 if five or more years have passed since the first dose. - For people with a lack of spleen function (such as in sickle cell disease or after spleen removal), transplant patients, patients with chronic [kidney disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm), immunosuppressed or immunodeficient people, and others at the highest risk of fatal infection, a second dose should be given at least five years after the first dose.

When indicated, [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm) should be administered to patients with unknown vaccination status. All residents of [nursing](https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm) homes and other long-term care facilities should have their vaccination status assessed and documented. How long must a person wait to receive other vaccinations? Inactivated [influenza](https://www.medicinenet.com/influenza/article.htm) vaccine and [tetanus](https://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus/article.htm) [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm) may be given at the same time as or at any time before or after a dose of the pneumococcus vaccine. There are no requirements to wait between the doses of these or any other inactivated [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/childhood_vaccination_schedule/article.htm). Recommended pneumococcal vaccination schedule In July 2000, the American Academy of [Pediatrics](https://www.medicinenet.com/childrens_health/article.htm) (AAP) and the CDC jointly recommended childhood pneumococcal immunization, since pneumococcal infections are the most common invasive [bacterial infections](https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_infections_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) in children in the United States. \"The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV13 or Prevnar 13, is currently recommended for all children younger than 5 years of age, all adults 65 years or older, and persons 6 through 64 years of age with certain medical conditions,\" according to the 2014 AAP/CDC guidelines. - \"Pneumovax is a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) that is currently recommended for use in all adults 65 years of age or older and for persons who are 2 years and older and at high risk for pneumococcal disease (e.g., those with sickle cell disease, [HIV](https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)infection, or other immunocompromising conditions). - PPSV23 is also recommended for use in adults 19 through 64 years of age who smoke cigarettes or who have [asthma](https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_overview/article.htm).\" Recommended for pneumococcal vaccine schedule for adults - Patients who are healthy and have never received the pneumococcal [pneumonia](https://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)vaccine (PPSV23), if equal to or older than 65 years of age, should receive the PCV13 first and then within six months to a one-year receive the PPSV23. - Those who have already received the PPSV23 should get the PCV13 about one year later. - If the person received the PPSV23 over five years earlier, they essentially should be treated as if they never received the vaccine, getting the PCV13 injection, followed about six to 13 months later by the PPSV23. - In general, there seems to be a better immune response to the overlapping 13 strains of pneumococcus if the PCV13 is received first. - The adverse effects are similar and minimal, with main soreness at the injection site, [fatigue](https://www.medicinenet.com/causes_of_fatigue_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), [headache](https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), chills, and diffuse achiness.

Vaccinations included on the childhood immunization schedule include Hib, polio, DTaP, MMR, HPV, flu, chickenpox, meningitis, rotavirus, pneumonia, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Symptoms, Causes, Stages, TreatmentCongestive heart failure (CHF) refers to a condition in which the heart loses the ability to function properly. Heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathies are just a few potential causes of congestive heart failure. Signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure may include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, angina, and edema. Physical examination, patient history, blood tests, and imaging tests are used to diagnose congestive heart failure. Treatment of heart failure consists of lifestyle modification and taking medications to decrease fluid in the body and ease the strain on the heart. The prognosis of a patient with congestive heart failure depends on the stage of the heart failure and the overall condition of the individual. Diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2)Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. The two types of diabetes are referred to as type 1 (insulin dependent) and type 2 (non-insulin dependent). Symptoms of diabetes include increased urine output, thirst, hunger, and fatigue. Treatment of diabetes depends on the type. Vaccination Schedule for Adults and AdolescentsImmunizations can prevent many diseases nowadays. It's important to follow the vaccination guidelines recommended on the CDC's vaccination schedule for adults and adolescents in order to stay informed about new vaccines and to learn how often and when the vaccines should be administered. Kidney (Renal) Failure Kidney failure can occur from an acute event or a chronic condition or disease. Prerenal kidney failure is caused by blood loss, dehydration, or medication. Some of the renal causes of kidney failure include sepsis, medications, rhabdomyolysis, multiple myeloma, and acute glomerulonephritis. Post renal causes of kidney failure include bladder obstruction, prostate problems, tumors, or kidney stones.Treatment options included diet, medications, or dialysis. LeukemiaLeukemia is a type of cancer of the blood cells in which the growth and development of the blood cells are abnormal. Strictly speaking, leukemia should refer only to cancer of the white blood cells (the leukocytes) but in practice, it can apply to malignancy of any cellular element in the blood or bone marrow, as in red cell leukemia (erythroleukemia). PneumoniaPneumonia is inflammation of the lungs caused by fungi, bacteria, or viruses. Symptoms and signs include cough, fever, shortness of breath, and chills. Antibiotics treat pneumonia, and the choice of the antibiotic depends upon the cause of the infection. Do I Have Pneumonia QuizPneumonia can be deadly. Take the Pneumonia Quiz on MedicineNet to learn more about this highly contagious, infectious disease. Skin RashThe word \"rash\" means an outbreak of red bumps on the body. The way people use this term, \"a rash\" can refer to many different skin conditions. The most common of these are scaly patches of skin and red, itchy bumps or patches all over the place. What Are the Side Effects of the Pneumonia Vaccine?The pneumonia vaccine can help protect against pneumococcal infections. Learn what the pneumonia vaccine is all about, and what to do if you experience side effects. Pneumonia is an infection in your lungs that is usually caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. When Is a Thoracentesis Procedure Performed?Thoracentesis is a bedside medical procedure used to drain fluid from the space between your chest wall and lungs (the pleural cavity) for analysis. Removing the excess fluid provides relief from the associated symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest discomfort. Conditions for which thoracentesis is used include pleural effusion associated with congestive heart failure, empyema, pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs), cancer, pulmonary hypertension, and pneumonia.
