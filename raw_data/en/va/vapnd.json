The EPA describes IPM as \"an environmentally friendly, common-sense approach to controlling pests.\" When warranted, we apply treatments that work but are pet-friendly when applied correctly, as long as a few simple guidelines are followed: 1. Keep pets out of treatment areas until applications have dried. 2. Remove pet beds, toys, food and water bowls from treated areas for a few hours. 2.Use the least toxic formulation that will get the job done.
