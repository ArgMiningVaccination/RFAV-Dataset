He described it as an innocent state of awareness that is wild and free, completely awake and fresh.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 6 By Laurel Decker Hogge I'm over a mile into my morning jog... the distance it takes for my body to stop complaining and just let the endorphins do the work. Pink is turned up all the way in my headphones, and my feet are locked in with the beat. I'm in the best mood. So I'm not even annoyed as I near a crosswalk and slow down just in case I have to wait for oncoming traffic. A car approaches, and I hear a short honk. Interpreting it as a warning that they intend to keep moving, I completely stop to show that I'm not going to run in front of their car. They give another little honk, and I realize it's a friendly nudge telling me to go ahead and cross. They stop. I wave a quick \"thank you\" and resume with Pink and endorphins. I'm a few strides away from the crosswalk when I hear another horn. This one is louder and held longer, and it's coming from the big black truck that had to stop behind the driver who kindly waited for me to cross. The guy driving the truck was not in the mood for all of this small town politeness. Feeling a bit stunned by the noise, I try to figure out if he was angry at me for crossing, or angry at the person who stopped in front of him to allow me to cross. As the truck's engine revs to pick up speed, I turn my body fully toward the angry man, spread my arms out dramatically, and yell, \"REALLY?! IT'S A CROSSWALK!!!\" He keeps driving. I go back to jogging. But now I am very annoyed because that dude just killed the blissful high I built up in my first mile. But then I feel a new rush building inside me. I had just done something I would have never imagined doing two years ago. I just spoke up for myself. No\u2014I yelled up for myself\u2014at a big man who was angry that I inconvenienced him. Without any fear whatsoever, I had turned my 5'5\" body straight toward him and exclaimed that I had a right to be on that crosswalk and a right to make him wait for me. As my feet find a cadence with the beat once again, I think about the past two years. Two years of transition out of a fundamental religion that had formed the core of my identity for 38 years. Growing up in a community established by my Mormon pioneer ancestors, I proudly believed my life's purpose was to be worthy of eternal approval from God. And to earn that approval, I needed to follow the direction of men appointed to speak for Him as prophets and leaders. I felt privileged to have such specific instruction on how to be a righteous young woman, knowing it would prepare me to marry a righteous young man in a Mormon temple. Everything went as planned, and I met him at Brigham Young University. In a temple marriage ceremony, my husband was given the responsibility of keeping me on the path to eternal salvation. Together we observed the counsel to have as many children as possible, and the first of our four kids was a honeymoon baby. Throughout our marriage, we continued attending multiple weekly church meetings, following guidelines on how to dress, paying tithing, avoiding swear words, and never drinking alcohol or coffee. I still find it hard to explain why I allowed myself to examine my deeply-rooted beliefs. It's even more difficult to explain the complete collapse of my sense of identity once I realized I could no longer hold those beliefs. As I tried to embrace new freedoms and release familiar habits, I felt like a stranger to myself. It was during the darkest time in my faith transition that I first walked into a yoga studio. My eyes followed the canvas-white walls from one pretty decorative accent to another, finally landing on a shelf of rolled white towels with a cheerfully framed message urging everyone to \"Please kindly take one f#*$%ing towel.\" I blushed out of pious reflex as I took one f#*$%ing towel and turned toward the yoga room door.Pulling my mat closer to my chest, I tried to politely push through the crowd of strangers blocking the entrance to where I would find dark and quiet safety. I tried not to seem out of place as women all around me chattered, hugged, and excitedly greeted each other. I kept encouraging myself not to turn around and leave, and told myself that just past that door I could roll out my mat and be alone. I was making slow progress toward the door when I found out what was holding everyone up. Right at the entrance was a woman laughing hysterically and hugging people. Her energy was massive. It was loud. My first response was to be annoyed by her and all of these noisy, affectionate, happy women. My reaction was confusing, but at that time I felt like nothing made sense. In the following months I went to many excruciating therapy sessions with a woman who guided my healing process without judgment. I spent a lot of time in nature, learning a new foundation for personal spirituality. I attended yoga religiously. I did all of these things not only because I needed the physical momentum to keep from giving in to depression, but because I was determined to make sense of the chaos inside me. To fix the broken, to turn and face my fears directly so I could release them, and to move forward into spaces where I knew I belonged. Through my own healing process, I bonded with other women bravely doing their own soul work. I came to understand my first experience in the studio when I felt an aversion to the energy of the women around me and wanted to be in my own silent space. Emotional pain is hard to articulate, and I felt I couldn't possibly be understood. But over time, as I vocalize my experiences, I rediscover lost pieces of myself. It was in a therapy session that I casually explained that I had taken an oath when I was 21 years old to \"avoid all light-mindedness and loud laughter.\" I never considered Mormonism strict or difficult to live, but my high school friends and college roommates would tell you if there was ever loud laughter happening, I was usually involved. Over time I was able to stifle my sense of humor just enough to keep from feeling guilty for not observing that oath. In my transition away from my religion, I enrolled in yoga teacher training with hopes of rebuilding my personal spirituality. It was lead by the same woman who proudly displayed a sign with the F-word in her studio, and Finding My Voice I had just done something I would have never imagined doing two years ago. I just spoke up for myself. The first time I went to a yoga studio was during the darkest part of my journey away from that identity, and I had felt like a stranger to myself.My first response was to be annoyed by her and all of these noisy, affectionate, happy women. I did all of these things not only because I needed the physical momentum to keep from succumbing to depression, but because I was determined to make sense of the chaos inside me.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 7 who kept me waiting to enter the door that first day in her class. I had no idea that her dynamic, and sometimes inappropriate, energy was exactly what I needed to release that guilt. Today, hearing myself laugh hysterically with family and friends is just one reason I am grateful to be on this complex journey back to myself. I'm nearing the parking lot, so I slow to a stop and begin recovery stretches. I love the way my breathing and pulse settle into a calm rhythm after a demanding workout. I inhale and clasp my hands behind my back, exhale, and fold forward. I allow my body to soften into this pose... heart open and head bowed... a lovely image of pride and humility. I am proud of my own courage to get to this point, and I am humbled by the women who helped to amplify my voice. I feel like a lioness who has just shown herself as a fearless monarch and is now resting contently among her pride. I smile to myself and recall that Leo is my astrology sign, and suddenly I'm curious about this animal. I get into my car and do an internet search on \"Why do lions roar?\"... Lions roar to tell other lions where they are... When lions greet each other and play together, they make lots of silly noises\u2014like hums and puffs\u2014to show they are happy. (lionalert.com) Makes perfect sense to me. I exhale a peaceful hum and start my car to drive home.Laurel Decker Hogge is a yoga instructor, artist, and wellness guide in Brighton.

Try it as many times as you think necessary. Then ask yourself, and yourself alone... Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good. If it doesn't, it is of no use.\" \u2014Carlos Castaneda Dr. Roxane Chan has been a nurse all of her career. She knew that she wanted to be a nurse early on, and even though, as she says, she was na\u00efve and idealistic, somehow she also knew that nursing was a key part of her emotional and spiritual journey. She sees her role as nurse as a vocation, as a piece of who she is, rather than merely what she does for a living. Chan grew up on the south side of Chicago in a family with a mixture of joys and dysfunction. \"In my young life, with the struggles in my family, I didn't see a clear path to happiness and wellness, until I discovered nursing. Somehow I knew that nursing was going to be my path from dysfunction to health.\" Chan has strong Italian roots and a deep faith shaped by her upbringing and broadened by her life experiences. She tells the stories of how two key women in her life set her on a spiritual and an intellectual path, and helped her link head and heart in all that she does. Her Aunt Shirley gave her books about strong women and encouraged her to read and to learn, giving her a very different message than she received from her teachers and parents. Neither her high school teachers nor her parents expected her to go to college, nor did they encourage her. She sent her own applications off and surprised them all when she was accepted into Northern Illinois University. Four years later, she received her bachelors degree in nursing, and again surprised everyone when she graduated with honors. \"My parents were continually startled throughout my graduation ceremony, because I kept standing up as they called my name for honors. In contrast, they were very excited that I was in the NIU Marching Band, and told their friends with pride of that achievement.\" Submitting her own college applications, and following through on her acceptance into college by going, was the first time that Chan can remember advocating for herself and charting a course with intention and conviction. The second woman of note in Chan's life was her neighbor Angie, who shared her spiritual practices openly, and showed Chan for the first time that there were women priests. Although they didn't call themselves that, she recognized Angie as a spiritual teacher and watched her carefully. Angie burned palms and said prayers in such a way that it helped Chan begin to create her own rituals. She was raised in the Catholic church and was drawn to the practices of that faith that gave her peace and a firm foundation.She went to public school, but for first communion and confirmation classes the public school students joined the Catholic School preparations. The Catholic School children all wrote \"JMJ\" at the end of their names on the top of their papers (for Jesus, Mary, and Joseph). Chan wanted to write these initials too, but they weren't allowed to do so at the public school. She used to say the rosary every night before bed. \"We learned that if you fell asleep before you finished the rosary prayer, your guardian angel would finish it. That was magical to me, and I believed it.\" Her experience at the Catholic School was so compelling that she wanted to be there every day, to be with the nuns. As a grown woman, Chan continues to be a woman of ritual\u2014she knows how to set a sacred space and how to hold that space. When I asked her about this, she said that it started at a young age. She would go to church for the special prayers, and she loved to spend time with the nuns. She remembers only kindness from the nuns, and their calm, patient demeanor. These women were the antithesis of what she had at home, and she found comfort and peace there. She told of how she would soothe Her Aunt Shirley gave her books about strong women and encouraged her to read and to learn, giving her a very different message than she received from her teachers and parents. Submitting her own college applications, and following through on her acceptance into college by going, was the first time that Chan can remember advocating for herself and charting a course with intention and conviction. Roxane Chan A Warrior's Path Continued on next pageArtwork by Caitlyn MuncyThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 10 herself by reciting the rosary, and how at a young age she would pray for others using the rosary. While Catholicism is not the faith that she practices now, Mary and the Rosary are still important parts of her spirituality. Chan's journey in nursing has always included care for the marginalized populations and care for the caregivers themselves, and she has committed her life to working for social change. Early in Chan's career she was the Nurse Manager at the County Hospital in East Los Angeles, and she is proud to have been part of creating an award-winning unit in the face of low/no funding and minimal basic necessities (no clean water to drink, no air conditioning in the hottest months). Her work with this unit transformed them into a team that was called on to train other teams across the country. \"It all started with a large piece of butcher paper hung on the wall with one question: What would you like to learn?\" Chan said. \"I was thinking they would answer with skills they wanted to learn, but the nurses took the question broader and wrote all kinds of things on this large piece of paper.\" Chan went on to say, \"Once this happened, and I saw that there was a lot of valuable information written down, they began to trust me, and we began to listen to each other and talk to each other. No one had ever asked them for their thoughts and ideas before, and I opened the flood gates. Talking and listening to each other matters!\" Chan has continued to broaden her \"lane\" from patient care, to nurse care, to teaching nurses about advocating for patients and being present to patients in a way that only nurses have the opportunity for and considering nursing as a vocation with breadth. She did all of this through her work as an Assistant Professor at Michigan State University in the College of Nursing. She tried to convey her experiences in such a way that the students who were training to become nurses didn't miss the beauty, complexity, and importance of their role as caregiver. \"As nurses we get to be in situations that are very intimate with patients when it comes to wound care and care for their bodies and our presence in their time of need.\" Chan got misty-eyed as she tried to convey this complex idea of presence and continued by saying, \"I could sit for days and days and think of one beautiful, powerful, meaningful exchange after another. It has been such a privilege to be with people in this way. In our medical model today, the newest nurses could miss this beauty, and I don't want them to miss it\u2014to overlook the things that remind us that we are all connected.\" After six years at MSU, Chan has finished her time in this role. In reflecting on the things that she is really proud of accomplishing at MSU, she cites examples like how she used innovative and creative methods to teach integral processes for patient care and the medical team approach. She started a holistic student retreat that gave the students the building blocks for not only patient care, but key ingredients and encouragement for self-care. She used her love of, and extensive experience with, drumming circles to teach the students the \"Team Steps\" process for calling out when they recognize that something isn't going right in a patient care process. The drumming circle gives them practice in making \"a big noise stop and using their own voice to name what they see is happening.\" In a drumming circle, even though the students felt silly sometimes, she had them all (30 plus students at a time) on drums, drumming together, making a big noise and then one by one, they made a grand gesture with their arms or their vocal voice to make the sounds stop. Then, to get the sound restarted they shared a rhythm on their drum that they have made up (representing their own voice), everyone repeats that rhythm before continuing around the circle, giving each student practice to stop the loud noise and start with their own \"voice\" (drum). Because the students mentioned her name repeatedly, it peaked the Dean's interest enough to seek out Roxane and ask about her creative teaching methods. This gave Chan comfort and lifts her heart when reflecting on her time at MSU. It is confirmation that the students were understanding her message. She has been glad to be a voice in the MSU program. She has been told that she is \"too creative\" on more than one occasion. Chan takes that as a compliment. As she contemplates this time of transition, Chan feels a new wave of work rising, which she calls \"Warrior Nurses.\" She doesn't see this as a training, but more of a movement\u2014a movement that, in her minds-eye, has thousands of nurses wearing Warrior Nurses T-shirts and showing fierce compassion for themselves, their patients, their fellow nurses, and society as a whole. In the workplace, a Warrior Nurse would take the time that they need to eat, go to the bathroom (there are many circumstances where nurses go long periods of time without ever relieving themselves), and the time needed to be present with each patient\u2014fully present. Warrior Nurses would meet difficult circumstances with compassion and be present to themselves and others more fully. \"Holding a space of peace is much harder than war or conflict.\" Chan is a Mindfulness Self Compassion (MSC) trainer and sees this as key to not only caring for patients, but caring for ourselves. \"Acceptance, or meeting people where they are, can only happen because I can meet myself where I am.\" Chan says that \"the connections of past experiences with current moments are often surprising. Seemingly random opportunities come back to be meaningful in a current experience.\" Navigating transition times takes a lot of energy when done with integrity and intention. She is opting to, as she said, \"Go back to the building block skills of first things first\" and ask herself the question,\"What do I need to do right now?\" over and over again. Chan marvels at all of her years of nursing care and at her evolution as a nurse, mother, teacher, mentor, companion, and sponsor. A clear path doesn't necessarily mean a direct path. In Dr. Roxane Chan's life, the only clear path was in nursing, which helped her move from dysfunction to wellness, from the shifting sands of a life in an unstable home to the foundation-building experiences from which she will launch into her next endeavor. She is a Warrior Nurse on a clear path to changing the world one encounter at a time. Roxane Raffin Chan, PhD, RN, AHN-BC is currently working at Cristo Rey Community Organization as program director and is a member of an eight-person CREDO faculty team providing wellness conferences for Episcopal clergy through the Episcopal Church Pension Group.

Local food and the local food economy have grown in Michigan over the last decade, and the Ann Arbor Farmers Market features new farmers every year, but there are other needs and areas that could benefit from using the same lens. Clothing is one of them. Clothing ourselves is a necessity for some and a passion for others, but however you see it, we could all benefit from asking the questions, \"Where did this come from? Who made it? And how?\" Fast fashion, like fast food, is not healthy, but unfortunately, it is what our clothing industry has become, and our closets are bursting from it. If you doubt this, watch an episode of \"Marie Kondo\" or \"Tiny House Nation\" to see beds piled with clothes, overstuffed dresser drawers, and relationships strained over closet space. This article isn't trying to guilt you into decluttering, but rather encourage you to look at what lies underneath (besides underwear). We think our clothes are cheap, yet if you look at how often you wear that \"so cheap\" shirt or pants, it is actually more expensive than you think\u2014a $20 shirt worn twice costs you $10 a wear, versus a $40 shirt worn ten times, which would cost you $4 per wear. The expense isn't only in your pocketbook, though. Textile production produces 1.2 billion tons of CO2 per year, contributing to global warming. If your shirt is made with synthetic materials (like polyester), it sheds every time you wash it, creating micro-plastic lint that will eventually show up in your drinking water and your body. Clothing ourselves is a necessity for some and a passion for others, but however you see it, we could all benefit from asking the questions, \"Where did this come from? Who made it? And how?\" Continued on page 12 Love Notes Sweater at SPUNAll the women pictured are employees of Detroit Denim wearing the DDCO. Button Down Denim Knee Length Skirt.For example, take the T-shirt I recently purchased: 50% polyester (plastic), 25% cotton, 25% rayon (wood pulp\u2014contributing to deforestation and processed with the known toxins carbon disulfide and sulfuric acid) and made in Nicaragua. Who picked the cotton, wove the fabric, or sewed the seams? Twenty-one million people are engaged in forced labor, and 55% of those are women, as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor. According to the 2019 Fashion Transparency Index, a rating of 200 global producers including Adidas, Patagonia, and H&M, only five companies scored above 60% on issues of transparency of labor and environmental impacts in their supply chain, and no company scored greater than 70%. With these kinds of statistics, local clothing makes sense. Going local implicitly contains the ability of the consumer to know more about the company. Local is not a simple remedy, but rather a step toward accountability, responsibility, and knowledge about who, where, and how the clothes we wear are made, how workers are treated, and what by-products are created. In addition, local adds to our economic diversity and tax base, creating a stable community. When I looked for locally produced clothing, the first place I decided to start was with a raw material: wool fiber at SPUN. Carol and Pete Sickman-Garner opened SPUN three years ago on the south side of Kerrytown overlooking the Ann Arbor Farmers Market. Before that Carol was an editor and Pete was at Zingerman's. They wanted something different, something they could do together. After talking with the Brinkerhoff's (owners of the Argus Farm Stop), digging in and doing research, and finding that there was no fiber store in town, they opened their doors.When I asked Carol and Pete about local sourcing, it was immediately clear this is not a straightforward answer. \"Fleece to needle is the way people talk about it,\" said Carol. \"We have a fair amount of yarn in the shop that can be traced back to the ranch and through every step of the production process. It's all manufactured here in the U.S.A. Some of it is at a pretty low price range, some mid-range, and some of it's quite high.\" Not everything in the shop meets this standard because the Sickman-Garners wanted to meet the needs of as many customers as possible. \"We've always wanted to make sure that we think about inclusivity in a lot of ways like age and gender,\" said Carol. \"We also think about economic inclusivity, and we want the shop to be a place where we can set people up with yarn at their price point.\" Pete brought up another aspect when he mentioned hand-dyed yarn. \"We love the yarn they're using to dye, but we can't necessarily say exactly where it came from.\" Yet, they find value in supporting what are often small, women-owned businesses. They also sell small wooden tags that say \"Made in Michigan\" that can be sewn onto garments to identify \"that it was handmade, that it had a source and location,\" said Pete. He added, \"I don't think I appreciated enough how much went into all the things Carol knit for me, Lily, and Robin (the Sickman-Garners' daughters) over the years until I started working here.\" The Sickman-Garners' commitment to making wool, and all the objects one can make with it, accessible to all is evident in the shop. Carol mentioned a movement within the fiber community toward inclusivity of all people, and in support of that SPUN features patterns, hand-dyers, and samples from designers who don't fit the white middle-aged female stereotype. Several male knitters visit the shop, and Pete, who is learning to knit, admires a fellow male staff member he calls \"extremely talented.\" Making things also creates a community, because of the time involved, so SPUN has a seating area where knitters and those who crochet can sit, chat, and enjoy being together. \"Making something and giving it to someone,\" Carol said, \"feels different from buying something and giving it.\" While knitting allows one outlet for responsibly sourcing your clothing, sewing allows another. Tooya Ritchey is an Ann Arbor native who returned home after years in the fashion industry in New York. In 1999, she and her husband, Leif, moved to New York City and connected with other artists. They began experimenting with clothing, using natural colors and untreated materials, adding handwork, and sewing individual pieces. If you remember fashion at the turn of the century, such details, now ubiquitous, were unheard of. They joined Johanna Hofring at the Art Fiend Foundation on the lower east side, which Ritchey described as \"a very Swedish aesthetic. The floor was unfinished wood and we had a tree branch hung with clothes. We received a lot of press. It was a really fun, inspiring time, and you could just make something and hang it up [for sale].\" Eventually buyers came to the store, leading the couple to create seasonal lines, then a showroom, and increase production. Production as two people proved a challenge, however, and Leif and Tooya followed their creativity to other fields: Leif to painting and Ritchey to producing fashion shows and working for Yohji Yamamoto. The birth of her son, Theo, caused Ritchey to return to making and creating clothing. \"I really liked the feeling of making clothes for him. It was really satisfying to get so tiny. [With] a T-shirt, you can make ten out of a yard, and it costs a 10th [of retail]. I like them to be comfortable and organic.\" As Theo grew older, organic clothing in his size was still available, but Ritchey said, \"I got so much joy out of making things and being able to make them exactly to my own specifications.\" Ritchey also made small animals out of the scraps, and these are the focus of her online shop, rosietooya. com. She also met Amanda Cinco-Hoyt, one of the founders of Colorwheel (see the article in The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal Issue #73), and connected with The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 12 Locally Sourced Clothing Continued from page 11 Carol and Pete Sickman-Garner opened SPUN three years ago on the south side of Kerrytown overlooking the Ann Arbor Farmers Market.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 13 local textile makers. Organics have long been a priority for Tooya, and most of those textiles come from overseas. Not all producers have a transparent supply chain, so Ritchey found herself attracted to \"this person actually made this cloth, or they've spun this yarn, and then I'm using it\" as part of her greater world view. \"The more I get into it, the further I want to go. When I'm using things that are [transparent], I can feel more relaxed because I know that no one along the line has been injured in any way.\" Ritchey continued her thinking, \"How can you live lightly on the earth? I was thinking about sustainability. What is it to really be sustainable, and is sustainable enough, or do we have to be more like regenerative? Sustainable is a good starting point to stop doing lots of damage. But I think a lot of sustainable is just trying to do less damage. To me, it's how can you do no damage and then how can you do good? How can what you're doing actually leave more beauty, or be better for having been farmed, or better for having been made?\" This exact question is the premise behind Fibershed, an experiment expanded into reality. Founder Rebecca Burgess decided to source her clothing for one year from her local community in northern California. Burgess, a dyer and fiber artist, discovered vast gaps that led her to creating Fibershed, now a non-profit with affiliates around the country, including the Great Lakes. A fibershed, like a foodshed or a watershed, describes a particular geographic area from which a community sources its needs; in this case, clothing. The vision is bold: to create economic, environmental, and community prosperity around the production and creation of textiles. To educate their audience, Fibershed produces a PDF download \"Clothing Guide: A Menu of Actions and Options\" to guide consumers to learn, think, and purchase from companies that are using some of their methods and principles. Included in that list are three Michigan-based companies: Conscious Clothing in Belmont, Detroit Denim in Detroit, and Maggie's Organics in Dexter.

AwArene SS, CoMPASS ion, And wiSdoM However, part of changing the model means changing the way we evaluate our clothes. Using the idea of \"price per wear,\" let's look at those $215 Detroit Denim jeans. If you purchase a pair of jeans that you wear twice a week for five years, your cost is less than two dollars per wear. I asked Yelsma if he had ever worn out a pair of jeans. \"Heck yeah,\" he replied. \"I wear them every day, so I go through a pair in a year. They are 100% cotton and will wear out.\" His price per wear (given 365 days of wear) is 60 cents. Given that 60% of all clothing is discarded within the same year, these jeans saved you money, shopping time, transportation costs, provided fair labor, and reduced your carbon and ecological footprint. Clothing made in this way does have a high dollar cost, not because of branding or marketing, but because of manufacturing: water usage, dye impact, and labor are all accommodated for in the price of the garment, not hidden or displaced. We pay for water treatment for our drinking water because we dump waste in it; we pay for landfills because we dispose of items that are broken, non-recyclable, or no longer cared for, we pay for government to monitor air quality. Transparent supply chains that allowed consumers to think about the bigger impact of their purchases could possibly reduce all of those costs. Yet economically, locally sourced clothing isn't feasible for everyone. But as models switch over and economies of scale come into play, costs change. Finally, there is the question of human trafficking. Around the globe, women and children are forced to work in textile manufacturing and agriculture. According to End Slavery Now, 1.4 million Uzbek children are forced to pick cotton for clothing. More children are indentured to textile manufacturing than the number of children enrolled in the New York public school system. End Slavery Now offers an online calculator to find out your slavery footprint and offers actions individuals and businesses can take to help end slavery. In the face of all these conundrums, Ritchey said, \"It's overwhelming. I feel overwhelmed sometimes when I'm trying to buy organically and then you hear there's this whole thing you'd hadn't even considered. Or we're going to use organic cotton. A really good thing, right? But it takes too much water. Where do you even begin? That's why I'm saying just begin somewhere, do what you can, get inspired, and have fun thinking of ways to be zero waste.\" All of these individuals and businesses are, as Yelsma said in the video, \"trying to create a new apparel model that's not so gross.\" And there are more benefits possible than cleaner air, water, and fair labor. As SPUN's Carol Sickman-Garner said, \"Another benefit of knitting is learning to accept the imperfections in life. Because you make mistakes and it's not the end of the world. You can fix some, or you can adapt accordingly.\" In our current whirlwind of culture change, the ability to adapt may be the greatest benefit of all.

On their website each item has measurements for the garment offered. For example, the very cute Revolution Dress size XS measures Bust 35 / Hip 40.5 / Sleeve Length 12.5 / Leng th 36. Measurements are given for each size up to XL. You can customize the item for an additional $20 fee.

Maggie's Organics goes further, offering \"Behind the Label\" tabs on every item that they create, listing NGOs, mill names, their third party verification companies, and even information on transparency and credibility. Conscious Clothing lists shops that carry their products, while Maggie's can be found in major retailers such as Whole Foods. Detroit Denim, founded in 2010, has a storefront and factory in the Riverfront Warehouse District on Detroit's lower east side, not far from Belle Isle. When I spoke with founder Eric Yelsma, he told me the company employs ten people and is vertically integrated, meaning they design the patterns, manufacture the items, and sell their own brand. In following this model, Detroit Denim is acting more like an haute couture house than a modern retailer. Contrast that with what Yelsma calls \"contract manufacturing,\" also known as \"outsourcing,\" the typical model in clothing manufacturing. Outsourcing decreases costs, but also decreases control of quality and process, creating the obfuscating system the textile industry currently uses. According to a video on their website, all materials are domestically sourced, and Yelsma acknowledges that \"there's a premium to that.\" Which explains the $215 price tag.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 14 Locally Sourced Clothing Continued from page 13 Transparent supply chains that allowed consumers to think about the bigger impact of their purchases could possibly reduce all of those costs. \"Another benefit of knitting is learning to accept the imperfections in life.

I was west of Chelsea, visiting the Great Lakes Herb Faire. The Faire provides classes for herbal and naturopathic practitioners and students, shared ceremony, and time for community meeting. Successful since it began in 2014, the Faire draws herbalists from around the country to speak and present, but its focus remains the Great Lakes region, its plants, and practitioners. Since its inception the Faire has been held at Cedar Lake Outdoor Center, on the west side of Chelsea, only a ten-minute drive from Interstate 94. Tall white pines and mature deciduous forest surround wood cabins separated by green lawn, and connect to a wildflower-edged lake. I parked and was immediately greeted by Colleen, one of the many volunteers who make the Faire happen. She checked me in, gave me Caitlin Potere's beautiful Faire guidebook, and sent me over to the Pavilion \u2014the largest white tent of many\u2014where people in layered clothing sat in folding chairs. A fire burned nearby, welcome on the cool morning, and other participants sat around it. All was quiet except for the high-pitched voices of children over the hill and the day's keynote speaker, Margi Flint, at the front of the tent. Flint appeared as one might imagine an herbalist: long white hair to her waist, loose and flowing, with scarves and tunics layered over leggings, and sturdy lace-up boots. Her practice is in Massachusetts, and along with running her clinic, Flint has taught at Tufts Medical School. She is one of the elders of the profession, and her speech\u2014aptly titled \"Lessons from an Elder Earth Momma\"\u2014exhorted her colleagues to persist in the face of challenges. She related an anecdote about her first time teaching at Tufts. She was aware that she was moving in a different sphere from the usual, and knew the limits and legalities of herbalism, since only physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners are allowed to diagnose and prescribe medication to patients. Given this, she had titled her course \"Herbal Treatments for Organ Systems.\" However, when she got to Tufts, she saw that the sign on the door said \"Herbal Medicine.\" The audience laughed as she said, \"Everyone knows who we are. Herbs are the people's medicine.\" She concluded her talk by saying, \"Stand in your power, stand with the plants, share the love.\" After the applause the audience gradually dispersed, but there was no need to hurry. My schedule listed a comfortable forty-five minutes before my next chosen session: \"Marketplace, Silent Auction/Mingling.\" No rushing was necessary. All my other Who sings to the plants That are grown for our plates? - Joy HarjoBy Kirsten Mowrey \"Everyone knows who we Herbs are people's medicine.\" \u2014 Margi Flint \"It's very welcoming here\u2014herbalists are different, this kind of local and regional thing makes you feel less alone.\" \u2014 Brook e Sackenheim Workshop leader jim mcdonald (4th from left) with some of his students. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 17 conferences required hustling from event to event, like being in high school, leaving no time to make a contact, follow up with a speaker, or continue an interesting conversation. Moving to a human-dictated, not technologically-based pace, was part of the pleasure of the Faire, and conveyed respect, dignity, and a welcoming atmosphere throughout my visit. At the fire I met Nia Aguirre, a naturopath who works at Castle Remedies, in Ann Arbor, and her friends and colleagues Helen Kociba, from Midland, and Rebecca Culley-Healey, from Fenton. All three have attended the Faire since its inception. I asked how the Faire has changed since the first year. Kociba replied that the first year was \"fun and exciting, but they have more speakers now, more clinical classes, all the bases.\" Culley-Healey agreed, noting that they have nailed down the details and that it runs more smoothly. All three agreed that community is the draw for them and is what keeps them attending, in addition to the spiritual and ceremonial aspects. I drifted from tent to tent observing the courses. In the Pavilion, Guido Mas\u00e9, from Vermont, lectured on \"Herbs for Cognition, Focus, and Brain Health.\" Guido was direct, intense, and a fast-paced speaker, with a PowerPoint presentation full of slides featuring brains, brain scans, and data. He talked about the clinical protocol for concussion, stroke, and dementia and contrasted that with a wellness protocol for function and performance. His presentation would fit seamlessly at any university medical school. In the yurt, clinician Maria No\u00ebl Groves, from New Hampshire, also used PowerPoint with anatomical slides and data on the topic of \"Herbal and Natural Support for Thyroid Health.\" While the Faire is open to the public, both of these courses were aimed at professionals treating patients, rather than for the purposes of self care or learning about the herbs themselves. For those classes, I moved on to a smaller tent where local herbalist and Faire co-founder jim mcdonald (who prefers lower case letters when writing his name) was talking with Friday's keynote speaker, Althea Northage-Orr, from Chicago. On the table in front of them they had a variety of tinctures\u2014herbs preserved in alcohol and typically administered by drops\u2014all for use as nervines. Nervines are herbs that affect the nervous system, either by toning, calming, or relaxing. Northage-Orr picked up a tincture, read the name, and lectured on how she used it while the sample was passed around for people to smell, taste, and note its effects for themselves. Jim added his knowledge, and then he picked an herb and the cycle began again. People have taught each other this way about the uses and dangers of herbs for thousands of years, and in rural communities in Africa, Asia, and South America they still do. According to Kew Gardens's 2017 State of the World's Plants report, at least 28,187 plants are documented for medicinal use for humans. Down by the lake, the members of Abby Artemisia's class on fall foraging stood along the lake's edge, taking notes as she stroked goldenrod flowers. From North Carolina, Artemisia wears the essentials I saw others wearing here: long pants, long sleeves, lace up shoes, and a knife sheathed at her waist. The sky cleared and sun shone down on her as she recommended goldenrod in fall as the antidote to ragweed allergies. People scribbled in notebooks, asked questions, and discussed their own applications. Moving back to the main tent, I observed the kids' tent in passing. Participants in the \"Natural Building for Kids\" class ran in and out of the forest and carried limbs, flowers, and branches back to the lawn. A half dozen triangle-shaped lean-tos appeared on the grass in stages, decked with goldenrod and asters, and occupied by their small creators. Daniel Stone, from West Bloomfield, watched over the kids as he has all five years, though his wife, Tina Stone, is the herbalist. He pointed out how free the kids were, playing well with one another. I never heard a cry of distress coming from the kids' tent the entire time I was at the Faire, though their voices were audible throughout the marketplace and class area. In the marketplace, Brooke Sackenheim, of Sovereignty Herbs, of Ohio, prepared for her kids' class, \"Secret Blend\"\u2014a combination scavenger hunt and mystery tour\u2014while chatting with her neighbor, Ginny Denton, of Linden Tree Herbals in Ann Arbor. The Faire, said Sackenheim, \"...is the best conference. It's not only local, it's like a family reunion. It's very welcoming here\u2014herbalists are different, this kind of local and regional thing makes you feel less alone.\" Denton agreed, adding that,\"There are many different herbalists, yet we are all in a similar mode here.\" That mode could be described as one of respect for the natural world. In her lyrical book Braiding Sweetgrass, botany professor and Potawatomi citizen, Robin Wall Kimmerer, offers essays on the intersection of science, indigenous wisdom, and plants. I saw many people strolling with copies of the book while at the Faire. One essay, \"The Honorable Harvest,\" tells of Kimmerer's asking permission of wild leeks to pick them for her dinner, demonstrating the approach of showing respect to the spirit of the plant, taking only what is needed, and feeling gratitude for the gift given. She wrote, \"One of our responsibilities as human people is to find ways to enter into reciprocity with the more-than-human world.\" Another essay, \"Learning the Grammar of Animacy,\" explores the different worlds revealed by the Potawatomi and English languages. English, like many European languages, often uses gendered nouns, whereas Potawatomi uses a framework of animate or inanimate being. Kimmerer gives this example: \"Of an inanimate being, like a table, we say ' What is it?' ...But of apple, we must say 'Who is that being?'\" She explains \"...in Potawatomi and most other indigenous languages, we use the same words to address the living world as we use for our family. Because they are our family.\" Relating to the world as full of living beings, and offering respect and relationship rather than utilitarianism and self absorption, created an atmosphere of gentleness, kindness, and compassion that was tangible at the Faire. While I didn't hear anyone explicitly articulate Kimmerer's words, I could feel the attitude of that worldview and a corresponding physical reaction: my shoulders softened and the tension in my abdomen eased. It wasn't only I who noticed. When I spoke with Esstin Niganobe McLeod, an Anishinabe herbalist from Ontario and three-time Faire teacher, she said that she \"...likes the atmosphere and the direction the organizers are moving\u2014taking better care of our health and the land. It's been there but never a forum before.\" Two weeks after the Faire, I met with Anna Fernandez and Marcie Nido, two of the many volunteers who make the Faire reality. Fernandez, along with jim mcdonald, is one of the founders of the Faire. Her biography in the Faire guidebook describes her as \"a mother, herbalist, home birth midwife, and RN.\" She was working on a farm in Oregon when she discovered herbalism, through a book by Penelope Ody. The Great Lakes Herb Faire will be held on September 11-13, 2020 just west of Chelsea at the Cedar Lake Outdoor Center. You can find more information and register for classes on their website, greatlakesherbfaire.org. \"...in Potawatomi and most other indigenous languages, we use the same words to address the living world as we use for our family.

This year the Faire added \"tween classes,\" for herbalists between eleven and fifteen years old, and sold out early, capping entry at 350 participants. Now, Nido said, \"We come in knowing\u2014what did we do last year?\" Fernandez continued that sentence with \"...what do we want to do differently? We all came out of this year with a thousand ideas for what to do next year, within our own little role of expertise. We're still trying to\u2014we're never going to perfect it, but still trying to manifest this original dream.\" Fernandez holds tight to that original dream of community. Remembering her own early, lonely days as an herbalist she said, \"Creating this place where people can go back to Ohio and say, 'I met six people from Ohio that are studying herbal medicine. Let's get together our little group and continue studying, learning, identifying plants, and being with the herbs.' We have such a crazy history of herbal medicine in this country, and we have such a long way to go to build that back up\u2014we'll never be able to get it to where it was prior.\" I asked her for a definition of \"crazy history.\" She replied, \"Twofold: losing so much of the indigenous knowledge, and\u2014within the European community\u2014burning women at the stake for knowing anything about herbal medicine and midwifery. I would definitely have been burned at the stake. That's the beauty of Ayurveda and Chinese medicine...that it's an unbroken history within their cultures. There's so much wisdom, and it seems more accepted and integrated into those cultures because there wasn't that disruption. We have a lot of work to do to get comfortable with the plants again, trust them and learn from them, grow them, gain trust.\" Themes of community, connection, and education go beyond the Faire to the region itself. Sackenheim had said to me that part of the appeal was that \"people crave...ritual and ceremony, but for Europeans, unfortunately, we've coopted others and are enamored of others' rituals.\" Aguirre had also mentioned that the spiritual and ceremonial aspects drew her. This year's opening ceremony on Friday evening was led by Panoka Walker, an herbal healer of Anishinabe descent, who led a water ceremony and invited all to \"figure out what your water address is.\" Additionally, each year the Faire hosts a silent auction to benefit the community. This year the auction raised $2,000 for MackinawOde, an indigenous-led group peacefully advocating for water protection at the Mackinac Straits and the shutdown of Line 5, an Enbridge\u2014owned pipeline running under the Straits. Relationships are never one way, Kimmerer's work reminds us; they are always reciprocal. I asked Nido and Fernandez what the future holds for their community. Some challenges face the Faire. One is they have more interested participants than Cedar Lake can accommodate. They also have no way to accommodate wheelchairs. Various ideas have arisen, including holding winter courses or other seasonal classes, but taking time away from everyone's lives isn't always possible. Nido hopes that \"...everyone will start incorporating herbalism into their everyday life, even if it's just one or two plants. Just start to get to know the plants and form a deeper connection with the earth.\" Both were inspired by the kids' classes and the future community they may help to create. For example, Guido Mas\u00e9 came from Vermont to teach, yes, but mainly because his ten-year-old daughter wanted to see friends from last year. Fernandez's vision is based in Great Lakes imagery. \"I want the Herb Faire to be a tossed stone that has many ripples that just keep going out. So many conferences that are similar to this are popping up all over the country. Those ripples are all going to meet and there's going to be coverage for anyone who's interested; they're going to reach out and find their community.\" Next year's Great Lakes Herb Faire will be held September 11-13, 2020. You can find more information on Facebook (Great Lakes Herb Faire), Instagram (@greatlakesherbfaire), or on the web at greatlakesherbfaire.org. MackinawOde can be found on Facebook under \"Heart of the Turtle.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 20 Fernandez said, \"I became fascinated and began using comfrey, then hawthorn, and it snowballed from there.\" She taught herbalism at a Washington state music festival for a time, until she returned to the Midwest, settling in Chelsea. Fernandez had a vision of recreating her Washington experience. One day she was out running and came across Cedar Lake. \"I thought, 'This is the place,' and I went home and called jim that day and he said, 'Yep, let's do it.' He called in some of his people, and everybody was interested right off the bat. And almost everybody is still part of the organization.\" The group meets monthly around southeastern Michigan to plan the next year's Faire, and having observed the enthusiasm between Nido and Fernandez, I can only imagine the energy of the whole group. The two women hugged and chatted about Faire details before we resumed the interview,and continued outside afterward. Nido, who manages the vendors, came to herbalism through her own health issues. At one point while in college, she was on twelve medications. With the assistance of a chiropractor, she weaned herself off them, changed her diet while working at Oakland University's farm, and then became fascinated with herbs. At twenty-eight, Nido is the same age as many Faire attendees, and I asked her what the attraction was for her age group. \"Everyone is seeking a deeper connection with nature,\" she began. \"Also, a lot of people have had health issues themselves, or close family members with health issues, and traditional medicine isn't doing the trick for them or they want something gentler. It's also really fun to learn about plants, and it's also [a good fit with] DIY self-sustainability culture. I think that's really a major draw.\" Fernandez said her vision for the Faire has always been threefold: education, connection, and community. The first year, she said, \"I lost a lot of sleep. Financially it was on me\u2014if we didn't get enough people, we had committed to the teachers, what about all the food?\" That first Faire drew 225 people and offered classes for adults and kids Saturday and Sunday only. The fourth year, the Faire added Friday Great Lakes Herb F aire Great Lakes Herb F aire Continued from page 17 \"We have a lot of work to do to get comfortable with the plants again, trust them and learn from them, grow them, gain trust.\" \u2014 Anna Fernandez Themes of community, connection, and education go beyond the Faire to the region itself. \"I want the Herb Faire to be a tossed stone that has many ripples that just keep going out.\" \u2014 Anna Fernandez Relationships are never one way, Kimmerer's work reminds us; they are always reciprocal.

Mark Skowronski on farming Laurel Decker Hogge finding strength in building intuitive spiritualityThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 22 By Madeline Strong-Diehl Every Saturday for the past five years, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., it's breakfast time at Peggy's house, where she cooks pancakes for whoever happens to show up that week. Most of Peggy's guests are old friends of hers\u2014in fact, it's always a family reunion of sorts. But there are almost always new people, too\u2014most of whom feel welcome the minute they walk through the door. That's because extending simple hospitality is the central goal of Peggy's house, one of five Catholic Worker houses in Michigan and 178 in the U.S. \"The reason our guests feel welcome here is because they see people who look like them scrambling the eggs and cooking the bacon,\" Peggy explained. \"We are building community. This is not \"charity\" where there's a power imbalance, where the \"helpers\" are the powerful ones and the receivers are \"less than\" (them). When a homeless person walks through that door, they see other people from the homeless community pitching in and doing the work, and they think, 'I can be the one who cooks and washes the dishes, too. I don't always have to be the needy one.'\" Peggy says that she's especially proud that African-Americans feel welcome at Mercy House. \"This required us to actively reach out to them and include them in the leadership of the community. It took effort over time.\" At Peggy's house, homeless African-Americans (and others) not only receive the basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter, they can also find support from friends and peers who can offer advice and a listening ear. With a J.D. from the U-M Law School, Peggy herself is a well-coiffed woman with auburn hair and hazel eyes, and by day she works in the legal department at a Detroit-area corporation. But there's a big difference between Peggy and many other people who are involved in work with the homeless. That's because after work, Peggy returns to a home that she shares with homeless people, and she has voluntarily given up almost all of her valuable possessions to follow in the tradition of Dorothy Day, one of the social activists who established the Catholic Worker Movement in the 1930s. Peggy is a testament to the fact that the movement is still alive and well, and people like her combine a radical personal commitment to aid the poor and homeless and also take part in nonviolent direct action on their behalf. As might be expected, Peggy did not suddenly make this commitment overnight. In fact, she says that at the age of 37, she was a \"total workaholic\" who had worked as a partner in her own law firm for fifteen years and, by most worldly measures, was leading a very successful life. \"But I was raising my two girls, and one day I was driving home from work and I started sobbing so hard I had to pull the car over. I had been working so hard for so long that I had no friends, and I just felt so lonely, so empty. I knew I was a good parent, but that was the only thing I had besides work.\" So Peggy began doing volunteer work, and eventually she was introduced to the homeless community known as \"Camp Take Notice\" (CTN) by her spiritual mentor, Father Dan Reim, a Jesuit priest at St. Mary's parish in Ann Arbor. \"Dan took me to the place in the woods [on Wagner Road] where all these homeless people were living in tents, and I met Caleb there, and I just fell in love\u2014with Caleb, and with the homeless people, and with Camp Take Notice. I watched Caleb help facilitate a discussion they were all having, and I couldn't believe how polite they were and respectful toward each other. You see, Caleb had taught them how to make decisions based on Robert's Rule of Order\u2014that's right. These homeless people were handling their disagreements better than most of the employees you'd find at a corporation. Talk about finding a unicorn! Here was this man in the forest who was genius-smart, wise, compassionate, open-hearted, and fully-human, and he had given up his life's ambition to become an ER physician because he felt God had called him to live among the homeless and advocate for them.\" And yes, that was the beginning of the fairy tale, of how Peggy and Caleb fell in love and now help each other welcome the homeless people of the Ann Arbor area into the home they share together. While Peggy's away at work during the day, Caleb provides a consistent presence at the house\u2014and Peggy says in addition to all of Caleb's remarkable personal qualities, he has ten years of experience as an EMT. \"And that really comes in handy because a lot of people come in with blisters all over their feet from constantly being on the move, and Caleb gets them all fixed up.\" Peggy says it's impossible for her and other residents and volunteers to cure the worst medical challenge that homeless people face\u2014the kind of intense social isolation that leads to depression and other mental illness. But Peggy says they can still do lots of little things to mitigate the problem. \"Some people come in here smelling pretty bad, and that can be a big part of social isolation,\" Peggy explained. \"So their friends will just say, 'Hey! You need a shower!' And it's no big deal. And we give them fluffy towels, shampoo, soap, a toothbrush, razor...whatever they need. Most importantly, we give them clean clothes so they have something to change into when they're done, and then they have a chance to do their laundry.\" Random Acts of Kindness Saturdays at Mercy House That's because extending simple hospitality is the central goal of Peggy's house, one of five Catholic Worker houses in Michigan and 178 in the U.S. And yes, that was the beginning of the fairy tale, of how Peggy and Caleb fell in love and now help each other welcome the homeless people of the Ann Arbor area into the home they share together.Peggy says it's impossible for her and other residents and volunteers to cure the worst medical challenge that homeless people face\u2014 the kind of intense social isolation that leads to depression and other mental illness. Peggy says her two daughters supported her in her decision to establish a Catholic Worker House. \"They know it gives me joy and meaning,\" she said. She added that it was difficult at first to give away most of her possessions. \"After I raised my two girls, I was still very attached to stuff, like the rocking chair I used to rock them in, and the baby quilt I made while I was pregnant. But now that kind of stuff means less to me.\" What is the most important thing that she can offer to the people she opens up her home to? \"A lot of them tell me this is the first place they feel accepted since they became homeless,\" Peggy said. \"A lot of people ask how I can do this, and I have learned that fear is the enemy, and fear is contagious. And the opposite feeling\u2014hospitality\u2014is also contagious. I have decided that I am not going to let fear rule my life. When people see someone who is acting out of their deepest self, they are electrified, and they are calmed, and feel that they can be welcoming, too. People are almost relieved, and think, 'This is really who I am! I can finally reconnect with myself.' This is most important for the homeless people who come here\u2014this community gives them a sense of agency, it opens up a way for them to create meaning for themselves through serving others.\" Gracie is just one such person. Tall and graceful, with long blonde hair and emotionally sensitive facial expressions, she began volunteering as an organizer at Mercy House one year ago after living in the Delonis Center for about a year. \"I always wanted to be that person who had a voice and could advocate for others,\" said Gracie. \"But I didn't have a voice my entire life until I had been coming to Mercy House for a while. Then I realized, I am that person. Here I am accepted as family, and I can express my need to take care of and nurture others. This has changed the whole trajectory of my life.\" Peggy says one of the most meaningful gifts she and others in the community have received came from taking care of four people who lived in hospice at Mercy House and then died there. \"One of them wrote me a letter that said, 'Thank you for giving me a way to contribute and find meaning (before I died).'\" Mercy House (otherwise known as \"Peggy's House\" and \"Ann Arbor Peace House\") is a private residence, not a 501(c)3.

Alonzo, Peggy, Gracie, and Caleb of Mercy HouseThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 23 Unbeknownst to her social scientist husband, she had found meditation, vegetarianism, and had her first out-of-body experience.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 24 By Moira Payne Her fingers glided easily over the silk of the deep red sari that she wore. Her lipstick matched the dress and contrasted with her short, trendy black hair. She left her three children at home with their nanny, as she was joining her husband at a close friend's house for a dinner party. She was looking forward to seeing her new friends that night, fellow spiritual seekers. She was in her early 20s and felt the entire world was within reach. They had lived in India for the past few years\u2014a country that she fell deeply in love with. Unbeknownst to her social scientist husband, she had found meditation, vegetarianism, and had her first out-of-body experience. At the party, her eyes settled on the old fortune teller. Although wrinkles covered her face, she was still beautiful. What captured her attention most was the fortune teller's necklace, which dangled close to her cleavage and had a glass container as a pendant. Inside the pendant was a giant spider, alive and moving, legs scratching against the glass. As she sat watching, she decided to hear her fortune. The old woman smiled and began to tell her of a life far away...and how she would die when she was 64. The young woman was my mother, and this was her first experience with a psychic. This story occurred in the mid-60s and I was not yet born. As my mother would later tell me, she was deeply distressed after her reading. Months later, she would return to the States and think about that woman with her spider necklace pendant. One day, years later, while walking down a street in Los Angeles, she saw a sign for a palm reader. As she was without her children, she had some time and stepped inside. The palm reader asked her if she had any specific questions, and my mother told her that she wanted to know at what age she would die. The palm reader stared at her palm for some time and finally replied that she would die at the age of 64. I remember learning about death in my single digit years. My mother would laugh and tell me how I asked, \"You mean you won't always be here to hold my hand and take me for a walk?\" When I asked her when she would die, she told me she was going to die at the age of 64. I remember thinking about it with despair, then deciding that when she was 64, I would be 35 and have my own family and maybe she would not mean the world to me. For the next few decades, my three sisters and I would gather around our mother as she would tell us tales of living abroad, both before we were born and after. Vietnam, Switzerland, India. The tales of India, where she returned every year, would be the most animated and vivid. As we got older, her stories would become more focused on her spiritual awakenings there, and always, they would end with that psychic telling her she would die at the age of 64. My sisters and I have followed life paths very different from our mother, and each other, yet each of us are, in our different ways, drawn to the world outside us\u2014 spiritually and culturally. Over the past two decades, I have explored many religious traditions. I quickly concluded that religions were too narrow and institutional for my comfort, but spirituality broadened my world. My mother was always there, sharing in our stories and challenging us to find our own truth. She was the healthiest person I knew, proudly saying that she had only ever been to the hospital to give birth. She wore no makeup, and she meditated every day for an hour\u2014and had since she had left India decades before. Finally, my mother turned 64. No one spoke of the psychic that she had gone to so long ago, but we all wanted that year to be over and to know that our beloved matriarch would be alive and well. I knew this without ever speaking of it to my sisters. I was 35 and had children of my own. I laughed at my younger self, thinking that even at my age, my mother was still my everything. One Sunday, my mother was not feeling well. She and my dad had gone out to dinner the night before, and my mother told me she had gotten food poisoning. She asked me to bring her some anti-acid medication, since her supply had expired a decade prior without ever being opened. I brought it to her and watched her, fearfully, as she lay in her bed. My sisters each called, as they did every day, and she told them she had food poisoning. We all insisted she go to the hospital right away, just in case it was more. Finally, that same morning, she agreed and went to the emergency room. They examined her and then sent her home, saying that it was probably a digestive issue that would be cured with time. Days passed and my mother's condition grew worse. I was still at her bedside the afternoon when one of my sisters called again, this time in tears. She begged my mother to go back to the emergency room. My mother scoffed at first, but then finally relented. At this second examination in the ER, they discovered that her appendix had ruptured and she was admitted for emergency surgery. Her ruptured appendix had released so many toxins into her system that it was difficult for them to keep her infection down. She was in the hospital for two full weeks but came home, thankful for all of us who had insisted that she go. Some will listen to the story of my mother and the psychic and say that the psychic was wrong since she did not die at the age of 64. I think of the story and am grateful for that old woman with the spider in her pendant. Perhaps if she had not foretold my mother's passing, so many years ago, we would not have been so insistent that she go to the hospital. Throughout the years I have heard people discuss going to psychics and why they decided to go or not to go. Psychics can provide us a different perspective. Sometimes when we are too close to a situation, we are unable to see the entire picture. Psychics can provide some different structure to our thoughts and help us find a solution. I have had readings over the phone, at psychic fairs, at the side tables at farmer's markets, and even little metaphysical book stores. I am aware of the different forms that the messages take. I find psychics fun, helpful, informative, and affirming. Or not. I have had psychics tell me all about my deceased loved ones, including names, hair color, and favorite books or pets. Psychics can provide a snapshot of our lives. Like a snapshot you may take with a camera, things can drastically change after that picture is captured. There is nothing that is guaranteed to happen or not happen, as we all have free will to change things. I think this concept is the most important thing to remember. If we are prepared for something to happen, we can change the course of events. When I'm 64When I'm 64 Getting the Most Out of A Psychic Reading Some will listen to the story of my mother and the psychic and say that the psychic was wrong since she did not die at the age of 64.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 25 Here are some tips that can help you get the best out of a psychic reading: Do some resear ch before deciding who to see. Many psychics work out of metaphysical stores that have already vetted them. Est ablish how long of a reading you are getting. There are usually agreements for payments based on how long the reading takes. Find out if credit cards vs. cash works well for the reader. Ask if you c an record the session if they do not offer to record it as part of the reading. If allowed, put your cell phone on airplane mode, to stop any interruptions in the recording. When you are able to record, it frees you up from having to take notes yourself. Be open in the reading , uncross your arms and legs. This allows your energy to flow in your body easier and connections to be made. If you have some time before the reading, try to meditate and clear your head. Get quiet on the outside and inside. Let your thoughts leave your head and breath slowly for a few minutes. Remember tha t the messages are for you. Many times I will hear how wonderful a psychic is because she was able to tell someone her grandmother's hair color, name, and favorite meal. That is great information to affirm that a connection has been made, but don't dwell on the information you already know. If you are paying to find out if a person is really psychic, you may miss information that would be helpful for you to know. Most psychics will tell you how they read. Some will ask you if you have questions, while others may ask you not to ask any questions. Both of these are common in readings\u2014but remember the focus is on you and not the reader. Some ps ychics are better at connecting with one person than another. If you go to a psychic and their messages are all off, just know that they weren't the right reader for you. I have had amazing readings with a psychic, but that same psychic gave a \"poor\" reading to a friend. Many times a reading will simply not make sense. That is okay, as it may make sense at a later date. Be respectful. This r eader is working some muscles that not a lot of people frequently use. They take it seriously, as should you. You are paying for a service, and the more serious you are, the more serious they will be. You may hear things that you do not want to hear. Most people assume that there will be talk of death, but many times it is talk of addiction that makes someone uncomfortable. If you can hear the message and not react, you may find truth in the end. Timing of ev ents can be difficult to tell. Most people will say that within six months is a good frame of reference, but timing is difficult because of the idea of change. Lastly , enjoy your session. So many of us spend our lives taking care of others and are not comfortable focusing on ourselves, even for a short amount of time. If you cannot accept the messages as coming from beyond, accept them as another perspective of where you are now. My mother is now 80. She does not recall the psychic that she saw over 50 years ago. That is okay; each day is a treasured gift that I still have my mother in my life. I am grateful, and that is enough. Moira Payne was born and raised in Ann Arbor.

She starred in the workshop production of my husband Greg's play Whatever Happened to Captain Future? with the Ypsilanti-based Neighborhood Theatre Group. Then, when Greg and I were vending at our area's newest book festival Booksilanti, I learned that Secord is more than a talented actress\u2014she makes delightful handmade jewelry, too! Each piece is made from the pages of children's books. As her sign read, \"Beloved books go from trash to treasure.\" I couldn't resist buying a pendant featuring the Mad Hatter from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, for which I have received several compliments since. (It was a tough choice between that and Winnie the Pooh!) Secord learned to make jewelry through trial and error and watching YouTube videos. \"I went through a lot of learning what didn't work before I figured out what did!\" When I asked why she chose books to make her jewelry, she answered, \"I just hate to see books get thrown out\u2014especially Children's books. [...] When you are a child and you discover a love of reading, certain books just speak to your soul and become a part of you\u2014at least that's how it was for me. I can still remember how certain books smelled, the warmth of the sun on my back as I lay on the floor in front of the window with my pile of books, the feel of the pages of certain favorites, rough paper smoothed to soft over a thousand re-reads. I have so many books that are falling apart because I read them over and over again. To be able to carry that book with me when it's no longer readable, to save it and give it new life as a cherished piece of jewelry makes me feel like it's getting some of the love back that it deserves.\" In addition to acting and jewelry making, Secord also enjoys spending time with her family and loves to bake. \"I made rainbow layered unicorn cakes for my daughter's first birthday this summer and have done golden snitch cakes, pizza cakes, roller skates, and more!\" The name Bunny and Smooch is inspired by her daughter and her daughter's toy bunny. \"My spare time and fun time is generally spent hanging out with my family. Most days we like to cuddle up on the couch and watch Great British Bake Off, HGTV, or old episodes of our 90s favorites like The Nanny and Mad About You. Weekends are spent running around Ypsi, camping throughout Michigan, visiting fun and funky art shows and festivals, and catching up with friends.\" In addition to selling at the occasional festival, Secord's jewelry can be bought online through Facebook.

Reflexolo-chiTM Healing with Greg Knollmeyer According to the Reflexology Association of America, \"Reflexology is the application of specific pressure by the use of the practitioner's hand, thumb, and fingers to a reflex map resembling a human body which is believed to exist on the extremities.\" Reflexolo-chi TM was developed by Gloria Zimet as a gentler, less penetrative variant that incorporates the body's life energy (chi). The impact of reflexolo-chi can be felt as quickly as the first session. I decided to investigate this myself, and I made an appointment with local practitioner Greg Knollmeyer. I have a painful tailor's bunion on my left foot that I was eager to address. Knollmeyer explained that there is a long list of ailments that can be tackled with reflexolo-chi, such as stress, headaches, joint pain, PMS, allergies, digestive disorders, and so on. My chief concern was my bunion, however, which I could feel quite sharply as I limped into the office and hopped onto the table. Even while resting, my foot throbbed. Rather than press on my foot, Knollmeyer manipulated my toes and lower leg to make adjustments, starting with the problematic left. (It reminded me a bit of a chiropractic exam I had many years ago in California, and now I wonder if that doctor perhaps had some of this training.) For anyone with sensitive feet, this is probably a better route than traditional reflexology. I felt my body slowly loosen up, and the ache in my left foot gradually faded away. Knollmeyer was also easy to talk to and happy to answer any questions and concerns that I had. When he was finished with the left leg, he lifted my foot, moved it around, and invited me to get a feel for how the left side of my body felt. Aside from pain-free, I felt more connected from top to tip. \"Okay, good,\" said Knollmeyer, and set down my left foot. He raised my right foot and asked the same question while moving the foot gently in all directions. I was surprised by the stark contrast. My right leg felt hollow and disjointed. Knollmeyer worked on that side until my whole body felt whole again. After the session, I asked what I could do about my foot pain in the future. Was there anything I could do about my shoes? \"To be able to carry that book with me when it's no longer readable, to save it and give it new life as a cherished piece of jewelry makes me feel like it's getting some of the love back that it deserves. \" \u2014 Deborah Secord Knollmeyer was also easy to talk to and happy to answer any questions and concerns that I had.In this column, Crysta Coburn writes about crazywisdom-esque people and happenings around Ann Arbor.Crysta Goes VisitingCrysta Goes VisitingThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 31 A Time 4 You Bath and Spa Treats with Adrian Leek It is vitally important to make time for yourself and get back to you on a regular basis. But that can be hard, especially with how busy our lives are, and when you throw parenthood into the mix, when you are responsible not only for yourself but for your children, devoting time to only you can feel selfish and that much more difficult! Ypsilanti-based A Time 4 You Bath and Spa Treats to the rescue! It was actually Adrian Leek's family that guided her to learning about naturally and simply made bath and body products and launching her own business. \"When I became a mother I was very, very particular about what I put on my baby for skin care, but mostly drawn to mixing my own oils for relaxing and calming effects using lavender, chamomile, and olive oil for after bath and bedtime,\" Leek shared with me. \"My kids LOVED the massages, and I loved knowing that I was able to make something so healthy and enjoyable for my kids.\" About starting her own business, Leek said, \"When my second child was diagnosed with autism, it changed our lives...but I was already on the right track with my pursuit of natural hand-made products. With my son's condition, it was all the more important that natural products were used because so many sensitivities come along with autism. On the flip side of this lifestyle is that we tend to live such stressful lives, and I've found it necessary to make a conscious effort toward self-care. A Time For You Bath and Spa Treats was created to help inspire others to stop and not only enjoy a moment to ourselves, but take better care of ourselves...so we can continue to care for the people and things that we love.\" It is vitally important to make time for yourself and get back to you on a regular basis.\"Shoes are a corset,\" he answered. Having worn several corsets, I knew exactly what he meant. He suggested not sticking to only one pair of shoes. \"If possible, change shoes halfway through the day.\" That way my feet wouldn't get stuck in a position they found uncomfortable. Knollmeyer also showed me a simple exercise that I could do to slowly get my turned out duck feet back in parallel alignment. Walking and standing with feet turned outward stresses feet and knee joints, just to name a few. Which I wish I had known when I went to physical therapy for mysterious knee pain a few summers ago. I was impressed by the results of my first visit. The pain was gone! Not forever, but it was a relief to walk around the rest of the night pain free. And I feel better armed to get my body back in alignment and pain free in the future.

I asked her about how she learned to make her products and where she finds the ingredients. She said, \"Research, a love for these kinds of products (natural and simply made), feedback from people that use them, and of course...trial and error. My ingredients come from a mixture of places, my focus is on high quality, responsible, and clean materials.\" At the moment, she sources many of her materials online and is \"looking for a brick and mortar location to buy materials.\" When I asked Leek why self-care is so important in her life, she answered, \"I have learned over the years that it is necessary to consciously try to balance our level of stress with something calming, positive, and relaxing. I believe that these things are imperative to keeping our balance and allowing us to continue with the necessary things that we find important to us.\" Leek is hoping to have her products on boutique shelves within the next five years.

By Cashmere Morley Winter around town doesn't have to put the freeze on a good date night! Here are five unique local spots that will warm your date's heart this season. For an occasion that's out of this world, book a date with Planet Rock Climbing Gyms in Ann Arbor. A day pass, for $18 per person at Planet Rock will grant you, and your date, access to their vast climbing wall and fitness centers, including a traditional gym and yoga space. Planet Rock At first glance, the vast, colorful climbing walls at Planet Rock could look a little intimidating to a person who has never climbed, but Mark Hanss, a manager and instructor at Planet Rock, ensures that the adrenaline rush that comes with the experience is what makes it the perfect spot for a date. \"I've brought many dates here,\" said Hanss. \"It's a great place to learn to trust somone, mentally and physically. It's an easy skill to learn together, and it gets the blood pumping!\" Jermaine Hinton, an instructor at Planet Rock, added that climbing \"can build trust and communication between a couple. All the adrenaline starts going, and you get rid of any initial fears you might have. Plus, you're flexing your body, whether you're trying to or not. And that always looks good on a date!\" Dale Cutshaw, a frequent climber at the gym, said the atmosphere at Planet Rock is very \"inviting and welcoming,\" so first-timers who may be searching for a new experience can take a date there without feeling judged. Planet Rock is open Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., Thursday from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., Friday from 3 to 10 p.m., and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. at: 82 Aprill Drive C, in Ann Arbor. Last Word Bar After a hard work out with your date, unwind over at the Last Word Bar. Known for their $10 take on The Osborn, a twist on a Moscow Mule, the Last Word takes its name from a cocktail that was popular in Detroit in the 1920's. The atmosphere mimics this era with its almost hidden entranceway and underground, speakeasy feel - mismatched lighting fixtures dangle from the ceiling, casting a soft glow on the hardback books lining the walls and glistening bottles of liquor of every variety. It's the cozy, close-knit ambiance that makes it a good place for a date. \"We're about to celebrate our seventh anniversary on Valentine's Day,\" said Marlee K\u00e4tt, a manager at the Last Word. \"We usually do something a little special that day, for our anniversary and for any couples coming in to celebrate Valentine's.\" Beyond that, the Last Word has Happy Hour Whiskey Wednesday's from 5 - 7 p.m. every week, and live jazz music on Thursdays that turn the intimate spot into a celebration of sound that rivals the beats you'd hear in the Roaring Twenties. Last Word Bar is open Monday from 5 p.m. to 12 a.m. and Tuesday through Saturday from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. at 301 West Huron Street, in Ann Arbor. \"I've brought many dates here,\" said Hanss. \"It's a great place to learn to trust someone, mentally and physically. It's an easy skill to learn together, and it gets the blood pumping!\" The atmosphere mimics this era with its almost hidden entranceway and underground, speakeasy feel. \"Snow flurries began to fall and they swirled around people's legs like house cats. It was magical, this snow globe world.\" Sarah Addison Allen, The Sugar Queen Photo by PR Staff Photographer B.Gonzales.Ziggy's If you're looking to take a date somewhere a little more avant-garde, look no further than Ziggy's in Ypsilanti. \"It's a great place to just drop in!\" said David Jeffries, owner of Ziggy's, a live music bar in Ypsilanti. \"It's for the left-field people that crave the deeper parts of art. But it's also welcoming and authentic. You'll get the punks of Ypsi here, but also the people who enjoy that \"living room feel\" that merges live music with comfort.\" At Ziggy's, there are records to spin, arcade games to conquer, and pop-culture references to gawk at, all while enjoying a sip at the bar. Whether you're looking for a wild night at one of Ziggy's karaoke events or just looking to grab a drink and enjoy some live music, Ziggy's has a little something for every date. Jam out at Ziggy's live music venue at 206 W Michigan Ave, in Ypsilanti. Ziggy's is open Tuesday and Wednesday from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. and Thursday through Saturday from 5 p.m. to 12 a.m. and is located at 206 West Michigan Avenue, in Ypsilanti. Revel and Roll Bowling Alley and Party Venue For a spot that's buzzing with activities no matter what time you swing by with your date, lace up your bowling shoes and head over to Revel and Roll Bowling Alley and Party Venue. Promising a great night \"whenever you feel like fun,\" Revel and Roll has plenty to offer the couple looking to get out for a good time when the weather gets bad. A total of 56 televisions line Revel and Roll's expansive 27-lane bowling alley and attached restaurant/sports bar, illuminating date night with black lights, music videos, classic films, and sports games depending on what time you drop in. Start the night off with \"some of the coolest and stunning [bowling] lanes in the game\" that feature plush lounge seats and games of varying prices, depending on what time you play. (Check out bowlero.com for prices and more information.) \"Thursday night is a great night to come for date night,\" said Revel and Roll manager Christopher Cachin. \"It's college night, we've got a resident D.J. here that's local to Ann Arbor, playing some great music. It's also our \"Unlimited Bowl,\" which means for The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 33 $12.89 it's all you can bowl after 9 p.m. with your own shoes. Pints of beer and slices of pizza are $2.50 that day as well, so it's a great day to bring someone.\" Tuesdays, Cachin mentions, is another good day to come with a date, since bowling games, tacos, and select domestic beers are only $2.88. But the fun doesn't stop there! A neon landscape of 103 arcade games beckons from the party venue's back room, featuring classic arcade games like air hockey and Skee-ball as well as some more modern marvels such as a Batman-themed multi-player adventure and an immersive Halo 4-player game with a panoramic screen that puts you and your date in the middle of the action. After the fun winds down, enjoy a wide selection of local beers on draft with your date at the venue's restaurant and sports bar. \"There's a lot of great selection here,\" said Cachin. \"We feature stuff from Ypsi Alehouse, which is brewed right downtown on Pearl Street, and of course Bell's from Kalamazoo. There's a lot to choose from here, whether you're looking for that sports-bar type venue, or something a little more immersive like our arcade.\" Oracle Card Readings At Ziggy's, there are records to spin, arcade games to conquer, and pop-culture references to gawk at, all while enjoying a sip at the bar.

This little place packs huge flavor into its dishes, and features American classics including a wide variety of omelets and gyros in a retro-diner setting. Fleetwood's sticker-slapped walls hold a nostalgic, and sometimes strange, sense of local history, and while many come to admire its unique aesthetic, they stay for Fleetwood's signature \"hippie hash.\" \"Have you tried this stuff?\" says Callie Tobin, halfway through a plate of hippie hash. \"It's so delicious. Plus, it's full of vegetables so I feel like I'm being healthy.\" She laughs. For $8.58, Fleetwood's plentiful plate of hippie hash begins with a generous layer of homemade hash browns. Layered on top of that is green peppers, onions, tomatoes, broccoli, and mushrooms. Sprinkled with melty, gooey feta cheese at the end, hippie hash is something that has to be experienced for yourself (preferably with a good date by your side!). \"Besides that, [Fleetwood] is cheap, and has good food with a lot of options. I've been coming here for years and used to come here with my boyfriend almost every day, before I graduated. This is my favorite food,\" Tobin said. \"Fleetwood is how all the waitresses meet their husbands!\" Johnnie Williams, a worker at Fleetwood, chimed in from the back of the store. \"Seriously. This place is for matchmaking. Plus, you can't beat the quality of food.\" Outside is a covered porch, which is heated in the wintertime, so you and a date can enjoy the Ann Arbor view anytime of the year. \"We're having a great time sitting out here, just enjoying the day,\" said Natalie Arvin. \"[My husband] has never been here before, so this is his first time, but I come here a lot.

I had been on the road for sixteen months before I moved to the charming town of Ann Arbor. I went to Italy over Christmas to visit family, and until then I had been travelling around Asia. My plan was to carry on with my nomadic life. I was going back to Thailand for the month of January, then I was going to make my way back to China, where I was temporarily living and working as an outdoor guide. I had decided that when I grew tired, I would move on toward new horizons, maybe to New Zealand or Australia. Yet, here I am, with a one-year lease on an apartment. I couldn't even have pointed to Michigan on a map before....How did I end up here? I am in a new country (I mean continent) in a state that seems as flat as a pancake. The kindness and warm welcome I've received reminds me of the Netherlands, the last country I lived in before packing my life into a backpack. After a lot of adventures and experiences alone I started traveling with a cute American guy, and the magic happened. Last January we met up again after six months apart and realized that we wanted to spend our lives together. Right before we made this decision, he had accepted a job offer in Ann Arbor. So, I decided to give up my nomadic lifestyle and come with him. We moved here with very little, and we have very little, materially speaking. We do have basic comforts like a roof above our head, kitchen supplies, a bed, but everything inside was found on the street or at second-hand shops. We bought a new memory foam, though the mattress beneath it is second hand. We do not own a car, but bike everywhere. Thank goodness we have amazing friends that lend their car to us when we need it. Now, I am not saying that when I am waiting at the bus stop, and it is pouring rain, that I don't sometimes wish I had a car, but that thought is fleeting, and as soon as I reach my destination, and I am dry, it stops defining my moment to moment experience. Backpacking taugh t me a new art of living. The most uncomfortable and challenging circumstances have become a great source of wisdom. When you live a nomadic lifestyle, everything is always changing at the speed of light, from vast landscapes to the beach; one night I slept in a cozy bed, the following night I was trying to rest in a noisy bus in India. One day I was by myself, and the next I met the companion I decided to share the rest of my life with. Good times follow difficult times, and those difficult times follow good times again. It was Augus t 2017 during a scorching summer in Maastricht (Netherlands), and I was stuck in a traffic jam, at 7 a.m. on a daily basis. I w as longing to be somewhere else, but I wasn't following through. I kept sitting every morning at my desk, with my pretty dress and a grey Dutch sky above my head. One morning, I w as stuck in my routine traffic jam when my car broke down. I had a 20-year-old Twingo, and the mechanic told me that repairing it would cost more than the value of the whole vehicle. That was it; that was the moment where I would either gather the courage to leave, or decide to buy a new car and keep getting stuck in traffic every morning.I had a whole house packed with furniture, decorations, clothes, shoes, a bike, more shoes, and a lot of climbing gear. I was born in Italy, and I moved to the Netherlands in my twenties for undergrad. After my studies I found a job, and I extended my stay. Year after year, I accumulated more \"stuff.\" I had a bank account, a phone plan, medical insurance, a pension scheme, friends, a broken car, and a house (with all the related bills). I decided to leave, and suffice to say, my life became chaos. I began to panic. I was overwhelmed. I thought to myself, \"I can't leave anymore; it's too complicated. It's impossible.\" I took a deep breath, went to yoga, and ended the panic. How could I tackle all of this? I made a plan and set the following steps into action. Step 1 - Plan of action. I made a lis t of everything I needed to take care of, and I gave myself a deadline. Step 2 - Financial plan. I c alculated that my budget was $54 per day for a year. Step 3 - I r esigned from my job. Step 4 - Fir st lesson of minimalism. If I wanted to travel and live out of a backpack, it needed to be light. I had to learn how to get rid of a lot that had sentimental value. First, I sold all my furniture, because plane tickets are expensive. I placed the most precious memories in two boxes that I shipped to my mum's house in Italy. Finally, I organized a massive party at my place for my birthday, invited all the people I'd met while living in the Netherlands, and I gave away all my clothes and unsold items. It was hard at first to donate, but generosity is a muscle, and it can be trained. The more I tried to smile and willingly give, the easier it became. Step 5*- Not mandatory. I could have stopped at step four; maybe what I needed was just to feel lighter, but I wanted to go all the way. So I left. I booked a one-way ticket to Vietnam, and my adventures began. I broke down my process in five straightforward steps, but it was hard and emotionally tasking. Nevertheless, the transition only lasted two months once I decided to make a drastic change. Like generosity, minimalism can be learned, and backpacking across the globe was the best teacher. Having lived with no possessions highlighted the essentials for me, and now I can appreciate the comfort of having a wardrobe, and a choice, once again. Hitting the Road: Life and Love in a Backpack After a lot of adventures and experiences alone I started traveling with a cute American guy, and the magic happened. The most uncomfortable and challenging circumstances have become a great source of wisdom. That was it; that was the moment where I would either gather the courage to leave, or decide to buy a new car and keep getting stuck in traffic every morning.

To begin, roll out your yoga mat, leave your negative thoughts at the door, and be prepared to invest some sweat equity into the next hour of your day. At Red Yoga, a vinyasa-based, infrared studio that opened in 2015, red will transform not just your body, but your mind. \"Similar to blowing glass or bending metal, heat helps you get that flexibility in your body and your mental state,\" said Red Yoga co-owner Kelli Harrington. \"Our philosophy is to teach to the strongest in the room. If I'm, say, running, I run with someone faster than me, so that I can become faster. It's the same principle here. There's nothing worse than someone holding you back, and we encourage becoming your best, and growing continuously to reach that. At Red, we give permission to take breaks, to drop your knees, to realize that this is a practice. With yoga, the practice is every day. It's what you eat, how much you sleep, how tapped into your emotions you are that day. You want to work all of that into your day-to-day, and into your [yoga] practice. We don't put levels on our classes for that reason, because you can't put a level on any of those things; you can't put a level on life. You have to be confident in yourself, and that's what we teach at Red.\" At R ed Yoga, visitors are bathed in a deep crimson light as they move through poses. Infrared is a form of light that is invisible to the human eye, but that we can feel as heat. All objects in the universe omit some level of infrared, two of the most obvious sources being fire and the sun, though not all infrared can be felt or seen by human senses. Paired with vinyasa yoga, a \"flow\" based yoga that encourages the yogi to move seamlessly from one yoga posture to another, Red Yoga is a truly unique experience that pushes the visitor deeper into traditional poses with the help of infrared light, which relaxes the muscles and stimulates collagen. The therapeutic, infrared heat helps yogis get the most out of their practice, while the technology helps alleviate pain, improve flexibility, and detoxify the body. Allie Oberlander, an assistant manager at Red Yoga, explains that there are different kinds of infrared in the room. \"Our studio has near and far infrared lights, which means we have both lighting and panels in the room. The thing about infrared heat is that the room heats you from the inside out, instead of the outside in. This helps you get into the poses easier because you're more warmed up as you start doing the yoga,\" she explains. \"So, you're flowing through the entire class. We start you out with a 10 to 15-minute warmup, and it gets hotter and more challenging as you advance from there. Yoga is such a broad exercise. We always tell people, \"don't push yourself past your edge!\" Make sure you're not hurting yourself. We have instructors who are here to help you do just that, push yourself while not going past your edge.\"LEAPS OF FAITH TALES OF LOCAL BUSINESSESThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 36 This column is a look at brave souls who have taken a leap of faith to open their own businesses in and around Ann Arbor.

With yoga, the practice is every day. Kelli HarringtonThere's a yoga spot downtown that has people seeing red\u2014feeling red, breathing red, and moving with red, too - and it all starts with a heat lamp. Since the Ann Arbor location is situated in downtown, patrons at Red can come and go as they please between sessions to refuel and replenish at any of the surrounding shops, which means that visitors will often come back for another yoga session after some cooling off, something that Harrington enjoys. \"The city location encourages people to hang out here. Beyond that, we see a lot of college students [from Michigan universities] coming back to our studio after moving to other larger cities that don't have Red Yoga, because they miss the effect it has. Other big cities aren't capturing what we have at this studio, and that makes us really special.\" For an yone hesitant to try infrared yoga, Harrington ensures that at Red, they are there to make you the best version of yourself. \"Every pose is different for every body. We aren't trying to mold you into a \"perfect\" yoga shape. Get into the poses first, and if you need more direction, we're here for you. We give you a lot of opportunities to learn at your own pace - learn about yourself, from yourself.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 37 Feature continued on next pageRed began when Harrington took the studio over from another studio that was also practicing heat-based yoga. Since then, she and her co-owner, Aric Shaffer, have transformed the spot into a building that's all about healing and focusing on the here and now. Yoga instructors from all over the world gather at Red to teach awareness, acceptance, balance, and community. While the room heats slowly as you progress, it can reach temperatures as high as 103 degrees Fahrenheit. Harrington ensures it's still a practice that anyone, from any walk of life, can benefit from. \"I used to be a runner - and I ran through everything,\" Harrington said, \"Every emotion. When I started doing yoga, I couldn't breathe. I didn't understand [the mental and physical boundaries of yoga]. I had to sit with my emotions instead of running through them. It was hard to not push. But I learned it was okay to have off-days, to drop my knees, to realize the bigger picture. That's part of the individual process, and part of your journey here at Red,\" she said. \"Yoga can be done at home. But do you push yourself in certain ways at home? Not always. What gets people to come out here is the room, of course, but also the friendships created through the practice. We encourage people to get to know the person next to you. To not feel inhibited by people who are stronger than you,\" said Harrington. \"Certain areas of the room are not as hot, and we have a map in the room to help decipher that for new people. Just like in life, you'll feel a bit tense as you reach your peak, but then the air comes on in the room and you make it through that tough spot, just as you're hitting your most intense moment. The middle of the room is very hot, but it can be for everyone. Give yourself permission to learn [the process] slowly.\" For people who ma y have heat aversions or suffer from certain kinds of medical pain, Harrington invites you to still come and try out Red. \"People have to make their own modifications. Listen to your body. If you want to set up a private lesson, we can make adjustments for your body type. Just tell the teacher ahead of the session. I had a woman come in here with osteoporosis, and I was able to set up a private lesson with her where we were able to work out a modified lesson that was perfect for her body type. That's the thing about yoga - there's a pose for everyone,\" Harrington said. Oberlander expands on this topic, explaining that their core base of visitors are women aged 40 and above. Some are into more advanced poses; some are looking for a little meditation in the hectic hustle-and-bustle of everyday life, but all are coming with different body types, in different frames of mind, all seeking a little peace and relaxation. \"We offer free meditation every day, for whoever wants to drop in. That's to help people find a little more peace of mind. We also have free community yoga nights on Saturdays, for people who don't have a lot of money and just want to do something different on a Saturday night. That starts at 6:30, and people fr om all walks of life attend,\" she said. \"Our community is a huge one - everyone who walks in needs to feel welcome and open to the different types of people we accept. We want the energy to be the best it can be; no negative energy in the studio. Get to know your neighbor and focus on who you're around. I always tell people, it's going to be more difficult than what you're used to, but you're going to enjoy it. I created such a close friend base here, and it just made everything so much more fun.\" In the years to come, expanding the Red Yoga brand is definitely something on Harrington's mind. \" When thinking about growing the company, we want to take it one year at a time. We believe in our philosophy and know that this is something that takes off better in city areas, because we can really mesh what we do and accomplish here [at Red] with a city community,\" said Harrington. \"With a yoga community, everyone gets to know one another. Within a city, that only amplifies since we get to know local businesses through the people that come and practice here. We're looking at Detroit next, Chicago, New York, Seattle... the red-light mimics sunshine, and that's what's also missing from a lot of dense city [landscapes]. Visiting [Red Yoga] is like visiting the beach, but you're not leaving with any bad rays. You're actually energized from it.\" Yoga instructors from all over the world gather at Red to teach awareness, acceptance, balance, and community. LEAPS OF FAITH TALES OF LOCAL BUSINESSESThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 38 Feature continued from previous pageBy Cashmere Morley Teaspressa Allison DeVane 414 South Main Street #115b Ann Arbor, MI 48104 734-431-6798; annarbor@teaspressa.com Find Your Cup of Tea with Teaspressa There's a Zen-like quality in the air here at Teaspressa; regulars are sipping color-changing lattes under the building's neon lights while the work of local artists hangs from every wall, encouraging you to pause and reflect for even just a moment on something other than your normal everyday routine. Cultivating positivity and creativity in your everyday life is part of Teaspressa's branding. \"If everyone drank our tea in the morning instead of traditional expresso, no one would have jitters or crashing.\" says Rachel Miller, Ann Arbor general manager and event coordinator at Teaspressa. It's the middle of a rush on a Friday, but Miller is as bubbly and effervescent as the cup after cup of coffee inspired tea she's pouring. There's a Zen-like quality in the air here at Teaspressa; regulars are sipping color-changing lattes under the building's neon lights while the work of local artists hangs from every wall, encouraging you to pause and reflect for even just a moment on something other than your normal everyday routine. Miller says that's the point. Teaspressa, established in 2015 by founder Allison DeVane, is an all-natural, specialty blended tea brand made just like a shot of expresso through Teaspressa's patented technology. The finely ground tea they're known for is not quite a powder consistency but not a loose-leaf tea either. Miller says it falls somewhere in between. At their locations, a curious tea drinker could discover espresso-style tea shots, lattes and macchiatos, home brewing equipment to make it yourself, and even a few loose-leaf tea blends to round out Teaspressa's out-of-the-box and into the expresso machine marketing. Cultivating positivity and creativity in your everyday life is part of Teaspressa's branding, and unlike most caf\u00e9s, Miller says that each person who walks in will find a little Zen in the creation of a Teaspressa drink, something she calls the \"Teaspressa experience.\" \"I honestly think there isn't a most popular drink here at our Ann Arbor location. We have so many options, that I truly believe there's a drink for everyone here,\" says Miller. \"If you're a tea lover and love black tea, our Manhattan Black Rose is gonna be your best bet. If you like green tea, our Ruby Rose tastes like chocolate with a hint of passionfruit, that we decorate with flowers on the top. There's a drink for everyone, and that's what makes this place special. We end up knowing our regulars by name, here. When you go into Teaspressa, you're going to get the perfect drink for you. We know your name, your kids' name, your dog's name. The Teaspressa experience means you get exactly what you want out of the drink.\" Tea that's made like coffee, some might argue, is hardly a departure from the specialty health teas floating around stores these days. But Miller says that Teaspressa is different from their approaches in almost every way, starting from the way the tea is processed, to how it's incorporated into a drink. \"The reason why I think our product is so important, and the methodology of Teaspressa is so different from what's out there, is that you can make a latte and have all the same flavors as coffee, you could have notes of mocha, or fruity flavors, Rachel Miller, Ann Arbor general manager and event coordinator at Teaspressa. \"She took all of their critiques into consideration,\" says Miller. \"Teaspressa was too new for the sharks to fully consider them for a deal, but if anything, it made us a stronger company. Allison is the most influential, powerhouse of a woman I've ever met. She is the boss. There's no question what we are, what we do, and want we want to put out. And part of that came out of our experience from Shark Tank.\" Miller says there was \"a million roadblocks\" forming the innovative tea brand, but that never stopped DeVane from succeeding. After her first modified machine got ripped out of her caf\u00e9 by a bunch of thieves at her Arizona location, the first store she opened, DeVane invested in new expresso machines and kept experimenting. Even now, the formula and process of Teaspressa is an evolution, still a learning experience to make sure the receiver is getting the perfect drink out of it. And along the way, there is a constant push from Teaspressa to give back to the community, a push to go green and local through their products and vendors. \"One of our biggest things is that all of our food products are through farmer's market, Trader Joe's, or Home Goods. Everything is completely organic, and we go as local as possible. Every location is a little different, but we all have events going on. At this location in Ann Arbor, we just did a bullet journal event that focused on wellness. We support small businesses in that way. We keep everything very organic and local. All you have to do is email me to become a vendor,\" says Miller. It's a symbiotic process; the shelves of Teaspressa are nestled with local candle and drink vendors that have supported the brand since its inception, and in return, Teaspressa sells their goods. Traditional caf\u00e9 items like paper straws replace traditional plastic straws, a push away from everything plastic all the time, and in return to this message, local vendors fighting for the same cause help populate Teaspressa's \"events\" page with all kinds of local popup occasions, focusing on health, the environment, and wellness. \"If you're hesitant to try Teaspressa out because you're not a tea lover, you should consider it for your health, bottom line,\" says Miller. \"Most people don't drink coffee black, they add fillers like milk and sugar, and even if you're doing that with a tea latte, the benefits from the tea are so much healthier for you than expresso could ever be. Everyone in the whole world drinks tea. The benefits of it outweigh anything else. Plus, it will be a personal, custom experience that you will end up loving here at Teaspressa.\" but you're making it out of tea which is healthier for you, there's much more health benefits, like tea antioxidants and digestive health. You still get the caffeination, but you don't get the caffeine crash or the side effects that come with it, like the jitters, like you would with a shot of an expresso,\" says Miller. \"We have the technology to not just make it into a cup of tea, but a latte. Anyone can make tea at home, anyone can make tea at work, but only our locations can make it into a true tea latte. You can make a very similar drink at home with our ingredients, but it wouldn't be pulled through an expresso machine. For the perfect consistency and texture, you have to come into the store. But, even though our tea is done in house through our own modified expresso machines, you can also create a latte at home through our sugar cubes.\" Teaspressa breaks away from loose-leaf or bagged teas with their sugar cubes and elixirs. Sugar cubes come in a variety of flavors including cocktail cubes, citrus cubes, and more. Elixirs are the opposite of sugar cubes in that they're sugar free, and come in only three flavors. With all the taste, and none of the sugar, they added to your drink by drops, like a traditional elixir. \"We have our signature flavors of teas like London Fog compressed into sugar cubes. We also have fruity flavors like strawberry and vanilla.\" says Miller. \"For making expresso lattes, for instance, you'd just drop in a sugar cube along with milk and make it at home. Instead of syrup, we have our sugar cubes.\" Cocktail cubes pack the flavor into an innovative form of sugar cube that mixes traditional tea flavors with a twist of cocktail yumminess. \"The cocktail cubes are really fun because they eliminate the need for ginger beer or other modifiers. You could take a vodka and sparkling water, throw in one of our sugar cubes, and boom! You gotta mojito.\" says Miller. Teaspressa also has other traditional cocktails flavors like sours and Manhattans to elevate your beverage . Since 2016, Teaspressa has spawned four new locations, and just celebrated a year open at their Ann Arbor site on South Main Street. DeVane had an appearance on the popular television show Shark Tank in 2016, three months after Teaspressa was founded. Armed with a passion to change peoples' minds about tea and an innovative, woman-run team, DeVane did not land a deal, but the knowledge she took away from that experience made Teaspressa what it is today.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 40 Our Western Neighbors Our Western Neighbors Holistic Practitioners in Jackson CountyHolistic Practitioners in Jackson County By Stephanie Weed Photographed by Mary Bortmas Half an hour west of Ann Arbor is the vibrant city of Jackson. Once a railroad hub for Michigan, Jackson is a centrally located city with abundant parks and wooded areas. Although Jackson has not traditionally been known for its spiritual community, it is a quickly growing region with a bright future ahead and many new opportunities blossoming on the horizon. The dedication of a strong collective of like-minded people is supportive to all those on their own journey in the Jackson area. One Jackson-based business founded by dedicated individuals is Essential Energies. Essential Energies: Center for Healing & Personal Growth Entering through the glass doors one is greeted by a wave of uplifting energy and the cheery smile from one of the gifted instructors of Essential Energies. Essential Energies, located on the west side of Jackson, is a gathering place providing opportunities for practitioners of complementary healing therapies and those in need of their services to find connection. The energy behind Essential Energies belongs to former elementary school teacher, Thomas Pieronski. He made an abrupt career change, choosing to attend hypnotherapy school in Lansing. He had always had an interest in the spiritual side of things and had studied to become a Reiki master while he was still teaching. Pieronski enjoys the rewarding experience of helping people with emotional issues, weight loss, overcoming trauma, and other issues they may be facing. It gives him a warm feeling inside to be able to help people. The other half of Essential Energies is Scott Nichols, a Certified Massage Therapist focusing on the medical side of massage therapy and specializing in sports injuries, chronic pain, and myofascial therapy. Nichols, a Pagan, has been following his spiritual path for about 24 years. A naturally gifted intuitive and healer, he had always done energy work, even though he didn't learn until later what to call it. He had been intuitively clearing people's chakras, so becoming a Reiki master was the perfect next step for him. During a job layoff, he decided to change careers and study massage. He now is the Director of Education and a massage instructor at The Salon Professional Academy in Battle Creek, Michigan. In addition to massage at Essential Energies, Nichols performs tarot and energy readings, which he describes as receiving messages from someone's energy field. Nichols also teaches a variety of other classes at Essential Energies, including Reiki and beginner Wiccan classes. So naturally, given the range of the two men's talents and interests, when the opportunity to acquire Essential Energies arose, they jumped at the chance. Essential Energies was originally founded in 2002. For the past three years, Pieronski and Nichols have worked within the original vision of founder Glenda Pruis, expanding operations to include rental space for practitioners of a number of healing modalities including crystal and energy healing, Reiki, and massage. Instructors offer jewelry making classes, such as beading and wire-wrapping, and a wide variety of other classes that nurture mind, body, and spirit.Workshops and classes are held in a cozy gymnasium located within the Essential Energies building. Instruction in meditation, yoga, Zumba, aerobics, and mindful stress management take place in this comfortable and relaxed healing space. Pieronski and Nichols have found considerable demand in the area for a center like this, and look forward to expanding their community reach in the years ahead by hosting more activities to involve the community like healing sessions at the local homeless shelter. The down-to-earth and peaceful employees and instructors add to the laid back atmosphere, making Essential Energies an ideal location for the relaxation, healing, and growth taking place within the walls of this unassuming brick building. Essential Energies hosted their first Holistic Health Expo in Fall of 2019, which included readers, clairvoyants, medical intuitives, and speakers on the topics of holistic medicine, spirituality, astrology, and the paranormal. This expo will be a regular event twice a year, in the spring and the fall. The annual Kendra Care Day will take place on the last Saturday of March. Named after Kendra Holliday, the daughter of a former owner who passed away from cancer, this is a day of healing dedicated to cancer patients. It is a free event for those needing services. Each guest to this occasion can choose three modalities from all those provided, and they receive a free psychic reading as well. This has been a popular event in the past, but reservations are not necessary as a large number of healers volunteer their time so all those needing healing can receive services. Visit Essential Energies at 915 Airport Road, Jackson, Michigan, 49202 or online at essentialenergies.org, where you can find a calendar of their upcoming events and classes. You can reach them at (517)796-2082 to schedule an appointment or via email at essentialenergies1@sbcglobal.net. Follow them on Facebook at facebook.com/Essential-Energies-133859646646642/.

Only 11 years old, Lubbe expressed her concern to her mother, who was unprepared to cope with her daughter's gifts. Lubbe has the ability to connect with others on the other side and remains in contact with her sister in spirit. She only received her mother's blessing of her gifts on her deathbed, at last providing Lubbe the opportunity to heal. Projecting her mother's issues and fears onto herself took a toll on Lubbe, reflected in her lack of health, and lead to weight gain. Introduced to Reiki by a doctor, Lubbe was finally able to find release and even lost 100 pounds. Inspired by these benefits, she took classes in Adrian from a Reiki Master, eventually becoming one herself. She strongly believes in the power of laying on of hands and Reiki's ability to truly help people. She began attending Jackson Spiritual Center, finding guidance from the pastor there, and stresses how crucial it was for her journey to find other like-minded individuals.

Past the computers and technical merchandise lies an amazing collection of handmade, Reiki-infused Tree of Life pendants that can only be described as \"divine.\" Eye-catching crystal cabochons delicately wrapped Because of this, Lubbe was able to find a way to meld her gifts and spiritual practices with her religious upbringing, deepening her spiritual connection in the process. She believes strongly in places like Essential Energies that provide people with a way to connect with others in their community for healing and instruction. Lubbe wants to help provide a network of like-minded individuals for others and for those who may feel alone with their gifts, like she once did. Recently, she attended a holistic fair in Ann Arbor. She pointed out to her daughter all the other people with similar beliefs and reveled in the feeling of community and oneness. During the last ten years, Lubbe really started getting into helping people by listening to messages sent to them from their loved ones on the other side. Lubbe owns her own practice, A Touching Hand, inside the Essential Energies building. She offers Reiki, spiritual readings, and guided meditations. Lubbe, also an ordained minister, hopes to offer more classes on Reiki and other healing modalities and more group meditations at Essential Energies in the near future. She feels that people in Jackson haven't been as open to spirituality in the past, but that is changing, and the need in the area is consistently and quickly growing. Really excited about the future of Essential Energies, Lubbe is helping to get the word out about this gathering place in Jackson. She hopes to personally help the Jackson spiritual community grow and expand. One item on her agenda is to introduce a psychic mini-fair at Essential Energies as part of their regular monthly schedule. Lubbe shares her space at Essential Energies with Robin VerCande, another gifted psychic and healer. Together they have organized the Sisterhood of the Travelling Psychics. This group of psychic readers, energy healers, and lightworkers travels to various Jackson locations to offer crystal, oracle, tarot, and various other readings.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 43 Divine Sanctuary began as a blog by Bengel who was seeking to find some calm and peace in this crazy world and as a way to escape from the depression and negative energies she was battling in her personal life. She was able to use her blog to expand and grow spiritually, finding hope and love in a world she was struggling in, like so many other lightworkers. She went on to become a Reiki master and an ordained minister. Bengel strives to continue her own spiritual growth. Her goal is to provide comfort and peacefulness to others and to help them find and feel love in an often difficult world. Bengel hosts an online healing circle twice monthly, on the first night of the full and new moon. She began the healing circles in July 2013 as a weekly event, connecting online spirit healers and those in need in a wonderful exchange of sending and receiving healing energy. Energy clearing, meditation, prayer, and Reiki energy sharing strengthens the bond between those involved with Spirit and with each other. Bengel also includes a link to a virtual candle lighting page for those that choose to light a sacred candle. This event is announced through an event on her Facebook page. Simply join the event to participate. If you don't have a Facebook account, you can still be included by emailing Bengel in advance. In addition to the store, Divine Sanctuary also offers services such as space smudging, Reiki sessions and certification, and tarot and oracle card readings. The services of an ordained minister can also be provided at Divine Sanctuary.

Leslie Blackburn, sacred sexuality tantra coach and educator, has moved her home and professional space from Dearborn, where she lived for 20 years, to Ann Arbor.

New Offerings by Established Businesses and Practitioners Leslie Blackburn, sacred sexuality tantra coach and educator, has moved her home and professional space from Dearborn, where she lived for 20 years, to Ann Arbor. The new space will be her home as well as a place for her to conduct coaching and craniosacral therapy sessions. It will also serve as a community gathering and temple space, as well as a venue for a retreat she hosts for sexuality educators, coaches, therapists, and healers. Blackburn said that she had been f eeling the pull to move for some time. She had a clear desire for a place where she could \"disappear in nature\" and yet still be within a 15 minute drive from downtown Ann Arbor. She said the space \"revealed itself\" at just the right time, and she was also able to quickly sell her Dearborn home in order to make the move possible. The new home is on 3.7 acres of land and has ample private living space, multiple entryways so she can separate her personal and professional rooms where she can conduct private coaching and craniosacral therapy work, and space for temple gatherings. Eventually, the temple will be moved to a walkout basement area, which is still under construction. The property is wooded and contains walking trails that connect with paths on the neighboring property of the Unitarian Universalist Church. Blackburn is excited about living in a natural setting after 20 years in a city home. She said the property will be \"a place to honor the values we hold dear of co-creating a space of love and respect for our bodies, ourselves, nature, and the planet.\" It is important to her to be able to treat the land respectfully as part of a sacred connection from human to earth. She is working toward installing composting toilets and finding other ways to be as eco-friendly as possible. She resumed hosting monthly temple gatherings in the new space in November and plans to continue holding them \"mostly during the school year.\" She described temple gatherings as a \"weaving from many traditions,\" including yogic, Native American, ancient Egyptian, Daoist, and Earth-based, animist religions. She explained that she believes \"the path to God/spirit is unique to each person,\" and as such gatherings are in a way \"non-specific on purpose.\" She also explained that she is conscious of how weaving together different spiritual practices relates to social and racial justice, to gender concepts, and to her own whiteness. She spoke of \"healing our bloodlines\" as a possibility to be sought out. She also explained that her own sense of her gender identity has been evolving and \"opening,\" and so her understanding of the tantric traditions, which are very binary, have evolved and expanded. Blackburn will be opening up the space for her workshops, classes, and her Leadership Program, for professionals who are working to support their clients' sexual empowerment. She is also booking sessions for Sacred Sexuality private sessions and Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy. More about Leslie Blackburn and her offerings is available on leslieblackburn.com. She can be reached by phone at (313) 269-6719 or by email at leslie@leslieblackburn.com. On July 8, 2019, Healing Hands Physical Therapy moved to a new space in the Parkland Center on Ann Arbor's West side. The practice is integrative, meaning it combines traditional Western methods with \"alternative\" methods including Bowen, Gua Sha soft tissue mobilization, visceral manipulation, dry needling, cupping, and others. The center's therapists specialize in a number of issues including pelvic floor therapy, TMJ, complex spinal conditions, and more. Owner, and physical therapist, Amira Tal-Henig, said that having a variety of specialists in one place allows them to work as a team for a patients' care. Sometimes patients will benefit from more than one type of treatment, and they can facilitate this. She said the practice employs a \"great biller\" who helps make sure that anyone who uses insurance to pay for services will get the best value out of it. Tal-Henig said that the world of physical therapy is becoming very corporatized with large companies taking over many clinics. By staying independent, they are able to provide more personalized care, looking at the patient as a whole and not just providing a \"cookie cutter\" plan. She talked about the business' \"core values\" such as quality care, and giving back to the community. She explained that she only hires people who are aligned with those core values. Moving into the larger space has enabled her to hire several new therapists. Tal-Henig explained that the priorities of physical therapy at Healing Hands are first, to re-align. \"Pain shows that something is not working correctly,\" and needs to be adjusted. Second, neuromuscular re-education. The body must re-learn how to move in healthy and sustainable way, eliminating patterns of compensation for injury and weakness that cause further problems. Third, strengthening the body in a functional way, to make sure the person is able to do the activities they need and want to do in a way that will keep them healthy and functional. Healing Hands is hosting an open house for the general public on January 9th from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. They will offer free laser therapy treatments with their brand-new level four laser (the most powerful used in laser therapy), giveaways, and a chance to meet staff members. Healing Hands Physical Therapy is now located at 58 Parkland Plaza, Suite 100, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. More information is online at physicaltherapyannarbor.com, and they can be reached at (734) 222-8515 or by emailing reception@physicaltherapyannarbor.com. Column continued on page 46 House and share in community resources. The House is a historic building built in 1877 located in downtown Dexter, within walking distance to all downtown shops and restaurants and near a park where events and festivals are held regularly. It was purchased by Verapose in 2018 and renovated and remodeled into a \"zen-like,\" \"bright and airy\" space, said owner Courtney Fitzpatrick. Now that the renovations are complete and the yoga program has settled in, she felt it was time to open up possibilities for other wellness-oriented small business owners. The upstairs area of the house contains a furnished office suitable for practitioners who meet and speak with clients one-on-one or in small groups of up to four people, such as talk therapists, nutritionists, and life coaches. Another room is set up with a massage table and is ready for massage therapists and other body workers, Reiki practitioners, and others. The larger downstairs spaces typically used for Yoga and other group classes are also available for trainings, workshops, and classes. To ensure no space conflicts, co-op members will have access to the Yoga House's shared scheduling software, where they can reserve time spots and see when each space is being used by others. Fitzpatrick explained that the co-op is for \"community-minded\" professionals who want to share space and be part of the wellness community. The co-op will also host a monthly healing arts business development coaching program for those interested in growing their business.

Sarah Page is an Enneagram Coach hosting a monthly discussion on the Enneagram in the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti area. The Enneagram is a personality typing system that helps people understand themselves and others better. People are categorized into one of nine Enneagram types, which gives insights into how each type views the world, how they manage their emotions and relate to others, their strengths, and weaknesses. Page explained that: Understanding ourselves on a fundamental level [using the Enneagram system] offers access points for self-awareness, acceptance, compassion, and transformation. It also provides valuable insights for relationships: increasing compassion and understanding for others; helping to diagnose the root cause of behaviors and conflicts; and providing new directions for love, cooperation, and reconciliation. She said that the Enneagram helps on the personal level by helping us understand our own strengths, weaknesses, and blind spots, and on an interpersonal level by helping us understand where our friends, coworkers, family members, and romantic partners are coming from. There are many levels to the Enneagram, she said; she has studied it for 15 years and still feels she grows in understanding all the time. Page started the discussion group in the spring of 2019. It moves to various coffee shops and breweries in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, and offers a chance for people interested in personal development, building community, and using the Enneagram as a tool for these purposes to share insights, questions, and challenges with one another in a casual setting. The group is small so far, with five or six people usually attending. Those interested in participating in the Enneagram discussion group or in individual coaching can email Sarah Page at sarah@sarah-page.org, or view her website at sarah-page.org. Guiding partners Judy Ramsey and Rachel Egherman of Head To Toe Therapies in Ann Arbor are adding a new aspect to their business in January of 2020. Head to Toe has offered body work for 22 years, and will continue to do so, but additionally they will offer new end-of-life services. Ramsey explained that the business has had several loyal, long-term clients pass away in the last two years from different causes, from terminal illness, to sudden death. She and Egherman had Miriam Levy Vincent is a Senior Care Consultant and Dementia Care Educator operating in Ann Arbor. For the last six years Vicent has worked as a senior companion and advocate; she is now adding consulting to her offered services. She can help families who have questions and need direction and support when their loved one is going through age-related health changes and care needs. She calls her process \"struggles to strategies,\" and helps people \"explore a range of options beyond traditional and limited ways of thinking about care.\" The process is individualized to the needs of the senior and their family caregivers, and is focused toward creating a plan for \"positive living\" for both the senior and their families as the necessity for care increases. Vincent has personal experience with dementia in a loved one. She was inspired to get into her current profession when her father became ill and she observed other elders suffering from lack of companionship and support. Since then, she has completed dementia care training through Positive Approach to Care, a \"person-centered program\" created by Teepa Snow in response to deficiencies she saw in existing models of care. Vincent has also done self-study in how lifestyle impacts brain health and \"meaningful and novel approaches to care.\" She enjoys using creative problem solving to come up with ways to improve the lives of seniors experiencing dementia and their loved ones. She explained that she feels that the \"wisdom of the elders\" is important and present, \"even when dementia-related symptoms are present.\" Vincent offers a free consultation conversation to determine whether she is a good fit to work with a family. She emphasized that the process may be more affordable than people think, and that a lot of planning and problem solving can be accomplished, sometimes in only four or five hours of consulting time. All of her consulting work is offered by the hour, and \"it can be as much or as little as someone wants,\" for example, she can get a family started with basic questions, directions, and resources very quickly, or be very involved in the decision making process and care design. She also said that she keeps current on aging-related topics and research, as well as local programs that are \"accessible, informative, and/or enjoyable for seniors and family caregivers.\" More information is available on Mariam Vincent's webpage, a2caringcompanion. com. She can be reached by email at MiriamLevyVincent@gmail.com or by calling (734) 972-1074. Spiritual Medium Jani Cooke has worked as a professional medium for about six years, and has done events and readings in Tecumseh and surrounding areas, but is relatively unknown in Ann Arbor, where she lives. She recently leased an office space on Jackson Road where she sees groups and individuals, and she is actively seeking to do more spiritual work in the Ann Arbor area. She explained that she \"receive[s] messages from angels, guides, and deceased loved ones to assist [people] to live [their] highest life possible.\" In addition to mediumship, she does spiritual coaching. She said that she is inspired by the work of Byron Katie, author of Loving What Is , A Mind At Home With Itself, and A Thousand Names for Joy, which Cooke said she recommends regularly to her clients and everyone else, and describes as her \"go-to metaphysical book.\" Cooke said that in all her spiritual work she is working toward helping people heal their souls. When there's a message from spirit for someone, she explained, she frequently witnesses those people, when they are able to open themselves to the message, \"regain the ability to breathe when they had no idea they were holding their breath.\" Many people have spiritual struggles or blocks they haven't been able to get past, and she loves to help them \"make space for healing in order to live their biggest, highest lives.\" Information and testimonials are available on Jani Cooke's website, janicooke.com.

The University of Michigan Museum of Natural History opened a second phase of permanent exhibits on November 10th. The Museum opened in its new home inside the University's new $261 million, 312,000 square-foot Biological Sciences Building in April, after vacating the Ruthven Building, which had been its home since 1928. Since the move, the Museum has hosted more than 100,000 visitors. New exhibits added in November include Under the Microscope, which includes a giant walk-in model of a cell; People and the Planet, which explores how humans and the natural world shape each other; and the Exploring Michigan gallery, which uses hands-on activities and life-size dioramas to illustrate our state's natural history. Two \"Investigate Labs\" have been added, where visitors can learn about the natural world and ways in which we humans study it by close-up interaction with parts of the Museum's collection and tools like microscopes. The new exhibits join the Museum's notable mastodon skeleton pair, its prehistoric whale skeletons, touchable Tyrannosaurus Rex skull, and a huge evolution exhibit covering 4 billion years. When it opened in April, new features included a 25-foot life-size reconstruction of a Quetzalcoatlus p terosaur suspended in a five-story atrium, a Planetarium and Dome Theater, a Fossil Prep Lab where visitors can observe researchers preparing fossils for study and display, a multimedia Tree of Life display illustrating the ways in which all living things are connected, and the Student Showcase featuring research projects from U-M undergraduate students in a variety of disciplines. The UMMNH is part of the U-M College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. Its history goes back as far as 1841, when the U-M's first natural history collections went on public display. On January 25 and 26, the Museum will host a Great Lakes Weekend, for which details are still in development. For more information about the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History, visit ummnh.org. The Museum is located at 1105 North University Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI 48103.

Patty Brennan, owner of Center for the Childbearing Year, and co-owner with Merilynne Rush of Lifespan Doulas, consolidated their businesses into one entity called Lifespan Doulas. The building housing the Center for the Childbearing Year will remain Lifespan Doulas' home, and it will continue to serve as a collective space for childbirth-related services through the Breastfeeding Center of Ann Arbor, New Moon Midwifery, and Ann Arbor Doulas. A birth or postpartum doula provides support to new mothers, providing experienced knowledge and teaching skills related to birth, breastfeeding, caring for the baby, and helping make space for the mother to recover physically and emotionally. An end-of-life doula helps provide non-medical care for a dying person's physical, emotional, and spiritual needs, as well as supporting their loved ones during this time. Lifespan Doulas now offers comprehensive, professional birth, postpartum, and end-of-life doula training and certification, and business development for doulas. Brennan is the author of The Doula Business Guide: How to Succeed as a Birth, Postpartum or End-of-Life Doula (now in its 3 rd edition). She teaches the birth and postpartum doula training programs, and co-teaches the end-of-life doula training with Rush. Rush is the President of the National End-of-Life Doula Alliance and is on the boards of several other respected organizations related to end-of-life, home funerals, and green burial.

The store is described as \"Michigan's largest source of Homeopathic Medicines.\" It is located in the Parkway Center, a pair of Victorian houses saved from demolition and moved five miles from South Main Street in downtown Ann Arbor to their current location on Huron Parkway in 1987 by holistic doctors Edward Linkner and Dennis Chernin. The houses were then remodeled and became home to a variety of holistic medical practitioners such as chiropractors, dentists, homeopaths, naturopaths, massage therapists, psychotherapists, Reiki practitioners, and others in addition to Castle Remedies. Tillinghast began working for Dr. Linkner before the houses were moved, as part of his practice to serve his own patients. Afterward, they opened the pharmacy to help the public access homeopathic medicines. At the time, there was no other place to get homeopathic medicine in Ann Arbor or nearby. Dr. Linkner still owns the business and acts as a medical consultant, advising on new herbs and supplements. Tillinghast and Potere abide by the guidelines in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, the \"official compendium for homeopathic drugs in the United States.\" Tillinghast has taught introductory classes in homeopathic medicines for many years as well as managing the pharmacy. She will leave for a four-month sabbatical to Ireland in January, where she plans to write a memoir. When she returns to Ann Arbor afterward, she will decide whether to resume teaching. Potere has worked at the pharmacy for seven years as a buyer, sourcing herbs and supplements and keeping the store stocked. She attended pharmacy college before changing her career focus to homeopathic remedies. She has been very successful at finding and acquiring rare remedies and herbs, said Tillinghast. She has taken an intensive herbology course with David Winston at the Center for Herbal Studies, and may begin teaching classes herself at Castle Remedies, possibly expanding into new topics such as flower essences, herbs, and essential oils, depending on public interest. She explained that she doesn't intend to make any drastic changes, preferring to keep the store a familiar and helpful place for the many loyal customers, and looking for small and sustainable ways to grow. The pharmacy fills prescriptions from holistic and homeopathic doctors, but also stocks a variety of herbs and supplements that are sold over the counter to people looking to improve their health naturally. The staff can advise customers on supplements, guide them to excellent sources for more information, and refer them to some of the many excellent holistic practitioners in the area. It also stocks a variety of unique items and gifts in all price points\u2014jewelry, d\u00e9cor, and more. They offer a frequent buyer discount program and senior and student discounts. The store employs six people in full and part-time positions, said Tillinghast and Potere, and they are described as a close-knit, \"harmonious\" family-like group. Everyone does a little bit of everything, from stocking shelves to cleaning to serving customers. Potere said the store is a \"magical place,\" and that the focus is on \"making people happy.\" A recent addition is an in-store library where people can settle into a comfortable chair and read up on herbs and remedies. Castle Remedies is located at 2345 South Huron Parkway, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. More information is available at its website, castleremedies.com.

Grey is a Michigan native and has lived in Ann Arbor for seven years. She works as a clinical dietician at the VA Medical Center and writes for Food & Nutrition magazine. This is her first published work of fiction. The novel centers around Olivia, a strong, \"feisty\" and independent 88-year old woman whose life is thrown into chaos when a fire destroys her home. On moving in with relatives, she finds an old jewelry box from her travels, which turns out to be magical. Along with her great-niece and her great-niece's estranged husband, Olivia is transported through time on a quest that brings each of them back to some of the most painful moments of their lives. It is a family story with a strong spiritual element that explores whether our lives are determined by fate or by the choices we make. The book, along with eight others, is part of the Fifth Avenue Press' third year publishing local authors. The Press grew out of a writers' group that met at the library, and Grey credits it with helping her to craft her book into \"something I'm really proud of.\" All That We Encounter is available at the Crazy Wisdom Bookstore.

This is the first time this training is being offered in Ann Arbor in over a decade. Inner Engineering is a daily practice created by Yogi and Mystic, Sadhguru. According to local teacher Jyoti Jankowski, it takes 21 minutes per day, comprises physical and meditational aspects, and helps one to \"perceive and think about life in a different way.\" It is a way of stress reduction or management, and is \"capable of creating a significant impact on individual well-being, allowing an individual to live a more balanced and joyful life.\" She said it has impacted her own life significantly, allowing her to create balance within her life, including raising her children. She explained that one does not have to ascribe to any particular belief system as it is \"independent of background or religion,\" and \"transcends all cultures.\" It is a tool for living, she said, not a belief system. Anyone 15 years old or older can participate in the training, and Jankowski said it is great for families to take together. It will be held at the Ann Arbor Regent Conference Center on Carpenter Road. Two evening session on Thursday and Friday will be held from 6:30 to 9:45 p.m. The Saturday and Sunday sessions will last all day, with healthy vegetarian meals served. Early Bird registration ends on March 3rd and reduces the cost from $325 to $285. Nurses and massage therapists will be able to claim continuing education credits from the training. Isha Foundation teachers will be offering free meditation and yoga events at Ann Arbor Public Libraries and the Crazy Wisdom Bookstore leading up to this event, to allow potential participants to \"get a taste\" of what Inner Engineering can offer.

Having w orked for years as a board-certified physician in internal medicine and geriatrics, first at Harvard and then at the University of Michigan, she had to retire earlier than planned due to health concerns. During her retirement she attended the One Spirit Interfaith Seminary and was ordained as an Interfaith Minister. Afterward, she completed a two-year program in Interspiritual Counseling. She began her practice in June of 2019 after achieving the certification. Rosenblatt said she has \"always had a very committed spiritual practice of my own,\" and that part of her spiritual practice is to be of service to others. Her spiritual counseling practice is a way for her to fulfill that desire. She approaches spirituality and aging from a perspective that aging involves a lot of loss: not just in bereavement but in one's own ability to perceive the world as hearing and vision may decline, loss in mobility and ability to work and do all the activities once enjoyed, loss of robust health, loss of independence, and sometimes loss of one's home as care needs increase. All of these losses can bring deep feelings of grief, despair, and rage, and seniors often find little support for coping. Rosenblatt said that studies show that seniors who have a strong spiritual connection have better outcomes in health and quality of life over time. This can be especially difficult to achieve and maintain for those who may consider themselves spiritual but who have no religious affiliation, since they may not have the social and structural support or leadership support a religious community brings. Rosenblatt teaches the use of different tools and practices for seniors to use to \"strengthen their connection to the divine as they understand it,\" including meditation, journaling, artwork, guided meditation, time in nature, and more. She becomes a companion for those she assists through their journey in integrating spiritual wisdom, insights, and connection into their daily lives. She draws from wisdom and practices from many religions and faith traditions, and follows what she described as a \"Yogic path based on meditation, chanting, and selfless service.\" She also offers free workshops, as part of her spiritual service to others, on spirituality as a resource for coping with loss in later life. Her counseling services are offered on a sliding scale to ensure that seniors who wish to work with her can do so in a way that works for their budget. More information about Dr . Dorrie Rosenblatt and her Inter-spiritual Counseling practice can be found at RevDorrie.weebly.com. She can be reached by phone at (734) 665-4186 or by email at drosenbl@umich.edu.

New Practitioners and Businesses Energy healer Shellie Powers recently moved back to her home state of Michigan after 16 years in Florida and 19 years in California to be closer to her family. She is trained in a variety of energy healing modalities that she uses to help clients achieve their highest level of well-being. Powers' journey into energy healing began in Florida, where she had moved for school and then a career as an executive assistant. After 16 years there, she began to have prophetic dreams and visions. \"It wasn't really a thing you talked about at the time,\" she said, but she also began to have a strong premonition that she needed to move to California. After applying for and being accepted into an acupuncture school in San Diego, she moved, ready to start a new chapter of her life. However, soon afterward a close friend died unexpectedly at age 36, and she was thrown into a deep and all-encompassing grief affecting all parts of her life. Since her support structures were back in Florida and Michigan, and she didn't want to worry anyone, she struggled for five years before finally seeking help. She connected with a holistic doctor who used tapping, a technique of reprogramming the nervous system and energy body through tapping meridian points with the fingertips. This helped somewhat but she continued to struggle. Eventually, she stumbled upon a book by Dr. Eric Pearl: The Reconnection: Heal others, heal yourself . She described Pearl's teachings as \"like Reiki, but hands-off,\" helping people to \"remove blocks in spirit.\" Unlike many modalities, Reconnection Healing is done for no more than three sessions, she explained. She felt a major shift in her energy and life and began training to become a practitioner herself. In the years since, Powers has trained in and practiced many healing methods. She is a certified practitioner of Reconnective Healing (level I, II and III), a Reiki Master, and an Akashic Records reader and healer. She works with chakra alignment and Transformational Hypnosis and has received several other healing activations (one-time spiritual downloads, in effect, which are believed to alter the practitioner's energy body with various effects) including the Universal Sphere, the 111 Activations, and the Tree of Life Crystalline Activation. Powers works with clients one-on-one and in groups, and also offers a variety of trainings, activations, classes, and workshops online and in person. For each person she works with, she can pick and choose from her energetic \"toolbox\" of modalities and techniques to help people deal with grief, feeling, \"stuck,\" and with any transformations they are looking to enact in their lives.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 51 GREEN LIVING One Step Toward WasteTALKING TRASH There was genuine shock on my face when my youngest sister, at just 11-years-old, accompanied me to a Starbucks on a weekend visit and very firmly told the barista that no, thank you, she did not need a straw. She had brought her own. My shock continued as she reached into her purse and pulled out a reusable metal straw. After she finished her drink, she then lovingly washed it out and put it away before we continued with our day. I'd like to say I taught her that, but unfortunately this is one I can't take credit for. She informed me it was a trend among children her age right now, all of them buying reusable straws with the rallying cry of \"save the turtles.\" Oh sweetheart, I thought, if only it were that cut and dry. I did not, however, say this, but instead commended her for her efforts. Anne-Marie Bonneau, a noted zero waste chef, recently shared her thoughts that \"We don't need a handful of people doing zero waste perfectly. We need millions of people doing it imperfectly.\" I am far from perfect in my efforts, and I know so many others have seemingly insurmountable obstacles in their own way. Time, money, and yes, privilege, all play a factor in how close we can get to reducing our own personal environmental impact. I was first introduced to Zero Waste the way any good millennial seems to be introduced to anything these days, the internet. I was fascinated when I came across a video of Lauren Singer, founder of the Package Free Shop, who can fit multiple years' worth of waste to landfill in a small mason jar she displays proudly on her counter. She made it all sound so easy, and if she could do it in her small Manhattan apartment, then I thought, surely I could accomplish Zero Waste to Landfill in my own tiny space. I dove in headfirst, recklessly auditing my life and removing anything that didn't fit this new ideal. It wasn't long before I was up to my ears in reusable alternatives, and I managed to fail spectacularly and go back to my old ways. Now, years later, I'm toddling my way through the baby steps of a Zero Waste journey, and I'd like to share some practical tips with all of you. The first thing I'd invite you to do is look up others in the Zero Waste space. See their perfectly organized flat lays on Instagram of their grocery hauls, their bathroom products, their bamboo, and steel, and glass... and then promptly forget it all. The first thing I've discovered with zero waste is this, it doesn't have to fit into an aesthetic. Instead, try out one or all of these tips to get started on your own Zero Waste adventure! 1. Give Up Your Plastic Water Bottles\u2014and use a cup instead. I have fond memories of a favorite professor who, to my horror, drank her water from a large cup she brought with her every day to class. She had no fancy water bottles that I was so apt to purchase, and she didn't need one. Right at her disposal she had something that could help her save thousands of plastic bottles to landfill each year. So, she practiced one of the main R's of Zero Waste\u2014repurpose\u2014and so opened my eyes to how easy it all can be. 2. Let Your Produce Roll Free! Yes, I sometimes get odd looks from my cashier on this one, but trust me, you don't need those thin plastic produce bags every time you make a purchase. There are now lots of beautiful reusable options out there, but don't feel like you must go out and buy them! I put everything except my greens in my cart and let them roll free. Lots of produce comes with its own wrapper from nature, but even things like tomatoes and peppers will be okay in your cart. I promise! Unlike some other plastics which can be recycled only a few times before being sent to landfill, those thin plastic bags are extremely difficult to process, and almost no curbside recycling programs take them. Leave them behind and let your produce wear what nature gave it! 3. Compost, Compost, CompostSome cities, like Ann Arbor, are starting curbside composting programs in addition to recycling and trash pickup. If you don't have that as an option in your area, take the time to research other options. Sometimes farmers markets, restaurants, stores, or other establishments will collect compost scraps. You can also start your own compost pile in your back yard! Most people think things like fruit and vegetable scraps are harmless to throw in the garbage. They're under the assumption that these scraps will decompose in a landfill. In reality, food scraps get too buried to properly decompose, and the pressure lets off high amounts of methane gas that contributes to climate change. Composting is one of many moves you can make toward more conscious living. 4. Replace As You GoFor some changes in a Zero Waste journey, there aren't sustainable items already on hand. Sure, you can use the Tupperware you already have for food storage rather than plastic wrap, but what about dental floss? Or toothbrushes? Some non-recyclable plastics take a little more care to get out of our way of living. Luckily, there are lots of amazing companies both locally and globally putting in the work to make sustainable living available to everyone. Rather than doing what I did when I first started down this path and trying to do it all at once, may I highly encourage that you replace as you go. Toothbrush worn out? Try a compostable bamboo alternative instead of buying another one that's plastic. Out of Keurig pods? Buy a reusable pod to fill with fresh ground bulk coffee every morning. There are what can feel like an endless amount of changes we can make to be more sustainable. However, this slow replacement method will help make it light work. 5. When in Doubt, Throw it Out! While this may seem counterintuitive to everything we've talked about thus far, there's no shame in throwing something you're unsure about in the trash as you're learning about your area's recycling capabilities. Something as small as one grocery bag in a curb side recycling bin can cause several pounds of lost recyclables at a facility. For the plastic you can't avoid, please take the time to research if it is recyclable or not. While Zero Waste to Landfill is a huge topic around which several books have been written, I hope these few tips gave you a jumping off point in your own sustainability efforts. Remember, just because our efforts are imperfect doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Any difference is better than no difference at all. I encourage you to take a moment and reflect on how you too can charge at sustainability with the same childlike abandon my sister exhibits every time she whips out that reusable straw. Now, go forth and reuse. Thanks for talking trash with me! Alaina Lightfoot has a Bachelor of Arts in English-Creative Writing from the University of Findlay.

By Alaina Lightfoot She informed me it was a trend among children her age right now, all of them buying reusable straws with the rallying cry of \"save the turtles.\" Time, money, and yes, privilege, all play a factor in how close we can get to reducing our own personal environmental impact. I dove in headfirst, recklessly auditing my life and removing anything that didn't fit this new ideal. It wasn't long before I was up to my ears in reusable alternatives, and I managed to fail spectacularly... ...just because our efforts are imperfect doesn't mean we shouldn't try. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 52 by Namita Sachdev, MD and Elizabeth Shadigian, MD Managing any illness is challenging, and conventional medical care\u2014the current \"doctors at the top and patients at the bottom\" status quo health care (SQHC)\u2014 provides diagnosis and treatment of acute life-threatening illnesses such as a heart attack, stroke, or pneumonia with mostly excellent results. Acute illnesses such as these require an immediate, short-term, reactive approach and generally resolve once appropriate treatment is completed. In contrast, treatment of a chronic illness is most effective with an incremental, long-term, proactive approach to managing symptoms. However, SQHC has not yet evolved to treat chronic illness optimally. A chronic illness is life-long and has symptoms that come and go or are present continuously. In many cases, multiple chronic illnesses exist simultaneously. When you have a chronic illness, a health care provider may not know the exact diagnosis and will tentatively use \"a working diagnosis\" while a full work-up is pursued. During this time you will still have to cope with symptoms and may not have a clear treatment strategy yet. You may feel like congratulations are in order when your chronic illness is first identified or diagnosed. It may have been many years of scattered symptoms and multiple health care visits to generalists and specialists. You may have had feelings of self-doubt and uncertainty about your symptoms until the reality of having a chronic, serious health condition is confirmed. SQHC has divided health into two broad categories of body and mind and treats each category separately. All illness has physical and psychological components, and it is necessary to treat both the body and mind simultaneously, especially with chronic illness. When a chronic illness is finally diagnosed, physical symptoms can be overwhelming and difficult to manage. You may also have upsetting thoughts that recur in combination with feelings of fear, frustration, loss, or anger. The ph ysical and psychological components always work together, and to treat only one will not produce long-lasting beneficial results. Chronic illness is characterized by ongoing physical and psychological symptoms that worsen and improve over time. Patricia Fennell describes the four phases of chronic illness as crisis, stabilization, resolution, and integration, in her book The Chronic Illness Workbook. This four-phase model describes how you may experience chronic illness and how to identify which phase you are experiencing. Understanding the signs and symptoms of each phase can help you develop and implement management strategies\u2014ways to cope with your illness. For e xample, during the crisis phase, medical treatment can be complex. Partnering with your health care provider and building a team of health professionals can be a slow and frustrating process. Some of the s trategies in this phase require ensuring your own secure physical space and learning to hang on through the changes and suffering which may occur. A chronic illness can create feelings of trauma, loss, and grief that are unique to each person. Acknowledging and recognizing these feelings can give you insight into what is happening to you and can help you better manage the crisis phase. Another important part of caring for yourself during this phase is to ask to see your health care provider more frequently based on your physical and psychological needs. You may want to have separate support from a counselor or psychotherapist as well. Having a health c are advocate at your visits during the crisis phase can also be helpful to assist you in gathering information, providing support, and advocating for yourself. You can get the best out of your health care experience by having another set of eyes and ears with you before, during, and after medical appointments. At WomanSafeHealth, the term \"woman advocate\" is used and applies to clients of any gender seeking care. A woman advocate differs from a health care advocate in at least three important ways. A woman advocate is aware of the: a) woman seeking health care's particular herstory, b) power dynamics in all health care settings, and c) sexism and other oppressions women are up against seeking health care. A w oman advocate can be a friend, family member, colleague, or trained professional.Feeling empowered to ask for information about treatment options, risks of treatment, and the time frame for decisions will develop over time. Since most of the care given to the person who has a chronic illness is given by herself or himself, the care given by you is essential, necessary \"self-care.\" You are also making multiple daily decisions to manage your illness. As you enter the stabilization phase you may look for others with a similar illness. You will have greater control of your symptoms, but you, your friends, and family may still have difficulty accepting that the illness is ongoing or chronic. Your symptoms will likely worsen some days and your physical capability may change from day to day. These fluctuations can lead to uncertainty and variations in mood. The goal in the stabilization phase is to develop an \"observing\" self; this will help you pay attention to what you do and how you do it. By tracking your symptoms to look for patterns, restructuring your activities based on your physical boundaries, and learning to understand your thinking patterns, you can learn to manage your symptoms over time. When you are empowered, involved, and feel competent in caring for your chronic illness, you have a tremendous positive impact on the outcome of your illness and your quality of life. As you move toward the resolution phase you accept your illness as chronic, and as your \"observing\" self develops, you recognize the triggers that increase symptoms. You understand there is ambiguity in the course of chronic illness and have compassion for yourself. You begin to reflect on the change in yourself from your pre-illness self and develop insight into your losses. You are able to maintain a more stable and meaningful life. A linear progression through the four phases of chronic illness does not exist. Symptom flares come and go, and over time your ability to anticipate flares and head them off improves. In the integration phase you understand that recovery, stabilization, and relapse are part of the normal cycle of chronic illness. You develop a new \"personal best,\" engaging in joyful activities and integrating the chronic illness into your life. So, congratulations on your diagnosis and your ability to cope and thrive.

It was lovely, and I don't recall the name, or much about it, as it came and passed rather suddenly in the practice. Do you recognize this and can you tell me more? Sandy, Ann ArborNamaste, Sandy,I think that I do! If I am way out of sorts, let me know, and we'll try something else next issue. I believe that you are speaking of Breath of Joy. This Pranayama practice is an invigorating practice that awakens heat and fire in the body, while the forceful exhale and forward fold provides a space for release. Breath of Joy is used in many varieties of asana practice, as it is emotionally uplifting and offers balance to the body. To c ome into Breath of Joy, start in Tadasna or Mountain Pose. During the first third of your inhale bring the arms up to about shoulder height, in front of your body. The next third of the inhale takes the arms out to the \"T\" position you mentioned, and the last third of the breath takes the arms overhead. The exhale is a forceful release while folding into and Uttansana, a Forward Fold. One point on the Forward Fold; take that fold as deep, or as soft as feels good. For those of us with blood pressure issues, a full fold may be too much. This is also a breath practice that is best to ease into, start with three rounds of the breath, and if it feels like a safe and healing space, the next time, try five breaths and so on. See what joy you can find in this breath today!The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 53 Photo by Hilary NicholsNamaste, Katie... Whether you're a seasoned yogi or getting ready to roll out your mat for the first time, here you'll find a variety of useful tips from local yoga instructor, Katie Hoener. Namaste, Katie, Over the cold months, I feel like I am frequently scrunching my shoulders toward my ears, and my ears toward my shoulders. My shoulders and my chest feel tight as a result. I try to pay attention, and relax when I can. Is there a particular posture that I could add to the end of my day to assist with relaxing these areas? Gina, DexterNamaste, Gina,This is a common concern for many in our Michigan winters. As the weather changes from moment to moment on some days, we carry a lot of that anticipation and reaction, and hold that tension within the body. As you mentioned, common places to hold stress in the body are the shoulders, the chest, and not specifically stated, the neck. Though we all have 'hot spots' in the body where tension loves to hang out, these are common areas for a large number of Michiganders. One particular asana that ma y be useful to you in the cold months to relieve tension is Dhanurasana, or Bow Pose. This posture has many benefits, one of which is to release the front of the shoulders, chest, and neck. In addition to these openings, Bow Pose strengthens the back, and uses the breath, with contact with the floor, to massage the organs. To c ome into Dhanurasana, lay on your mat (or the floor) face down. You may wish to come into a Crocodile Pose in between sides, if you are choosing to take a Half Bow, and move from one side to the other. Let's start with this option. Gently find the right foot with the right hand, feel free to use a prop, such as a strap, if that is a safe choice for your body. On an inhale, pr ess the foot into hand, and float the chest off the floor. Allow the neck to remain neutral, so the gaze will stay on, or near, the floor. Allow the shoulder blades to reach down the back as you engage the glutes and the muscles of the lower back. Breathe deeply, and see if you can notice the movement of the abdomen along the floor or mat. Gently lower down, and rest on one side of the face, or return to Crocodile Pose. Take a few breaths here until you are ready to move to the other side. Another option is t o take a full Dhanurasana, where both feet come to the hands at the same time. In this variation of Bow Pose, we press both feet into the hands, and want to make sure the knees are magnetizing toward one another to help with stabilizing the pelvis. Find the right amount of lift that makes the shoulders feel open and the spine feel long. After a few connected breaths, lower yourself down, and find a resting space. Namast e, Katie, I have been taking meditation classes, and yoga when I can, and I understand that 'yoga is the quieting of the mind.' I struggle at times to explain this idea to my friends and family. Do you have any tips? Steve, Ann ArborNamaste, Steve,You are not alone in recognizing this challenging concept! When we discuss \"yoga citta vritti nirodhah\" we discuss the calming of the modifications of the mind, or the mind-stuff. You are absolutely right that translating mind-stuff can be a daunting proposition. Michael Singer's The Untethered Soul does a lovely job of describing this chatter of the mind. He opens his book describing these modifications as an \"Inner Roommate.\" Michael Singer states that this inner roommate comments on all that we do, and narrates every moment that we have. If we can think of this \"inner roommate\" narration, as additional fluctuations of the mind, we can begin to make sense of what we are working with.This Pranayama practice is an invigorating practice that awakens heat and fire in the body, while the forceful exhale and forward fold provides a space for release. Yoga Column One particular asana that may be useful to you in the cold months to relieve tension is Dhanurasana, or Bow Pose.This, plus all of the external stimuli that we interact with on a daily, even momentary basis, are a portion of what makes up the mind-stuff. We add to that memories, plans, and thought patterns, and the mind becomes a busy place to be in, much less a place of rest. If we can think of this \"inner roommate\" narration, as additional fluctuations of the mind, we can begin to make sense of what we are working with. Not only are we trying to quiet the thoughts, we are working to quiet the response to the thoughts! This is not an easy task, and yet the process begins one minute at a time. As we ha ve tried to develop throughout this column, and we will continue to do so, yoga is meditation. This quieting of the mind that you so beautifully bring forward, is the essence of our practice, our mission statement so to speak. So, perhaps we start with one minute of meditation each day, and build from there to a place that feels comfortable within our lives. Best of luck with your inner roommate.

A Meat Eater's Guide to Supporting Local Farmers, Mongers, and Butchers Page 56Conscious & Tasty food and nutritionThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 56 By Angela Madaras Photography by Rachael Waring My passion for great food, and for those who produce and handle all aspects of providing it, is at times an obsession. I become a little rapt when meat and fish are involved because I have health issues that demand clean, healthy food, and environment. I place huge emphasis on the person behind the product when I embark on seeking out a farmer, hunter, monger, or purveyor. There is a symbiotic relationship between one who raises, gathers, and hunts animal meat and the end consumer. This relationship should be taken on with deep sincerity and thoughtfulness. I prefer, when possible, to purchase meat from animals bred and raised locally. The animals feed from grass in the pasture where they live and roam, until they are nearing full growth. At this point they are usually grain fed for higher fat marbling, but the lives of the animals are still cared for and properly managed. We support our neighbors, friends, and family that spend their time feeding and caring for their livestock. We take a weekend every year to butcher a hog with family and friends. We also buy half a cow from a local farm and tell the butcher exactly how to cut it up in ways we will get the best use of the animal's tasty morsels of nutrition for a whole year. The taking of a life stings, and feels incredibly intimate and primal, so I offer gratitude for the animal's life force, and take great care to do this in a cognizant way. For the meat we are unable to gather from neighbor farms we use some of the following locally owned, independent shops that specialize in meat products with craftspeople at the helm, who know what they are selling and handle it with care. The following article will explore some of the people who have a hand in making the roasts, salmon, and burgers that appear on your plate. The people and places mentioned here are devoted to their craft. I highly recommend you take a day or two to visit each market, farm, purveyor, and craftsperson highlighted. There are many price ranges to fit any budget, and these people will help you find exactly what you like, want, and perhaps inherently need. Don't be afraid to ask questions and learn about what you are putting in your body. My hope is that if one is to eat animal products they will do it in an educated way. And those local pros in the business who take the time to care will be supported and able to continue for many years to come. The setting is of utmost importance if one considers the health of the animal and how that translates in one's body. Purchase good meat from animals that are raised on healthy, well-managed land and water! Building a relationship with farmers-producers is a good way to begin the journey of the animal becoming fare. EMMA Acres Farm is one local farm that sells rare breed chickens, heritage hogs, lamb, and cows wholesale and retail directly from their location. They offer customers a weekly slot to purchase meats directly. Some of their products are found in the frozen A Meat Eater's Guide to Supporting Local Farmers, Mongers, and ButchersCarnivores Unite! Carnivores Unite! There is a symbiotic relationship between one who raises, gathers, and hunts animal meat and the end consumer. This relationship should be taken on with deep sincerity and thoughtfulness. Stephanie Willette, manager at the Ann Arbor Farmer's Market. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 57 section at Argus Farm Stop in Ann Arbor, and Agricole in Chelsea. Farmer Mark Skowronski, a scientist by trade, hails from a long line of farmers, as does his wife Michelle Kahlenberg (a doctor and researcher) who is responsible for growing the organic garden produce. Their farm is now 100% solar powered and resilient for future generations. Another one of the many local farms that sell organic meats is Whitney Farmstead in Ann Arbor. Local young couple, Maliaka Whitney and Mathew Haarklou, decided to remain on her sixth generation family farm. They are extremely passionate about preserving farm land and farms in our area because of the long history their family shares with the land and community. They want future generations to inherit this farm and keep it vibrant for many years to come. Their website whitneyfarmstead.com describes their business and practices best: In addition to farmers markets (Ann Arbor and Webster) and Argus Farm Stop, we also offer a year round diversified meat CSA. Pickups are from the farm and offerings include 100% grass-fed beef and lamb, and pastured pork and chicken. Our CSA membership perks include a wide variety of nourishing meats in flexible share sizes, as well as member on farm potlucks and pasture walks. All spring, summer, and fall we rotationally graze our livestock on diverse lush Mark Skowronski with one of the calves from Emma Acres Farm on Waters Road. continued on next p agepastures of grasses, legumes, and forbs. Our Heritage Breed cattle are 100% grass fed. Our Heritage Breed Red Wattle Pigs and Broiler Chickens are raised on pasture and fed organically grown (primarily) local grains, minerals and kelp, homegrown milk, hay and pasture, and acorn and hickory nuts from our trees in the fall. According to Stephanie Willette, the Manager of the Ann Arbor Farmers Market, Of the 125 vendors we have at the Ann Arbor Farmers Market, six sell chicken, five beef, three turkey, five pork, two lamb, one fish and one goat. Most sell more than one type of product, so there are only a total of ten vendors that sell meat overall. We have fewer meat vendors than many other The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 58 types of products because the regulations and licensing are stricter for food safety reasons. It's also become more expensive in the past few years to process meat, which is another obstacle. I have found that many customers are very conscientious about how their meat is raised and are interested in the care given to the animals. Vendors who are successful use practices like free range, grass fed or non gmo grain, organic, and no hormones or antibiotics. In the store, these labels can be confusing, because it's not exactly clear what \"organic\" means for how an animal has been raised, and there's still a lot of variation between farm practices. Meat vendors need to tell their story and communicate to customers why their animals are raised humanely and the difference between local meat and that from factory farms. Organic, local (considered within a 50 mile radius) and/or grass fed meat that allows grazing in open healthy fields, is better than organic meat from places outside of the U.S. But that does not mean Illinois or Iowa beef is less than, just that there are lower fuel emissions and transportation costs when you buy closer to home. In addition, we are supporting our local farms, people, community, and economy. Local can mean many different things to many folks and even something different in the industry. Costs are higher from small farms because of processing fees due to a lack of local processors. FDA and state regulations make it a challenge as Willette pointed out. The \"upside\" is that meat production is protected in Michigan and through the Midwest, and worries of health concerns such as serious infections, disease, and such can be almost eliminated. Here is what the Graham Sustainable Institute of the University of Michigan has to say about the local food chain: There is an imbalance in the Southeastern Michigan supply chain involving sustainably and humanely raised animal products. First, the supply chain lacks a shared understanding\u2014from producers to end consumers\u2014of what sustainably and humanely raised animal products are and the spectrum on which they can range in terms of environmental, economic, and social impacts. Second, demand from institutional purchasers and other wholesale buyers like restaurants and stores far outstrip supply. There are many questions surrounding why these gaps exist, yet, there is no lasting group in our region working on this issue. Ann Arbor Storytellers' Guild is delighted to announce...

One retail market and butcher shop, Sparrow's Meats, in Ann Arbor has been in business for almost 35 years in Kerrytown. Owner Bob Sparrow, and his friendly staff, operates an open air meat counter where they butcher meat from local and nonlocal farms for a reasonable price. Many of their products are from West Michigan, surrounding states, and the Midwest. They also sell odd cuts and provide special orders per customer. Their chicken is air dried. It is extremely moist and tasty at three dollars per pound on average. They will even grind it and add ingredients like spinach and feta if you order in advance for a little extra cost. They also sell some organ meats, bones, fois grois, cured meats, and cheeses, have a fabulous sandwich and salad take-out counter, and so much more. It is one of the best retail places to buy reasonably priced meat, with Knights Market a close comparison. Both butchers will custom order and cut whatever you desire. They are happy to answer any questions you have. Both Bob Sparrow of Sparrow's and Vernon Bedolla of Knights, are knowledgeable, seasoned butchers who care about what they do and who they serve. I recently sat with Bob Sparrow for a pleasant conversation. He only buys his goods from a real person, not online, and has developed relationships with all of his producers. When he is able, he procures local meats, but consistency and quantity is a challenge as he also provides meat cuts for about 20 restaurants. Sparrow's Meats employs about forty people, and Sparrow personally trains all his butchers, spending a month or more on food safety-service measures. He hires people who are clean and good at communicating with customers, but he emphasized that safety comes first and foremost. Safety measures include temperature alarms on the refrigerators and other equipment. The market is inspected by the state and USDA regularly and can only accept animals from inspected farms. \"Y ou learn a lot about someone when you share a meal together, \" Anthony Bourdain once said.

Fish mongers are laid back artisans who take great pride in their fresh products. Monahan's also sells kitchen cooked lunches hot off the grill with whatever fish are available in the case. Certain favorites are part of their daily menu, but you can walk up to the counter and pick your fish and sides made to order. They have fish delivered daily from all over the world, but I see mostly Atlantic, Maine, and Michigan offerings in season. They do sell some frozen items and offer meals to take home for re-heating. Catering and bulk sales are welcomed with advance notice. They always have wonderful raw oysters you can slurp at the counter and poor boys on Saturdays. Seating is available inside and out in the shared garden space of Kerrytown. Their staff is knowledgeable, and owner Mike Monahan is usually present to answer questions and offer recipes. Every Friday they send regular customers the \"Friday Fish Report\" with the weekend specials and usually a recipe or two. His family works in the business, too. I trust the sources Monahan's uses, and I do not mind spending a little more to support those who are fishing, raising, and selling the highest quality fish available. They also happily offer their own pickled herring and other cured fishes for bagels and such. The staff is super friendly and fast.

Durham. They make and sell smoked and cured fish on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. They are a small shop with friendly staff and a very informed and jovial owner who loves what he does. He has also authored a cookbook and offers recipes and guidance to assist picky clients.

A family member, we will call him John Smith, drives to Michigan for a half hog and half a cow every year. He is in the meat industry, trained as a butcher, and has worn many hats since. He travels all over the country for his work, attending industry shows and meat plants, and knows some of the key producers for most grocery chains and restaurants. I asked to interview him about his take on the business with forty years experience. Angela Madaras: As a trained butcher, and someone working in the corporate meat industry, why is it important for you to drive to Ann Arbor in order to butcher our pig and buy grass fed beef? Is it for the taste and quality of the mea t, the friendship, family, community, or to support farmers? John Smith: The short answer is YES to all. I would come up to just cut-up the hog and not take a pound of it home because we enjoy that weekend so much. F ortunately, we do take home some of the meat and that is the cherry on the top. Plus, I have really enjoyed getting to know your friends\u2014all very cool and unique people with open arms. The y have made me feel very much at home and part of the group. Farmers have been the \"back bone\" during the evolution of the history of this country, and I have a great respect for them. Never ending work for a few pennies it seems, and always betting against the house. I ha ve seen the meat machine at work for over forty years and have experienced so much.

This list will give you an idea of how to begin your journey into this area of food. The businesses on this list all carry a variety of organic, grass fed, humanely raised, healthily cured meats, but do consider that not all your needs will be met by Michigan products only. Meat and fish come from all over and sometimes that may be the best fit for your needs.

I enjoy eating the locally grown meat, knowing there is a lineage to them and they are raised in a healthy, nutritious, sustainable manner. The fla vor is real and not enhanced with process aids that inundate the protein sector today. I am no long er a buyer of meat that is in the supermarkets. Ther e are some exceptions, there are supermarkets that still cut meat in the back room, but the skill level is low and getting lower. Most of the major supermarkets today have been forced to go to these case-ready operations. Those exceptions will continue to be driven toward the case-ready operations, because it requires less staff. Case-ready meats aren't terrible, and I do not want to give that impression, and the stores are all well run, quality stores where cleanliness is key, but they too are facing a labor shortage, and it's just a matter of time before those operations will struggle with the same issues that all supermarkets face today. Angela Madar as: Where do you see sustainable meat production heading? Is it important for the health of the people, the animals, and the planet? John Smith: Sustainable? I have used that word it feels like thousands of times over the last several years because meat production as we have known it is not sustainable. W e are in a decline and are going to ride this all the way to the crash. It won't happen soon, but I am thinking we are within a ten year window where the industry will not exist as we know it today. The biggest reason I see the meat industry in the U.S. crashing is that there will not be a work force to operate it. Automation is coming, but will not be able to perform all tasks. We started seeing the cracks in the system occur about five to seven years ago, and much more so in the last three. Plants just are not seeing young people willing to work for the wage they are paying\u2014around $40,000 for skilled workers. The work ethic is missing. I have tried to mentor young people in these operations. If they show up, work hard, do a good job, they will be noticed, and it won't be long before they are promoted to the next level. Today, the scene that is repeated way too often, is giving an operator a pay raise which they decline, because it will put them at a pay level that will disqualify them to receive the benefits they are getting from the government. Or they keep the raise and just \"call out\" a day\u2014absenteeism per day approaches 20% in many plants. Immigrants \"saved\" the meat industry in the early to mid 90's when unskilled workers came to the U.S. in droves and quickly learned that the meat industry would gladly put them to work, pay them $7.25 an hour, and let them work as many hours as they wanted. They forced out the American meat industry workers who were making in excess of $15.00 an hour in the 90's, but the owners, and major companies, realized that they could tap into the immigrant worker and pay them a whole lot less, and man did they work. It s tayed that way for about ten years, un til they became \"Americanized.\" They started getting assistance from the U.S. government and realized they didn't have to work so hard for their money, and could collect benefits, like the Americans they replaced a decade earlier. Then the industry started going to other parts of the world to look for workers and brought them over. It is quite typical to go into a meat processing plant today and see signs written in 20 different languages. The Americ an meat worker is an afterthought\u2014probably less than 10% of the work force is American, the rest hail from all points on the globe. There are other factors that will force this change in the meat sector: fuel costs, feed costs, and c osts to replace the old meat plants is staggering. I believe I am right when I say that the average pork plant in the U.S. is over 40 years old. There is one in Sioux Falls, SD that is over 100 years old. It is an activ e relic of a bygone era\u2014eight stories high, slaugh ter on top floor and every bit goes down floor by floor. The book The Jungle was inspired by plants like this. Ther e have been new plants built in the last 20 years, and some in the last five, but on a whole they still only represent 1/5 of the meat plants in the U.S. From a plane t perspective, the amoun t of resources the industry gorges itself on to grow an animal is incredible, and just the amount of fossil fuel it takes to fuel this monster is immeasurable. Not to mention the natural resources consumed. The amoun t of water use each day is in excess of one million gallons per plant. Throw in the seed for feed corn, the most crucial part of the industry, and how it has been genetically modified with pesticides and herbicides, and I believe we are sitting on a time bomb. The industry is moving toward renewable power sources and harnessing some of the methane that comes from the process, but that is only a drop in the bucket. Top management is focused on short term, much is kicked down the road for others to solve. Angela Madaras: Can you tell the difference in meats raised in a humane way? John Smith: I do not believe the difference can be distinguished by most average folks, but there is a huge difference in taste to those who care, and foodies will know the difference, too, but it also makes a huge difference when you look at the larger picture. Processed humanely? I think that is where the real difference lies. All of the pr otein industries are adopting the Gas Stunning method. The animals are brought into the building and are \"put to sleep\" by immersing them into a CO2 tank. The meat quality is better; less thrashing around which leads to less adrenaline racing through the animal. Meat quality is better too. Angela Madaras: Can you share anything else you feel the readers should understand about the corporate meat business versus the local people who continue to raise grass fed and healthy animals and butcher by hand as a craft? John Smith: The large meat processors basically do the same thing: they process meat that is made to sell, not to eat. More and more meat is being processed in a plant with some sort of a process aid, whe ther it is marination or flavor enhancer, and some are injected in excess of 30% water,. The laughable part is they call it \"value added.\" The only value is what profit it brings them. I love the way the small butcher shops are again thriving, ho wever, ther e is a caveat. The meat they are being Carnivores Unite!

The primary difference is the skill level to process it is typically much higher and quality cutting is being done at a small butcher. The abattoirs [slaughterhouses] that are going to thrive are the ones that source meat locally, of a certain quality. Meat that is traceable and grown organically. Once you get to know your local butcher, he/ she will t ake care of you. One doesn't hav e to agree with everything John Smith said to understand that no matter what you are eating, it all comes down to relationship; relationship between you and the farmer, the relationship between the farmer and the animals, and the relationship between the animals and the land. I've given you an opportunity to see a little bit inside the meat business from a couple perspectives, but there are many books written on the subject and documentaries made to educate you about the importance of buying local\u2014not only to support your local economy, but also support your health. I also ask that you consider how YOU define local and what that word means to you.

As a freelancer, I am always on the lookout for a new place to meet with collaborators, get some work done, or just kick back and relax with a tasty beverage alone or joined by loved ones. 19 Drips Coffee and Tea more than fits the bill. Owned and operated by local father-son team, Hisham and Saeed Ebrahim, 19 Drips is located on the thin strip of West Liberty Street between Maple and Stadium roads. It's cozy, simply decorated, and, despite its small size, 19 Drips provides several spots for intimate conversation or to hunker down with a book or laptop. Along the front window is bar seating with high-backed stools. While I was there, smooth jazz played on the stereo. 19 Drips sources its beans from fair trade farmers across the globe. The beans are then tested and locally roasted weekly. Per its website, \"Every coffee we bring is inspected pre and post roasting, giving us the opportunity to get the beans we want to share with our community.\" Many different brewing methods are offered, such as drip, pour over, Chemex, AeroPress, French press, and more. I can't speak to the benefits of all of these various methods, but I admit that I have not seen so many offered together in one shop and it impressed me. I ordered a con miel, one of my favorites less commonly found, and was not at all disappointed. Of course, you can also order an espresso, Americano, cappuccino, latte, mocha, and more. Also on the menu are nine different teas, including another favorite of mine, the matcha latte, a latte-like drink made with powdered green tea. If you're feeling peckish, 19 Drips offers sandwiches, oatmeal, honeycomb bread, sabaya (a layered sweet bread), Le Waf artisan waffles, and cookies. Customers are welcomed to ask about the weekly specials. 19 Drips isn't a crowded coffee shop with an overbearing menu. It's a neighborhood coffee shop that takes care and pride in its product. And it has been a wonderful addition to Ann Arbor's far west side, where the busy intersection of Jackson and Maple roads can make things feel a little hectic. It's refreshing to tune out the traffic, settle in, sip a cup of joy, and enjoy a sweet snack. 19 Drips Coffee and Tea is located at 2263 West Liberty Street in Ann Arbor. They are open Sunday through Thursday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. For more information, contact them online at www.19drips.com or call (734) 585-0461. Fillmore Bar & Grill As you head toward downtown Dexter, you may well miss the Fillmore Bar & Grill as the building is a beautifully converted single-family home on Ann Arbor Street. Bright white columns and trim stand out against the dark blue siding, and concrete steps lead up to the front porch and front door. You may feel like you are visiting someone's home rather than a trendy hangout. Once I stepped through the front door, the house illusion slipped, and I found myself in the main bar area. The floor of the second floor had been removed, doubling the height of the bar's ceiling and infusing the area with a sense of ease and openness. Natural light comes in through the (former) second floor windows, which keeps the room from feeling too dark. Being used to sparsely lit, hole-in-the-wall or basement brewpubs, I was surprised by the choice of light wall paint. I think this is part of what sets the Fillmore apart. It is not a dark and brooding space, but light and fun, a place you can kick back with your friends, enjoy a few drinks, some good food, and maybe watch a game on the TV behind the bar. It's also clean and sophisticated, but not ostentatious. It's a neighborhood bar that suits its surroundings. On to the food! The menu pulls together several popular dishes, such as poutine, spinach dip, chicken wings, pretzel sticks, and offers the Fillmore's own unique twist on each. Among the appetizers, you will also find items like Pan Seared Scallops and Pork Belly Bibimbap, so there is something for everyone. The Happy Hour Five Cheese dip is quite tasty and segues nicely into a French fry dip when the entree arrives. There are several clearly marked on the menu gluten-free and vegetarian options. Buns can be substituted with a lettuce wrap. By Crysta CoburnPhotography by Rachel Everheart 19 Drips isn't a crowded coffee shop with an overbearing menu.

The steak was melt- in-my-mouth tender, each bite a delight. My husband chose the Korean Barbecue Burger, which is such a great combination of flavors. The fries are great even without any special dipping sauces (though the dipping sauces are also pretty tasty). He also ordered a Mule Beer by Short's that did, indeed, taste like the ginger and lime cocktail Moscow Mule, and he's still telling people about it weeks later. Our server was personable and happy to offer comments and suggestions on the menu options. I love it when a restaurant's staff is both knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what they're offering. When they take a vested interest in my experience, I feel more emotionally invested in it, and that enhances the meal. (The reverse is also true.) If you are in the area, drop by. When the weather cooperates, there is a large and lovely deck for outdoor seating. Treat yourself! The Fillmore Bar & Grill is located at 7954 Ann Arbor Street in Dexter. They are open Monday through Thursday from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Happy Hour is every day from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. For more information, visit fillmorebarandgrill.com or call (734) 426-3727. Shimmy Shack Shimmy Shack began as a popular vegan and gluten-free food truck in 2013 as a test to see if people were ready for such a restaurant. The answer seems to have been a resounding yes, and now, in addition to the truck, Shimmy Shack has a brick and mortar location in Plymouth, and it has not lost any of its charm. Shimmy Shack is in its element! The clouds were heavy and a light rain was falling on the day I first visited. Safely tucked under the overhang beside the front door was a rack of \"recycled and repurposed\" clothing. How perfect, I thought, for a business that is devoted to kitsch and lightening the load of our carbon footprints. Once through the door, I knew I was in for a treat. The tables, chairs, and stools are all mixed and matched vintage pieces, no two settings alike. I didn't feel like I had stepped back in time so much as the best pieces of kitchens past had come together to create a colorful, eclectic, welcoming space. I think a lot of thought and care went into creating this unique restaurant, yet it comes across as effortless and just plain fun! Of course, I was there for the food, too, and the all vegan and gluten-free menu is definitely a star. I immediately saw Shimmy's scrumptious cookies, which I know from local Ann Arbor cafes (such as the Crazy Wisdom Tea Room), but I managed to forge ahead and pass them by in favor of a Cookie Monster shake (their own cowgirl cookie blended with vanilla soy ice cream), a Shimmy Coney (grilled Lightlife\u00ae brand soy hotdog, vegan chili, mustard, and finely chopped onion on a grilled gluten-free bun), sweet potato fries, and garlic dipping sauce. Shimmy's menu is obviously diner-inspired with burgers, coneys, pitas, chili, nachos, fries, soups, shakes, and some other fun surprises. It proves that vegan food doesn't have to be fancy or out-of-reach for the average person. What is more traditionally American than burgers and fries? What says \"Michigan\" more than a coney dog? Shimmy brings what might seem like a difficult food choice well within everybody's reach. If you are a meat-eater (as I am), the occasional opening up of your diet to new choices and possibilities won't hurt you. Next to the register is a sign that offers different reasons to go vegan, including allergies, weight and health, religion/spirituality, family, compassion, and the environment. Even cutting down on meat consumption one day a week can have an impact on all of these areas as well. (#MeatlessMonday, anyone?) I know there are people who may worry about being \"preached at\" at a restaurant like this, but I never felt that way at all. It's a celebration of good food. I myself have a restricted diet, so Shimmy's menu is great for me. If you, too, have food intolerances or allergies, you may well rejoice! Especially with those cookies. Shimmy Shack is located at 1440 Sheldon Road in Plymouth. They are open Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., closed Mondays.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 66 By Matthew Silvasi Photography by Joni Strickfaden Over the last few years, there has been an increasing desire to know where and how our food is made. Farm-to-table restaurants, in particular, have been essential for strengthening this movement and lending transparency when it comes to what we eat. While many of us are starting to learn about the farms where our food is produced, we are still mostly unfamiliar with the people who are instrumental in making it all happen. For the better part of two decades, Maggie Long, the executive chef at Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales + Kitchen, has been working tirelessly to seek out and provide, as she would say, \"food that is awesome.\" If you were to sit down and talk to Long, you would quickly find that her career as a chef means much more than spending time in the kitchen. Her passion for fostering connections between farmers and consumers almost makes her appear more like a community organizer before anything else. As a stern advocate for local farmers, when asked what these entrepreneurs could do to help themselves increase their business, Long exclaimed, \"I don't know what more they can do, they are already doing so much. It's the restaurants, schools, food service institutions, and wholesalers that need to step up and support these local entrepreneurs.\" She also couldn't help but compliment the work of others within the community. When the topic of Argus Farms came up, Long stated, Kathy Sample and Bill Brinkerhoff (owners and operators of Argus Farms) are my heroes.\" The enthusiasm Long holds finds its roots within her early years. Long said, \"While growing up, family meals were had together at the table. Food always meant valuing people as well.\" This love for community and food seemed to follow Long wherever she went. While studying social work at Michigan State, she worked at the University as a cook in order to put herself through school. After graduating, she immediately discovered it wouldn't be possible to leave the cooking part of her behind. This path eventually led her to Jolly Pumpkin in Dexter, where she now operates as their executive chef. As executive chef, Long has been responsible for opening and creating the menus at several Jolly Pumpkin locations. She has focused on creating and fostering connections with local farms and farmers such as White Lotus Farms, Green Things, and Cherry Capital Foods. These are just a few examples of Long sourcing ingredients from local producers. All the produce on the current Dexter menu comes from local farms or Jolly Pumpkin's own garden. Even the bread is made using stone ground Michigan wheat. Many might think that sourcing food locally would come with higher cost; however, Long was quick to point out that this isn't always the case. She noted, \"For one, buying produce local means fresh harvest, less travel time, and a better shelf life. The products I get from a local farm may cost more but I get three times the shelf life out of it.\" Long was also quick to point out that it's possible to pay less for better quality food, stating, \"The price I pay for ground beef happens to be less expensive per pound than leading food distributors. I get to pay less for pasture raised ground beef, while at the same time supporting the farmers and the community.\" To Long, the importance of sourcing locally goes well beyond the quality of food\u2014it's about supporting the dedicated farmers who grow our food and the next generation of farmers who are starting to emerge. Long stated, \"If we as restaurant owners and chefs don't support them [the next generation of farmers], they will go away, and in the end the community will suffer.\" It is this attitude toward farming and the community that has led her to do work well outside the walls of the kitchen. In 2011, Long's good friends, Nate and Jill Lada, owners and operators of Green Things Farm, were looking for a way to spread the word about their farm. Long thought of a creative idea that would combine her skills as a chef with the quality produce they were growing. Long proposed doing a buffet night that exclusively used ingredients grown and raised on Green Things Farm. People would be able to enjoy fresh local food while having a chance to to enjoy time on the farm where the food was cultivated. Furthermore, she was also able to line up some musicians to play during the event. Long said, \"What started somewhat slow, with just over 70 guests in 2011, is now an event that hosts well over 200.\" After years of working alongside farmers, Long decided it was time to get her own hands dirty. Long said, \"I wanted to prove to myself that I could do the work that I had always admired others for doing.\" As of this past year, Long finally got this opportunity. One of the farms with which she has a close connection, White Lotus Farms, had recently scaled back their operations and weren't using all of their hoop houses. Maggie offered to rent one of the hoop houses on the farm, but instead, White Lotus Farms decided to donate the space needed for her farming venture. Long stated, \"It is moments like those that I just feel so grateful for the community I get to be a part of.\" While she was brand new to the experience she was fortunate to have the help of Kyla Nance, a bartender at the Dexter location of Jolly Pumpkin. \"Kyla was the real force behind making this farming project work. This wouldn't have been possible without her,\" Long said. While her first farming experience had its challenges, she was able to grow so much food that a large portion of it ended up in the kitchen at Jolly Pumpkin. Maggie Long of The Jolly Pumpkin Bridging the Gap Between Farmer and Consumer Farm-to-table restaurants, in particular, have been essential for strengthening this movement and giving us transparency when it comes to what we eat. To Maggie Long, the importance of sourcing locally goes well beyond the quality of food\u2014 it's about supporting the dedicated farmers who grow our food and the next generation of farmers who are starting to emerge. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 67 Jolly Pumpkin staff from left to right, Falisha Faz, Grant Smith, Maggie Long, Kyla Nance, Chris Shapman, and Amy Drake. If you were to ask some of the farmers that Long has worked with over the years, I don't think they would have been all that surprised that her first farming venture was a success. Long has been a farmer at heart well before she planted her first garden. Everywhere she goes she has been doing her best to grow the connections between restaurant patrons, farmers, and her staff alike. Near the end of our conversation Long put her purpose simply. \"Every day I make it my goal to do the very best for everyone that is associated with Jolly Pumpkin or myself. I want to be the best I can for the staff, local farmers, and the community at large.\" While Maggie has always been enthusiastic about farming and cooking it was the circumstances of life that truly taught her how important this attitude toward her work was. In 2009 a close member of Long's family was in the hospital with serious health complications. Long said, \"For over a year I did nothing but work and live at the hospital.\" She continued, \"Once I was finally through it, I remember asking myself 'what the hell am I doing with my life?' The experience taught me a valuable lesson, I realized the importance of doing as much as I can for my family and my community.\" From that point on Long dedicated herself to being and doing the best she could be for everyone she knew. Long demonstrates why farm to table restaurants are so important\u2014while access to quality food is great, it is the value it adds to the community that is even worthier. When we start to see the connections between us and the food we eat for more than just the bottom line, we understand the real magic behind local food. To Long it's more than just a job. \"Everyone here has their own lives, goals, and passions. Doing what I do... it's a dance. We are all in it together, because we believe in something that goes beyond our individual selves.\"Jolly Pumpkin Continued Archangel Clearings: A Manual to Release Unwanted Energies Diana Burney is an author, energy healer, a registered nurse, and the founder of Earth Release, where she provides Remote Spiritual Clearings, identifying and releasing negative, unwanted energies through the assistance of the Archangels and Ascended Masters.

Big Surprise! Having lived in Michigan most of my life the prediction seems average at best. A mild winter is more of a rarity than one with consistent below zero weather and a foot of snow every two days. I say embrace winter! It's a good time for winter sports such as skating, hockey, skiing, and sledding. Wintertime is tea time. After all, there is no better way to warm up from being outside in all the cold and yuck, than a warm, flavorful drink. Winter is a playground for various hot tea combinations. Some of the herbal teas, such as peppermint, can even spice up your coffee or cocoa. The winter is about enjoying the cold, and then finding comfort. So, I am going to suggest a few combinations of tea to try to heat things up. Any of them that use milk can also be made with almond, rice or coconut varieties due to allergy reasons, as well as to add depth of flavor. Chai Tea is my number one pick for the winter. Traditionally, the tea is made with black tea and a variety of spices, such as cinnamon, clove, ginger, cardamom, black pepper, and fennel. Usually, the tea combination is steeped then combined with hot milk and some sugar to taste. For me, cinnamon makes Chai sweet already, so I don't add any sugar to it. The spices are warming as well as comforting. Chai simply put is a smile in a cup. Not only is the tea delicious it also has amazing health benefits. Chai tea has been known to help reduce blood sugar levels, aid digestion, and it works to help alleviate inflammation. Cambric Tea is made from milk with some sugar and a little bit of tea. Some people make the tea prior to adding the milk. As a former barista I usually steep the tea in the hot milk. The flavor of tea used should be very mild. Traditionally, a Cambric tea should be mild because it is often referred to as nursery or infant tea. My favorite Cambric is one made with Earl Grey tea. However, any flavor of tea will work, even Matcha with a bit of cane sugar or honey. For me a Cambric is an ideal way to drink Matcha tea, which tends to be quite strong and even medicinal. Overall, Matcha contains many health benefits such as help with weight loss, type two diabetes, heart health, and even cancer.Finally, tea can be used to make a heck of a good hot toddy. On a cold winter night sometimes you need something a little extra to help warm things up. One of my favorite hot toddy's combines whisky with Earl Grey tea. The citrus notes found in the tea complement a good whiskey. So, I leave you with a Hot Toddy Recipe. Enjoy the snow with a nice cup of hot tea in hand! Earl Grey Hot Toddy Recipe 2 to 2 \u00bd cups of hot water, not boiling. You want it hot enough to drink, but not sc ald yourself 1 tablespoon of or ange juice 2 tablespoons of y our favorite whiskey, rum, or spirit 1 slice of orang e 1 cinnamon stick 1 bag of Earl Gr ey tea, or approx. one to two tablespoons of loose leaf tea in tea infuser Combine the hot water with the Earl Grey tea.

But on a recent Friday afternoon, after a week of air and road travel, I was maxed out, and I was hoping for some respite at a weekend retreat center up north that I was scheduled to visit. I just needed to rally enough energy and awareness for the four-hour drive. This was new territory for this East Coaster whose Michigan experiences have mainly focused on the southeastern region. I opted for the US-127 approach through Mount Pleasant. It lacked the speed of an interstate highway, but the closer proximity to towns, lakes, and parklands afforded a degree of intimacy missing from my typical highway commutes. I turned off the car audio to use the drive as an exercise in mindfulness. The subtle foliage changes became more pronounced as I drove past Clare, Grayling, and Gaylord, and made my way to the town of Vanderbilt and Song of the Morning (SOTM), a long-established yoga retreat center set on 800 beautiful acres. As I turned off Vanderbilt's Main Street and onto Sturgeon Valley Road East, I appreciated arriving at dusk, but questioned my ability to find the destination without natural light. Thankfully, the winding road through the forestland led me to the retreat's main sign. After a light rainfall, a misty haze blanketed the area. Traversing the wooded path I hoped to hear or see more wildlife, but the sound of swaying trees was all I heard as I moved toward the main house. Walking trails and small garden plots dotted the landscape. An evening meditation session coincided with my arrival, so while I waited for my hostess, I decompressed in the house waiting area. The influence of Hinduism was evident in the artwork and decor gracing the property, including a gift shop that carried clothing, bath items, and reading material that reinforced the spiritual foundation of SOTM. Particularly prevalent were images of Paramahansa Yogananda, an Indian yogi who introduced Americans to mediation and yoga while living in the United States from 1920 through the 1950's. Yogananda became famous for his book, Autobiography of a Yogi , certainly the book which introduced more Americans to yoga than any other book of its time. As the Guru of Detroit businessman J. Oliver Black, Yogananda inspired Black to establish SOTM, eighteen years after Yogananda's death, as a location dedicated to teaching yoga as a lifestyle and philosophical choice promoting physical, intellectual, and spiritual development. Reading about Song of the Morning's history, I was inspired to begin meditating in the waiting area, an effort to engage with the energetic forces all around me. While the darkness and isolation surrounding the house was initially foreboding, it encouraged a degree of introspection and connectedness that would be challenging to achieve in a more distracting environment. It was a good way for me to occupy myself while waiting for the hostess's return. Making my way from the main house to accommodations in the lodge was a short drive toward an unassuming house. The living room space, adorned with Hindu art, was the site of the evening's mediation session. My sleeping quarters were comfortable and simple, but not austere. SOTM's quiet hours (10:30 p.m.-7:30 a.m.) ensured a restful and calm experience, which was enhanced by the absence of phone or television. I made a conscious effort to leave my laptop in the car in order to appreciate a low-tech getaway. The lack of technology freed me up to explore the wooded landscape of Song of the Morning at first light. Walking trails afforded an opportunity to envelop the mind, body, and spirit in the natural world. Garden areas, campsites, and a creek The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 69 By Petula Brown traversed the property adding to the tranquil setting. From what I gathered, cranes and coyotes are both equally comfortable exploring the terrain. Guesthouses and camping accommodations are scattered on the property with mindful consideration of the landscape...enough space to have a meditative walk but locations for group activities are also available. I met a private group whose members I hadn't encountered earlier in my explorations, when I arrived at the main house for brunch. The communal experience provided a different perspective of SOTM. The opportunity to see SOTM used as a social hub was quite a contrast from its introspective origins focused on spirituality and yoga. While I was visiting as a solo adventurer, the SOTM accommodations and staff also provide options for groups looking for a serene escape for relaxation and renewal. Whether visiting with a group or alone, SOTM provides guests not only a retreat location, but a spiritual home to \"connect with self,\" as described by manager Jennifer Saks. The ashram setting recognizes Yogananada, and the lineage of Self-Realization Fellowship masters, while embracing visitors of all faiths. Though known for Hatha and Kriya yoga practices, Song of the Morning welcomes opportunities to host other spirituality-focused programs. The annual YogaFest is a summer event ideally suited for individuals, couples, groups, and families to relax, renew, and rejoice with a variety of planned activities. In 2020, a range of events are planned to celebrate several milestones, including the 10th anniversary of YogaFest, the 50th anniversary of SOTM, and the 100th anniversary of Paramahansa Yogananda's arrival in the United States. My visit to Song Of The Morning was quite different from the golf outings and ski trips that are typically associated with a weekend \"Up North.\" It was an opportunity to embrace natural beauty and focus on introspection. Far enough for a unique experience, but close enough to be an accessible weekend getaway.

Be it a rich palette of field tiles gleaming across a foyer, colored Celadon and Caribbean Blue, and framed with nature inspired accents, or a graceful interpretation of Charley Harper's red birds, installed within a kitchen surround, becoming the trill and warm quiet of the woods, ceramic artist Nawal Motawi's decorative, handmade tiles elevate the statement of the space. What began, in 1992, in a garage workshop on Packard Street has become the leading manufacturer of art tile in the United States for over a decade. With robust tile sales and an installation operation in Ann Arbor, distinct murals on view across America, and decorative accent tiles that are the favor of museum gallery buyers and their peers, Motawi Tileworks and its sister business and clay supplier, Rovin Ceramics, are among the most impressive niche businesses in Michigan. Their catalog states, \"At Motawi Tileworks, we handcraft our tiles with a design aesthetic that is both historically inspired and often borrowed from the natural world. While our earliest tile images were derived from Medieval, Art Nouveau, and Arts & Crafts motifs, our design language has expanded to incorporate the Mid-Century Modern movement and internationally inspired patterns.\" Flipping through her extensive library for inspiration, an old motif or design must speak to Nawal Motawi and clearly express the perfect potential for her design translation; a conspicuous choice among hundreds. Otherwise, the designs arise from her own sensibility.The State of Michigan recently recognized Motawi as the Women-Owned Small Business of the Year. Asked where her business is in the narrative of the state, Motawi answered, \"I'd like to think we are a jewel. A little treasure that came out. As well as a Michigander that had a vision. God bless the business climate, and the freedom was enough to allow me and the company to live and grow on the merits of the products.\" MotawiMotawi TileworksTileworks If there is a definitive impression one gets from meeting her it's that she has a really wonderful laugh. Local Craftswoman Nawal Motawi has Built the Leading Art Tile Manufacturing Business in the Country Nawal MotawiThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 71 Back when it started, Nawal (pronounced No-elle) Motawi was a young artist fresh out of University of Michigan Stamps School of Art + Design. She was raised the eldest daughter of an Egyptian-born food scientist and Gerber Foods researcher, Kamal El Din Hussein Motawi, and Karen Kitson, in Fremont, Michigan. For two years she apprenticed at Pewabic Pottery learning the craft and business of classic tilemaking. In her early twenties, Motawi knew she was onto something when her first attempts at a green Medieval motifed relief tile started selling at the local farmers' market. A self-described devoted nudger (referring to the nudge tool on her design software), Motawi is most herself spending ten hours perfecting the curves on an 8 x 8 tile design. The possibilities of the curve, and her love of history and color, have remained threads throughout her work, as well as what she called \"the things people love about Motawi work.\" Whenever she interprets an idea, she said, \"There's going to be a focal point, there's going to be some drama. There's gonna be some kind of movement to it. It's going to have the hallmarks of the things that I bring out.\" From reinterpreting Greuby Fiaence's Pine Trees to bringing Frank Lloyd Wright reimagined to mantles and gorgeous wooden frames, she sees the possibility of an old form and, as she put it, \"Motawi-izes it.\" Her designs utilize the old Spanish technique called cuenca, or the creation of basins for the application of polychrome glaze. From the innovators that inspire her to her industry peers, the artistry of her brand is seen as sophisticated. She is exclusively licensed to several Arts & Crafts archives that trust her with their portfolio. Motawi Tileworks is the sole licensed manufacturer of Frank Lloyd Wright tile designs worldwide, with their foundation trusting her to interpret its guarded archive. Similar arrangements have been made with Charley Harper and Louis Sullivan. The famed Arts & Crafts furniture designer Stickley just put Motawi bookmatched tiles of a river scene in a standard console table, drawing the eye of the modern buyer to a classic form. As for high art public murals, Ann Arborites will have seen Motawi Tilework's striking deep turquoise installation in the downtown Y .M.C.A. lobby surrounding the names of donors; their stunning, giant quilt murals adorning 17 elevator alcoves of the University of Michigan Medical Center; and the whimsical storybook themed Boy Reading murals in the children's sections of the Pittsfield Branch of the Ann Arbor District Library and the Downtown Ypsilanti Library. Longtime Motawi employee Lester Bates bought the latter, weighing in at 130 lbs., as a gift for Ypsilanti with his years of accumulated staff appreciation vouchers. Pride in Arts & Crafts revival workmanship, a thoughtful business owner and artisan at the helm, and a team of some 38 dedicated employees are responsible for one of the most respected contributions to American art tile and design active today. They come from Ann Arbor, Dexter, Ypsilanti, and Chelsea, and they do it with pride, in a 13,000 square foot factory on Enterprise Drive and a 7,000 square foot clay works on Dino Drive, on the far westside of Ann Arbor. A Tradition of Fine, Handmade Art Tile Michigan's reputation for fine, handmade art tile is well-known. For the past century, Detroit's Pewabic Pottery is its most historically famous pottery, with recognizable jugs and accent tiles among many family's heirlooms. Roadtrippers, leaving from here to parts east and south, have likely seen signs for Rookwood Pottery of Cincinnati and American Encaustic Tiling of Zanesville, Ohio, or Moravian Pottery of Pennsylvania, or Greuby Fiaence of Boston, Massachusetts. These potteries have become American signatures and archaeologies. California is home to most notably Batchelder-Wilson Tile Company of Pasadena and Los Angeles, which has long embraced the fusion of American Arts & Crafts sensibility with 18th century Spanish tile. Batchelder's warm color palette of brown, red, grey, and sand decorate interiors and exteriors of homes and monuments, along with Spanish Colonial style bright azulejos (Portuguese and Spanish painted tin-glazed ceramic tilework) of gold, orange, Mediterranean blue, and white. The look is synonymous with Southern California flair.What began, in 1992, in a garage workshop on Packard Street has become the leading manufacturer of art tile in the United States for over a decade. Flipping through her extensive library for inspiration, an old motif or design must speak to Nawal Motawi and clearly express the perfect potential for her design translation; a conspicuous choice among hundreds. continued on next pageThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 72 Historically, the simple elegance of Arts & Crafts tiles came as a reaction to Victorian fussiness. In 1840's England, as an alternative to porcelain and cheap \"sham,\" art tile became a popular decorative accent championing minimalist aesthetic and form follows function thought. Each tile captured a small scene celebrating the simplicity of the region's flora and fauna. Potteries provided a British regional statement, transforming the handmade works into a pottery of place, many carved with a low relief front design, or made from a transfer print. The glazes, thicker and suited for exteriors and interiors, gave a feel and impression on the senses that many seek as a luxury today. American artisans of 1870's influenced by these designs began utilizing the rich clay deposits in Massachusetts, Ohio, and New Jersey. They embraced the ethos of the Arts & Crafts movement, which was a reaction to the social ills caused by industrialization, the degradation of the factory worker, and the cheapening of tools and quality of life. Anne Stewart O'Donnell's excellent Pomegranate Press book called Motawi Tileworks (2008) explained that the movement was a response to how industrialization had ushered in a spiritual emptiness across society, taking people and families away from the hearth, from the quiet of the reading chair, and from the sacredness of the kitchen. The mandate of the Arts & Crafts movement was to change the way everyday objects were designed and made to affect change in the world. Tenets included: 1) a celebration of craftspeople putting \"head, heart, and hand\" into what was made, 2) to operate in a collaboration workshop akin to Medieval guilds, 3) to have design arise from materials used, 4) to elevate everyday objects to the status of fine art, 5) to reinterpret the history of a region or country, and 6) to favor simplicity. With great success, Motawi Tileworks is embracing these tenets and fusing the artisan guild ideal with modern manufacturing and purpose-driven, small business best practices. It is, according to Motawi, the next gen, the revival.A Little About Nawal Nawal Motawi is comfortable being described as an Ann Arborite. She is studied up on her favorite topics yet casual and approachable. She has a visually poetic manner of speaking\u2014always connecting the tactile, the worldly, and craft with ideals and arcs of time. Unaware at first that her creativity would come from business as much as from art, she was in the same wave of thoughtful small business owners as Zingerman's and Moosejaw. Her pottery, like all regional responses to an anchor guild, is part of a greater Detroit community of artisans that were inspired and trained by Pewabic, like Dave Ellison and Whistling Frog Pottery. Vivid, sharp, and an incredibly gifted artist, this past winter she recalled her history with enthusiasm, candor, and good humor from her office, her booted foot propped on a chair (the injury: dancing in Europe). If there is a definitive impression one gets from meeting her it's that she has a really wonderful laugh. Now age 54, she is the mother of a son, Kitson Dong, a Michigan State student (he has never worked for her). She loves to spend evenings doing partnered social dancing with a community of close friends and is an avid fan of Celtic and traditional French music. Her reminiscences have an appreciation for folly, like when she told me of the shock of their biggest mural commission\u2014for Disney's The Grand Californian Hotel\u2014being completed in the wrong dimensions. She is also upfront about not wanting to waste time going after ill-defined calls for public art: \"The truth is...there's artists who make what they make. And you just gotta want what they make...\" Currently she owns a 1950's Cape Cod in the Haisley School neighborhood. As one might imagine, the three homes she has owned have contained various levels of monument to her craft, with her staff eager to know what she plans to have them install next. For ten years, she and her ex-husband renovated a home near Skyline High, reinventing the kitchen twice, putting on an addition, and creating the absolute Taj Mahal of bathrooms (\"a gorgeous shrine...because I could!\"). Perhaps her team's most ambitious project\u2014the shower's floor to ceiling dark green and turquoise Tapestry floral tiles are spectacularly breathtaking. One can only imagine chancing upon that at a showing. She ended the report on that experience like this: \"So when I divorced that bathroom\u2014[laughing and falling over] and the house...\" She followed with why she looks for boring blank slates when she's with a realtor: it has to be a house she can do some tilework in. \"Whenever I do a project, when I design a project\u2014which is not that often, it's going to be a really close friend or it's my house\u2014what I come up with ends up really influencing the design that comes out of Motawi for a while, which is cool. Because I do something different, naturally.... It takes me a while for a different solution to appear.\" The Early Days \"In high school I hadn't even met clay,\" she said. Then, she looked away and asked, \"Have you ever thrown a pot?\" Centering is a thing. And pulling up a cylinder. It's kind of like riding a bike. Once you can center and pull up a basic cylinder, basically that's not going away. So, I could do that in high school, but I wasn't really entranced by clay then. So, I went to art school at Michigan. And actually, after a year and a half, three semesters, I dropped out in disgust! [Laughter].... Said screw it, I want to go do something else. I want to lead outdoor trips for a living... I did that for a year and a half and it wasn't really panning out for me. And then I went back to art school...and finished my fine arts degree. And that's when I found ceramics. After Motawi graduated she joined Pewabic, where a good realization came that she didn't like working for other people. It was a statement she would repeat, though always with laughter. Her desire to attend a graduate program in England was not possible with her many siblings still in college. Her mother came up with an alternative if she really wanted to be a ceramicist: they would buy her a house and rent it to her and her friends. Her mother wisely counseled, \"Why go learning more? Just do it.\" Like many young postgrads whose hearts are in many places, she had a boyfriend at the time who lived in Martha's Vineyard. \"My mom gave me the stare. You're In her early twenties, Motawi knew she was onto something when her first attempts at a green Medieval motifed relief tile started selling at the local farmers' market. Motawi Tileworks continued from previous page The mandate of the Arts & Crafts movement was to change the way everyday objects were designed and made to affect change in the world. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 73 not going to leave me with this house and go off with your boyfriend in Martha's Vineyard, are you? No, no!\" Within three years the business outgrew the house. At the time, the only tile store anyone had ever heard of was Color Tile, a chain store selling four and a quarter, the standard size for U.S. tile for years. In the garage she started doing glaze tests, painstakingly mixing her own, sampling clays from different makers, and showing at the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market. Using the four and a quarter concept, she first thought she would have to make decorative accents that could be incorporated into those limitations. The goal would be to get a full installation ordered, like the ones she saw made at Pewabic. Only thing was, she was not exactly the savvy in demand interior designer of 1992. In her wonderfully open way, sheepishly smiling and fluffing her hair, she described herself as a twenty-nine-year-old wanting to land an installation: And I really wanted to be able to do that. I, you know, frankly, I kinda knew I could. But I did not, um, I didn't present well. You know, I was kinda a punky kid. And you know, my hair messy. I was always dirty. I was always covered in clay. And I was kinda impetuous and immature, I would say. And so, when some of those jobs came open, they didn't even come open. [Laughter] Her big break came in 1993, when a local lady who was already \"comfortable with artists doing commissioned work at her house\" bought a duplex in Ann Arbor, and shook hands with her at the farmers' market. Still wide-eyed at the reminiscence, Motawi, whose installations will now revise any home renovation's budget, enthused:When she came to me, and you know, at the farmers' market, and I invited her to the garage, which was, you know, a garage\u2014and showed her these samples and asked for 250 bucks for a design deposit. You know, that actual moment I will never forget it, because I asked her for a two hundred dollars non-refundable design deposit to draw up the thing and she said yes! The heat of the victory still available, she ended the anecdote smiling and throwing her hands up. The neighbor at that duplex bought the next installation. When The Ann Arbor News did a write up about that first fireplace on North Fourth Street, Motawi was on its way to becoming a name around town. Soon came going to art fairs all over the place, selling gift tiles, and showing people installation concepts. Of her early marketing: \"I took pictures with my Tele-Instamatic...I know!\" It took several years to get to a point where \"it felt like survival wasn't the issue, that we were having choices about how to thrive.\" It became apparent the business had to evolve to be process oriented. The basics of craft at the Tileworks are very physically demanding: working with heavy clay, putting up a mold, pressing, carving, edging, and kiln firing \u2014 all very \"wooly\" propositions. Then the application of their dazzling color palette: dipping tiles in glaze or the fine hand work of glazing with a bulb syringe, which is akin to making lace, followed by firing and finishing. She found out early on that she is not interested in being the only manager. Admitting this is not her strength freed her to be a better boss. Nawal Motawi and her production staff \"The big discovery was visionary, founder, artwork: that's where my talent is. Any outsider maybe can see that. They might think I'm a good manager, and I would say, no, I'm not a nurturing, kind, coaching person. And I'm too chicken to hold people accountable to their face. Y ou know how Michiganders are, it's a Michigan thing. That's a human thing. \" \u2014 Nawal Motawi continued on next pageThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 74 The big discovery was visionary, founder, artwork: that's where my talent is. Any outsider maybe can see that. They might think I'm a good manager, and I would say, no, I'm not a nurturing, kind, coaching person. And I'm too chicken to hold people accountable to their face. You know how Michiganders are, it's a Michigan thing. That's a human thing. It's not a nice thing to tell people to their face how they are doing, and I don't have a nice way of doing it. Which really good managers have; that can say, here's the expectation, here's your behavior, and we need to get you here. I can describe it, but I can't do it. This challenge has motivated her to grow the business. The guild concept would have to modernize into a more intentional workspace and a factory led by industrial processing managers. The challenge had already been for the bulb glazers to get up to a certain speed without mistakes so that a tile could be sold as a first or sold at all. As they scaled, the challenge would evolve to become how to make fine art tiles in a consistent manufacturing process. A major part of the solution would be investing in heavy equipment. The acquisition of a RAM press for pushing clay into molds demanded more space than the garage could fit. After her parents sold the house, operations moved to North Staebler for seven years. The facility, tucked behind a towing shop and across from the Kiwanis drop-off, was, to sum it up with Motawi's own word, icky. The building has since had the ceiling cave in \u2014 \"the business incubator...ha ha ha...a total dump.\" What was to follow really set the tone for the ascension of the brand. Motawi and her family members pooled resources to become owners of a warehouse sized modern building \u2014\"glorious and giant.\" She has since bought everyone out, becoming the sole owner of the facility. The possibility she felt moving in to Enterprise Drive was incongruous with the times. Going big was a risk, especially as a house poor business in autumn of 2001. It was great and scary at the same time. Because right when we got it and moved in...9/11 happened. And so we were all here making tile when the planes hit, and the phones stopped, and the orders stopped for two solid weeks.... You know, when you are out here in a building that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, you're not messing around anymore. Yeah, so, I was in deep on it. Embracing her new responsibility as an investor opening the doors to a pristinely renovated new location, this was her baby. She had to balance the feeling of wanting to protect everything with the reality that she and her band of artisans would be working this place hard. With amazement she recapped that first day and the feeling of okay, be gentle with the property: So, it was great. The floor was clean. Now it's all worn out. [Laughter] I remember we epoxy-ed the floor before we came in...it was beautiful. And the first day we came in and showed the staff, and one guy came in and he sorta whipped open the back roll-up door, and it didn't have stops on the end, so the whole thing rolled over and then fell on the ground! [Laughter] He ripped a whole door off! Nobody was hurt.... These days, when you enter the iris bordered entrance to the Tileworks, what they have created is beautiful. You are immediately immersed in a tiered display of decorative tiles for sale in the gallery. Rows of lush art tile in the hallways compose examples of concept and motif. Multi-hued sample installations adorn a meeting room intended for customers to What was to follow really set the tone for the ascension of the brand. Motawi and her family members pooled resources to become owners of a warehouse sized modern building\u2014\"glorious and giant. \" She has since bought everyone out, becoming the sole owner of the facility.

Motawi Tileworks continued from previous page A beautiful Motawi installation in a private home.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 75 go over plans with their designers. Installation planning is a mind-meld more than the designer taking the reins. Colleen Crawley, the senior installation designer, is the employee who has been with Motawi the longest. Her typical clients are either those who can readily make the financial decision or homeowners who have been idealizing an installation for years. Producing solid Arts & Crafts revival pieces is basically what the Tileworks stands for, and Motawi shrugged in her self-effacing way when she said the brand does not have snob appeal yet: \"It's not like people are coming because they have to get Motawi in the house. No, we get clients who really, really love it [the tile]. And so like, they're sweet. They are really usually easy to please because they love the tile.\" People connect with the natural beauty of the tile. Keeping things close to home, the Tileworks self-distributes; they do not employ remote sales people. Their website emphasizes Motawi chooses designs \"that are true to our spirit and present them in our distinctive way.\" With her typical candor, Motawi joked that there would be no Kokopelli. \"We're not going to do a Keep Calm and Carry On tile!\" Their audience is Arts & Crafts. It's narrow, and she's fine with that. Being transparent and sharing a lot of information with the team \"so that everyone can put their brains on it if they want to\" is their embrace of the Toyota ideal. Acting with integrity and right by their vendors and suppliers, and the people they work with, is the culture. continued on next page 5340 Plymouth Rd. Suite 209 Ann Arbor , MI 48105 (734) 546-9645 eavrin@comcast.net The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 76 Mining For Better Results Taking control of the process has been a hallmark of Motawi's evolution. In 2011, their clay supplier was going out of business. Feeling confident that she knew enough about business, she bought the company to control her supply. Admittedly, it's a very different business and the cost drivers are really different. So, it's been really challenging. It's working now. But it took me a long time to realize, to bring in seriously expert experienced management and people who knew process inside and out. In lieu of expecting her usual creative types to know how to manage people and run a clay supply, she turned to the auto industry to find her solution, hiring an automotive industrial process engineer used to managing a plant, as well as another manufacturing manager, to run Motawi and Rovin production. That transition has been one of her biggest wins. Rovin Ceramics, located nearby but not at the Tileworks, supplies Motawi, but also sells to schools, colleges, and artists. It's taught Motawi about the elemental realities of her material supply: which clay mines matter, what veins to go for, what trace elements can throw you off, and an awareness of the availability of sourcing. When asked if the arc of her familiarity with process\u2014reaching back to when she was an art student to knowing the mine level of elemental clay arriving\u2014if it affects some of the more fanciful choices she gets to make during the day, she laughed and said it has less to do with what is learned than what you can improvise. That, for her, being \"super creative\" is as much about having a compulsion to make designs as it is her coming up with solutions to an issue, no matter how mundane. The beauty of ceramics inherently balances scientific control of the process with form. The business of art, as she wants to practice it, inherently balances creativity with creative leadership. In 2002, ten years in and facing a recession, she looked at the balance sheet and the take home pay and told her team, \"This isn't enough. We need to be doing better.\" They started looking up lean manufacturing. Motawi Tileworks continued from previous pageIt started a revolution. Their model changed to being a factory for fine art; whereas before, it was a workshop where you could expect a delay on your order. \"The reputation was kinda good, the tile was pretty, but delivery was bad, and it was really chaotic, and that's not very fun,\" she said. Scrambling to make enough tiles for each customer, having issues with communications as they assembled orders, all while maintaining standards and efficiency, would push them into discovery as purpose-driven small business owners. A book had just come on the market called The Toyota Way, written by Jeff Liker, a professor of industrial and operations engineering at the University of Michigan. His research team posited that you could use Toyota production in an opposite manufacturing situation; such that Toyota's high volume, low variability model (making a lot of cars) could be applied to a lower volume, but high part variability environment like Motawi's. Liker could not find enough case studies, and Motawi Tileworks agreed to accept his free advice and become one. It made them identify with being a manufacturing process: \"It changed us, it changed me in a huge way. Suddenly I feel like a manufacturer. And I know how much we can make today and tomorrow.\" The biggest discovery was the Kanban system, which she said \"changed Motawi into something that was fun again. And controllable.\" The defining feature of the system is a huge communications board that shows workers how much of each item needs to be manufactured. Eliminating managerial conversations, it plainly communicates priorities. There is beauty in its simplicity, keeping worker and manager happy: \"The system tells people what to do.... The creating of the system is fascinating and the tweaking of the system is fascinating. Because who wants to order people around all day long?\" she said imitating a snore. The same is true that no one likes to be ordered around. It's better if everybody understands what the goal is and what's needed to meet it. Kanban liberated their practices. She had to balance the feeling of wanting to protect everything with the reality that she and her band of artisans would be working this place hard. Glazing tiles with a bulb syringe.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 77 Undertaking a major business decision about operations with a small, close-knit staff was hard. Their consultant, Eduardo Lander, coached them through the growing pains. They had to embrace a forward progress and accept the notion that a new model was not putting people out of their jobs but being more effective with what they had. As she put it, \"We're not getting rid of jobs. We are creating more value with the work that we're doing.\" Scaling operations is never easy for a small outfit, yet she was relieved they switched. Her recollections of that time are the tender statements of an empathetic small business owner. Feeling empowered by putting in place better management, and being intelligent, curious, and eager to study business principles, Motawi jumped into applying better practices throughout. The vision statement adopted the 14 principles of Toyota, among them the famous distinction to \"create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface.\" They delineated an employee-focused approach, influenced by the ethos found in Small Giants: Companies That Are Choosing To Be Great Instead of Big. They were galvanized to take care of their employees across the totality of their lives. Health insurance, life insurance, a retirement program, and a workplace that is healthy physically and mentally became documented standards. Employees are encouraged in a caring, individualized way. Gleaning wisdom from Gallup research, they brought into practice that employees do better with clear expectations. Each process became documented and official. The workplace is also intentionally social, joyful, and kind. It sounds simple, but it's a big job to control as a boss. Motawi does it with aplomb. Being transparent and sharing a lot of information with the team \"so that everyone can put their brains on it if they want to\" is their embrace of the Toyota ideal. Acting with integrity and right by their vendors and suppliers, and the people they work with, is the culture. \"The last thing I want to care about is shareholder value. So, it's a human scale company. People know each other, people care about each other,\" she said.

Hopefully, as she hones a succession plan \"emergency or otherwise,\" freedom will be a benefit she reaps. Her near-term goal is a sabbatical. Outreach and telling their story with joy is part of why many locals have been to Enterprise Drive. Members of the public can tour the Tileworks to see and feel the installations, as well as learn about Motawi's take on a modern guild system, with its RAM press, CNC machine, glaze area, and kilns. If you go during production hours expect to be hot with the kilns firing. Twice a year they host a very well attended open house and sale of tile seconds, lined up in rows for art collectors or prospective remodelers to browse. Kids can see that \"there's people making things! It's not an app!\" Potters and amateurs alike can join Make-A-Tile. Taking place under a tent outside, for five dollars they will give you clay and tools to design your own square. Later, all tiles are fired with the same glaze, available for pick-up in a few weeks as a present you planned for yourself. On the feeling of Make-A-Tile, she mused: It does make my heart swell to walk around and see all different ages of people engaged. They are talking with each other. Some of them are wracking their brains because they don't want to make a bad tile, you know. It's focused and positive, the energy. And I know people come year after year...That's just worth doing. \"It does make my heart swell to walk around and see all different ages of people engaged. They are talking with each other.

The notion arises of how can a bulb glazer do this all day? If the yin is the bulb glazer at work, what is the open work, the release of focus, the yang for that person? Not surprisingly, Motawi said the answer is that joking around and humor are encouraged. \"Go kibbutz for a few minutes, it's okay.\" Motawi is also hiring with harmony in mind.

I used both woven wool scraps and wool felt to create these whimsical little guys. Wool is a great material to absorb the water from a sweaty glass or protect your table from a hot mug. Using a hot steamy iron you can get the wool to lay nearly flat, so it's a nice even surface for your glass to sit on, too. This is an easy no-sew project, but can also be embellished using a blanket stitch. Best of all, each gnome you make will be unique. Happy creating!

He began picking at his wingpit until it bled. Because of the grief and the pain of his chronic wound, Jake would cry at night, preventing his human from getting any rest and increasing her anxiety. Through shamanic healing, the shock aspect of his grief was removed, creating a more peaceful sense of the situation. A power animal, a golden eagle, was retrieved for Jake, giving him courage, a broader view, and a sense of his own strength. His wound was able to heal (with the help of a small collar to address the habitual nature of his picking), and he became calmer at night. Shamanic practitioners believe that everything\u2014people, animals, plants, the Earth and its minerals\u2014has a spirit. When something happens to that spirit through trauma or life circumstances, there is soul sickness that expresses itself through the physical body and mind. Shamanic healing addresses the spiritual aspect of an illness or injury. The practitioner acts as a bridge between this world of Ordinary Reality and the spirit world of Non-Ordinary Reality where compassionate spirits provide healing for the animal. As a witness to the healing performed by these compassionate ones, the practitioner brings through energy, communication, and strategies to further the healing of an animal. Animals are particularly responsive to shamanic healing, because they mostly live in their soul spirit. As humans, most of us are focused on our body's spirit and day-to-day functions. Animals inhabit their body as a vessel for their life force, their soul spirit that is connected to 'all that is'. It is this soul spirit that enables them to communicate telepathically, to live in the present moment, and to leave their bodies at will to help manage their physical pain. The shamanic practitioner enters a trance-like state (called a shamanic state of consciousness) to connect with his/her personal helping spirits who want to assist the animal. This state is a deep, active meditation that is not difficult to achieve, but usually takes some training. While in the shamanic state of consciousness, the practitioner's \"connected self\" is able to reach out and engage with the \"connected selves\" of other beings, including compassionate helping spirits who can directly show what is happening with a particular animal. This process of interaction is called a journey, and is similar to an active dream state. In the shamanic perspective, there are three main causes of illness: power loss, fear, and soul loss. Loss of personal power may occur when life situations create disharmony, such as loss of home, partner, or purpose. When animals lose their best friend, human or animal, or experience chaos in their lives, they may exhibit behavioral issues like aggression, separation anxiety, or depression. In cases of power loss, energy that is not associated with the animal's highest good (called an intrusion), may be present. The energy can be extracted by a shamanic practitioner and moved to a neutral place where it can contribute to wellness instead of harm. After an extraction, animals frequently experience greater physical energy and confidence, as well as a joyful demeanor. Another strategy used to remedy power loss is retrieval of a power animal by the shamanic practitioner. A power animal is an archetype that can restore those qualities for which it is known. Prolonged fear destroys an animal's sense of wellbeing, safety, and balance, the foundation for a healthy immune system. Chronic illness may appear at this stage as the energy of an animal is put off balance and the immune system becomes By Judy Liu RamseyShamanic Healing for Animals Shamanic practitioners believe that everything\u2014people, animals, plants, the Earth and its minerals\u2014has a spirit. vulnerable to disease in the state of disharmony. The compassionate spirits working with the practitioner may offer several different remedies for the animal's fear, including a \"dismemberment\". Shamanically, a dismemberment of the spirit purges the spirit of fear and its effects by taking it apart and putting it back together like new. Buddy, a large dog, had a chronic seizure disorder from the age of two that got progressively worse with age. During some of the more serious grand mal seizures, Buddy became fearful and anxious, creating an internal environment conducive to additional seizures. Shamanic journeying revealed strategies that his person could use to support him in his process when seizures did occur, and helped to identify the parts of his brain that were affected. His journey involved a rebirth with his mother, a type of dismemberment, which also restored parts of his soul spirit. Overall, his endurance of his seizures was much calmer. Soul loss is the most serious of the conditions for illness. It happens during trauma or abuse, when the event is so overwhelming that a part of the spirit leaves so that the rest of the spirit and body can survive. That part takes with it those qualities that need to move to safety or be destroyed. Qualities such as courage, curiosity, trust, joy, or sweetness are most commonly dissociated from the animal's spirit. With the help of compassionate helping spirits, the shamanic practitioner can retrieve the lost soul parts and help the animal reintegrate them. This treatment is very effective for PTSD, abuse, bad experiences in rescue shelters, sudden life changes, and chronic or severe illness, and frequently results in significant behavioral changes. Mack, a Quarter Horse gelding, was in a rescue shelter for two years, recovering from starvation abuse at an \"upscale stable\". He was a walking skeleton when he was rescued. The male caretaker used to tease him with food and rattle plastic bags at him to scare him. When adopted, Mack exhibited fear and aggression toward men, and bucking behaviors that were very dangerous to his rider whom he injured more than once. Shamanic healing returned the piece of his soul that left during his worst abuse, and with it, a sense of trust and groundedness. During the healing journey, Mack's spirit experienced dismemberment of his fear, and was also merged with a power animal that restored his confidence. Afterwards, Mack and his person were able to function normally without fear, and move forward together peacefully. It is unusual for an animal to experience only one of these disease sources, and the three disease causes are sometimes indistinguishable as in the case of Mack, the horse. Frequently one state includes aspects of the others. The helping spirits of the practitioner prioritize both the sources of illness and the healing elements. Communication with the animal's holistic veterinarian is often helpful, as the journey may reveal sources of pain and discomfort that were not previously known. Shamanic animal healing is not a substitute for good veterinary care, as the two modalities work on different aspects of the animal's illness or condition. Working with the animal's highest good in mind, shamanic healing can help an animal restore itself to spiritual wholeness, timely healing, and balance. Judy Liu Ramsey is a shamanic practitioner who provides treatments for both animals and people. She practices at Head To Toe Therapies in Ann Arbor, where she is also a professional animal communicator and craniosacral therapist.

It can be all too tempting to curl up in front of the fire and head outside only for grocery pick-ups and school drop-offs. Yet, the benefits of outside play for kids happen all year long, even throughout the winter months. Despite the effort it takes to bundle in layers, find matching mittens, and pull on snow boots, it is absolutely worth your time to get kids outside! Compared to one hundred years ago, life has moved inside for both children and adults. In the 1920s, almost 75% of jobs took place outside. Scott Sampson, host of the PBS kids show Dinosaur Train and paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, quotes research stating that the average kid spends only four to seven minutes playing outside each day. People are always floored by this statistic. They wonder how it can possibly be true, since even maximum security prison inmates in the United States are guaranteed at least two hours of daily outdoor time. Most likely this is not a situation where kids walk outside for literally four minutes, only to turn around and come back in. It is instead, a circumstance where children only get a half hour here or forty five minutes there throughout the week to play freely outside. Why go outside anyway? It certainly is a lot of work and there are plenty of other things to do inside. Time outside benefits every facet of child development: academic, social, emotional, and physical. The need for outside play doesn't diminish when the temperatures start to drop. In fact, current research shows that kids need hours of free play a day, preferably outside.So on days when it isn't dangerously cold, let's take our kids outside! We can sled, hike, and build snowmen. We can build snow forts and make snow angels. We can catch snowflakes on our tongues and watch for wildlife through the barren trees. There are so many ideas, and there are so many great places to visit! All of this outside movement will help move the gunk and germs through our children's lymphatic systems, keeping them healthier throughout the winter. The sunlight will help preserve the size and shape of the rods and cones in our kid's eyes, which are still developing through age nine. The complex movements involved with activities like sledding and stomping through the snow will help our children have quicker, more adaptable brains. Remarkably, senior citizens who dance regularly have a 76% LESS chance of developing dementia. That's a statistic worth paying attention to! Complex movement and our brains are intricately connected. Taking our kids out in the snow gives them a chance to try out skills they haven't experienced all summer, like ice skating, skiing, or simply pushing large balls of snow around to make snowmen. Playing in nature brings us peace through sounds, colors, and smells. What a delight to see the brilliance of a cardinal land on a tree branch or catch the movement of a herd of deer at dusk. A hike through a towering pine forest will deliver so much more than a good workout. When we take our kids outside, it helps them emotionally. This is especially important during a season in which we can often grow weary of the short days and long nights. Time in natural surroundings will help smooth out the rough edges of life, both for kids and parents. Playing in nature augments social skills as children practice communicating and collaborating with friends. Using imagination and creativity, kids are intrinsically motivated to work together and continue their play time. Angela Hanscom, pediatric occupational therapist and founder of Timbernook, says that it can take up to 45 minutes for kids to develop a play scheme. Given the abysmal statistic of four to seven minutes of daily free play outside, most kids hardly get the opportunity to practice these imperative social skills. Don't you remember playing outside in the snow with friends as a kid? I remember building elaborate tunnel systems and flying down sledding hills headed directly for the bumps where we would catch some air. I have vivid memories of dressing snowmen and adding that carrot nose. At the end of it all, we would come inside for some hot cocoa! It's one of the world's best feelings to come in from the cold, take off wet gear, and cozy up under a blanket with a warm drink. If the frigid temperatures are a huge barrier, consider visiting an outdoor location that has an indoor option such as a nature center. Often these centers will have fires going, bathroom facilities, and a place to warm up for a while. No matter how you do it, your children will thank you for investing in their development through nature play all year long, even during the Michigan winters.

Plus, it's beautiful and a lot of fun.\" When kids hit the river, they're also being trained on how to team build and communicate. They learn how to pilot double kayaks or rafts. \"Sometimes navigating a kayak with another human being can be challenging,\" Wood told us. Leslie also partners with the Hands On Museum and the Yankee Air Museum for STEM-focused camps where kids explore physics of motion through building marble coasters and the like. Keep an eye on their website for camp information, which goes up during the winter. If you're looking for a daytime summer play event outdoors for a younger kid, Matthaei Botanical Gardens has recently expanded their garden \"Nature Popup\" programs for ages three to seven, as well as nature hikes often recommended for kids age four to eleven. Youth Education Coordinator Elizabeth Glynn said they do a lot of guided field trips for groups that can even include multiple families that sign up to come together, which is a great option for homeschooling families. \"Summer programs are all outdoors,\" Glynn said. \"Sometimes we make paper indoors because we have tables there, but we try to be outside all the time.\" Matthaei takes younger kids on \"Wetland Explorers\" tours of what a watershed is and what wetlands look like. Glynn said they start with an overview of how water flows downhill in a watershed and then drill down to what animals live there. \"We explore, look at maps, and then we go outside and dip nets into the pond,\" she said, to look at organisms that live in the water. \"We focus on making observations and for the older middle school kids we introduce simple chemical testing to see how much dissolved oxygen is in the water,\" Glynn added, \"or nitrates. We connect that to fertilizers and runoff and talk about how youth can participate in keeping water healthy.\" The Matthaei \"Bugs Are Beautiful\" camp helps kids and their adults appreciate the diversity and beauty of the insect kingdom, and four to seven year-olds learn body parts of insects and practice catch and release methods of examining insects out in the botanical gardens. \"Older kids get into learning about pollination and predator prey relationships,\" Glynn said. \"Things With Wings\" is a similar free family program, and the paper mentioned before gets made during \"Tree Trail Hikes.\" For artsy kids like mine, there is a program called \"Sketchbook Detectives\" where kids use watercolors and sketching to make observations about nature. \"It's about being quiet, having fun, and using color,\" Glynn told us, \"and they really get to tap into their artistic expression.\" Why did the snake cross the road? To get home because he has been unceremoniously dumped into a poisoned bog. My neighbor, the plumber, says he just threw a Missassauga Rattlesnake in our swamp down the street because he heard they wouldn't cross the road to get back to his farm. Another neighbor dumped a giant snapper in the bog because it was eating all his pond ducklings. This year we also learned that we were positioned precariously between two known PFAS plumes off the Huron River. All of this got me thinking about recent news of imbalances in the river ecosystem around the Huron River north and west of town where we live. Just this year, I learned that several kids' summer camps take trips down the Huron River, and I thought that sounded like a great replacement for the bygone childhood romps through nature. These days, everything is scheduled, so why not pencil in some river tubing fun? Well, things didn't go quite as planned because of the pollution, and a few other problems we ran into along the way, but there are still some cool ways to sign your kids up for some water-themed fun this summer. Here is what we learned about how to keep your kidlets safe while attending outdoor programs. Leslie River Days & Matthaei Creek Walks Everyone knows the Leslie Science Center on the north side of Ann Arbor has great outdoor summer camps, but did you know they have programs that take kids for day trips to the river as well? We spoke with Camps Program Manager Zachary Wood, who told us, \"We take fourth and fifth grade campers on a river trip about every week as well as [taking] half of our middle school camps.\" This is because the fourth and fifth grade camps are environmentally focused, and Leslie has new camp options for middle school students that combine a STEM focus with environmental education. It's fun though, nothing like summer school. Kids get out into nature and really explore in these camps, which is what we were hoping for. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 86 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community By Laura K. CowanOver the Huron River and Through the Woods: Ann Arbor's Outdoor Summer Camps (Oh My, Registration Deadlines are Just Around the Bend!) These days, everything is scheduled, so why not pencil in some river tubing fun? The fourth and fifth grade camps are environmentally focused, and Leslie has new camp options for middle school students that combine a STEM focus with environmental education. It's fun though, nothing like summer school. For artsy kids like mine, there is a program called \"Sketchbook Detectives\" where kids use watercolors and sketching to make observations about nature.There is a creek that runs through the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, so many of these programs integrate water into their nature-exploration programs.

Fuller Park Swim Camps We thought we were off to a great start with summer camp options near water, but then we ran into a snag. The marketing copy for the Fuller Pool camps is inspired, nostalgic stuff: s'mores, bounce house, log rolling, tubing, fishing, camp crafts, swim lessons. This place sounds awesome. But... well, not a lot of that actually happened at the camp my kidlet attended, I'm sorry to say. Her bestie who invited her to join still had a great time, but we think it's worth mentioning that when registering for themed camps, you might want to call ahead and ask which events will actually take place during the week you're signing up. The teenagers who run Fuller Pool camps are friendly, but smiling and telling me they would put extra sunscreen on my daughter's nose did not in fact get any high-spf sunscreen on her day after day, until she was sick with sunburn by mid-week. The counselors do make the kids reapply sunscreen every two hours and drink plenty of water, but the problem is they never let the kids go inside. Ever. Fuller Pool camps are supposed to be cool because they combine swim time, camp crafts and activities, and days on the Huron River. But what we got was more like kids running everywhere in the sun all day, or sitting under a cramped picnic shelter regardless of weather, than a day camp version of sleep-away camp. However, this is a great camp for kids who don't want to be stuck inside with scheduled activities all day. \"We try to give kids activities that are fun that involve a lot of water,\" Fuller camp and facilities director, Gayle Hurn told us. \"Kids love the cascades, and little kids do rafts in Argo pond.\" She did also apologize that the camp can be a bit lax on delivering themed activities like the animal crafts my daughter was excited about during Wild Animal Week that didn't materialize beyond a couple camp games and playing with beads and face paint. Hurn said, \"Sometimes counselors get a bit complacent, and I think we need to do a better job of soliciting feedback from parents during the week rather than at the end.\" Hurn also said the camps have so many repeat kids year after year, and week after week, that they need to plan the camps to accommodate older kids now, as they're really designed for the younger set. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 87 Continued on page 88At Fuller, the camps are very popular with kids who like to swim and play outdoors all day. Hurn said many campers come all summer and are repeats for years. Some of what went wrong for my daughter was circumstantial, and couldn't be avoided. Campers are grouped by age and track with camp counselors for the week they attend Fuller Pool Camps, but what happened to my kidlet was that her oldest age group cabin ran out of space so she was put into the next cabin down in a group with more than one child with behavioral problems. She had to spend all the activity time with mostly boys two years younger than her and couldn't see her friend except during free time. During free time they were forced to sit in the sun or at picnic tables with kids screaming around them for hours (as you've probably guessed, not my kid's thing), and during swim time they weren't allowed to leave the pool or sit in the shade for two hours straight every day in week-long 90-degree heat wave. Kidlet came home exhausted and, frankly, mad as a rattlesnake. Staff varies by year, of course, and we're lucky to have had such positive summer camp experiences up to this point. Kidlet's bestie seemed to be having fun all week and wasn't bothered by the sun at all. The marketing copy for the Fuller Pool camps is inspired, nostalgic stuff: s'mores, bounce house, log rolling, tubing, fishing, camp crafts, swim lessons. Hurn is advocating for a larger picnic shelter for the kids next year, but there are still no plans for indoor breaks because the pool facilities don't have indoor daycare space. City of Ann Arbor River Camps What goes on in the river camps once kids get there? Cheryl Saam is the Recreation Supervisor at Gallup and Argo Parks on the Huron River. \"We run River camps here at Argo for middle school and at Gallup for younger children,\" she said. \"The programs are often full to capacity, and are very popular because you get to hang out on the river and try different activities.\" Boating options include single and double kayaks, mini kid kayaks, tubes, paddle- boards, paddleboats, Saam look for river critters to learn about ecosystems, and we catch bugs and catch fish and let them go.\" Super cool. Critters don't include poisonous snakes, I'm assuming. Saam said that as kids gather Monday morning, they do \"an introduction, lay out camp rules, safety procedures, and right off the bat we go kayaking. Younger kids kayak in Gallup pond and older kids do river trips.\" Leslie Science Center does some live animal programming of what animals might live in the river for the city river camps. \"In the afternoon we paddle to the playground at Gallup and paddle back,\" said Saam. \"Tuesday is all about paddleboats and rafts, raft towers, and tubes in the cascades. Big kids go all the way down the river in five-person rafts. There is a lot of team building there.\" Wednesday little kids do paddle boats and canoes and then go swimming at Fuller Pool and look for bugs at Island Park. The nature themes here really strike me as being similar to how I grew up without much supervision, looking for bugs in the woods at Leslie, picking berries, and creek walking. Saam said that big kids go on Thursdays to Dexter and do a river trip, which is another bonus of extra nature. It seems that if your kid wants more river time and less pool, this is a fantastic option to switch the ratio of outdoors to swim time.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 88 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Continued from page 87 My daughter was too sick with sunburn by day three and begged off to stay home, only to miss tubing at the Argo Cascades, which did sound like a good time. It was hot enough all week in late August to melt me like a chocolate bar just picking her up from the parking lot, and, Hurn told me, last year they had at least one week over 100 degrees. Hurn is advocating for a larger picnic shelter for the kids next year, but there are still no plans for indoor breaks because the pool facilities don't have indoor daycare space. I'm sure other weeks are cooler, but you should know before signing up that these camps are heavily weather dependent with zero recourse for inclement weather. Still, Hurn is sensitive to the river pollution issue and cares a lot about her kids having a good time. \"I'm from Flint,\" she said of her awareness of the PFAS pollution in the Huron River, \"We're dealing with other people's children, so we err on the side of caution. We go by the policy of the livery. If they're closed, we don't go, but the week they reopened after the sewage spill, we decided not to go [too].\" So, lots of time outdoors, and great for younger kids who like to run all day or swim for hours. Just be proactive communicating if you need your kid's cabin changed, if there are problems with staff, or something similar, and go to the director, not through counselors if your concerns don't seem to be handled. Fuller Park Pool is located at 1519 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor MI 48105. You can find information about summer camps online at a2gov.org/departments/parks-recreation/parks-places/fuller/Pages/default.aspx#daycamp or by calling (734)794-6236. How Can Parents Monitor PFAS? Some City of Ann Arbor camps entirely focus on river fun, and are a great way to get your kid outdoors if you have to work all summer. Except... there was sewage, raw sewage, in the Huron River the week we considered signing kiddo up for actual fun at the river. Lord help me. It sounds like such fun, but what are kids actually touching in the river every day when PFAS foam is poisonous and sewer drains can back up like this? A rattlesnake sounds like a pristine encounter with the great outdoors compared to this. I called Jennifer Lawson, the City of Ann Arbor Water Quality Manager, to hear about progress handling the sewage leak that closed down boating rentals and trips for two days. Lisa Wondrash, City of Ann Arbor Communications Director, responded with more information on PFAS and where parents can keep up to date on a changing situation, which seems like the right plan since this unfortunate situation will be changing for years, sometimes weekly, as pollution levels shift and laws requiring cleanup are still in the works. \"Swimming or bathing in water containing PFAS is not a health concern because the amount of PFAS is typically low compared to the foam,\" Wondrash told us, though the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has issued a \"Do Not Eat Fish\" advisory for the Huron River and now advises people and their pets to avoid foam on the Huron River where the pollution concentrates. City canoe liveries around town have installed washing stations for concerned citizens wanting to rinse PFAS foam or river water off themselves after boating, which has raised more concerns about the levels of pollution among parents, in particular. It's hard to imagine kids boating down the river without coming into some contact with foam if they're anywhere near the dam or any rapids. Fortunately, a lot of camps for younger kids stay in Argo pond with calm water, which is some comfort. Some City of Ann Arbor camps entirely focus on river fun, and are a great way to get your kid outdoors if you have to work all summer.

The deadline for submissions for the May through August issue is March 1, 2020.\"Friday is a cookout with paddleboats and canoeing,\" Saam said. \"Big kids get to choose their favorite boat and kayak up to Bandemer Park and do disc golf and paddle back.\" It's not clear if kids get any more time inside at Argo than at Fuller, but there is more of a cabin there as opposed to small sheds for backpacks only at Fuller. \"Behind Argo we have a camp cabin and have hammocks and tents and kids use that as their home base,\" Saam said. \"Camp registration starts February 1st and fills up quickly. Many of the camps fill within a day. It's all about boats and space.\" City River Camps are licensed by the State of Michigan and employ experienced instructors who help keep kids safe on the water. The liveries offer many fun river programs such as summer camps, preschool programs, night paddles, and Huron River Day. For river pr ogram or camp ques tions please call the Gallup Livery office (734) 794.6240. Arg o River Camp is for kids who have completed 6th-9th grades. Each day features paddling on a different section of the Huron River, and kids can choose from kayaks, canoes, paddle boards, tubes, rafts, and also have fun fishing, geocaching, playing disc golf, and having a bonfire lunch. Argo River Camp is based out of the cabin and pavilion at the Argo Livery. Argo River Camp has a girls only week for sixth to ninth graders from July eighth through the twelfth. Argo also runs a program called River Kids that allows kids age two to seven to explore Gallup Park (Resident, $70; nonresident, $84 per child/month). This camp is parent supervised and creates a fun space for parents and littler kids to paddle around Gallup pond in a kayak, canoe, or paddleboat. Kids can also try fishing off the dock, and enjoy a story time and some arts and crafts. River Kids sessions run May through July. Red Fish Blue Fish Teach Kids to Fish is another program in June that is only $5 per child that teaches parent-supervised kids to fish. All ages are welcome.

One thing is for sure. There are some adventurous options for outdoor summer camps for kids, but you need to Argo River Camp has a girls only week for sixth to ninth graders from July eighth through the twelfth. pay attention to the state of the waterways. That probably was the case long before we knew how polluted local rivers were, or knew they were probably full of snakes my neighbor doesn't want. We are looking forward to including more outdoor activities, for our family (have you done the night paddles at Argo? They're the best!), and for kidlet with her friends. Stay cool this summer, have fun, and speak up before problems build up. Our mistakes are your navigation map for a trip down a thoroughly modern Michigan river. Laura K.

Feb. 28 The Healer (2017) Discovering he has the gift of healing, a young man is aided in his struggle to understand this gift and the new reality it offers by a teenage girl with terminal cancer. Mar. 27 Old Fashioned (2014) A beautiful, moving, old-fashioned love story, in the true sense of that phrase.Kindness is like snow\u2014 it beautifies everything it covers. \u2014Kahlil GibranEditor' s note: Kate Durda is a local developmental psychologist, shamanic practitioner, and educator who is currently serving as a board member of the Peace Education Center (PEC), an organization devoted to peace activism. W e live in turbulent times, yes, but human history has been full of crises, natural and man-made. What is important, what makes or breaks us, is how we respond to life's challenges as well as its gifts. Maya Angelou wrote, \"You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.\" All w e can do is try to meet that challenge with power and presence, becoming bigger through our response, and perhaps even do something positive in response. There is no guarantee that we will come out of a crisis unscathed. Such events sap our very life force, making it difficult to move on. How many of you know of someone (or were such a one) who couldn't stop crying, or stayed in bed for days, paralyzed, or who seemed to become totally numb in response to some event (for example: 9-11, the 2016 presidential election, or one of the many recent mass shootings)? Unfortunately, tragedy and disaster can lead to despair, depression, passive acceptance of reality, hopelessness, or other expressions of \"checking out\" of life. Grief is a healthy, natural, and necessary response to such events. It is import ant to express our emotions so that we can experience their lessons, benefit from the healing inherent in them, and then move forward with our lives. Be yond being hurt, we may respond with anger, outrage, and lay blame, judge, and even hate those whom we see as responsible. However, when our reactions to events deepen into clinical depression, suicidal despair, attitudes of separation (us vs. them), or deep hatred, we've given those emotions too much power. We may need support or help from friends and family, or even professional help, if we are to recover and heal. The emotional responses above collectively might be considered as reactive (used here in the sense that we experience them passively, as in being the recipients of actions done to us, personally, or collectively). How ever, we may also respond pro-actively with acts that reflect our most noble and creative instincts. Offering compassion, aid, and support to those suffering, or perhaps engaging in social or political reform would be an example of a pro-active response. George Elliot asked, \"What do we live for if not to make life less difficult for each other?\" Indeed, what do we live for? What are our values? The inspiration to act is directed from deep within our experiences of who we are and what we live for. We interpret events based on our values, our understanding, and philosophical perspective. Nietzsche wrote, \"Those who have a why to live can bear with almost any how.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 98 That why embodies what has value and is deeply meaningful to us and provides an internal compass to help us to navigate difficult times. Viktor Frankl (psychologist and Holocaust survivor) wrote of this importance of finding meaning in all forms of existence, even the most brutal ones, as a reason to continue living. A necessary practice for anyone who strives to live a spiritual life is to examine one's values. Wha t are you living for? Le t's explore attitudes/values from two perspectives: the material the spiritual. Materially-based values: Self-cen tered; individual advantage; \"me\" Fear of chang e, control oriented Fear of the \"other '\"(us vs. them, anyone not like us) Extrinsic orien tation\u2014placing blame or cause outside of ourselves View of Lack-not enough, glass-half emp ty Po wer over, dominate (for personal gain) Spiritually-based values: Other-cen tered; communal values Accept chang e Seek unity, c onnection with others (including Nature) Intrinsic orien tation-to self-reflect and accept Abundance, plenty f or all, glass half-full Po wer within, collaboration (communal gain) While the material-based values may have contributed an evolutionary advantage thousands of years ago to our ancient ancestors, they certainly must be questioned as to their advantage now. Such attitudes result in divisive and destructive acts that benefit self or one's tribe to the expense of other people and the environment. Taken to its extreme, they result in oppression, destruction, war, and exploitation of 'others' (people, animals, the environment). An obvious r eality is that not all people share the same values. This is wher e a lot of conflict can arise. The U.S. is currently deeply divided politically, with each side entrenched, and often hating the other side. Common sense t ells us that hatred is not a solution; we are simply adding fuel to the fire. A spiritual solution is to start by considering the impact of our stance (whichever \"side\" we are on) upon the well-being and outcome of our world and ourselves. A help ful and healing practice is one of non-judgement. Mother T eresa said, \"If you judge people, you have no time to love them.\" If we cannot love or at least respect all people, we have little chance of healing the rifts and moving forward. Non-judgment is the fir st step, and the next step is recognizing our role in the conflict. How are we contributing? A Hawaiian spiritual practice of reconciliation and forgiveness, H'opnopono, suggests that we are responsible, on some level, for all that is. For example, how are we complicit in our acceptance of current government policies and social norms in allowing poverty to exist? Acknowledgement of this is critical. This owning of responsibility helps us move from passivity to action and our acting in ways that can reduce or change the problem. I encourage you to explore this practice further to see if you might find power and healing there for you. As Einstein stated, \"We can't solve problems using the same consciousness that created them.\" Ho w would our world benefit from actions coming from spiritually- based values? What Do You Live For? What is important, what makes or breaks us, is how we respond to life's challenges as well as its gifts. Grief is a healthy, natural, and necessary response to such events. It is important to express our emotions so that we can experience their lessons, benefit from the healing inherent in them, and then move forward with our lives. Informing our Response to Turbulent Times Offering compassion, aid, and support to those suffering, or perhaps engaging in social or political reform would be an example of a pro-active response. By Kate Durda, M.A.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 99 A powerful approach we can embrace to inform our response to crises, as well as guide our everyday life, is through spiritual practices and beliefs. Devoting ourselves to a spiritual practice provides the ultimate home from which we grow up, learn, and manifest our highest self. One spiritual path that lends itself perfectly to the values we are discussing here is Shamanism, an ancient, yet contemporary spiritual practice focused on restoring balance and providing healing to self and others. In this practice, all beings have a spirit, and all life is respected. The c ore beliefs and the many practices of the shamanic path have tremendous power to increase one's well-being, health, attitude, success, and joy. They can also lead to cohesive and harmonious relations with all that is.The ultimate search for meaning in life entails this question: What do you live for? If we are full of peace and respect for those around us, our actions will be reflected in a world that mirrors that back to us. Answer this question, live accordingly, and you will find yourself helping to create the changes you are seeking! Kate Durda is a developmental psychologist, shamanic practitioner, and is trained in reiki and esoteric healing. She and Spirit Weavers partner, Stephanie Tighe, MSW, have been providing shamanic healing, experiential shamanic training, and spiritual community for over 25 years.

While the material-based values may have contributed an evolutionary advantage thousands of years ago to our ancient ancestors, they certainly must be questioned as to their advantage now. \"Yesterday, I was clever, so I wanted to change the world.

T olkien Holistic Law The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 102 By Dorrie Rosenblatt Years ago, when I was working as a geriatrician, I had a patient named Maria. She was an 82-year-old Italian woman who had been raised in a convent in Italy. She had crippling arthritis that gave her terrible back and knee pain, and was only minimally relieved by all the many medical interventions we tried. She spent most of her day on a narrow bed in her bedroom where she had a life-size statue of Saint Therese of Lisieux. She managed to drag herself to church every day where she insisted on painfully kneeling during Mass despite my attempts to convince her that God would hear her prayers just as well if she sat in the pew. Although I considered myself to be a spiritual person, I still found it hard to understand how her faith could sustain and allow her to keep going in a situation that most people would have found intolerable. In the last few decades, spirituality has become a hot topic. Searching on Amazon for books on spirituality pulls up over 70,000 titles. Although spirituality in general has been a focus of interest, spirituality in the elderly has really only received academic attention in the last twenty years. Robert Atchley's seminal book, Spirituality and Aging , was written in 2009. One problem with research on the topic has been the lack of clarity on differentiating between religiosity and spirituality. There is now something of a consensus that spirituality is the personal search for deeper connection with the Divine, as the person understands it, as opposed to religiosity, which is associated with a specific religion with fixed theology, dogma, and rituals. A spiritual journey may take place in the setting of specific religious observance, but often it takes the form of a search outside the boundaries of formal religious observance. A spiritual journey usually involves aspects of committed spiritual practice, self-discipline, and integrating insights gained into daily life. The spiritual practices can take the form of prayer, meditation, chanting, mindful movement such as Tai Chi or Yoga, or time spent in Nature as a few examples. In a recent survey, a quarter of people defined themselves as spiritual but not religious. This percentage is predicted to grow as the Baby Boomers, a generation of eclectic seekers, ages. Traditionally, elders had the role of transmitting sacred knowledge and rituals. In many cultures people were expected to spend their later years focusing on spirituality. A prime example of this is the fourth, or Sannyasa (renunciate), stage of life in the Hindu tradition. In this stage of life, elders were expected to leave the family and worldly concerns, and retire to the forest to seek God and enlightenment. Even without withdrawal from society, spirituality continues to be an area in which people can experience continued growth and development in their later years. Studies have also shown that seniors who report deep religious or spiritual connection have a better quality of life and better health outcomes. Even those seniors who actively seek to age \"successfully\" experience many kinds of losses in later life which can include decreases in vision and hearing, decreased mental acuity, loss of robust health with simultaneous development of acute and chronic illness, loss of mobility, loss of independence, loss of home when care needs mandate a move to a facility, loss of family and friends, and finally facing loss of life as death approaches. Facing death can be a particularly scary experience without the support of a spiritual connection. I know from my own experience. When I was told at age thirty-six, after a cardiac catheterization that was supposed to prove the chest pain I had been having for almost two years was \"psychosomatic,\" that I needed emergency bypass surgery, I was terrified. That was in 1984. It has been an interesting experience to see how, over the years of a more committed spiritual practice and deepening connection with the Divine, my feelings have changed from fear to deep gratitude for every day and a complete lack of fear of death. This experience has convinced me of the importance of a sense of spiritual connection, especially in later life when people face multiple losses and death. In the past, most spiritual counseling has taken the form of pastoral counseling based in a particular religious tradition. As the number of \"spiritual but not religious\" people increases, there will be an increased need for people trained in spiritual counseling who are not clergy associated with a specific religious tradition. My own background is that of a geriatric physician, an Interfaith minister trained in Interspiritual counseling, and a long-term spiritual seeker. Interspiritual counseling draws on the Perennial Wisdom that is common to all the major religious traditions. As the German theologian and mystic Meister Eckhart (c.1260 - c. 1328) said, \"Theologians may quarrel, but the mystics of the world speak the same language.\" Supporting Spirituality in Seniors A lthough I considered myself to be a spiritual person, I still found it hard to understand how her faith could sustain and allow her to keep going in a situation that most people would have found intolerable.

The phenomenal world of ma tter and individual consciousness is a mani- festation of a Divine Ground in which all have their beginning and without which they would not exist; 2. The Divine Ground c an be known not only from inference but also, and more importantly, through direct intuition which unites the knower with that which is known; 3. Man possesses a phenomenal ego (small self ) and an Inner Self (a spark of the Divine) with which he can choose to identify: 4. The purp ose of Mankind's life on earth is to identify himself/herself with the inner Divine Self and to come to unitive knowledge of the Divine Ground. Interspiritual counselors use teachings and practices drawn from all the major religious traditions t o assist their counselees in deepening their connection with the Divine and in integrating their insights and wisdom into their daily life. One of the main challenges in Interspiritual counseling is to create an individualized spiritual practice consistent with the counselee's beliefs and interests. I think the most challenging person I have worked with was a middle-aged professional woman with a very high anxiety level and an inability to relax and just be. She had signed up for the pro bono counseling program at the seminary that was staffed by trainees. When we first connected, I began, as usual, by asking her about her spiritual beliefs, and she stated that she did not believe in any sort of higher power. My first reaction was one of not understanding why, in that case, she had signed up for spiritual counseling, but I came to realize that she felt a need for connection with something. She liked being in nature and she liked practicing yoga. After contemplation and connection with my own source of inner wisdom, I was moved to offer her a breathing meditation. I suggested that she sit and ground herself. Then I asked that on the in breath she say internally \"may I receive what I need to receive\" and on the out breath say \"may I release what needs to be released.\" I asked her to try it for a minimum of five minutes a day until we met again. At our next session, she reported that the practice had really resonated for her and that she felt more relaxed and connected with something outside of herself. She had even taught the practice to members of her yoga group. She had taken a first, tiny step on a spiritual journey, and I was happy that I had been able to create a practice that worked for her. There is also a role for Interspiritual and traditional clergy in educating those caring for the elderly, particularly those in the Health Care Professions, about the importance of asking about older patients' spiritual beliefs and integrating spiritual care into their over-all Plan of Care. As noted above, seniors with a deep religious or spiritual connection have better outcomes in terms of health and quality of life. So, it is vitally important that all those caring for the elderly, from caregivers, to medical personnel, to those providing psychosocial support, be trained in addressing the spiritual needs of seniors and how to provide the spiritual support that can make such a difference in the quality of patients' lives and also in how they and their families experience death. Starting in 2030, when all \"boomers\" will be older than 65, older Americans will make up 21 percent of the population (compared to 15 percent today). By 2060, nearly one in four Americans will be 65 years and older, the number of 85-plus will triple, and the country will add a half million centenarians. This makes it imperative that there be more research into spirituality in the older population, more education on how to assess and support the spiritual needs of older people, and more people prepared to undertake the requisite training and to provide the needed support for all of those seniors for whom spiritual life is so important. Rev. Dorrie Rosenblatt, M.D., Ph.D. practiced as a physician board certified in Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, first at Harvard and then at the University of Michigan. When she had to take early retirement from medicine due to illness, she started a second career as an Interfaith Minister and was ordained in 2014 after a two year training in Interspiritual Counseling. She offers both individual and group counseling, and as part of her own spiritual practice, she offers these services to seniors for whatever fee fits their budget. She can be reached at drosenbl@umich.edu or (734) 665-4186.Studies have also shown that seniors who report deep religious or spiritual connection have a better quality of life and better health outcomes. T his experience has convinced me of the importance of a sense of spiritual connection, especially in later life when people face multiple losses and death.

Exceptional Healing Work. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 109 By Catherine Carlson \"How are you feeling?\" Author Marc Brackett, Ph.D. begins nearly every chapter of his new book Permission to Feel by asking this. According to Brackett, when faced with this question, we often have trouble getting beyond the words \"good\" or \"fine.\" Most of us, in fact, are so far removed from naming our feelings we struggle to find the answer. He says that by overlooking how we feel, we are missing out on the valuable information our emotions are able to give us. Marc Brackett is a professor in the Yale Child Study Center and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. For over 20 years the work at the center has focused on researching and developing ways to teach people how to use the power of emotions. Their goal is \"to create a healthier, more equitable, innovative and compassionate society.\" While the research applies to all ages, helping children is at the heart of the center. Brackett comes to his work honestly. He had a childhood filled with bullying, buried feelings, and parents that didn't know how to help. He knows from personal experience that children's outward expressions don't necessarily match what they are feeling inside but parents and teachers react to what they see. An example of this is the child that has an angry outburst and runs away. The child appears as though they don't want anyone near them, but inside they desperately need a hug or someone to respond with compassion instead of an adult reflecting an angry outburst back at them. For Brackett, it was a perceptive uncle that ultimately helped him. One day his uncle, a teacher, simply asked Marc: How are you feeling? It was like a dam burst. Phrases like warm and fuzzy or touchy-feely can get a bad rap, in the corporate world especially, conjuring up an image of someone out of touch with reality. In fact, Brackett says, emotional skills, which must be acquired, are no different from other mental skills. And they are linked to everything from success to immune function, and especially creativity\u2014\"the lifeblood of our culture and our economy.\" Brackett, a regular consultant and speaker indicates that we do ourselves a disservice if we think ignoring our feelings will help us to move on more easily and get ahead. He cites an example of a senior professor who questioned how being a \"nice\" person has anything to do with high academic achievement. Brackett says on the contrary, being nice might actually perpetuate more achievement and achievers! Once we give ourselves, and the people in our lives, permission to feel, the book says the next step is to become emotional scientists. We need to \"access [the feeling] and then figure out what it's telling us.\" Brackett has developed the \"RULER\" system to help keep our feelings in healthy balance. We must learn to R ecognize, Understand, Label, Express, and finally most importantly, Regulate our Emotions. One outcome has been \"RULER\" schools that have implemented this system into their curriculum. The book explains the differences between feelings, emotions, and moods. In his work he uses a tool called the mood meter, a color-coded graph. The colors reminded me of the emotional panel of characters in the film Inside Out . The mood meter is a similar concept, but more varied and specific. The inside cover of the book is wallpapered with color-coded examples of feelings. Brackett says that our interactions with each person in our lives from family to a store clerk, and the people we're driving behind in our cars all play a part in how we feel at any given moment. Ignoring this contributes to stress, anxiety, and disconnection. Accessing our feelings and developing our emotional skills can be applied differently depending on the three main containers we find ourselves in, home, school, and work, and there is a chapter on each with relatable and inspiring stories. Apparently students love talking about emotion skills in the classroom ,and studies show teachers have very little training on the subject. Brackett's intention is that by opening up this conversation, we can create an \"Emotion Revolution.\" In this New Year and new decade, perhaps this is a simple resolution you hadn't thought of. Maybe you can give yourself, your friend, your child, or your colleague the Permission to Feel. While it may feel foreign or strange, we already know what the consequences are by ignoring it. You can start now. Ask yourself: How are you feeling? Catherine Carlson grew up in Ann Arbor and returned in 2014 to raise her family after many years living on both coasts.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2020 Page 114 Sure, essential oils can leave your home smelling of fresh cut lavender or the bright citrusy scent of lemons, but they are so much more than a pretty aroma. Did you know they could be used to support healthy emotions, keep you alert, focused, calm, and relaxed? All this is made possible in the limbic system, which is our emotional brain. Our limbic system supports five major functions: emotions, behavior, motivation, long-term memory, and sense of smell. As you inhale essential oils, the tiny molecules enter the nasal cavity and pass by the olfactory bulb. Your olfactory bulb is a part of your limbic system and therefore your response to an aroma is going to be emotional before it can be rational. This all happens in three seconds! First things first, all essential oils are not created equal! I am sure you have noticed that essential oils are everywhere these days. But I am here to tell you that there is a huge difference in quality between brands. To get the most therapeutic benefit from your essential oils look for 100% therapeutic grade. Your essential oils should not have flammability warning labels on the bottle (these oils are in a base of alcohol) or the words \"fragrance or parfum\" as these will have synthetic ingredients. Some oils are pre-diluted with carrier oil that makes them less expensive and less potent. Do your research and go with a trusted company. Essential oils can be used aromatically by adding them in a diffuser, inhaling them direct from the bottle, in diffuser jewelry (that can be worm in lieu of synthetic fragrances), be made into sprays to freshen your home and linens, or mixed with Epsom salts in a warm aromatic bath. Essential oils also have benefits when applied topically to the skin and can actually be found within the bloodstream in as little as 26 seconds. When applying essential oils to the skin there are a few safety precautions to consider. Some essential oils can be applied to the skin \"neat,\" meaning straight from the bottle, and some require carrier oil such as coconut, jojoba, or olive oil. Be sure to check the bottle for dilution recommendations, and if you have sensitive skin test a small area first. Carrier oils help to dilute the essential oils and are great when applying oil to a large area such as with massage. Some places to apply essential oils are pressure points at the temples, wrists, and behind ears. Apply the oils to your energy centers of the body or chakras, to the bottoms of your feet at the vita flex points (reflexology), or anywhere you feel drawn to that needs extra support. Essential oils can also be applied over different organs in the body to help with emotions. Our organs are linked to different emotions. We hold onto fear in our kidneys and anger in our liver. By applying oils to these areas of the body it can help facilitate release. Feeling stressed or anxious? Try adding a few drops of calming oils such as lavender, frankincense, Roman chamomile, or cedarwood to the palm of your hands, rub them together to activate, then cup hands over your nose and mouth and take three slow deep breaths. As you breathe deeply and inhale the oils they create a calming effect in the body. Frankincense is distilled from tree resin and has been used for centuries in spiritual rituals and ceremony. It can be used during meditation to increase spiritual awareness, calm the mind, and promote emotional balance.Essential Oils: More Than Just Pretty Aromas By Michelle Meier Malloch Roman soldiers, to clear their minds before battles, historically used Roman chamomile flowers. It is relaxing and can help balance and release emotions, calm anger, and diffuse irritability. One way I like to use my oils is through scent memory recall. In the morning I choose an essential oil and an affirmation or intention for the day. While inhaling the essential oils I repeat my affirmation or intention. I then apply the oil to my skin, and as I smell the aroma throughout the day, I am reminded of the intention I set. By inhaling lavender and repeating the positive affirmation \"I am calm and relaxed\" you can help reduce stress. If you need courage before a big presentation use Roman chamomile and repeat \"I am fearless.\" Having a down day and need a little pick me up? Citrus oils such as lemon and bergamot are very uplifting and refreshing to the body, mind, and your mood. Feeling tired and need a boost of energy? Skip that second cup of coffee and try diffusing or applying lemon and peppermint together. Peppermint is invigorating, purifying, and stimulating to the mind and can help you remain focused. Palo santo and sage can be beneficial to help clear out negative energy in the body or in a physical space. You can add these oils to a diffuser to clear a space, make a room clearing spray, or apply them to your body. I find palo santo to be very grounding when applied to the bottoms of my feet. Fun fact, it takes two years after a palo santo tree has been cut for the oil to be pulled into the heartwood (dense central wood of trunk) and can only then be extracted and distilled. Palo santo has been used in rituals for purification and cleansing and can help with spiritual awareness and emotional balance. As you can see there is so much more to essential oils than just aromas and this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Since 2013, Michelle Meier Malloch has been a natural living advocate and essential oil educator, helping others on their journey to a toxin free lifestyle with Young Living Essential Oils. She is a creative soul who crafts home remedies and natural products using essential oils, loves cooking from scratch, and creating art from elements found in nature.

By Laurie Dean Dharma\u2014Your noble purpose. One's duty or one's path. Sounds pretty lofty and esoteric\u2014right? And yet, these few words capture one of the essential principles of the Yogic tradition\u2014the idea that each one of us is born with unique gifts and the desire to express our unique purpose. While this may be a new idea for you, I am willing to bet at some point in your life you have thought about your purpose. It may have even happened as you sat outside looking up at a clear cloudless night. As you sat there awestruck, did you ever wonder\u2014why am I here? Life is such a gift\u2014what am I meant to do with mine? Dharma is the idea that we are born out of something noble and that each one of us has something unique and noble to contribute. It may be through parenting, through mentoring, through writing or a creative endeavor, or through your commitment to being involved in a way that contributes to create lasting change. We are inspired and cheer for those who accomplish great things\u2014gifted athletes, artists, statesmen, and inventors. In cheering for them, we are at some level, cheering for the part of us that aspires to become everything we are capable of becoming. I'm writing about individuals like Leonardo di Vinci, Anne Frank, Steve Jobs, Nelson Mandala, Mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi, Bill Gates, and Tiger Woods. So often what we admire as much as their innate talent is the quality or qualities of their contribution. \"Strength lies in the magnification of the secret qualities of my own personality, my own character...\" -Rod Stryker So\u2014how to we even begin to know what our purpose, our dharma might be? It starts with self inquiry\u2014with asking questions, being curious, being willing to dig deeper, to know more... A thread of this has been with you throughout your life\u2014but you may not have ever thought of it in this way. How do you grace the world? What makes you feel like the very best you? What do you have to contribute? Can you think of a time in your life or a situation when you felt like the best, the most positive version of yourself came through? What were you doing? What was it that was being expressed when the best of you was shining thru? People often think of their \"purpose\" as being what they do for their career. A few lucky ones may find career and dharma align. A career is a necessary and valuable means to an end\u2014a way to provide for our self or our loved ones. But dharma is more often what we articulate we would do if no obstacles stood in the way.Take a moment and ask yourself, what would I do if no obstacles stood in the way? What would I be doing if I was using my greatest gifts? What are the \"secret qualities of my own personality\" that I am longing to share and to express? I like to think of it as sharing your secret \"superpowers\" with others.Not just the yoga tradition, but all contemplative traditions appreciate the value of cultivating a calm quiet mind. As I described earlier, it is often when we are quietly stargazing or taking a walk through the woods, perhaps sitting outside with a cup of tea that our overactive mind has a chance to settle down. Then we can more readily tap into the part of us that really knows, instead of constantly listening to the part of us that thinks it knows! Meditation\u2014the practice of drawing your attention inward for even a few minutes each day\u2014helps to clear our mental space so that our intuitive knowledge can make itself known. This is a great place to begin asking yourself about what you would do if. Some people find it helpful to journal\u2014trying to write without self-editing about things they would like to do if. If you are curious about uncovering or connecting to ideas on what your unique life purpose is, why not spend a few quiet minutes each day and see what happens. And DREAM BIG!! Tap into the qualities within you that you have always known were there\u2014the ones you express in situations where you feel most alive, most yourself! I would describe myself as passionately curious. I love to learn. As far back as I can remember I have thrived when I was learning, and I still continue to want to learn more. And what makes me feel most alive? The times when I am sharing what I have learned from my teachers, the knowledge and wisdom they have shared that has so positively influenced my life. The book, The Four Desires, written by Rod Stryker, offers a clear, practical, and practice driven approach to helping you begin to discern what your dharma might be. Stryker's book closes with a quote from the yoga master, Yogananda. \"Analyze what you are, what you wish to become, and what shortcomings are impeding you. Decide the nature of your true task\u2014your mission in life, your dharma. Endeavor to make yourself what you should be and what you are meant to be.\" With curiosity and patience, may you begin to explore what it is that makes you uniquely you and offer your gifts to others. The world needs you to become who and what you were meant to be! Laurie is a 500-hour certified yoga teacher, and an Ayurveda Health Counselor. As a Four Desires teacher and mentor, she shares this life changing work with others both privately and through local weekend trainings.

Dharma is the idea that we are born out of something noble and that each one of us has something unique and noble to contribute.So often what we admire as much as their innate talent is the quality or qualities of their contribution. I like to think of it as sharing your secret \"superpowers\" with others.
