It is true that some children who receive vaccinations may still become ill when exposed to other disease-ridden children. Research shows that 70-90% of the entire population must be vaccinated to attain \"herd immunity\", \"the resistance of a group to attack by a disease to which a large proportion of the members are immune.\" (Farlex, 2012) When herd immunity is accomplished the spread of the disease can be averted throughout. If all parents were to take proper responsibilities and keep their children's immunizations up-to-date, herd immunity would be achieved against all 16 of the major life threatening diseases. 170). Thimerosal was first introduced in the 1930's and is a preservative that eliminated the bacterial contamination in vaccines, but could possibly sit in the brain and cause neurological damage (Mooney, 2009, p. 60). Before 1989, American preschoolers had to only receive three vaccines; for polio, diphtheria-pertussis, and MMR. In 1999 the FDA and CDC decided that vaccine users should reduce or even get rid of the amount of thimerosal used in vaccines. The CDC also recommended that newborns should wait to get the Hepatitis B vaccination until a thimerosal free vaccination became available (Miller & Reynolds, 2009, p. 170). According to head of the chemistry department at University of Kentucky, Dr. Boyd Haley, \"'You couldn't even construct a study that shows thimerosal is safe, it's just too darn toxic. If you inject thimerosal into an animal, its brain will sicken. If you apply it to living tissues, the cells die. Knowing these things, it would be shocking if one inject it into an infant without causing damage'\" (Kennedy, 2005, p. 59). With the being said, vaccine manufacturers began working to find a way to make a thimerosal-free vaccination, and eventually they made one. Then a decade later, children were receiving a total of 22 vaccinations by the time they started first grade. As the number of vaccines that children needed went up, the autism rate stayed Vaccinate Vaccinations are safe and they work. There are many parents who choose for their own reasons to ignore Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations to vaccinate and exercise their right to not do so. They run the risk of having their child suffer or even possibly die when they opt-out to having their child vaccinated. Today in the United States, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease are often traced to susceptible children whose parents have claimed an exemption from school or child care immunization regulations (CDC, 2014). The Necessity of Vaccination in Children: Opposing Anti-Vaccination There appears to be an alarmingly large group of people that don't mind exposing their children to serious harm; in recent years, many adults have decided against vaccinating their children. This is unusual, as vaccines are non-lethal, very safe protection for children; they are even cost-effective for their parents and are considerably safer for the entire family when these children are vaccinated routinely (Prosser, 1548). Jennifer Hamborsky of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention essentially describes vaccination as the administration of antigenic material to stimulate an individual 's immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen- and vaccination Would you ever take away a prime defense from your child? Some parents are doing so without even knowing it. Per Glanz and Daley, \"Last year 10 children died in California in the worst whooping cough outbreak to sweep the state since 1947.\" (Daley, Glanz, N.p.) These are illnesses that are preventable with vaccinations. Childhood vaccinations are key for the protection of children, the people around them and the prevention of widespread disease. Between 1924 and 2013, vaccinations prevented 103 million cases of polio, measles, rubella, mumps, hepatitis A, diphtheria, and pertussis (Bailey). Vaccinating is \"the process by which pathogenic cells are injected into a healthy person in an attempt to cause the body to develop antibodies to a particular virus or bacterium\u2014successful creation of antibodies is referred to as immunity to the disease caused by the particular pathogen\" (Introduction to Should Vaccinations be Mandatory). Popular conflicts regarding vaccination include the worry that this form of immunization isn't natural, the idea that vaccination schedule for children in the U.S. takes away parents' rights to make decisions for their children, and the concern that vaccinations aren't safe for all children. Most doctors and scientists advocate for vaccinations in the name of herd immunity, protection against foreign diseases and prevention against pockets of disease outbreaks. Vaccinations should be mandatory for all children in the United States for who they are deemed safe and effective. Debate Analysis: Vaccination When one is given a vaccine, he or she is being injected with a killed microbe to train his or her immune system to be able to fight it off, in hopes to prevent a future disease. Whether or not to vaccinate one's child has been a controversy through the years, because some vaccines have had unplanned side effects. These unplanned side effects have caused parents to be skeptical on whether or not to vaccinate their child, despite getting vaccines can possibly prevent a fatal disease. Many questions have risen from this practice of vaccination, in which Dr. William C. Douglass attempts to answer in his article, \"How To Win the Vaccine Argument Every Single Time\". Although William C. Douglass provides decent arguments What is autism? Autism is It is not common for these side affects to take place, and to decide to not vaccinate children would actually be doing more harm than being safe. These ingredients and amounts have been tested and regulated, and only very few cases have shown any harmful side effects. The theory that these vaccines are the cause of autism was a main reason to stay away from vaccines, but this theory has since been disproven. on Oct. 6, 2015, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) found that infant rhesus macaques (monkey species), whose physiology is the closest to young children, was injected with childhood vaccines which contained thimerosal, and from 2008, without the thimerosal, was discovered that there were no neuropathological changes in either. With the parents thinking that the main issue is thimerosal, this disproves the theory that this could be linked to Since the early 1800's vaccinations have been significant factors in eliminating many contagious diseases and, for the most part, have been an accepted part of preventative medicine in our nation. Veritably eradicating often fatal diseases such as smallpox, polio, and cholera, vaccinations have been vital in contributing to a healthier and more disease free world. Furthermore, there are beneficial reasons for embracing vaccinations for one's children. Children are especially vulnerable to disease because their immune systems have not yet developed, and getting a serious illness can have Verstraeten's study, released in February of 2000, appeared to show that thimerosal may cause problems in the brain, such as autism. His study concludes by saying that \"We can state that this analysis does not rule out that receipt of thimerosal-containing vaccine in children under 3 months of age may be related to an increased risk of neurologic developmental disorders\" (Benjamin 2003). To anti-vaccine supporters this is a red flag, and a reason why they believe that vaccines should not be mandatory for children. Thesis Statement: Today, the choice on whether to vaccinate children or not is a thriving topic that many parents are starting to look deeper into. Ultimately, the sole purpose of vaccinations are to promote immunity. When parents decide not to vaccinate they are not only putting their child at risk for contracting diseases, but other children as well. Mothers who are vaccinated are protecting their unborn children from viruses that could cause birth defects. Protecting future generations is vital in order to try and exterminate disease. The dangers of not vaccinating include exposing the individual child to disease, and also exposing other vulnerable people who may have compromised immune systems or not are eligible for vaccination. By receiving a vaccination you are limiting a future outbreak. Disease has been a problem for as long as mankind has been around. By making vaccinations mandatory for schools in every state we as a whole will be much healthier and less likely to get sick. 93% of children between the ages of 19-35 months have gotten the vaccine for Polio and the causes for that disease have decreased by 99%. In today's world our medicine and science is getting much better. One of the first vaccines created was for smallpox. A man named Edward Jenner discovered that by taking the right amount of the live virus cowpox (vaccinia) and injecting it into his patients they did not catch smallpox. Like most things, the right dosage of a vaccine can prevent people from getting sick. The fact that vaccines have nearly gotten rid of some deadly diseases is a reason why getting vaccinated is important. With better education and information, people who choose not to vaccinate their children can be encouraged to consider vaccination, which will benefit both their families and society as a whole. For many years, there has been a controversy about whether or not vaccinations should be mandated for everyone. In the United States, many diseases such as polio, diphtheria, measles, and whooping cough used to be extremely common, until vaccinations came around and started preventing these diseases. The main point for vaccines is to prepare a person's immune system for any possible attack of a disease that comes in the future; a person's body will be prepared to fight off the disease with the vaccine (\"Basics\"). Vaccines have the ability to prevent many cases of these diseases in advanced, but there are people who think vaccines are unnatural and should not be required for their children. It is said that immunity in child vaccines are about 90%-100%, which is an increase over the past few years (\"Childhood\"). Although many Americans believe that vaccines are unsafe and cause autism in children, vaccinations for children should be mandatory because they can save a child's life, create herd immunity in a community, and they have been proven safe/cost-effective. \"Standard immunization currently averts an estimated two to three million deaths every year in all age groups\" (\"General Information\"). Children along with adults should be vaccinated because these Inoculations prevent diseases, even deaths, from going around, along with keeping the environment a safer place. As people know, kids get vaccinated "}
