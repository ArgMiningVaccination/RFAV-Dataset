While we usually think of food, water, and air (and shelter), a critical nutrient is sleep. Recent research on sleep has demonstrated that we need, on average, eight to nine hours of quality sleep. Ppoor quantity or quality of sleep cause deterioration of health and performance as evidence d by the following: o tendency toward obesity o tendency toward insulin resistance and diabetes o poor concentration and memory o increased rate of car accidents o irritability o lack of awareness of o poor decision making (the accidents at Chernobyl, and Three Mile Island all occured during the night shift) o worsening of pain and inflammation What is Sleep? We spend approximately one-third of our lives sleeping, and yet, scientifically, there is much ab out sleep that we don't know. We do know that most functions of the body begin to fail with insufficie nt or improper sleep. The functions that are most directly affected by lack of sleep are perception (including pain), thinking, alertness, energy and immune function. There are four stages of sleep, Stage I-IV. Through the night, we cycle through these four stages approximately every 3 hours (approximately 45 minutes per phase). As we go through the night, some phases get longer and others get shorter. Dreaming, or Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep occurs during stage II. Stages III and IV are non- dreaming sleep, while Stage IV is called \"restorati ve\" sleep. During various portions of the sleep cycle, there are important surges of specific hormones, su ch as growth hormone. Disruption of normal sleep \"architecture\" can cause an imbalance of these important hormones. People with lack of dreaming sleep can develop cognitive or emotional difficulties. People with Stage IV sleep deprivation usually do not feel refreshed in the morning, even if they sleep eight hours or more. Also, a lack of Stage IV sleep see ms to \"turn up the volume conrol\" on the sense of pain within the nervous system. \"Normal\" people woken up each time they go into Stage IV sleep will eventually develop multiple pains. Evaluating Sleep Sleep can be studied by spending a night in a \"sleep lab\" While sleeping, the sleep patterns are recorded and analyzed. Quantity of stage IV sleep, apnea, oxygenation, and other physiologic parameters are measured. If problems are identifie d, many can be treated. For the majority of people, a sleep study will not change treatment, so the study is optional. If there is no response to treatment, a sleep study can always be done. Treatment of Sleep To achieve optimum sleep, you must follow all these guidelines: 1) Go to sleep and wake up the same time each night , even on weekends. 2) Reduce disturbances to sleep (noise, pets, snori ng spouse.) 3) Your sleep chamber should be pitch dark. 4) Minimize naps. 5) Avoid foods and medications that interfere with stage II or IV sleep: late meals, alcohol, caffeine , soda, benzodiazepams. 6) Don't do any stimulating activities for an hour before bedtime-such as TV, video games, etc. Instead, read, listen to music, take a hot bath... 7) Adjust your sleep/wake cycle to clock changes (Daylight Saving Time, trips) at no more than 10-15 minutes per night (i.e. take 4-6 nights to adjust t o a 1 hour change) 8) Exercise regularly (gentle aerobics works best; but not immediately before bedtime). 9) Do not use the same class of sleep inducers (suc h as Ambien or Restoril) more than 2 times per week (but you can rotate ). 10) If you wake up, stay in bed. Focus on your breathing or use other relaxation techniques. 11) Adjust your sleep-wake cycle to earlier or late r in the day (a more natural rhythm for you). Use of sleep medications and supplements Certain medications, especially Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine), tricyclic antidepressants (Elav il, Pamelor, amitryptiline, nortryptiline), Trazadone, and others improve stage IV sleep. Short or long- term use of these medications, at low doses, can 11/11/06-1 sleep_aa.wpf \"Sleep\" M Cheikin MD Page 2 signficantly help with sleep and pain. Side effect s are usually mild and can include dry mouth and constipation, and rarely difficulty urinating or restlessness. Other medications, supplements and herbals, such as Benadryl, melatonin, 5HTP, threanine and magnolia can help with various aspects of sleep dysfunction. Usage and dosage varies significantly between individuals.
