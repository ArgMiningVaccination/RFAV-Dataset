As a consequence, many Americans have heard only a case for the bill. This commentary is an attempt to present the other side. VIRGIN IA COMMISSION O CONSTITUTIO AL GOVER MENT Travelers Buildi.ng, Richmond, Virginia CIVIL RIGHTS AND LEGAL WRONGS T he logic is said to go something like this: All decent Americans should support good th ings. All decent Americans should oppose bad things. Racial discrimination is a bad thing. Bills to prohibit racial discr-i mination are good things. The President's pending Civil Rights Bill is intended to prohibit racial discrimination. Therefore, his bill is a good th in g, and all decent Americans should support it. If this were all there were to it-i f the problem were as simple as A plus B, and therefore C-noth ing could be gained by further discussion of the Presiden t's proposal. All decent Americans would be of one mind. But the problems that have produced this bill are not easy problems, and the bill is not a simple bill. O ne of the great distinctions of the American system is that we try always to distinguish between the means and the end- between the goal itself, and the wa y in ,vhich a goal is reached. Such careful distinctions need to be made in this case. We bel ie-ye th is bill is a very bad bill. In our vie'-'v, the mean s here proposed are th e wrong means. T he weapons the President woul d con trive against race prejudice are the wrong weapons. In the name of achieving certain \"rights\" for one group of citizens, this bill would impose some fa teful compu lsions on another group of citizens. The bill may be well-inten tioned-we question no man's motivation in supporting it- but good intentions are not enough. In th is area, we need good la\"\u00b7 An d the President's bill, in our view, is plain bad law. That is perhaps the least that could be sa id of it. In our judgment, this bill violates the Constitution in half a dozen differen t ways: It would tend to destroy the States' control of their own voting requirements. It would stretch the Commerce C lause beyond recognition . It wrongly would invoke the 14th Amendment. It would undermine the most prec ious rights of property. I It would raise grave questions of a citizen's right to jury trial. The bill would open new doors to the forces of government regimentation. And in the end, because of the violence that would be done to fundamental law, Americans of every race would suffer equal harm. The emotionalism of this turbulent summer is largely responsible for the serious attention now given the bill and for the eminent voices raised in its behalf. In a calmer climate, the bill's defects would be readily apparent. But this is not a calm time; it is a passionate time, and dispassionate thought comes hard. What is here proposed, in this brief pamphlet, is simply that we sit down and reason together. Those of us who strongly oppose the bill believe our position is sound. We should like to explain this position to you. THE BILL ITSELF Mr. Kennedy's omnibus Civil Rights Bill of 1963 (S. 1731 ) is divided into seven major titles. Briefly: Title I relates to \"voting rights.\" It would place ela~rate new controls upon the States' constitutional authonty to fix the qualifications of voters. Title II relates to \"public accommodations.\" It ~,ould co~pel the owner of almost every business establishment m the United States to serve all persons regardless of race. Title III, relating to the \"desegregation of public education,\" would vest sweeping new powers in the U. S. Commissioner of Education and the Attorney General to deal with \"racial imbalance\" in schools throughout the country. Title IV would set up a new Federal agency, the \"Community Relations Service.\" T itle V would continue the Commission on Civil Rights until 1967, and endow it with broad new authority. Title VI amends all statutes providin 0o financial assistance b)' the United States bv orant ' contract, loans, msurance, , b 2 guaranty, or otherwise. It would permit such assistance to be suspended upon a finding of racial or religious discrimin ation. Title VU authorizes the President to create a \"Commission on Equal Employment Opportunity,\" possessed of \"such povvers as may be conferred upon it by the President\" to prevent discrimination under contracts in programs or activities receiving direct or indirect fin ancial assistance from the United States government. This is what the bill is all about. At first glance, p erh aps, man y persons may see n othing \\Hong in the several p roposals. In this emotion al hou r, one is tempted to leap from a sincere conviction that discrimination is wrong, to a fa lse conclusion that a Federal law is the proper way to prevent it. \\ Ale do not believe th e intensely person al problems of racial feeling ca n be solved by a ny Federal law ; the roots go deeper than Congress can reach. In an y event, we believe that whatever might be ga ined by this particular Fede ral lavv, if an ything, the positive harm tha t would be done to constitutional government would far outweigh the hypothetical good . TITLE I-VOTING RIGHTS In the United States, beyond :;ill question, the right to vote is just that-a right to vote. For most Americans, p robabl y the ancient right of property ranks l-irst in their dail y lives; it is the oldest right of all. But as political beings, they view the right to vote as basic. As the Presiden t has said, it is ultimately the -right on which the security of all other rights depends. A moment's reflection, however, reminds us that the right to vote is not an absolute right. C h ild ren cannot vote. L unatics cannot vote. C ertain con victs cannot vote. Bevond these obvious limitations, it is evident that persons in Virgin ia ~annot vote for a Senator from New York. Residents of Alban v cannot vote fo r the \u00b7C ity Council of Schenectad~,. And the man who moves to Ma nhattan on a Monday cannot vote for the M ayor on Tuesday. T hese a re elementary considerations, of course, but it does no harm to spell them out . Wh y is all this so? It is because the right to vote, though it is described in the 15th Amendment as a right accrui ng to \"citizens of 3 the United States,\" is in its exercise a right accruing to citizens of the several separate States. It never should be forgotten that whenever we vote, we vote as citizens of our States. We never vote nationally. W e are always, at the polls, Virginians, New Yorkers, Texans, Missourians. As voters, we are never \"Americans.\" The idea is hard to get accustomed to; but it is so. The Constitution makes it so. Three provisions of the Constitution merit attention . First, the I 5th Amendment. It is very short: The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of 'race , color, or previous condition of servitude. [Emphasis added} . The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. The briefest perusal of M r. Kennedy's pending Civil Rights Bill will disclose that some of its most important provisions are not related to the denial or abridgment ,of the right to vote \"on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" T he 15th Amendment is not relied upon at all . If the bill were based clearly upon the Fifteenth, the position of th e Virginia Commission would be wholly different. W e might obj ect that a bill along these lines were u nwise, or unwarranted; but we would not oppose it as unconstitutional. N o. In its provisions relating to a standard literacy test, and in other provisions, the administration's bill has nothing to do with State deprivals in the area of \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" This bill applies to all citizens, everywhere. Therefo re, other provisions of the Constitution come into play. The first of these provisions appears in the second paragraph of Article I. It tells us who sh all be qualified to vote in what often are termed Federal elections-that is, who shall be qualified to vote for members of the Congress. It reads : The H ouse of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several States, and the electors in each State shall have the qualifocations requisite for electors of the m ost numeroiis branch of the State legislature. [Emphasis supplied}. 4 v1s10ns quoted. The bill would prohibit the use by any State of a literacy test unless such tests met Federal requirements-unless the tests were \"wholly in writing\" and unless a copy of such test were furni shed th e individu al registrant \"within 25 days of the submission of his vvritten request. \" Beyond this, the bill would provide that State literacy tests were of no consequence anyhow: Any person who had completed the sixth grade in a public school or an accredited private school would arbitrarily be deemed to possess \"sufficient literacy, comprehension , and intelligence to vote in any Federal election .\" W e take no position here on the merits of th ese proposals as such. They are as may be. Our contention is th at such proposals plainly deal with the qu alifications of electors in the several States. These proposals have nothing whatever to do with the \"times, places, and manner of holdin g elections.\" In our view, they are simply beyond the authority of the Congress to enact. They pl ainly encroach upon the power of each State to fix \"qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature.\" The President's bill continues with a provision aimed at certain of the Southern States, in which- in a scattering of counties- fewe r than 15 percent of the adult Negroes have registered to vote. The Virginia C ommission would make its own position clear : We h ave no patience with conspi racie~ or chica nery or acts of in timidation intended to deny genuinely quali fied Negroes th e right to vote. We have no patience with acts of bland partisanship that may give the vote to certain white persons and prohibit the vote to Negroes of equal stature. W herever such acts have occurred, they are to be emph atically condemned. We do say this: T here is abunda nt law on the books-there was abundant law on the books even prior to enactment of the C ivil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960-to prohibit and to punish such willful acts by local registrars. All that is required is th at the existing laws be enforced . If the Congress somehow is persuaded th at still further law is required to enforce the 15th Amendment, the Virginia Commission will raise no constitutional objection . In the area of \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the Amendment pl ainl y vests in Congress the power to adopt appropriate legislation . We come back to the larger point. T he key provisions of Title I, as a whole, have nothing to do with \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" T hese prov isions assert, on the part of the 6 There are two other such provisions, but it is needless to quote them. The second proviso impales the smallest hotdog stand upon the transportation of its mustard. There is not a neighborhood soda fountain in American , not a dress shop, not a hat shop, not a beauty parlor, not a single place or establishment beyond the tiniest roadside stand of which it may be said that a substantial portion of its goods, held out for sale or use, has not moved in interstate commerce. We would urge thoughtful Americans, wherever they may live, whatever their views may be on questions of race relations, to ponder the twisted construction here placed upon the Commerce Clause. When the Congress first began to regulate \u00b7'commerce among the several States,\" the object was to regulate the carriers i~ which the goods were hauled. In time, a second area of regulation developed, as the nature of the goods themselves came into the congressional povver. Then a third area developed, as Congress sought to regulate the conditions under which the goods themselves were manufac tured. In this bill, a fourth area is opened up. It is as wide as the world. Here the Congress proposes to impose a requirement to serve. Heretofore, such a requirement has been imposed solely in the area of public service corporations-the telephone companies, electric power companies, gas and water companies-the companies that operate as regulated public utilities. Now the restricted class of public service corporations is to be svvept aside. H ere Clancy's Grill and Mrs. Murph y's Hat Shoppe are equated with AT&T. The n eighborhood drug store is treated as the gas company : It niust serve. v\\lithin the realm of Section 202, the owner has no option ,, no right of choice. Yes, he may reject drunks, rowdies, deadbeats. But his right to discriminate by reason of race or religion- or any other related personal reason-is denied him under the pain of Federal injunction and the threat of prison sentence for contempt of court. At this point in our argument the Virginia Commission would beg the closest atten tion: We do not propose to defend racial discrimination. We do defend, with all the power at our command, the citizen's right to discriminate. However shocking the proposition may sound at first impression, we submit that under one name or another, this is what the Constitution, in part at least, is all abou t. This right is vital to the American systel'n. If this be destroyed, the vvhole basis of individual liberty is destroyed. T he American system does not rest upon some \"right to be right,\" as some legislative majority 11 may defin e \\.vhat is \"right.\" It rests solidly upon the individual's right to be wrong-upon his right in his personal life to be capricious, arbitrary, prejudiced, biased, opinionated, unreasonable-upon his right to act as a free man in a free society. W e plead your indulgence. Wheth er this right be called the right of free choice, or th e right of free association, or the right to be let alone, or the right of a free market place, this right is essential. Its spirit permeates th e Constitution . Its exercise colors our entire life. When a man buys union-made produ cts, for that reason alone, as opposed to non-union products, he discriminates. W hen a Virginian bu ys cigarettes made in Vi rginia, for that reason alone, as opposed to cigarettes made in Kentucky or N orth Ca rolina, he discriminates. W hen a housewife bu ys a na-tionall y advertised lipstick , for that reaso~ alone, as opposed to an unknown brand, she discrimin ates. \\ iVhen her husband bu ys an American automobile, for that reason alone, as opposed to a European automobile, he discriminates. Every one of these acts of \"discrimination\" imposes some burden upon interstate co111.merce. T he exa mpl es could be endl essly multiplied. Every reader of this discussion will think up his own examples fro m the oranges of Florida to the potatoes of Idaho. And the right to discriminate obviously does not end with questions of commerce. T he man who blindly votes a stra ight D emocra tic ticket, or a straight Republican ticket, is engaged in discrimin ation . H e is not concerned with the color of an opponent's skin ; he is concerned with the color of his party. Merit has nothing to do with it. T he man who habitu all y bu ys the Times instead of the H erald Tribune, or Life in stead of Look, or listens to M r. Bern stein instead of to Mr. Presley, is engaged in discrimination. W ithout pausing to chop logic, he is bringin g to bear th e accumulated experience.:_the prejudice, if you please-of a lifetime. Some non-union goods may be better than some union goods; some Democra ts may be better than some Republicans; some issues of Loole may be better than some issues of Life. None of this matters. In a free society, these choices-these acts of prejudice, or discrimination , or arbit ra ry judgment- u niversally have been rega rded as a man's right to make on h is own . T he vice of Mr. Kennedv's Ti tl e II is that it tends to destroy this concept by crea tin g a pattern for Federal intervention. For the firs t time, outside the fu ll y accepted area of public utilities, this bill undertakes to lay down a compul sion to sell. 12 W e raise the point : If there can constitutionally be a compulsion to sell, vvh y cannot there be, with equal justification, a compulsion to bu y? In theory, the bill is concerned with \"burdens on and obstructions to\" commerce. In theory, the owner of the neighborhood restaura nt imposes an intolerable burden upon interstate commerce if he refuses to serve a white or N egro customer, as the case may be. But let u s suppose that by obeying some injunction to serve a Negro pa tron , the proprietor of Clancy's Grill thereby loses the trade of ten white patrons. In the South, such a consequence is entirel y likely; it has been demonstra ted in th e case of South ern movie houses. Ca n it be said th at the refusal of the ten whites imposes no burden on intersta te commerce? Plainly, these ten intransigent customers, u nder the theory of this bill, have imposed ten times as great a burden on commerce among the several States. Shall they, then , be compelled to return to C lancy's for their meals? Where . does this line of reasoning lead us? How would all this be enfo rced? Under Title II , the Attorney G enera l woul d be req uired to in vestiga te complaints of denial of service. Persistent acts of discrimi nation would be prohibited by Federal inj unction s, obtained in the name of the United States. Any person who attempted to interfere with Clancy's decision would be subject to individu al injunction. And at the end of every such proceeding lies the th rea t of fin e or imprisonment fo r contempt of court. There would be no jury trials. This has been a very abbreviated summary of the \"public accommodations\" fea tu res of the Presiden t's bill. A definiti ve analysis could be much extended. Not only is the Commerce C lause di storted beyond recognition, th e provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment also are warped to cover individual action as opposed to State action. O ur hypothetical C lancy could not call upon the police to eject an , unwan ted customer, trespassin g upon his booths an d tables. Reliance upan local police to en force old laws of trespass, under this bill , would be regarded as an exercise of \"State action.\" C lancy has become th e State. Like Louis of old , he too may say, \"L'etat, c'est moi.\" TITLE III-DESEGREGATION OF PUBLIC EDUCATION Titl e III of the P resident's bill goes far beyond all decisions of the Supreme Court in the field of school desegregation , for it im- 13 r plicitly couples the formal desegregation of public schools in the South with the elimination of racial imbalance\" in schools throughout the land . Th e bill proposes to achieve these aim s by vesting broad new po,vers in th e Commissioner of Education and the Attorney General. Even private schools, if th eir pupils received tuition grants from a governmental source, would be brought into line. The opening prov isions of Title III authorize the C ommissioner, upon application from local school offici als, to engage in a wide variety of programs of advice, technical assistance, grants, loans, contracts, and training institutes. The Commissioner would con trol the amounts, terms, and conditions of such grants. They would be paid on the terms he prescribed. H e alone would fi x all \"rules and regul ations\" for carrying out these programs to promote desegregation and to relieve \"racial imbalance.\" Presumabl y, the authority of Congress to promote th is bu sywork for the Commissioner is to be found in the fifth section of th e 14th Amendment. This is the section th at empowers Congress to adopt \"appropriate legislation\" in support of the Equal Protection Clause. If th e Equ al Protection C lause trul y vvere intended to p rohibit a State from maintainin g raciall y separa te public schools, such legislation perhaps would be \"appropriate.\" The history of public education in th e United States, in the yea rs immediately following the purported ra tification of the 14th Amendment in 1868, utterly denies an y such intent ion. To this day, no law of the United States requi res desegrega tion . T hese programs of the Commissioner of Education are cart before horse; th ey are th e sort of programs that would implement a law if th ere were a lavv; but there is no law. There is the Supreme Court's opin ion of 1954 in Brown v . Board of Education, and there are oth er high court opinions emana ting from it, bu t impressive and historic as these decisions may be, they are still no more than judgments bindin g named defendan ts in particu lar lawsuits. It should be emph asized, aga in , th at th ese decisions have nothin g to do with \"racial imbalance\" in public schools. T hey are limited to judgments req uiring th at the States shall not den y to any person on account of race th e rioht to attend an v. school it maintains. The . 0 shi ftin 0o of studen ts from school to school in order to \"remove . racial imbalance,\" w ith or wi thou t Federa l aid and regulation, 1s not w ithin th e ambit of the deseo0 reoa tion decisions. U nder th is gross 0 distortion of the I 4th Amendment , school children th roughout the country w~uld become pawns in a game of power politics. 14 It seems to us desirable to keep this distinction in mind , bet,,, ,een laws en acted by the C ongress, and judgments imposed by the court. T he C onstitution is the supreme lavv of the land, but when the court acts in a suit arising under the Con stitution it acts judicially, not legislatively. If local school boards throughout th e South are to be prohibited by law from maintaining separate school systems, a law mu st be passed \"pursu ant to the Constitution\" to impose such a proh ibition. Until then , an y such grants and loans and trainin g programs as th ese vvould appea r premature. And we would take the position , in the light of th e history of th e 14th Amendment, that such a law would n ot be \"pu rsu ant to th e C onstitution.\" It would violate the plain intention both of those who framed the amendment and also of the States that ratified it. Such legislation would not be \"appropriate\" legislation . Mean while, we do n ot intend to be captious or legalistic . The Brow n decision h as been treated as if it were indeed legislation. For good or ill , the desegrega tion of public schools proceeds. Th ese particular p rovisions of T itle Ill are better subject to criticism simpl y as manifestation s of the burea ucratic Federal sprawl. M.ore serious, in our view, are the provisions of Titl e Ill th at would vest elabora te new powers in the Attorney General. Th e effect of these pro visions woul d be to th row the enti re massive weight of the D epartment of J ustice, with its unlimited resources, into th e scales of almost an y paren t in search of a free laws uit. The basic complaint would be th at some local school board \"had failed to achieve desegrega tion .\" But as we h ave tr ied to point out, in th e overwh elming majority of school districts in the South, th ere is now n o legal requirement that local school boards even attempt to achieve desegregation. Before there ca n be a fa ilure of a dut y, th e re mu st firs t be a dut y. These p rovisions of the bill simply ass ume th e duty, and leap to its fa il ure. Ou r appreh ension is that the awesome power here proposed, for a proli fera tion of suits \"in the name of the United States,\" would create more tu rmoil th an it would settle. T he \"orderl y progress of desegrega tion in publ ic educa tion\" would anced , but impaired, as rese ntments were stirred up that otherwise might be peacefu ll y resolved. And we cannot see _the,. .en d to the burea ucracy ~hat could be req ui red to prosecu te suits m th e name of the Umted States,\" once thi s precedent were set in the sin gle area of school desegregation. 15 TITLE IV-ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMUNITY RELATIONS SERVICE This title \\.vould create a new Federal agency, the \"C ommunity Relations Service,\" headed by a director at $20,000 a year. P resumably, it would ful fi ll some functions not now ful fi lled by the Civil Rights C ommission, the P resident's Fair Employment Practices C ommittee, th e established churches and va rious civic bodies, the countless racial commissions around the country, and the civ~l rights division of th e D epartment of Justice. The duties of this Service would be \"to prov ide assistance to communities and persons therein in resolving disputes, disagreements, or difficulties relatin g to discriminatory practices.\" [Emph asis supplied} . \\ Ve are not inclined to haggle over the amount of time, energy and money th at might be wasted by one more Federal agency in the civil rights fi eld. \\A.Te do ca ll attention to the italicized lan guage. In our own view, it simply is not the fun ction of Congress, under anv provisions of the United States Constitution, to dispa tch Feder;! agents to countless commu nities in order to resolve racial disagreements among \"persons therein.\" TITLE V-COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS The Virginia Commi ssion on Constitutional Government expresses neith er opposition to nor support of Title V of the President's bill. This portion of the bill would extend the life of the Commission on C ivil Rights to N ovember 30, 1967, and would lay down certain standardized rules for its fu rther hearin gs and investigations. In our own view, th e Commi ssion on Civil Rights has contributed little or nothin t:,o toward the unravel ino0 of the knottv tangles of \u00b7race relations in the United States. Its recommendations in the spring of 1963, proposin g the withd ravval of gra n ts, loans, and even contracts fro m South ern States th at did not meet its own notions of right condu ct, amounted to an outrageous proposal for denial of the v~ry equal p rotection s it professes to su pport. We perceive no useful achievements of thi s Comm ission, bu t we raise no constitutional objections to its con tinu ance. 16 TITLE VI-NONDISCRIMINATION IN FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAMS T itle VI of the P resident's bill is not long. It had perhaps best be quoted in full: Sec. 601. Notwith standing an y provisions to the contrarv in an y law of th e United States providing or authorizin g dire;t or indirect fi nancial assistance fo r or in connection with any program or activity by \\,vay of grant, contract, loan , insurance, guara nty, or oth erwise, no such law shall be interpreted as requiring that such fi nancial assistance shall be furni shed in circumstances under which individu als participating in or benefi tting from the program or acti vity are discrimin ated against on the ground of race, color, rel igion, or national origin or are denied p3rticipation or benefi ts therein on th e ground of race, color, religion , or national origin . All contracts made in con nection with an y such program or activity shall contain such con ditions as the President may prescribe for the purpose of assuring th at th ere shall be no discrimin ation in employmen t by ar. y contractor or subcontractor on ' the ground of race, color, religion , or national origin. [Emphasis supplied}. T he thinly veiled intimidation of T itle VI goes back to a statement made by Attorney General Robert Kennedy in London in October of 1962. A t th at time, he speculated publicly that a threat to withdraw federal su bsidies, gra nts, loans, and contracts might be used as a club over the Southern States. Mr. Kennedy was quick to point out that such a threat woul d have to be used with great delicacy . He seemed un sure of its desira bi lity. He did not defend its constitutionality. H e wa s just thinki ng aloud. \u00b7 In April of 1963, the Civil R ights Commission evidenced no such fin esse. T he C ommission recommended Had y to the President tha t he seek power to suspend or cancel eith er all , or selected parts of, the Federal fi nancial aid that now Hows to such Sta tes as M ississippi, \"until la..,vs of th e United States.\" It was unclea r precisely how a judicial determination wou ld be reached that entire States had fa iled to com ply with the Constitution and laws of the United States, but this small question of due process apparentl y troubled the Commission not at all. 17 Th e question troubl ed Mr. Kennedy. !n his press conference of Ap ril 17, th e President blinked at this startling proposal and turned away from it: I don't have th e power to cut off aid in a general way as vva~ p roposed by the Civil Rights C ommission, and I would think it would probabl y be unwise to give the President of the United States that kind of power beca use it could start in one State and fo r one reason or another might be moved to another State w hich has not measured up as the P resident would like to see it measure up in one way or another. It is a fair question to ask what happened. W hat happened between April 17, when the President voiced these comments at his press conference, and June 19, when his majority leader . intreduced his Civil Rights Bill? H ow did a power that was \"probabl y umvise\" in April become a power th at was \"essential\" in June? T he obvious answer is th at the interim was marked by widespread racial demonstra tions. But 1t is not pl easa nt to conclude that the P resident of the Un ited States may be coerced , intimidated, or black jacked into changing his mind so swiftly on a legislative proposal of fatef ul importance. W hat h'lppened? W e ea rnestl y submit that the pun itive terms of Title VI of this bill threa ten gross violation of every p rinciple of due process of lavv. N o provision whatever is made fo r determin ing when individuals \"participating in or benefittin g from\" various programs are \"discriminated agai nst.\" The two sentences of this Ti tl e define no terms. T hey propose no judicial in qui ry. T hey leave hu ndreds of mill ions of dollars in \"Federal fu nds,\" pa id fo r b y all of the people- black, white, Liberal, C onserva tive-at the uncontrolled discretion of the President or someone else who may determin e this \"discrimination.\" These p rograms include aid to dependen t children, aid to the blind, aid to the permanentl y disa bled. T hey include funds for educa , hospital co nstruction, pu blic housing, the insu,rance of bank deposits. Federal personnel would be au thorized to supervise loans by banks an d building and loa n associations, farm financing of all kinds, govern men t su bsid ies, conservation programs, small business loa~s an d contracts in an y activity affected by government loans' in surance ' 0ouara nties ' or bora nts. If a Federa l aoencv made an 0 \u00b7 administrative fi ndin t,o th at discrimination exists, Federal support 18 could be withdrawn and the institution or program wrecked. To perm it a P resident-any President-to suspend such programs on his own unchecked conclusion that certain beneficiaries are \"discriminated again st\" wou ld violate the whole spirit of uniformity that pervades th e Constitution . T he supreme law of otir land provides that \"direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers.\" Duties, imposts and excises \"shall be uniform throughout the United States.\" There must be a \"uniform rule of n atu ralization\" and \"unifo rm Ja,.,vs on the subject of bankru ptcies.\" Many other provisions attest this same concept of equal treatmen t among the States. Only by a fa ntastic distortion of the congressional power under the 14th and I 5th Amendments could thi s Title VI be justified. Its effect would be to penalize th e many for the occasion~! unlawful conduct of the fe w. Its potential application would jeopardize the very lives and well-bein g of thousands of innocent and law-abiding persons, including veterans, blind persons, and disabled persons, in order to bludgeon a h andful of State officials into line with a President's desires. It seems to us sufficient merel y to quote the language of this tyrannical Title of the Presiden t's bil l. The language speaks most eloquently for itself. TITLE VII- COMMISSION ON EQUAL EMPLOYME NT OPPORTUNITY T his fin al substantive section of the bill authorizes the President to establish a \"Commission on Equal Employmen t O pportun ity.\" This permanen t agency of the government would be headed by the Vice P resident; the Secretary of Labor would serve as vice chairman. There would be up to 15 members in all. An executive vice chairman would run the opera tion . T he C ommission would be empawered to employ \"~u~h ~ther ? ersonnel as may be necessary.\" Th e bill defines the comm1ss10n s duties: It shall be the function of the Commission to prevent discrimination against employees or applicants for employment because of race, color, religion, or na tional origin by Government contractors and sub contractors, and by contractors and sub contractors participating in programs or acti vities in which 19 direct or indirect fin / ncial assistance bv the United States Government is provided by way of gra~t, contract, loan, insurance, guaranty, or otherwise. The Commission shall h ave such powers to e ffectuate the purposes of this title as may be conferred upon it by the President. The President may also confer upon the Commission su ch powers as he deem s appropriate to prevent discrimination on the ground of race, color, religion , or national origin in Government employment.

The power here proposed to be conferred upo~ the President is virtually unlimited. N o legislative limitations of an y sort a1e suggested. The President may confer upon the Commission \"such powers as he deems appropriate.\" And whether these include the power to impose criminal sanctions, or to seek civil injunctions, or to abrogate contracts awarded u nder sealed bid, no man can say. The Commission's powers would be whatever the President regarded as appropriate; and the defin ition of \"government employment\" is as wide as the Federal budget itself. T he administration's bill proposes, in effect, that the Congress abdicate, and turn its legislative powers over to the \\ i\\lhite H ouse. T he powers here demanded i.l rc not the powers rightfull y to be exercised by a President in a free country. T hese are the powers of a despot. There is a fi nal T itle VIII in the bill, authorizing the appropriation of \"such sums as are necess~ ry to carry out the provisions of this Act.\" What these sums might amount to, aga in, no man can say. This is the package Mr. Kennedy has asked of the Congress. H e has asked it in an emotional hour, under the pressures of demonstrators who h ave taken violentl y to the streets, torch in hand.

GAMBLE, SR. Attorney-at-Law-Retired of New Orleans Bar HARRY PREFACE To those who respect Harvard wisdom, listen to the warning in 1958, of Dr. Mc llwain, a Professor of the Science of Government: \"Never in recorded history, I believe, has the individual been in greater danger from government than now; never has law been in greater jeopardy from arbitrary will; and never has there been such need that we clearly see the danger and guard aga inst it.\" He does not name al l t he sources of this danger; but those most obvious are: The President, when he commands Federal troops to invade States; or, for example, issues \" executive orders\" threatening to take bread from the mouths of thousands of working people, by withdrawing Federal funds appropriated for local projects, till his commands are obeyed; AND the Attorney General, who may and does pin the badge of a U.S. Marshal's authority on hundreds of bullyboys, and sends them out to intimidate local authorities to bring them to his views; AND bureaucrats who freely issue \"directives\" to control the daily lives of thousands of people, from one to two thousand miles distant from Washington; people whose local laws and culture may be very different, even repugnant, to those of the area of their upbringing; AND the Supreme Court commanding obedience to their indefensible decisions, under threat of unlimited deprivation of liberty and p roperty for noncompliance. It is true the Professor relies largely on an \"able, honest, learned, and independent judiciary\" to protect us from the aggressors, but adds: \"I am not defending indefensible decisions of our courts. I would not shield them from the severest criticism.\" It is these lawbreakers and unauthorized lawmakers who are dealt wi th in the follo w ing paper. New O rleans, Louisiana, July 14th, 1963. H A RRY P. GAMBLE, SR. O f the New Orle ans Bar N o te l : Pe rtine nt p rovisi o ns of th e Const itutio n a re fo und in the a p pend ix. Note 2: All e mphasis supplied by th e writer. l.an ti ARE THE LAWBREAKERS The parrot cry, \"Obey the law, \" is heard daily from Washington. Yet the chief lawbreakers are there; among them, the President, who issues unauthorized \"executive orders, \" and commands the Federal army to invade the States. But the cocks of the roost, are the nine men on the Supreme Judicial Bench of the United States. These nine men are uncontrolled. Their power is supreme, irresistible, and absolute, in our so-called democracy. Yet in every age in the long ages of government, it has been demonstrated, in the language of Lord Acton, often quoted, that: \u00b7 \"Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" There is no authority in our system to check these nine men; or correct their mistakes, however grievous; or nullify their seizure of unauthorized power; or punish their acts of tryanny. From time to time the earlier Judges sitting on that Bench have recognized their freedom from control, and asserted that it was not their function to go beyond \"judicial review.\" Chief Justice Marshall (1801-1835) briefly defining this Judicial Review said: \"The Court is merely a legal tribunal for the decision of controversies brought before them in legal form.\" Judicial review means in general, that in cases appealable to the Supreme Court, it will review the evidence introduced in the lower court, and weighing the law applicable, will affirm, reverse, or cor rect the judgment there rendered. The law applicable has never been held to mean that the Court may contrive, forge, or enact a law, which in its opinion fits the case, but shall render a de. cision on existing law enacted by the lawmaking power, constitutionally authorized so to do. If the law applied to the case below, in the opinion of the Courts is not constitutionally authorized, then it applies other existing law; still not contriving one of its own, either by strained interpretation, or downright enactment. No one has ever contended otherwise. -1 - A recent announcement of that limitation by Chief Justice Vinson ( 1946-1953) declares: \" Since we must rest our decisions on the ConstitutiG-n alone, we must set aside predilections on social pol icy and adhere to the settled rules which restrict the exercise of our power to judicial review.\" (346 J.S. 240 1953) Judge Harlan, father of the sitting Judge Harlan, stated the same thing in this language: \"When the American people come to the conclusion that the Judiciary is usurping to itself the function of the legislative department, and by judicial construction is declaring what should be the public policy of the United States, we will be in trouble. \" In referring to the 14th Amendment, fraudulentl y adopted in 1868, which has become a bottomless fish hatchery, from which the Cou rt has hooked some queer fish, never before suspected of inhabiting those waters, the eminent Judge Holmes (l 9021938) said: \"I cannot believe that the Amendment was intended to give carte blanc to embody our economic or moral belief in its prohibitions. \" Referring to the rights reserved to the states in th e 9th and l 0th Am e ndme nts, he re marked that: \"There is hardly a ny limit but the sky to invalidating these rights if they happen to strike the majority of this Court as for an y reason undesirable.\" 251 U.S. 580 ( 1930) And Chi ef Justice Hu g hes ( 1930-194 l) co mmented: \"It is not for the Court to amend the Constitution by judicial decree.\" This fra nk spoken jurist once observed, \" The Constitu ti on is what the Supreme Court says it is.\" Thi s asse rtion of a subme rg e d t ruth d id not much shock the careless American peo p le; thoug h d ispleasing to the Co urt. Judg e Doug las, still sitting, exp loded fu rio usly in the Ca lifornia-Colorado wate r di vers io n case, a g a inst th e ma jo rity d e cision, saying : \" This case wi ll be marke d as the baldest at- -2- I tempt by Judges in modern times to spin th ei r philosophies in the fabric of the law in derogation of the will of the legislature.\" It will come as a surprise when disclosed that th is same Judge (one of the law school teachers ap pointed, maybe a DEAN) in the earlier case of th e Black School decision of 1954, took a contra ry stand, and agreed to founding the decision in that case on the mind reading speculations of a Swe de, Gunar Myrdal, and associates, who figured that it would make the Negro children feel bad if they could not sit with white children in public schools. THEIR OWN WILL THE ONLY RESTRAINT OF THESE NINE MEN In reorganizing their absolute freedom from control, the Court has frequently stated, to use the words of Chief Justice Stone (1925-1946). \"The only check on our exercise of power is our own sense of self-restraint,\" Butler case. In th us admitting their freedom from control, they declare they are a super-governm ent. Such a super-government, not elected by the people, but appointed for life, is not tolerated by the great democracies of Europ e,-not by England, nor France, nor Germany, nor Italy. This fact is unknown to the great mass of the American people. The continuance of this uncontrollable power in the hands of nine men, is undeniable proof that a potent segment of our political leadership does not trust democratic processes; and have somehow contrived to surround these mere human beings with a halo of sanctity not merited in the experience of life, except by saints; a sanctity which endeavors to protect them from criticism, no matter what. It is as if assumed and asserted that the appointment by the President of a politically deserving friend (or to get rid of an opponent), w ill make that politi cian qualified to sit o n the highest Tribunal in the Nation . In more than one instan ce such an appointment by th e Presiden t has been charged to this mode of riddin g himself of an active opposition candidate. - 3- President Lincoln appointed Senator Samuel B. Chase to be Chief Justice in 1864, when Linco ln was a candidate for re-nomination of the Repub lican Party, and Chase was an avowed candidate for the same nomination. It has been printed that a political deal was made at the 1952 Republican National nominating convention between Governor Warren, who controlled the 72 votes of California, and Eisenhower managers-Eisenhower to get the votes for a decisive lead to the nomination, and Warren to be paid off by appointment to the Supreme Cou rt. This may or may not be true, but since Warr en was appointed shortly after Eisenhower assumed office - with no visible judicial qualifkations for that high office; low-minded persons could scarcely be censured for raising their eyebrows. It may be that a miracle can be performed by hanging a black cloth on a politic i an, to forthw ith convert him into a Judge; but few would believe such a ceremony preceded by a sordid poli tical deal, is a correct method to procure SUPE RMEN for the Supreme Bench. It may be accepted as an axiom in government that once a politician, always a politician. A pol itician cannot escape from a life long practice of proposing to amend and im prove existing law. His success in politics has been founded on such promise and performance. That mode of thinki ng has become second nature. And though politicians are an honorable necessity in a democracy, without whom it could not function, the highest tribunal in the land is no place for them. School boys know that it is not the business of Judges to make laws, or amend laws, but to interpret an d apply the laws enacted by the lawmaking power authorized so to do by the Constitution; and then onl y in cases duly brought before them. Re l yin g on self-restraint by men exercising uncontrolla ble power is the ze nith of folly-proven in all ages. Thomas Jefferson who spent fifty years wi th public men in public affai rs, expressed his distrust of judicial restraint in these words: \"The Judicia ry is the instrument which is to press us at last into one consolidated mass .. . . If Congress fails to shield th e States fro m dangers so pa lpable and so immin ent, th e States - 4- Can Southerners afford to be ti ht with their mone in must shield themselves, and meet the invader foot to foot.\" (Thomas Jefferson to Archibald Thweat, 1821) And: \"The Judiciary of the United States is the subtle corps of sappers and miners constantly working underground, undermining the foundation of our constitutional fabric.\" This worldly wise man did not mean to imply that the men who would serve on the Supreme Bench were dishonest or \u00b7traitors; but simply that their natural bent would be to make the National Government of which they were a part, supreme. In the long history of the Court, not more than one instance is suspected to have brought the shame of lack of integrity to the Supreme Bench. That is not t he charge. The charge is that when appoint ed they do not know anything about judicial restraint and ar e not l ikely ever to be much i mpressed by that limitation . For they are not appointed on the basis of their judicial training and learning. That these men not elected by t he people to reign over t hem, a t ta i n their appointments for politica l reaso ns, an d not for t hei r judicial qual ifications, is a b und antl y p roven by the fact that it is rare indeed t o a p point a member of a state Supreme Cou rt, o r a Judge from the Federal Judiciary, wh er e men of p r o v en a bi lity and many years of experience are to be found. In recent years, i n r espect to t h is \"judicial restraint\" a new note has been interjected by some now sitting on th e Bench, Judge Do ugla s among them; that it is within th e p r o v i nce of judicial action to do some lawmaking; wh ic h as we shall see, th ey have boldly done-united wi th its partner, lawbreaking. This far afield lawmaking and law breaking in recent years have drawn sharp a nd unusua l criticism from the official o rgan of A mer ican lawyers, the American Bar Asso1ciati o n; a nd t_ he official condemnation of an assembly of Chi ef Justices of state Supreme Benches. Judicial seizure of power has grown so intolerable, that an Amendment to the Federal Constitution is now in process of adoption for holding them in check, and reducing th eir powers of super- - 5- government. This Amendment has alread y b een adopted by several states. HOW THESE SUPERM EN BREAK THE LAW When these nine SUPERMEN do not like a law enacted by Congress or a State Legislature, th ey shatter it. All they have to do is to call it unconstitutional . That it is not authorized, or is prohibited, by the Federal Constitution; and since , in the words of Chief Justice Hughes, the Constitution is what they say it is, the law is broken, and an y decision which had before held it to be la w is also broken, however long that decision may have been held to be law. In our kind of democracy, there is no remedy. Often the law is busted by the vote of one of the SUPERMEN. Four say ' tis or 'taint const itutional; and four say 'taint or 'tis; then one decides the question-to make a majority of fi v e to four . Right here it is easy for the unawed mi nd to become confused with trying to keep up with th e \"now you see it, now you don ' t, \" juggling going on among the SUPERMEN . Fo r in one decision yo u see that five are truly SUPERMEN, and the ot her four are bush leaguers; bu t in the next d ecisio n, the bush leaguers are bac k in t he majo rs, and some of the former SUPERMEN are ba nishe d to the minors. These chameleon changes so baffl es one contemplating this comi ng and going, t hat he is likely to head for the nut house . O nl y a lizard in the animal world ca n pa ss throu g h these changes without loss of p resti ge. When a citi zen is t old abou t t hese th i ngs, he is ama zed that a meek Co ngress d o es not perform even th e minor chec king t hat the Constitutio n does author ize it to do, if it had a ny spu nk. The highly intelligen t men wh o have made it to Cong re ss, you may be sure, a re not f o r a moment smitten with the preposterous id ea that hang in g a do zen yards of black clo t h on a p ol itic ian (or a la w school teache r), a nd g iv ing him a job for life, w ill convert him in t o a SU PE RMAN. (The State Jud ges are elected for periods of fro m eight to twe lve years; and gene ra ll y re-elected, since they nev er set up as SU PE RM EN .) Bu t som eho w a potent minority who distrust t he peop le p re va il s; so we in the great Ame rican democracy have our super-government. -6- A TESTED STATUTE ENACTED BY CONGRESS OR STATE LEGISLATURE WHEN FOUND CONSTITUTIONAL IS LAW: THAT IS, UNTIL BROKEN It not infrequently happens that an Act of Congress or a state Legislature is charged before the Courts as being unconstitutional , and therefore, null . If in its decision the Court of last resort pronounces th is law to be constitutional, then it is the law. Somewhat carelessly, this decision is itself sometimes referred to as the law in question. Then business and government, state and national, may and often do, expend millions, even billions, on faith thereof. That to the ordinary mind seems logical. The questioned law is settled. Let's go. But to th e SUPERMEN , no! Any upcoming set of SUPERMEN may, and often do, assert that their predecessors were not the SUPERMEN that thei r contemp oraries thought. Not at all . That was a big mistake. They were bush leaguers, or old fogies who did not know what was what. This is most extraordinary, since their own claim to absolu te supremacy is founded on the proposition that as a body they are SUPERMEN. Their puzzling refusal to regard each other as SUPERMEN, while demanding that in a body they be so regarded by the people, is disclosed by the fact that: \"In the brief span of sixteen years, between 1937 and 1953, this Court has reversed itself not fewer than thirty-two times on questions of constitutional law.\" Kirkpatrick in \"The Sovereign States,\" p. 270. This work is less than 300 pages, by a distinguished journalist, quite understandable by laymen. Published by Henry Regnery Co., Chicago. In every one of these instances, and many more, befo re and afte r, where their predecessors had presu ma bly settled the question by declaring that a d isputed act of Congress or Legislature is constrtutional I and therefore the law, the reversal broke that law. In some of th ese instances, that law had been settled for ma ny years, in the meantime frequ ently referre d to and a p p roved by subsequent Supreme Court decisio ns. A case of reversa l and breaking, occurring since - 7- the above record of thirty-two times in sixteen years, is one which will presently be brought under inspection. That was a decision of the Supreme Court of 1896, declaring an act of the Legislature to be constitutional law. In the interim of nearly sixty years, Supreme Courts presided over by such eminent jurists as Chief Justices White, Taft, Hughes, and Stone, had quoted that decision with approval. It was the law. THE SEGREGATION LAW That law was an act of the Legislature requiring the separation of the races in passenger transportation. In a case before the Court in 1896, it was directly charged that this state law violated the 14th Amendment in not granting equal rights to Negro travellers. It was there decided that if the accommodations were equal, the separation of the races was not prohibited by the Amendment. This established the so-called doctrine of \"Separate if equal; \" and through the years up to 1954, hundreds of millions have been expended in separate schools and other construction, and in educating Negroes in separate schools. This was the case of Plessy vs. Ferguson; 163 U.S. 537. In referring to other contemporary laws requiring separati on of the races, not only in the South, but in the North, it was stated in that decision: \"The most common instance of this is the establishment of schools for white and colored children, which has been held a valid exercise of legislative police power even by Courts where the political rights of the colo red race have been longest and most earnestly enforced . It is true that in public education, which had to be supported by local taxation, the South was fa r behind the more prosperous North, which had been enriched by the Civil War, as the South had been impoverished. Added to the ravages of wa r, was the ten years of misgovernment and looting by adventurers from the North-called carpetbaggers because when they arrived in the South thei r whole worldly possessions we re contained in a piece of luggage made of material used in ca rpet making. These were maintained in office by the votes of the recently enfranchised N egroes, and thousands of Federa l bayon ets i n each South- Sou.t b.2 _,:o_.9.r. nfEa.cdJ.o.J:i.,_ti.a..b Lw.i.tb...th.@ i c roooe,v j ern state. Just as the same self-seeking class of Northern politicians are doing today, these carpetbaggers, instead of trying to do something of economic value for the Negroes, who, when they were freed by their Northern emancipators, were turn ed out to barren fields, without economic aid from their touted benefactors-these carpetbaggers used the Negro vote__to maintain themselves in office, paying off the Negroes with a minimum of participation in the looting, and a maximum of sweet talk about sterile \" equality. \" Among the Southern people, regrettable as it must be admitted, there was then, as there is today, a relative few who profited by deserting to the enemy. These, called scalawags, aided the carpetbaggers and the Negroes; and, with their descendants, were ostracized for three generations. When these carpetbaggers were forced to flee by the bargain of the Southern Democrat leaders of Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina, with the Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes, withdrawin g the Federal troops they left the Negro in the lurch.-just as their modern white models will do when the N orthern white voters turn on th em for exciting the Negro es to ins urrectio n in those pa rts. After the flight of the carpetbaggers, both white a nd blcick had to endure another forty years of poverty-though gradually decreasing; until in 1915, the European war, demanding cotton, lumber, and other natural resources of the South, permitted a more ra pid economic move ment upward . The \u00b7 Second World War accelerated this movement. In 1961 the Un ited States Cha mber of Commerce published certain conclusions relating to that development, referring to it as \" nothing short of spectacula r.\" Und er thi s improved e conomic p rosperity, the white s and b la cks o f th e South wer e making impressive advance in rational partnership wh en under N ew York prodding, the SUPERMEN led by Ea rl Warren, the a st ute politician from Ca lifornia , broke the la w of 1896 -separate if equa l. This ma n, w ith not an hour's traini ng a s a Judge, had just been appointed b y Presi d ent Eise nhowe r to be Chief J ustice o ve r the ot her e ig ht who had been sitting a s Ju d ges for several ye a rs. This appoint- - 9- ment was not so reprehensible as might first appear, since of these eight, seven had been put on the Bench without any Judicial training. It must be admitted, in all fairness , that one of them, Judge Black, still there, had been a Justice of the Peace down in Alabama. The case before them in 1954, in which they broke the old law of separate if equal of 1896, was where some Negroes in Kansas, Delaware, South Carolina, and Virginia (t he cases consoli dated) claimed that the segregated Negro schools of these locations were not equal to the white schools, and they wanted the advantages of the white schools for their children. The Court did not agree that they were not equal, saying: \" The Negro and white schools have bee n equalized, or are being equalized, with respect to building, curricula, qualifkations and salaries of teachers, and other 'tangibl e factors '.\" That under the existing law, and its approval by intervening Supreme Court decisions, should have ended the case; the Negroes continued in t hei r equal schools, and the separate if equal doctrine again affirmed. But the SUPERMEN said \"No. \" That did not end the case, they had found something their predecessors, the White, Taft, Hughes, Stone, Vincent, Court Judges did not know. The SUPERMEN said that they had re ad in a bo qk by a fellow by the name of Guna r Myrdal, wh o lived over in Sweden on the icy Baltic Sea wh e re there are no Negroes, in which he claimed it would make the Negro children feel bad if they could not sit with white children in public schools, though their own Negro schools migh t be equal to the white schools. He was cited as \" ample autho rity; an expert, in o t her words. The Cou rt noted the names of some half dozen othe r book writers, who penned more o r Iess t he so me sen ti men ts in their books. Now something peculiar hap pened in this casesomething unheard of in judicial procedure where the opinions of persons al le ged to be expe rts a re introd uce d to aid the Courts. In such cases it is common for the a lleged \" expe rt\" to be brought into Court so that it may be determined by due e xaminati on , and cross-examination by opposing -10- counsel , whether the witness is in fact an expert whose testimony will be of value to the Court. Unhappily for all concerned, the Judges as well as others, this was not done in this case . What a field day a competent cross-examiner would have had with this Swede; and incidentally, protecti ng th e Court from embarrassment in their subsequen t exaltation of the opinions of the Swede, an d his Communist tainted associates. W ha t a joy it would have been to question this residen t of t he Arctic regions on how he became acquain ted w ith what it took to make Negroes feel bad; w hat Negroes d id he consult; was the feeling on ly mental , or also physical ; what schools of me d icine d id he graduate from ; or was he a follower of the Austrian Freud, who emphasized sex in eva lua tin g men tal operations; or the German Ad ler, w ho stresse d fear more than sex in probing the mind ; o r had he strayed off w ith the Swiss Jung, wh o had a cqu ired some twists of his own in tho ught read in g. He could have been required to state w heth e r hi s in vestigations related only to what ma de N e gro e s feel bad, or if he had included th e ye ll o w Chin e se , the brown Malays, and the red Indians. Es pec ially he could have disclosed what made white c hildren feel bad, that is if they were impprtant eno ugh to be included in his roamings; and if by making col o re d childre n fe e l good by bring ing them into as socia ti on w ith w hite childre n, it migh t make t he white c hil dr en feel bad; and w hich, if either, was the mo re important, to co ntin ue th e coloreds in fee ling bad, and the whites no t, or make the col o reds fee l good at the expe nse of the wh ites? Th e e xamina tion would have disclose d wha t we hope th e J udges w ere ignorant o f, w he n the y accepted th e Swed e, a nd his co mpanion s, as \" am ple auth ority,\" a s t hey said . These a uth o rs we re rotten with Co mm uni st associations, some with mo re th a n a d o ze n Comm u ni sti c fro nt citations. O ne must wonde r wh e th e r, w hen they approved the Swede a s \" amp le author ity, \" they had read that part of his book d ec lar ing that wha t the Founding Fat hers di d wh e n th e y confected the Consti tution \"was a lmost a plot again st the com mon people .\" An instrum e nt of g o v e rnm e nt wh ich non -Comm unist statesmen have a cclai me d fo r o ne hundred and - 11- seventy-five years. And was he \" ample authority\" when he asserted that our Constitution \"is impractical and outmoded?\" Having agreed with the Swede that it would make the Negro children feel bad not to sit with white children; it was next in order to determine whether the authors of the 14th Amendment in 1868 had intended by it to turn over to the Federal Government Public Education in the States. If that Amendment did not do this then the SUPERMEN could not seize control of these schools. They concluded, happily for their intent, that from \"exhaustive investigation \" of the times and what was then said, the evidence was \"inconclusive. \" That opened the way for them to insert in it their own views of what ought to have been, or might have been; that is to amend it to suit what they had in mind-namely, that it did take away from the States the right to manage their own schools which they had taxed themselves to support; and turned over to the SUPERMEN the power to say how they should be operated. It is poetic justice that the fraudulent adoption of that Amendment permits equally fraudulent interpretations-like the one by the SUPERMEN, the latest and most disastrous-which has resulted in the bitter interruption of good relations between the races . That adoption was achieved in an atmosphere of rancour, followed by the very same kind of deception and betrayal of the Negroes by the carpetbaggers, as is certain to result from similar conduct of the modern form of carpetbagge ry. Having now so interpreted the Amendment that they could use it as a basis for their decisipn to adopt the Swede 's cozy views to bring the white and colored children together to make the colo red children feel better; that they proceeded to do . The Court 's precise language in ag reeing with -the Swede is as fol lows: \"To separate Negro children fr om ot hers of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race, generates a feeling of in feriority as to their sta t us in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikel y to ever be undone . The Court failed to discuss whether it would \"generate a feeling of inferiori ty\" in t he hearts -12- I Can Southerners afford to be tiaht with their money in I and minds of white children, if forced to sit with Neg ro children. Apparently the Swede had 'no musing on this point. The modern mania for equal rights evidently does not include within its vague crusade, the wh ite race. To digress for a moment: Every century or so a craze unaccountably seizes on the world, as this egalitarian craze has appeared in our times. In the 13th century thousands of children were preached in Europe into a march on Jerusalem to free the Holy Sepulcher from the infidel Saracens. These who did not starve or drown before they reached sea ports, were sold into slavery? The witch craze of the Middle Ages took the lives of 300,000 men and women in Europe; not forgetting the seventy-five (75) tortured and executed in Massachusetts in the 1600s. The South Sea and John Law Investment Bubbles of the 1700s impoverished tens of thousands in France and England. One which much resembles that of today, was the St. Vitus Dance mania, in Germany, where people went prancing about the country in swarms. Due to the more rapid and far distant communications, the egalitarian mania of today extends from Washington and New York to Africa; where th e natives of Angora and Congo \"demonstrate\" their claim to equality by perpetrating crimes on hund reds of white men, women , and children priests and nuns-so bestial as to be beyond any civilized imaginati on-the women raped before the eyes o f dying men bleeding to death from unprintable mutilations-being the mi ldest. Covetous of the riches of Africa, the white nations of Noto, including our own, hastily sweep these horrors under the rug, and hypocriti cally toady to the \"ambassadors\" from that country. The brand of hypocrisy is the same; whether the white politi cian is bootlicking for the Negro vote in America; or the international \" statesmen \" are kotowing to African ambassadors-the result will be th e same-the black man will end up with his pockets picked by thes e self-seeking fakirs. Writing of the cr usades, Well s remar ks: \" From the very first Aaming enthusiasm was mixed with baser elements. \" Return ing to th e integration dec isio n; strangely - 13- enough in this case, and all the others which have followed in respect to adult Negroes, an admission is inherent in what the Court said, and accepted by all who agree with the Court, including the \" demonstrating \" Negroes, that the Negro is inferior, and the only hope for his advance is \" forced \" close association with whites. Later disclosures of his advancement in a segregated society, will not support such a contention. BARRIERS WHICH THE COURT HAD TO ELUDE But the Court was confronted wi t h several apparently insurmountable obstacles. How could this constant association, required to improve the asserted inferiority of the Negro children in this case, and subsequent adu lt cases; and to make them a ll feel better; be achieved in the face of the seg regation laws of many states, North and South? The only answer was for the SUPERMEN to b rea k the laws requiring segregation. That th e y just haul ed off and did. They sa id the WHITE, TAFT, HUGHES AND VINSON COURTS did not know what they were talking about when they approved the \" separate if equal \" doctrine. The oldti mers did not have the benefit of the Swede 's d is covery that it would make th e Negro childre n fee l bad not to sit with th e whites; and, too, th ey mig ht not have been frank and cold enoug h, to say th at the N egro is inferior, and t hat t he onl y re medy for that is constant contact w ith th e w hi te. The knoc ko ut blow came in these precise w o rd s: \" Any language in Pl essy vs. Ferg uson (t he old decision of 1896) contrary to thi s fin d ing (tha t is what the y and the Swed e had agreed upon) is rejecte d.\" It may again be re peated t ha t the man who wrote this opinio n dow ngradi ng the o ld Judges, had ne ver be fo re his appointment served as a Judge . It may be added here t hat the practice of appointing deserving political fr iends has not ceased . A little while ago t he Preside nt appoi nted Mess rs.

In these cases, o ne was t he a ssociate of Bobby Sox, Atto rne y Ge nera l, w hose ju dgmen t of wha t are the q ua li fications of a Supreme Judge, may be measured by the fact that hi s first contact with any - 14- Can Southerne rs afford to be tight w ith their money in the face of this?

At a recent meeting held in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field, Martin Luther King, Jr., collected 35 thousand dollars. This is to be used to create more racial strife. Hollywood Stars Donate to King Sammy Davis, Jr., donated 20 thousand dollars. Later that evening, a gathering of Beverly Hills citizens responded to an invitation sent out under the signature of California Governor Edmund Brown, gathered into the home of film star Burt Lancaster. .Guests of honor were Martin King and Ralph Abernathy. The guests were given the usual hearts and flowers sob story, etc. Then they came to the point. According to King and Abernathy, they have to have one thousand dollars a day to keep th ei r organization operating. \"Who wants to pay for one day's operation?\" Actor Paul N ewman and his wife, Joanne Woodward, wrote out the first check for one thousand dollars. Singer Polly Bergen with her husband, Freddie Fields, gave the next check for one thousand dollars. Anthony Franciosa, who participated in the Wrigley Field meeti ng, gave another one thousand dollars. Actor Marlon Brando, gave a check for five thousand dollars. Lloyd Bridges, TV actor .gave five hundred and Mrs. Burt Lancaster the hostess, gave one hundred. Film stars supporting the Wrigley Field meeting were, right to left, Joanne Woodward, Paul Newman, Rita Moreno and mulatto Dorothy Dandrige. Judge, and frrst appearance in any Court, was lately before the Supreme Court in an integration case-a tremendous leap even for a Kennedy. If I may interject a personal statement: I come from a football family, and we all admired the stardom in that freld of \" Whizzer\" White. But he, J no doubt, would readily admit that decking a husky youngster out in football togs does not make a football star, anymore than hanging black cloth on a politician will make a Judge. That the benign Goldberg had a special ability, too, is admitted. If these two apply themselves to their Judicial duties as faithfully as in their preceding specialties, we may wishfully expect that in time they will attain Judicial stature . In the meantime, they share the power of the other SUPERMEN. It is never enough, however, just to say that an old la w is out of date and haul off and break it. Correct Judicial procedure requires that somewhere something professed to be superior must be found to justify the law break ing. W here better t han in the old reliable 14th Amendmen t? So these modern Isaac Waltons baited their hooks w ith the Swedish bait, and went fishing in those bottomless waters. W ha t th ey caugh t is the prize frsh story of all fish sto ri es, su rpassing in th at freld of e xaggeration a ll oth ers; e xcep t onl y th a t one banishing God from p ub lic sc hool roo ms. That part o f the Amendm ent to w hich the right fish sto ry co uld a p ply reads: \"N o state shall mak e o r e nforce any law which shall deprive an y p e rson w it hin its jurisdiction of th e equal prote cti on of t he law.\" Since the sc ho ols wer e equ a l in t he instant case, nobody had been deni e d t he equal protection of the law on that score. The Sw ed e solve d that obstacle. The se parati o n w oul d make the Negroes feel bad; but not the whites. So t he \" g e ne ration \" of this feeling bad was ad o pte d a s gr a nting the Federal J udiciary a new area of control in passing on laws enacted by the a ut ho rize d la wm aking Powers. . The Integration frsh had bee n land ed . The next, it may be expected, given time fo r ne w b re e d s to hatch-will be the miscegenation shark. This addition of the state of the feelings of I I 1 -15- groups of people in considering t he application of this Amendment, has opened a vast new field, so vast indeed that the imagination cannot encompass where it will end. Crowds of adult Negroes have lately been persuaded that a large number of th e ir relations with whites, heretofore not suspected, make them fee l bad-not eating at t he same tables, swimm ing in the same pools, sitting on the sa me toilets, an d such-and they are filling the Courts with d emands, and the streets with \" demonst rations,\" t hat they be made to feel better by intimate associatio n in these matters-forced by Jud ica l d e crees, and new law enactments. The inherent admission of implied inferiority to be cured by t hese inti mate social and school ties is ignored . Also ignored in these \"demonstrations\" is that the right to \" assemble and petition fo r a red ress o f g ri e vances \" requires that such assemblies be \" peaceable.\" Are they? The unexpected catch of this feel bad fish in the school case met with shouts of joy from t he su rprised New Yorke rs, who from t he first promoted only suits claiming inequality in su ch \"ta ngible\" things as building, curricul a, teache r q ua lifications, salaries, etc. Now the objective was quic kly chan ged, a nd the New Yorkers, mainly an organ iza ti on called the Association fo r the Advance ment of Colo re d Peop le, th e well- kn o wn NAACP, sent out emissar ies, at first only to th e South, bu t later to a ll parts of the country, to te a ch th e N egro e s how to feel bad about a variety of things b esides no t mixing in schools. This went e xaspera tingl y sl o w in the begi n ning , for the inn o cent N egro e s did not kno w that th e y should f ee l b a d about the se th ings. In fact, they w e re fee lin g pretty good abo ut the advan ce me nt they were making along al l lin es in Am e rica. An example of their progress is noted even in bad old Mississip pi . Govern o r Barnett of that State, quoted in th e Jun e 3 rd iss ue of the U.S. News a nd World Report, said: \" W e ha ve N e g ro es w ho own t hei r own businesses, q ui te a number of them wealthy businessmen. There are more than 27000 N egro farmers w ho own title to land valued at appro ximately l 00 million dolla rs. More than - 16- 27% of the privately owned homes in Mississippi are owned by Negroes. We have Negro professional people, such as lawyers, doctors, teachers, dentists, social workers, nurses and many others.\" Does that sound like the grade of inferiority that the Court must cure by \"side by side \" contact with whites? Is that really poor achievement for the Neg roes in the last fifty years, when both black and white in the South got the chance to move upward economically? Propagandists refer to the \"plight\" of the American Negro. What in fact is that plight? The Census Bureau has released figures for 1960 showing that the Negro in t he United States has an annual income exceeding that of the whole people of France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Norway, Mexico, Japan-and equal to that of Great Britain, $1150.00. Only Canada, Australia, Switzerland exceeds that level. Nevertheless, the agitators made progress, at first havin g to pay some of the Negroes to feel bad. Th e NAACP with its annual ex penditure of one million dollars, according to its public audit, was t he leader. But at once, Northern politicians, sensing votes to be had, hypocritically sprang into the act. Progressively in th e last year, discovering that f eeling bad about a ll sorts of th i ngs, and shouting \"eq uality, \" could get their names in a sensationseekin g press, and t heir pictures on TV, Negroes are fillin g t he st reets with hysterical yelling mobs of men, wom en and children, disturbing the p ub lic peace, lying down in public places, throw ing pop bottl es a nd stones; their ministers maki ng political speeches disguised as prayer; in short, having the time of th eir lives in all these forms of em otional excitem ent. Bored by the mo no ton ou s routi ne of preaching the gospe l, w hite min ist ers, not indi ffe rent to th eir names and pictu res being broadc ast, can persuade t hemsel ves th at th e y are martyrs by going to jail for a fe w days. Then there are othe r white minist ers who from higher stations in their cleri ca l organizations, speak wi th pompou s authorit y, who expect the po pu lace to be impressed that th ey had just rece ived a tele- - 17- phone message from God directing them to sp ring to the front of marching, lawbreaking Negroes, demand ing \" rights\" -claim ing the constitutional right of \" peaceable assembly. \" One w onders a t t he colossal conceit of these men, who imagine, o r profess to believe, that God had withheld such instructions from their learned and spiritual prede cessors; awaiting till these chosen ones should appear. One may suspect that among these, too, \" the itch for the praise of fools, \" is not absent. Teenagers, according to a pattern emerg ing all over the world join in \" demonstra ting. \" Ma iden ladies and frustrated w ives, lying down in the streets and offices, force police to drag them off bodily; not a little t itillated by indecent e xposure. Many of these come from distant places to do their bit; ignoring the opportunities in t heir own back yards . Dickens etched this type indelibly in Bleak House a hundred years ago, describing Mrs. Jellyby who was \" involving the devotion of all my energies, \" as she said , in improving t he cond iti o n of those unfortunates a w ay off yonde r-in he r case-Darkest Africa; while he r own ch ild re n were ill clad, unwashed, ill nou rished , one of them tumbling down sta irs, so that a visito r cou ld cou nt the sounds of his bump ing head as it st ruc k e ac h step; and another \"crying loudl y, fixe d by the neck between two iron railings,\" \"wh ile Mr. G uppy, with the kindest intentions poss ible en d ea vo red to drag him back by the legs, un d e r a general impressi o n that his head was compress ib le b y t hese means .\" To all of this, Mrs. Jellyby was serenely oblivious, while she made diapers for the babies of the Congo, and \"discussed the Brotherhood of Humanity, and gave expression to some beautiful sentiments.\" Not to be left beh ind the ir b ret hre n of the So uth in all th e se \" demo nst ra tio ns,\" the Northern Neg roes are going a t it o n so large a scale as to scare t he tar ou t o f t heir po li t icians; and the se , in th eir constern ati o n t h at t hey have aroused ba rbarou s em o ti o ns which they cannot control , a re c ra w ling o n thei r knees, b e gging for restraint, lest t hese ri o to us e ruptions turn Northern white vote rs ag a inst them, a nd t hey wi ll lose their jobs. Callous to a ll else, they ne ither think nor care what all this wi ll do to t he po or Negro. It takes no majo r prophet to foresee that a check in Negro advance-18- ment will come; a setback which may last for deca des; and the innocent Negroes will see that they have been deceived by heartless self-seekers, and will turn on the leaders, both white and black, wh o have cost them so much. FEELING BAD AS AN EXCUSE FOR BREAKING THE LAW As we have seen, the NINE MEN have as a reason for breaking the old law of separate if equal, that it made Negroes feel bad. How easy it will be to extend that feeling bad defense to persons charged with crime. We have State laws prohibiting and punishing all sorts of acts deemed against public safety; acts from the disturbance of the peace to stabbing, murder and rape . What a laugh it would be for a culprit called before the Courts for breaking one of these laws to plead: \"I reject that law. To condemn me as it requires, will make me feel bad.\" And what a carnival of crime would ensue. That is exactly what has happened from the lawbreaking judgment of 1954 of these politicians sitting on a supposedly Judicial Bench. Not only have mobs gathered in streets, marching and yelling, disturb ing the public peace under the mask of rig ht of assembly, making speeches to God under the blasphemous guise of the sacred rite of prayer; throwing pop bottles and stones at the police; but felonious crimes have multipliedmurders, rapes and stabbings. Most frightening of all, murderers and rapists, tried and condemned to death before State Courts, may now be observed peering fr om beneath the black rob es of Federal Judges, where for years they have basked in security; protected by some techn icality of the law discovered by these SUPERMEN. At this writing there are twenty-six (26) tried and condemned to execution in the Angola Penitentiary of Louisiana; three whites for murder; and twe ntythree Negroes, nine for aggravated rape and fourteen for murder. Four of the Negroes sentenced in 1957; 1 i.n 1958; 1 in 1959; 1 in 1960; 8 in 1961 a nd 2 in 1962. Two of the Negro rapists in Ango la were co ndemned for raping white women in the state capita l a t Baton Rouge. Their exemption from execution has encouraged the nephew of one of them to - 19- another rape of a white woman in that city, taking place July 6th , 1963. Police kno w that the rape of white women by Negroes has multiplied since 1954; not more than one out of six or seven being brought into the Court, the victims not wanting their shame publicized. Within the last week a Negro has been identified by his victims, and charged with attempted rape of one nun and the beating of another, within their convent walls; in New Orleans. How many in all Southern States? In Washington, where it was ex pected that the concentrated glare on integration would disclose everybody made happy, the contrary is proven by a record of crime since 1954, exceeding that of any city of comparable size in the country. Washington, where a white American soldier may be killed on the streets, scarcely noticed , while on the same day, trumpets blare for a murdered Negro buried in Arlington. Washington, where white women may be assaulted by a Negro in a chu rch in sight of the Capitol, and in their homes, while their men only whimper, lest they lose votes , or their jobs. Did I say men? Based on his personal observa ti ons, no doubt the Negro Congressman Adam Cla yton Powell bragged for the nation to read : \"We have the white man on the run. After him, men; sic 'em.\" Some Congressm en, unnamed, have been quoted as saying \" We shoul d take a recess.\" Take a powder, they mean. It is impossible to believe that even Washing ton would inflict that disgrace on the American people i n the face of approaching Negro thousands. Let them take heart. We are informed that right up front, there will be some of Hollywood's quickdraw heroes to keep order; along with some nice white gentlemen in clerical garb sidling up to the camera boys. What would the Father of his country say, if he could see this city named for him , become a jungle; a monument to the folly of the SUPERMEN? It is unbelievable, that when a young Negro was condemned to execution for raping and murdering an elderly white woman in Washington , and released by the Supreme Court; Mallory vs. U.S. 354 p. 441 in 1957,-one of the Judges is re-ported to have remarked afterward , \"After all he was bu t -20- a lad.\" The \" lad \" was reported to have promptly committed another offense in Pennsylvania, and kille d by Police. The technicality on which this convicted murderer and rapist was freed to commit another crime, is simply too i ncredible to put down if it were not verifiable by reading the decision. The question of guilt was of no concern. He was released because, for some reason he was committed to prison, and not questioned until seven hours had passed . It is not now in the recollection of th e writer whether the Court fixed a time with in whi ch the questioning must begin; say one hour, ten minutes, and twenty-five seconds, or possibly ten seconds longe r. But it is a fact that law enforcement officers the nation over are dismayed lest th is ridiculous and indefensible holding of the Court, results iri freeing many vicious criminals. Who is to blame for setting the example of lawbreaking? On whose shoulders should horrid responsibility settle for these crimes? THE ADV AN CEMENT OF THE NEGRO OBSTRUCTED BY THESE PAID AGITATORS More th an fifty years ago, June 4th, 1910, in the Outlook magazine, Theodore Roosevelt quoted with approval the state ment of Sir Henry R. Johnson: \"That no wh ere else in the world, certainly not in Africa, has the Negro been given such a chance of mental and physical development as in the United States. Intellectually he has attained his highest degree of advancement as y et in the United States. Pol itically he is freer there; socially he is happier than in any other part of the world. \" The ex-President added: \" The boo k is of great interest and permanent value; and should be in the library of every American who cares to devote a little thought to one of the largest of the problems of today. \" Quoted from Book Review, printed in the words of Theodore Rooseve lt, Vol. XI I, pp. 221 -2. This progress had continued up to 1954. Fine publ ic schools built solely for Negro children, ta ught by competent teachers of the ir own race who best understand them, have multiplied a ll over the South. This day go into hundreds of communi ties and one will see that the newest and most -21- modern schools and campuses a re for the Negroes, fact concealed f rom the Northern people. The greatest Negro Un iversity in America, is in Lou isiana-five miles from the State Capitol, beautiful ly located on the Father of Waters. This Negro Uni versity has all the trimmings that the white State Un iversity has; located two miles fr om the State Capitol. (Maybe that is an offense, being th ree miles further from the State Capitol than the wh ite). It has full academic courses, granting d egrees at a regular graduating exercise (upwards of 500 in June 1963); homecomings, fraternities a nd sororities, football and other sports, bands a nd cheerleaders. There is nothing collegiate, socia l, and cultural, on the white campus not also see n on the Negro campus. Negro graduates at other Negro colleges in the state total 401 , not including the p rivately endowed Dillard in New Orleans, a large and well -ma naged Ne gro University w hose attenda nce and g ra d uate level is not at the moment availab le to the write r. a In the school year just closing there were 286,605 Negro students in 164 Negro High Schools, with 8,876 graduates in Louisiana, w ith a total population in 1963, e sti mate d as 3,300,000less than the popu lation of Ch ica g o . It w o uld be interesting to compare these figu res with those in Chicago. In the smaller sta te of Mississ ippi, near the po pulation of Philadelphia, to q uote G o vernor Barnett again, there a re \" mo re than 4 00 0 Negro students in State supported colleges; 7,382 Negro school teachers in the Negro public schools with maste rs' degrees and abo ve; an d o f 190 mi llio n d o llars spe nt on public school s since 1953,\" in th is by no me ans rich State , \" 63 % went for N egro pub lic school faciliti es. 1' There is much more in the Governor's inte rvi e w by U.S. N ews and Wor ld Repo rt that wo uld show misi nformed N ortherners that the Ne gro is b etter o ff in Miss issi ppi , than in the g reat Northern cities. But p rese nti ng a fair picture o f the co ndition of the N egro in Mississippi, o r any o the r Southe rn state, to the N orthern people cannot be expected so long as the egalitarian mania persists. The re is some sense in the Negro making a plea for a job. He cannot stay on relief forever; be- 22- sides most of them have the pride of preferring to wo rk to mooching on the taxpayers; but the cry of lac k of employment is something recently thought up by those who profit by agitation . Heretofore those who presumed to speak for them; those whose real object is to cause racial division and clash; those who were stirring to howling complaints, sit-ins, lie-ins and butt-ins, were eloquent with phrases as meaningless as they are sonorous - \" human dignity, \" \"plight of the Negro, \" \" social rev olution .\" A favorite is \"second-class citizenship,\" used in a sense which disregards good conduct as the indispensable duty of \" citizenship. \" A la ter one is produced by Bobby Sox, - \" Human rig hts are superior to States ' Rights. \" Whatever mea ning Bobby attaches to this bombast, it is certain that for him States ' Rights do not exist. Anoth er is in constan t use , - \" discr iminate. \" Would the se good w hite men of the clerical cloth, who are op pose d to \" d iscrimination \" refuse a daughter 's han d to one of the lusty young Negro \"demonstrators?\" Maybe these particular show offs would not. As k them . IMPENDING DESTRUCTI ON Is th e ad vancement of the Negro made in the United States in the last hundred years, and especia lly in t he Sou t h in t he last fifty years, to be ign ored , obstructed , poss ibly destroyed by rs , finan c ial p rofite ers, and gullible dogooders? When the uns uspe cti ng Negro is being aroused to heights of insurrecti o n p a ssio n, w hite men and women of the So uth, of g ood w ill and compassion -and these are, or were, in t he vast majori tya re reluctantly compelled in se lf d e fense to rem ind a ll con cerned, that in his o w n country of Africa he ma de no advance whatever in the 6000 years that the wh ite man wa s p a infully creating the civilizati on of which now in Ame ric a n t he tr ansplanted Negro has the advanta g e. Is it unkind to s uggest to Ma rti n King , Wil kins, et al , that if their an c esto rs ha d re main e d in Africa; what with disease, tr iba l w a rs, a nd canniba lism, they might not have survived to beco me sires of these descendants now demandi ng so fro m the white man's civi lization in Ameri ca ? In those 6000 years that the N e gro achi eved -23- nothing in his own country of a hundred millionin Egypt, next door to him, her engineers constructed the Great Pyramid 5000 years ago, an amazing feat still puzzling to moderns. Separated from Caucasians of the West by the vast length and height of the Himalayas, the Yellow Chinese more than 2000 years ago built the Great Wal l 1400 miles long, to protect them from the Mongolian Hordes-the Empire then more than l 000 years old, with great cities, and art and literature . The Brown Japanese boast of a culture 2000 years old when Christ was born. And when Columbus crossed the sea, he found 3000 miles from Western civilization, the rich culture of the Red man, which Cortez and Pizarro pillaged in the Halls of Montezuma and Golden Palaces of the Incas. In referring to the kindly feeling existing between the races in the South before the Supreme Court caught its integration fish, I beg to interject a personal note. I was born and reared on a cotton plantation in North Louisiana; grew up with Negro playmates; know their good qualities whe n not deceived and misled; and I am saddened whe n I perceive what is in store for them under a leadership so fraudulent as to be criminal. One of my playmates, bedridden in his home in his last yea rs, I never failed to visit when frequentl y visiting his section of the State. We would spend a hap py hour recalling incidents of our boyhood an d early manhood. I can assure our Northern fello w citizens, that there were many thousands of suc h r elationships between Negroes and wh ites of the South. So far as the South is concerned t he r e is mo re seeming than fact in all this Negro hu r ra h. The Negro is by no means the fool t hat t he fr o nt runners of his race are making h i m ou t to b e. I haven 't the least doubt that the majo r ity of them within their own t houghts , w ish t hese disturbe r s would subside. But as is frequen t ly t he ca se w ith the whites, these remain quiet lest t hey be cen sured by the more voca l, o r ev en injured. BREAKING ONE LAW CALLED FOR THE BREAKING OF ANOTHER The poli t ici ans si tti ng o n t he Supreme Benc h in 1954 did not sto p wit h b r eaking the old la w of 1896. Having decid ed what will ma ke the Negro - 24- fee l bad, they went on to the next step, and determined that they must do someth ing to make him fee l good. But here they were confronted with another Const itutiona l obstacle; t he specific declaration in the very same 14 th Amendment (Sec. 5) that only \" Congress shall have t he power, by appropria te leg islation, to enforce the p rovisions of this Article.\" But w ha t if Con g ress did not ag ree with w hat the SUPERMEN professed to have discovered in this Arti cl e , since it w as not so written; and what if Co ngress di d no t ta ke an y stoc k in what the Swede & Co. said about it m a king the Negroes feel b ad if t he y cou ld not be righ t there by the side of th e whiteman in w hatever he was doingleaving th e p resu mption t hat he had no ideas, likings, busine ss, o r ch o ices of h is o w n. There are in fact many Congress men , es peci al ly those from the Sou th , who do no t believe an y such th ing . They have kn o wn and lived beside th e N e groes al l their lives, an d th ey are qu ite positively certain tha t the So ut he rn N egro w o uld prefe r to ha ve his own sc hools and teac hers, a nd run his own affa irs; a nd that all the co m motion whippe d up by N ew Yo rk, e t a l. is just so m uch profitable po p p yc ock. But since t he SU PERME N ha d gotte n away with it before , t hey decided to go it al o ne in this case. The judgmen t th e y issued req ui red th e Dist rict Judges: \" To ta ke s uc h pro ceed ing s, a nd enter such o rders and decrees, a s are necessary and proper to admit to p ub lic schools on a ra cia lly no nd isc riminatory ba si s with a ll d e li b e rate spe ed,\" the parti e s to the case. This has b een expa nd e d so, a s a matte r of cou rse the Federal Judges, and not Cong ress, are \"enfor~ing the provisions\" of th e 14th Am e ndm e nt. It will be note d that in the accompa nying specific instructions to the District J udges, the SUP ERM EN delegate to these Judges the rig hts a nd d utieswhich they had themse lves us u rped-to bre a k State laws or local ordinances, and enact others to take their places. These are the precise instructio ns given to the Di strict Judges: \" Full implementation of these co nstit uti onal -25- principles (meaning those which they had inserted in the Amendment) may require solution of local school problems .. to that end Courts may consider problems relating to administration, arising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and regulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems.\" \u00b7 Even King Jehosaphat did not assign such whopping jobs to his Judges. Presumably these District Judges know all the multiplied aspects of public school management required of a competent Superintendent of Public Education who has learned them by many years of observation and practice; or they must instantly learn them-in what school not stated. It is a marvel that more of them do not reluctantly assume these added executive duties; but maybe very many are reluctant but are scared of the SUPERMEN - except some who may be eager for earned promotion; such as ou r New Orleans District Judge Skelly Wright, whose quick promotion is expected to entice others to follow his example. That the SUPERMEN quite well understood that they were usurping the exclusive authority of Congress, is perceived in their evasion of the wo rd \"enforce\" when they instructed the District Judges to \"i mplement\" their judgment . In their embarrassment, they tried, not too cleve rly, to escape from the specific constitutional limitation , by adopting a word to take its place. They have said repeatedly that their decisions shall be \"implemented\" (meaning \" enforced\") by th e directions they gave to the lower Judges. The word implement as a verb is not found in any legal dictionary, the old reliable Bouvier, Ballantine, o r the 1951 edition of Black. The lowe r Judges have u nderstoo d their superiors quite well; and ha ve issued orders and decrees by the doze ns to \"enforce\" the provisions of the 14th Amendment, the exclusive right of Congress so to do be damned . Th e Courts have also adopted another word to se rve their purposes- - 26- \u00b7 desegregate \" which was not in any dictionary, academic or legal, until it was inserted in Webster's International Dictionary in 1959. So we find the Court in the business of supplementing the English language to convey its meaning in the assault on the Constitution. It will not be long before the Federal Judiciary will ease into the use of the word \" integrate, \" as a substitute for \" desegregate. \" Then it will have gone the whole hog. The thin mask will be completely off. There will be no need for Congress to exercise its specifkally granted and ex clusive power to \" enforce\" integration of the races in all cases where the lack thereof is alleged to make the Negro feel bad. The obliging Federal Judiciary will do it. STILL MORE LAWBREAKING AND LAWMAKING It soon becomes obvious that in lawbreaking by on a ll powerful governmental body like the SUPERM EN , some very serious and dangerous lawmaking must follo w in its wake to carry out their enact ments . The Court has ordered integration of the races w herever demanded by NAACP; and masks off, proposes to enforce their commands by expanding the rule of Contempt of Court to punish noncomplian ce. The world o ver when the lawmaking power enacts a statute where a compl ia nce is required or a violati on punished, the same law fixes a penalty for disobedience. The limitation of punishment is clearly stated, generally in such terms as \" fined not more than \" so many dollars, or \"imprisoned not exceeding \" a term stated. Again the world ove r, there the lawmaker stops. It is left to another and not self-interested authority to hear and condemn breaches, and assess punishment with the stated limits. There was a time three hundred years ago when the Divine Right Kings claimed the right, (called Prerogatives) to make laws, fix punishment for noncomp liance, try culprits, and clap them in jail; all witho ut the intervention of Parliament. Those Divine Right cl a ims petered out when one was exiled, and a nother had his head chopped off. A revival of that right is now claimed , or at least apparently threatened by Federal Judges. - 27 - Under the guise of well-known and admitted ri gh t to maintain decorum in their court rooms, to require witnesses to answer proper questions, and enforce a well-known general line of Cou rt orde rs, noncompliance with the ir integration laws, orders, and decrees is now threatened with unlim ited Anes or incarceration in ja i l, without the right, as ol d as Magna Carta of 1215, to a trial by jury of th eir peers . The authority for this taking away the p ro p erty and liberty of American citizens, specifical ly prohibited by Articles of the Constitution (appended), they will call Contempt of Court. In tha t procedure, the lawmaker, the prosecu t or, the Judge, and the executioner will al f be centered in one person,-contrary, it is repealed, to a uni versally admitted principl e, and specificall y prohibi ted by the Constitution. Some imaginati ve journalists have speculated o n the infliction of fines as much as one hun dred thousand dollars, and imprisonment up to ten years. It is remarkable that in mentioning t hese possibilities, these generally well-informed men , di d not express the slightest dismay. That is ho w fa r we have gone in our indifference t o t he warning of the Harvard Professor that, \" Neve r in recorded history has the individu a l been i n g r ea ter d a nger from government than no w .\" It may take the infliction of such puni shm ent to awaken co.mplacen t Ame ri cans t o t hei r peri l, lest their liberties so valian tl y a nd blood ily fo ught fo r by their ancestors, w i ll fa de a way unde r th e tyrannical rule of uncontrolle d SUPER M EN. \" Power corrupts; abso lute po we r corrupts absolutely.\" When the sage, Benja min Franklin, in his o ld age, was aske d b y a la dy, after the adopt io n o f th e Constitution in 1787, in th e con fecti o n of wh ich he too k an active part, \" W hat kind of g o ve rnm ent have we no w, M r.

OBEY THE LAWS? LET WASHINGTON SET THE EXAMPLE. -29- l APPENDIX PERTINENT PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION Article Ill Section I. The Judicia l power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crime shall have been; (Note: \"The Courts derive their powers from the grant of the people made by the Constitution and they are all to be found in the written law, and not elsewhere. \" Wheaton vs. Peters, 591, 658; Bucher vs. Cheshire, 125 U.S. 555. \" It must therefore find its power to punish the crime in laws of Congress passed in pursuance of the Constitution, defining the offenses and prescribing what courts shall ha ve jurisdiction over them. No act can be a crime against the United States which is not made so or recogni zed as such by federal constitution, law, or treaty.\u00b7\u00b7 U.S. vs. Hudson; 7 Cranch, p . 32; Cool ey Principles of Constitutional Law, p. 138. AMENDMENT V No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment of a grand jury . .. nor shall any person be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law ...

AMENDMENT XIV. \"Section 1 . ... shall make or enforce any law which . .. shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" (Note: \"The guarantee of equa l to be un- -30- ( derstood, however, that every person in the land shall possess precisely the same rights and privileges as every other person. Ths amendment contemplates classes of persons, and the protection given by the law is to be deemed equal, if all persons in the same class are treated alike under like circumstances and conditions both as to privileges conferred and liabilities imposed.\" Cooley, p. 237. Citing authorities. \"Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\" With reference to enforcement, it may be said that no one will deny that when an authority is granted in the Constitution, it is exclusive, unless othe\"rwise stated. The application of the authority granted to the Congress here to enforce the provisions of the article, by appropriate legislation, denies to the Supreme Court the right to \"enforce its provisions\" by the enactment of any law by it; or to enforce its provisions by the formulation of \"orders and decrees\" which amount to enforcement. That is to say, that when Congress has enacted appropriate legislation to prohibit states from denying equal protection of the laws in any instance-in the racial cases here, the judiciary can a scertain when such legislation is violated, and apply the remedies se t out by t he Congress. W hat the Court has done in the school case, for instance, is this in effect: It has inserted in the Amendment substantially these words: \"The amendment contemplates Federal control of public education in the States. Therefore whe n a State enacts legi slation providi ng se parate schools for the races, tha t leg islation is prohibited as d e nying equal protection to t he Negro race .\" Having fo und, in effect, that la nguag e in th e Ame ndment, as o ne of its provisions, the next question should be whethe r Congress has e na cted appro priate legislation to prohibit state la ws violating the provision . If Congress did not know that such legislation by the States is prohibited by the Amendmen t; or if Congress shoald recogni ze this Judicial Amendment, but has not e nacted a ny legislation to e nforce the p roh ibition; does t hat g ive the rig ht to the judiciary to \"enforce\" it. The Supreme Court has answered that q uestion by ag a in inserti ng in the ame ndment, in effect, these words: \"But if Cong ress does not see ftt to e nforce the prohibition by a p propriate legislation, t he Supreme Court ma y do so by its own decision; \" , and may \"imple ment\" the ir decision by such \"orders and decrees\" as ma y be necessary to take th e place of t he missing act o r a cts of Congress, and \"may provide un limited punishment fo r no ncompliance with its decrees.\" In elud ing t he exclusive rig ht of Co ngress to \" e nforce the p rovisions\" of the Article, by using the word \"i mplementa ti o n,\" and other expressions, we observe a ll the a rts of a slick politician in writing this decision . The wonde r is tha t the oth e rs who had been on the Bench for some years, co uld be persuaded to fo llow him a long these twisting tra ils. - 31- Order this pamphlet from R.

Surely, the question is rather in what respects ra cial discrimination is properly the is concern of Congress under the Constitution. The concerns and powers r of Congress, moreover, are cumulative, not alternative. A deter mined Congress could strike at important segments of racial \u00b7discrimination with \u00b7the far reaches of its defeni,e powers (for _ example, discrimination which hame pers the defense \u00b7effor t ) ; its for eign affairs power (for example, .discrimr ination which affects our foreign reO la.tions, at least discrimination s against diplomats) ; its spending d power (fo r example, discriminat ion a by bodies or agencies which receive Federal funds) . There are also the powers of Congress t hat have been discussed. Of course, Congress can outlaw discrimination in interstate commerce, or which affects interstate com\u00b7 merce. Publlo- Authority's Complicity Congress can, in addition, pursuant to the 14th Amendment, strike a t discrimination for which the state is r esponsible, and at the widespread complicity of public authority in private discrim ination. It may be possible to \u00b7 draft a provision outlawing discrimination for which the state is reiiponsible, perhaps even leavi~g It t o t he courts to determine later where the 8t ate may properly be 1 held responsible. Congress could also forbid state and local officials to r equire, proe mote, encourage or enforce racial discrimination. In r egard to places of public accommodation, I am confident that s the Supreme Court would uphold an act of Congress which forbids local B judges and local police t o enforce ' discrimination , for example, through s trespass prosecut ions. These prohibi- tions on the acts of local cials could be enf orced by criminal pens alty, by injunction, by suits for monf etary damages. It is not either one power of Congress or another, nor a matter of in- canting several. The various powers of Congress can support various prof visions adding up to an effective civil rights act.

Physicist Backs Test Ban Selove Declares Agreement l!; in Interests of Both Sides The write1\u00b7 o/ the following ts professor of physics at the University of P ennsylv an1ia. TO TH!l EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As the test ban negotiations move ahead beyond initial agreement, it is strange to see the reluctance, if not opposition, to make such an agreement shown by some members of this Government. It is encouraging that a large number of Senators have joined in the remarkable Hpmphrey-Dodd resolution in support of an airspace-water test ban, and encoura;;;ing also that so highly informed and influential a Representative as Chet Holifield has indicated his feeling that such a ban should receive support. Why is there any question as to whether such a ban is in the interests of the Unitea ptates? I believe U1e opposition is due prjmarily t o two mistaken attitudes. First, there are those who believe that.this country can better achieve security by further nuclear weapons development rather than bY \"trusting\" the Soviet Union to adhere to the airspace-water ban. '!'his is a gross mistake. For one thing, no \"trust\" is necessary. More important, no foreseeable development ( at least in the next decade, as far as can now be seen) will change the ability of each of the two nuclear giants to utterly devastate each other. Orbiting Bombs Indeed, if nuclear tests of large weapons continue we would probHerman Kahn's ably move closer \"doomsday\" mac)lines - perhaps with each side w 0 rl<ing toward orbiting bomb1 of trLlndreds of megatons. A very few such bombs from continuous orbit could be used to set fire \\ o the entire eastern coast of this country. we have the judgment of Secretary McNamara that no really effective anti-missile defense is visible, and we can expect that prospect ~o become stronger with the passage o! time. The second mistal<e made by opponents of a test bll-n has to do with simple distrust of the other side. The question posed is essentially the following ( and Could be used by Soviet opponents of 9 test ban as well as by our own ) : Why should the \"other\" side want !I test ban unless it is to t heir advaJltage, and consequently, i t is ini_p)jed, t o our own disadvantage ? TM mistake h~re is to think that a test ban can b~ or must be t o t he to life a.nd his honor to be used to the best moral interests of his country. Your view [editorial J uly 17] would deny. him any moral dignity of his own. Segregation is morally wrong, and any citizen, military or otherwise, has the right and the moral obligation to make known, even by demonstrating, his views in reference to it. If the Brown Shirts aJld the German regular army 8Jld the German citizens had taken to demonstrations, rather than bowed to accepted immoral tradition, perhaps the cost to European Jewry would not have been so devastating. Historical precedent and honored tradition have their place in society, but they should not be above the individual's right publicly to make known his own moral standards. I wou\"ttl have thought The New York Times would have been the first to defend such rights and obligations. JOSEPH COLLINS. Rhinebeck, N. Y.,\" July 18, 1963. Taxing Foreign Securities Administration Proposal Declared No Cure for Present Gold Outflow To THE Eorron OF THE N EW Y ORK Tl.MES: The Times is to be congratulated for having immediately pointed out [editorial July 19] the dangers of the Atlministration's proposed tax on American purchase of foreign securities. These dangers have not been eliminated by its more recent proposal to exempt new Canadian issues. Indeed, the Canadian exernp. tion dramatizes how completely arbitrary this kind of currency regu. lation and manipulation is sure to be. When the niceties a.re stripPed away, the proposed tax is a forrn of exchange control, defined as an effort by Government to limit and to restrict the use of its own currency. Such restriction on foreign trans. actions was widely practiced by Nazi Germany and is the stocl< in trade of all totalitarian regimes. It is the entering wedge for other types of control over the domestic economy. The President wants the taJC in order to stanch the outward flow of American investment doilars which is augmenting the deficit in our balance of payments. But the proximate cause of this outflo\\1/ is that United States interest rat es are lower than in many other countries, which both encourages United Stflles citizens to buy foreign securities !Ul.d likewise encourages foreign cotn. panies to float t heir securities i n our markets on easy terms. It 1s notable and regrettable that the P r.esi~ent ~as no Intention of ,.:/{~; \u00b7, Founding Fathers' Intent Citing 18th Century Leaders in Support of Religion Disputed The w riter of the following letter is M inist er of Edu cation for the First Chttrch in B oston, Unitarian. TO THE E DITOR OF THE N~ Y ORK T IMES: The current debate on your editorial page about the intentions of th~ Founding Fathers in drafting, enacting and ratifying the \"establishment of religion\" clause of the First Amendment discloses more about the condition of American religion th8Jl it does about the historical problem of whether the clause was intended to apply to the establishment of a national religion based upon an \"es- \u00b7 sential consensus respecting God, i man and the moral law.\" Especially revealing is the zeal with which Christian leaders, lay and clerical, have clasped the Founding Fathers to t heir bosoms as upholders of this \"essential consensus.\" No matter how much we should like to re-create our Revolutionary saints in our own image, historical fa cts cannot be ignored without endangering both our honesty and our sense of history's vicissitudes. Recent research indicates that John Adams, Jefferson, Washington, Paine, Madison and F ranklin were deists. While they differed on particular points of doctrin~, they agreed that, in Franklin's words, \"there is one Godi who made all things,\" and that \"the most a cceptable service of God is doing good to man.\" In short, the religion of the most eminent Founding Fat hers was based largely on Genesis i, 2 and Matthew iv, 7. The deist position is clearly embodied in Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, where he r efers to \"the laws of nature and of nature's god.\" Deist Theology A comparison of the essentials of deist t heology and the docfrines of Judaism and Christianity shows that t he West's two great religions have properly regarded deism as their enemy. For, as expounded by most of its followers, deism denies the possibility of a covenant a nd of a savior. I can but marvel, therefort a t the Industry of Chr istian leaders in finding champions in the Founding F athers and in treating their religious testimonies as if anchored in the bedrock of theological orthodoxy. If we iu\u00b7e to believe that America's \u00b7essential consensus is embodied in the ideas of Jefferson and his friends, we must admit this nation ls not and never has been rooted in the J 11claeo-Chri\u00b7tian -:-break the \"white\" nuclear monopoly.

If we \u00b7did so, the pur.

Such a voice was heard when Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. of Atlanta testified before the Senate Commerce Committee in support of President Kennedy's bill to prohibit racial discrimination in stores, restaurants and other public accommodations. On the basis of the very substantial accomp lishments that his city of a half-million, the largest in the Southeast, has made in desegregating publicly owned and privately owned facili ties, he migh t have come as a champion of \"states' rights\" and of the ability of localities to banish discrimination without F ederal law. Certainly, he would h ave had much more warrant to es{?ouse that view than the Barretts, the Wallaces and the other arch-segregationists who raise the specter of F ederal \"usurpation\" as a device for keeping Southern Negroes in subjection. But Mr. Allen was not in Washington to boast. He was there to warn that even in cities like Atlanta the progress that had been made might be wiped out if Congress turned its back on the Kennedy \u00b7 proposal and th us gave implied en. dorsement to the concept that private businesses were free to discriminate. He left behind this charge to finish t he job started with the Emancipation Proclamation a century ag : \"Now the eliminat ion of segregation , which is slavery's s tepchild, is a challenge to all of us t o make every American free in fact as well as in theory - and again to establish our n ation as t he true champion of the fr ee world. \" The Fiddlers The Jong-legg ed, r a sp-win ged insects now come Jpto their own, and we won't hear the last of them till hard frost a rrives. They are t he leaping fiddlers, the grasshopl?ers, the crickets and the katydids. Grasshoppers are spoken of in the Bible as \" locusts,\" and their hordes have contributed in many lands, including our own West, to the l?ng history of insect devastation an d human famme. Walk through any meadow now, or a lo ng ~ny weedy roadside, and you will see t h em leapm.g ahead of yo u, hear t he rasping rattle of their harsh wings in brief flight. But they do little real fiddl ing. The fidd lers now are t.}le crickets. . Listen on any hot afternoon or warm evenmg, particularly in the country, and you will hear the crickets even though you seldom see them. In the afternoon you will hear the black field crickets, chirping as we say, and often into the warm evening. But in the evening, from dusk on through the warm night, the more insistent sound will be the trilling of the pale green tree crickets. Individually the tree cricket's trill is not so loud, but because all those in the neighborhood synchronize their trills the sound can be a s insistent as were the calls of the spring peepers back in April. The loudest fiddlers of all are the katydids, which look like green, hunch-backed grasshop\u00b7 pers. Night after night they rasp wing on wing and make that monotonous call, shrill and seem\u00b7 ingly endless. But the katydids won't be heard for another two weeks or so.

The fact is that a test ban is in the interests of both sides.

A t est ban will probably contrib\u00b7 ute to the understanding of that fact by both Governments and both peoples. It could indeed be a major step forward toward sanity.

I warned of \"a rising tide of discontent tha t threa tens th e publ_ic safety\" in many parts of the country. I emphasized that \"the events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cri es for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them. \" \"It is a time to act,\" I said, \"in the Congress, in State and local legislative bodies and, above all, in all of our daily lives.\" \u00b7 In t he days that have followed, the freclictions of increased violence have been tragically borne out. The ' fires of frustration and discord\" have burned hotter than ever. 85011- 6 3 -1 _,. . . . -ill,JGHTS . At the same in:ie, the response of the Am erican people to this appeal to their principles and obligations has been Teassuring. Private progress__:_by merchants and unions and local organizations-has been marked, if not uniform, in many areas. Many doors long closed to Negroes, North and South, have been opened. Local biracial committees, under private and public sponsorship, have mushroomed. The ma.yors of our major cities, whom I earlier addressed, have pledged renewed ac tion. But persisting inequalities and tensions make it clear that Federal action must lead the way, providing both the N ation's standard and a nationwide solution. In short, the tin1e has come for the Congress of the United States to join with the executive and judicial branches in making it clear to all that r ace has no place in American life or law. On F ebruary 28, I sent to the Congress a message urging the cnnc trn ent this year of three important pieces of civil rights legislat ion: 1. Voting.-Legislation to assure the availability to all of a b as ic and powerful right-the right to vote in a free American electionby providing for the appointment of temporary Federal v otii:w referees while votino- suits are proceeding in areas of demonstrated need; by giving such suits preferential and expedited treatment in the Federal comts; by prohibiting in Federal elections the application of differ ent tests and standards to different voter applicants; and by providing that, in voting suits pertaining to such elections, the completion of the si.-.::th grade by any applicant creates a presumption that he is literate. Armed with the full and equal right to vote, our Negro citizens can help win other rights through political channels not now open to them in many areas. 2. 'Civil Rights Oommission.-Legislation to renew and expand the authority of the Commission on Civil Ri~hts, enablin~ it to serve as a national civil rights clearinghouse offenng informat10n, advice, and technical assistance to any public or private agency that so requests. 3. School desegregation.-Legislation to provide Federnl technical and financial assistance to aid school districts in the process of desegregation in compliance with the Constitution. Other measures introduced in the Coniress have nlso received the support of this ad.ministration, including tnose aim.eel at assuring equal employment opportunity. Although these r ecommendations were transmitted to the Congress some time ago, neither House has yet had an opportunity to vote on any of these essential meas m es. The Negro's drive for justice, however, has not stood still-nor will it, it is now clear, until full equali ty is achieved. The growing and understandable dissatisfaction of Negro citizens with the presen t pace of desegregation, and their increased determination to secme for themselves the equality of opportunity and treatment to which they are rightfully entitled, have underscor ed what should already have \u00b7been clear : the necessity of the Congress enacting this year-not only the measures aJrnady proposed-but also additional legislation providing legal remedies for the denial of certain individual rights. The venerable code of equity law commands \"for every wrong, a remedy.\" But in too many communities, in too many parts of t he country, wrongs are inflicted on Negro citizens for which no effective r emedy at law is clearly and readily available. State and local laws may even affirmatively seek to den y th e rights to which these citizens I 3 CIVIL RIGHTS are fairly entitled-and this cn,n result only in a decreased respect for the law and increased violations of the law. In the continued absence of congressional action, too many State and local officials as well as businessmen will remain unwilling to accord these rights to all citizens. Some local courts and local merchants may well claim to be uncertain of the law, while those merchants who do recognize the justice of the Negro's request (and I believe these constitute the great majority of merchants, North and South) will be fearful of being the first to move, in the face of official, customer, employee, or competitive pressures. Negroes, consequently, can be expected to continue increasi ngly to seek the vindication of these rights tlu-ough organized direct action, with all its potentially explosive consequences, such as we have seen in Birmingham, in Philadelphia, in Jackson, in Boston, in Cambridge, Md., and in mn,ny other parts of the country. In short, the result of continued Federal legislative inaction will be continued, if not increased, racial strife-causing the leadership ou both sides to pass from the hands of reasonable and responsible men to the purveyors of hate and violence, endangering domestic tranquillity, r et::i.rding our Nation's economic and social progress and weitkening the r espect with which the rest of the world regards us. No -American, I feel sure, would prefer this course of tension, disorder, and diYision- ancl the great majorit~, of our citizens simply cannot accept it. For these reasons, I am proposing that the Congress stay in session this year until it has enacted-preferably as a single omnibus billthe most responsible, reasonable, and urgently needed solutions to this problem, solutions which should be acceptable to all fair-minded men. This bill would be known as the Civil Rights Act of 1963, and would include-in addition to the aforementioned provisions on voting rights and the Civil Rights Commission-additional titles on public accommodations, employment, federally assisted programs, a Community R elations Service, and education, with the latter including my previous recommendation on this subject. In addition, I am requesting certain legislative and budget amendments designed to improve the trainin&', skills, and economic opportunities of the economically distressed. and discontented, white and Negro alike. Certain executive actions are also reviewed here; but legislative action is imperative. \u00b7\u00b7 J. E QUAL A cco MMODATIONS 11- PunLrc FA CILITIES Events of r ecent weeks have again underlined how deeply om Negro citizens r esent the injustice of being arbitrarily denied equa.l access to those facilities and accommodations which are otherwise open to the general public. That is a daily insult which has no place in a country proud of its heritage- the heritage of the melt,ing pot, of equal rights, of one nation and one people. N o one has been barred on account of bis race from fighting or dying for America-there are no \"white\" or \"colored\" signs on the foxholes or graveyards of battle. Smely, in 1963, JOO years after emancipation, it should not be necessary for any American citizen to demonstrate in the streets for the opportunity to stop at a hotel, or to eat at a lunch counter in the very department store in which he is shopping, or to enter a motion picture 4 CIVIL RIGHTS h~use, on th\u00b7e s111ne terms as any other customer. As I stated in my message to the Congress of February 28, \"no action is more contrary to the spirit of our democracy and Cons titution-or more rightfully resented by a Negro citizen who seeks only equal treatmen.t-than the barring of that citizen from restaurants, hotels, theaters, recreational areas, and other public accommodations and facilities.\" The U.S. Government has taken action through the courts and by other means to protect those who are peacefully demonstrating t o obtain access to these public facilities ; and it has taken action to bring an end to discrimination in rail, bus, and airline terminals, to open up restaurants and other public facilities in all buildings leased as well as owned by the Federal Government, and to assure full equality of access t-0 all federally owned parks, fores ts, and other recreational areas. When uncontrolled mob action directly threatened the nondiscriminatory use of transpor tation facilities in Ma.y 1961, F e1eral ma.rshals were employed to restore order and prevent potentially widespread personal and proper ty damage. Growing nationwide concern with this problem, however, makes it clear that further Federal action is needed now to secure the right of all citizens to the full enjoyment of all facilities which 11re open to the general public. Such legisl11tion is clearly consistent with the Constitution and with om\u00b7 concepts of both human rights and property rights. The argument that such measmes constitute 11n unconstitutional interference with property rights has consistently been rejected by the courts in upholding ll1ws on zoning, collective bargaining, minimum wages, smoke control, and countless other measures designed to make certain that the use of private property is consistent with. the public interest. While the legal situations are not parallel, it is interesting to iiote that Abraham Lincoln, in issuing the Emancipation Proclamation 100 years ago, was also accused of violating the property rights of slaveowners. Indeed, there is an age-old saying that \"property has its duties as well as its rights\"; and no property owner who holds those premises for the purpose of serving at a profit the American public 11t la.rge can claim 11ny inherent right to exclude a part of that public on grounds of race or color. Just as the law requires common c111Tiers to serve equally n11 who wish theiT services, so it c11n require public 11ccommodations to 11ccommod11te equally all segments of the general public. Both lrn mn,n rights and proper ty rights are found11tions of om society- and both will flourish as the result of this measure. In a society which is increasingly mobile and in an economy which is increasingly interdependent, bu.sine s establishments which serve the public- such as hotels, rest11urants, theat ers, stores, and othersserve not only th e members of th eir immediate communities but travelers from other tates and visitors from abroad. Their goods come from all over tJ1 e I11,tion. This participation in the :flow of interstate commerce has given these . business establishments both increased prosperity and n.n increased responsibility to provide equal access and service to all citizens. Some 30 States,1 the District of Columbia, and numerous citiescovering some two-thirds of this country and well over 'Alaska, Massachusetts, Mich gan, Mlnllesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hompslure, Now Jersey, New Menco, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, P ennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, ancl Wyoming. Oltles with pt1bUc nccommoclations ordinances wWch are outside the above States Include Washington, D.C., Wilmington, Del., Louisville, Ky., E l Paso, Tex., Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis, Mo. CIVIL RIGHTS 5 its people-have already enacted laws of varying effectiveness against discrimination in places of public accommodation, many of them in response to the recommendation of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights in 1947. But while their efforts indicate that legislation in this area is not extraordinary, the failure of more States to take effective action makes it clear that Federal legislation is necessary. The State and local approach has been tried. The voluntary approach has been tried. But these approaches are insufficient to prevent the free flow of commerce from being arbitrarily and inefficiently restrained and distorted by discrimination in such establishments. Clearly the Federal Government has both the power and the obligation to eliminate these discriminatory practices: first, because they adversely affect the national economy and the flow of interstate commerce; and secondly, because Congress has been specifically empowered under the 14th amendment to enact legislation making certain that no State law permits or sanctions the unequal protection or treatment of any of its citizens. There have been increasing public demonstrations of resentmen t. directed against this 1..'i.nd of discrimination-demonstr_ations which too often breed tension and violence. Only the Federal Governmen t, it is clear, can make these demonstrations unnecessary by providing peaceful remedies for the grievances which set them off. For these reasons, I am today proposing, as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1963, a provision to guarantee all citizens equal access to the services and facilities of hotels, restaurants, places of amusement, and retail establishments. This seems to me to be an elementary right. Its denial is an arbitrary indignity that no American in 1963 should have to endure. The proposal would give the person aggrieved the right to obtain a court order against the offending establishment or persons. Upon receiving a complaint in a case sufficiently important to warran t his conclusion that a suit would materially further the purposes of the act, the Attorney General-if he finds that t.he aggrieved party is unable to undertake or otherwise arrange for a suit on his own (for lack of financial means or effective representation , or for fe11,r of economic or other injury)- will first r efer the case for voluntary settlement to the Community Relations Service described below, give the establishment involved time to correct its practices, permit State and local equal access laws (if any) to Op()rate first, and then , and only then, initiate a suit for compliance. In short, to the extent that these unconscionable practices can be corrected by the individual owners, localities, and States (and r ecent experience demonstrates bow effectively and uneventfully this can be done) , th e Federal Governm ent bas no desire to intervene. But an explosive national problem can not await city-by-city solutions; and t hose who loudly abhor Federal action only in vite it if they neglect or evade their own obligations. This provision will open doors in every part of the country which never should have been closed. It,s enactment will hasten the end to practices which have no place in a free and united nation, and thus help move this potentially dangerous problem from the streets to the courts. 6 CIVIL RIGHTS II. D ESEGRE GATIO N OF SCHOOLS In my message of F ebrua.r y 28, while commending the progress akeady made in achieving desegregation of education at all levels as foquired by the Constitution, I was compelled to roint out the slowness of progress toward primary and seconda,r y schoo desegregation. The Supreme Court has recently voiced the same opinion. M any Negro children entering segregated grade schools at the time\u00b7 of the Supreme Court decision in 1954 will enter segr egated high schools this year, having suffered a loss which can never be regained. Indeed, discrimination in education is one basic cause of the other inequities and hardships inflicted upon our NegTO citizens. The lack of equal educational opportunity deprives the individual of equal economic opportunity, restTicts his contribution as a citizen and community leader, encourages him to dTOp out of school and imposes a heavy burden on the effott to elimin ate discrimin atory practices and prejudices from our nation al life. \u00b7 The F ederal courts, pursuant to the 1954 decision of the U .S. Supreme Court and earlier decisions on institutions of higher learning, have shown both competence and courage in directing the desegregation of schools on the local level. It is appropriate to keep this responsibility largely within the judicial arena. But it is unfair and unrealistic to expect that the burden of initiating such cases can be wholly borne by private litigants. Too often those \u00b7entitled to bring suit on behalf of their children lack the economic ineans for instituting and main taining such cases or the ability to withstand the personal, physical, and economic harassment which sometimes descends upon those who do ins titute them. The same is true of students wishing to attend th e college of their choice but un able t o assume the burden of litigation. These difficulties are among the principal reasons for the delay in carrying out the 1954 decision; and this delay cannot be justified to those who have been hurt as a result. Rights such as these, as the Supreme Court r ecently said, are \"present rights. They are not merely h opes to some fu ture enjoyment of some formalistic constitut ional promise. The basic guarantees of our Constitution are warrants for the here and now * * *.\" In order to achieve a more ord erly and consistent complia.n ce with the Supreme Court's school and college desegregation decisions, therefore, I recommend that the Congress assert its specific constitu tional ~u thority to implement the 14th amendment by including in th e Civil Righ ts Act of 1963 a new title providing the following: (A) Au thority would be given the Attorney General to initiate in the Federal district courts appropriate legal proceedings against local public school boards or public institutions of higher learning-or to in tervene in existing cases-whenever(1) be has received a written complaint from students or from the parents of students who are being den ied equal protection of the laws by a segregated public school or college; and (2) he certifies that such persons are unable to undertake or otherwise arrange for the initiation and maintenance of such legal proceedings for lack of financial means or effective legal representation or for fear of economic or other injury ; and (3) he determines that his initiation of or intervention in such suit will materially further the orderly progress of desegregation I [_ CIVIL RIGHTS 7 in public education . For this purpose, the Attorney General would establish criteria to determine the priority and relative need for Federal action in those districts from which complaints have been filed. (B) As previously recommend ed, technical and financial assistance would be given to those school districts in all parts of the country which, voluntarily or as the result of litigation, are engaged in the process of meetino- the educational problems flowing from desegregation or racial imbJance but which are in need of guidance, experienced help, or financial assistance in order to train their personnel for this changeover, cope with new difficulties and complete the job satisfactorily (including in such assistance loans to a distri ct where State or loral funds have been withdrawn or withheld because of desegregation). Public institutions already operating without racial discrimination, of comse, will not be affected by this statute. Local action can always make Federal action unnecessary. Many school boards have peacefully and voluntarily desegreo-ated in recent years. And while this act does not include private c~leges and schools, I strongly urge them to live up to their responsibilities and to recognize no arbitrary bar of race or color-for such .bars have no place in any institution, least of all one devoted to the truth and to the improvement of all mankind. III. F A IR AND FULL EMPLOYMEN T Unemployment falls with special cruelty on minority groups. The unemployment rate of N egro workers is more than twice as high as that of the working force as a whole. In many of our larger cities, both North and South, the number of jobless Negro youth-often 20 percent or more-creates an atmosphere of frustration, resentment, and unrest which does not bode well for the future. Delinquency, vandalism, gang warfare, disease, slums, and the high cost of public welfare and crime are all directly related to unemployment among whites and Negroes alike-and recent labor difficulties in Philadelphia may well be only the beginning if more jobs are not found in the larger northern cities in particular. Employment opportunities, moreover, play a major role in determining whether the rights described above are meaningful. There is little value in a Negro's obtaining the right to be admitted to hotels and restaurants if be has no cash in his pocket and no job . Relief of Negro un employment reqt1ires progress in three major areas: (1) More jobs must be created through greater economic growth.The Negro-too often unskilled, too of ten the first to be fired and the last to be hired- is a primary victim of recessions, depr essed areas, and unused industrial capacity. Negro unemployment will not be noticeably diminished in this country until the total demand for labor is effectively increased and the whole economy is headed toward a level of full employment. 1Vhen our economy operates below capacity, Negroes are more severely affected than other groups. Conversely, return to full employment yields particular benefits to the Negro. Recent studies have shown that for every 1 percentagepoint decline in the general unemployment rate there tends to be a 2 percentage-point r eduction in Negro unemployment. Prompt and substantial tax reduction is a key to achieving the full employment we need. The promise of the area redevelopment i . 8 - . - -~- - - which tive town.rd the deep-seated economic distress-mus t no t be stifled for want of sufficient authorization or adequate finan cing. The accelerated public works program is now gaining momentum; States, cities, and local communities should press ahead with the projects financed by this measure. In addition, I have instructed the Departments of Labor, Commerce, and Health , Education, and Welfare to examine how their programs for the relief of unemployment and economic hardship can be still more intensively fo cused on those areas of hardcoi:e, long-term unemployment, \u00b7 among both white and nonwhite workers. Our concern with civil rights must not cause any diversion or dilution of our efforts for economic pro~E~ss-for without such progress the Negro's hopes will remain unfu1111led. (2) J..101\u00b7e education ancl tmining to raise the level of skills.-A clistressing number of unemployed Negroes are illiterate and unskilled, r efugees from farm automation, unable to do simple computations or even to read a help-wanted advertisement. Too many are equipped to work only in those occupations where technology and other changes have reduced the need for manpower-as farm labor or manual labor, in mining or construction. Too many have attended segregated schools that were so lacking to adequate funds and faculty as to be unable to produce qualified job applicants. And too many who have attended nonsegregated schools dropped out for lack of incentive, guidance, or progress. The unemployment rate for those adults with less than 5 years of schooling is a.round 10 percent; it has consistently been double the prevailing rate for high school graduates; and studies of public welfare recipients show a shockingly high proportion of parents with less than a primary school education. Although the proportion of Negroes without adequate education and training is far higher than the proportion of whites, none of these pro bl ems is r estricted to Negroes a.Ione. This Nation is in critical need of a massive upgrading in its education and training effort for all citizens. In an age of r apiclly changing technology, that effort today is failin g millions of our youth. It is especially failing Negro youth in segr egated schools and crowded slums. If we are ever to lift them from the morass of social and economic degradation, it will be th.rough the strengthenin~ of our edu cation and trainin g services-by improving the quality of instruction; by enabling our schools to cope with rapidly e:;,.J)anding enrollm ents;. and by increasing op:portunities and incentives for all individuals to complete their educat10n and to con tinue their self-development during adulthood. I have ther efore reques ted of the Congress and r equest again today the enactment of legislation to assist education at every level from grade school through graduate school. I have also .r equested the enactment of sever al measures which provide, by various means and for various age and educational groups, expanded job training and job experience. Today, in the new and more urgen t context of this message, I wish to renew my request for these measures, to expand their l?rospective operation and to supplemen t them with additional provisions. The additional $400 million which will be r equired beyond that contained in the J anuary budget is more t han offset by the various budget reductions which I have already sen t to the Congress in the last 4 months. Studies show, moreover, that the loss of 1 yea1s income clue to unemployment is mo1'e -- CIVIL R.IGH'l'S 9 (han the total cost of 12 years of education through high school; and, when . welfare and other social costs are added, it is elem\u00b7 that failure to take {hese steps will cost us far more than thefr enactment. There is no more profitable investment than educa tion, and no greater waste than ill- I trained youth. Specifically, I now propose: (A) That additional funds be provided to broaden the manpower de velopment ancl tmining program, and that the act be amended, not only to increase the authorization ceiling and to postpone the effec.: tive date of State matching r equirements, but also (in keeping with the recommendations of the President's Committee on Youth Employment) to lower the age for training allowances from 19 to 16, to allocate funds for literacy training, an d to permit the payment of a higher proportion of the program's training nllowances to out-of-school youths, with provisions to assure t.lrnt no on e drops out of school t.o t ake :idvimtage of this progmm ; . . (B) That additional funds be provided to finnnce the pending uouth emvloymerit bill, which is designed to channel the energies of ou t-of-school, out-of-work youth into the constructive outlet offered by hometown improvement proj ects and conservation work; (C) That t,h e pending vocational education amendments, which would greatly update nnd expimd this progmm of teaching job skills to those in school, be strengthened by the nppropriation of additional funds, with some of the added money em\u00b7marked for those areas with a high incidence of school dropouts and youth unemploym ent, and by the addition of a new program of demonstration youth train.ir1g projects t o be conducted in these ar eas; \u00b7 (D) That the vocational education progrnm be furth er amended to provide a worlc-study vrogram for youth of high school age, with F edernl funds helping their school or ot,her local public agency employ them part time in order to ennble and encourage them to coinplete their training; . (E) That the ceiling be raised on the adillt basic education provisions in the pending education progrnm, in order to help the States ten.ch the fund amental tools of li teracy and learning to culturally deprived adults. More than 22 million Americm1S in nll parts of th e country have less than 8 yenrs of schooling; nnd (F) That the public welfare worlc-reli~f ancl training program, which the Congress added last year, be amended to provide Federal fin ancing of the supervision and equipment costs, and rnore F ederal demonstration and training proj ec ts, thus enco uraging Sta.te and locnl welfare agencies to put employable but unemployed welfare recipients to work on local proj ects which do not displace ot,her workers. To make the above r ecommendations effective, I call upon more States to adopt enabling legislation covering un employed fathers under the aid-to-dependent children program, thereby gaining their services for \"work-relief\" jobs, and tq moYe ahead more Yigorously in implementing the manpower deYelopment and tru.ining program. I am asking the Secretaries of Labor and HEW to make use of th eir authority to deal directly with communities and yocationa.1 schools whenever State cooperation or progress is insufficient, particularly in _those areas where youth unemployment is too high. AboYe all , I urge the Congress to enact all of these measures with aln.crity and foresight. H. Doc. 124, 88-1 - 2 - 10 CIVIL RIGHTS For even the complete elirnination of ra cial discrimination in employment-a goal toward which this Nation mus~ strive (as discussed below)-will not put a single un employed Negro to work unless he has the skills required and unl ess more jobs hav'e been created-and thus the passage of the legislation described above (under bo th secs. (1) and (2)) is essential if the obj ectives of this message are to be met. (3) Finally racial discrimination in employment must be eliminated. D enial of the right to work is W1fair, regardless of its victim. It is doubly unfair to throw its burden on an individual because of his race or color. . Men who served side by side with each other on the field of battle should have no difficul ty working side by side on an assembly l~ne or construction project. \u00b7 'fherefore, to combat this evil in all par ts of the country, (A) The Committee on Equcil Employment Opportunity, under the chairmanship of the Vice President, should be given a permanent statutory basis, assuring it of adequate financing and enforcement procedures. That Committee is now stepping up its efforts to remove rncial barriers in the hiring practices of Federal depa.r tments, agencies, and Federal contractors, covering a total of some 20 million employees and the Nation's major employers. I have requested a company-bycompnny, plant-by-plant, union-by-union 1;eport to assme the implementation of this policy. (B) I will shortly issue an Executive order extending the authority of the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity to include the construction of buildings and other facili ties undertaken wh olly or in past as a result of F ederal grant-in-aid programs. . (C) I have directed that all F ederal construction programs be review.eel to prevent any racial discrimination in hiring!ractices, either directly in the rejection of presently available qualifie Negro workers or indirectly by the exclusion of Negro applicants for apprenticeshi p training. (D) I have dil'ected the ecr'etary of Labor, in the conduct of his duties under the Federal Apprenticeship Act and E xecutive Order No. 10925, to require that the admission of young workers to apprenti ceship programs be on a completely nondiscriminatory basis. (E) I have dii-ectecl the Secretary of Labor to make certain that the job counseling and placement responsibilities of the Federal-State Employment Service a.r e carried out on a nondiscriminatory basis, a.n d to help assure that full and equal employment oppor tunity is provided nil qualified Negro applicants. The selection and referral of applica,nts for employment and for training opportunities, and the administration of the employment offices' other services a.nd facilities, must be carried on witho ut regaTd to race or color. This will be of special importance to Negro es graduating from hi gh school or college this month. (F) The Departn.1ent of Justice has intervened in a case now pendino- before the NLRB involviug charges ofracinl discrimination on the part of certain union locals. (G) As a part of its new policy on Federal em ployee organizations, this Government ,vill recognize only those that do not discriminate on grounds of mce or color. (H) I have called upon t he leaders of organize<l labor to. end discrimination in their membership policies; and some 118 unions1 representing 85 percent of the AFL--CIO membership, have signea CML RIGHTS i 11 nondiscrimination agreements with the Committee on Equal Emplojrme'nt Opportunity. More are expected. (I) Finally, I renew my support of pending Federal fair employment practices legislation, applicable to both employers and unions. Approximately two-thirds of the Nation's labor force is already covered by Federal, State, and local equal employment opportunity measures_.:..__ including those employed in the 22 States and numerous cities which hav\u00b7e enacted such laws as well as those paid directly or indirectly by Federal funds. But, as the Secretary of Labor testified in Januar)' 1962, Federal legislation is desirable, for it would help set a standarcl for all the Nation and close existing gaps. This problem of unequal job opportunity must not be allowed to grow, as the result of either recession or discrimination. I enlist every employer, every labor union, and every agency of governmentwhether affected directly by these measures or not-in the task of seeing . to it that no false lines ar e drawn in assuring equnlity of the right and opportunity to make a decen t living.

COMMUNITY RELATIONS SERVICE I lrnxe rep eatedly \u00b7stressed the fact that progress in race r elations, while it cannot be delayed, can be more solidly and more peacefully nccomplished to the extent that legislation can be buttressed by voluntary action. I have urged each member of the U.S. Conference of Mayors to establish biracial human relations committees in every city; and I hope all communities will establish such a group, preferably through official action. Such a board or committee can provide invaluable services by identifying community tensions before they reach the crisis stage, by improving cooperation and communication between the races, and by advising local officials, merchants, and organizations on the steps which can be taken to insure prompt progress. A similar agency is needed on the Federal level- to work with these local committees, providing them ,vith advice and assistance- to work in those commw1ities which lack a local committee-and generally to help ease tensions and suspicions, to help resolve interracial disputes and to work quietly to improve r elations in any community tbreatened or torn with strife. Such an effort is in no way a substitute for effective legislative guarantees of human rights. But conciliation and cooperation can facilitate the achievement of those rights, enablin g legislation to operate more smoothly and more effectively. The D epartment of Justice and its Civil Rights Division have already performed yeoman service of this nature, in Birmingham, in J ackson, and throughout the country. But the problem has grown beyond the time and energies which a few otherwise burdened officirtls can make available- and, in some areas, the confidence of all will be greater in an intermediary whose duti es are completely separated from departmental functions of investigation or litigation. It is my intention , therefore, to establish by Executive order (until such time as it can be created by statute) an independent Community Relations S ervice- to fulfill the fun ctions described above, working through regional, State, and local committees to the extent possible, and offering its services in tension-torn communi ties either upon its own mot.ion or upon the request of a local official or other party. 12 CIVIL RIGHTS Authority for such a Service is included in the proposed omnibus bill. It will work without publicity and hold all information imparted to its officers in. strict confidence. Its own resources can be preserved by its encouraging and assisting the creation of State and local committees, either on a continuing basis or in emergency situations. Without powers of enforcement or subpena, such a Service is no substitute for other measures; and it cannot guarantee success. But dialogue and discussion are always better than violence-and this agency, by enabling all concerned to sit down and reason together, , can plfty a major rol e in achieving peaceful progress in civil rights. V. FEDERAL PROGRA.i\\lS Simple justice requires that public funds ,' to which all taxpayers of all races contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes, or results in racial discrimination.' Direct discrimination by F ederal, State, or local governments is prohibited by the Constituti9n. But indirect discrimination, th.rough the\u00b7 use of Federal funds, is just as invidious; and it should not be necessary to resort to the courts to prevent each individual violation. Congress and the Executive have their responsibilities to uphold the Constitution also; and, in the 1960's, the executive branch has sou~ht to fulfill its responsibilities by banning discrimination in federally financed housing, in NDEA and NSF institutes, in federally affected employment, in the Army and Air Force Reserve, in the training of civilian defense workers, and in all federally owned and leased facilities. Many statures providing Federa.l financial assistance however, define with such precision both the administrator's roie and the conditions upon which specified amounts shall be given to designated recipients that the amount of administrative discretion remainingwhich might be used to withhold funds if discrimination were not ended- is at best questionable. No administrator has the unlimited authority to invoke the Constitution in opposition to the mandate of the Congress. Nor would it always be helpful to require unconditionally-as is often proposed-the wi thdrawal of all Federal funds from programs urgently needed by Negroes as well as whites ; for this may only penalize those who least deser ve it without ending discrimination. Instead of permitting this issue to become a political device often exploited by those opposed to social or economic progress, it would be better at this time to pass a single comprehensive provision making it clear that the Federal Government is not r equired, under any statute, to furnish any kind of financial assistance-by way of grant, loan, ?0!1tra_ct, gt~aranty 1 ins~ua1;1c~ or_ otherwise- to ~ny program or activity ill which racial discrrmU1at10n occurs. This would not permit the Federal Government to cut off all Federal aid of all kinds as a means of punishing an area for the discrimination occurring therein- but it would clarify the authority of any administrator with respe?t to Federal funds or financial assistance and discriminatory practices. CoNcLusro Many problems remain that cannot be ignored . The enactment of the legislation I have recommended will not solve all our problems of race relations. This bill must be supplemented by action in every CIVIL RIGHTS 13 branch of government at the F ederal, State, and local level.' It must be supplemented as well by enlightened private citizens, private businesses and private labor and civic organizations, by responsible educators and editors, and cer tainly by r eligious leaders who r ecognize the conflict between racial bi0 \u00b7otry and the Holy Word. This is not a sectional prob1em- it is nationwide. It is not a partisan problem. The proposals set forth above arn based on, a careful consideration of the views of leaders of both par ties in both Houses of Congress. In 1957 and 1960, members of both parties rallied behind the civil rights measures of my predecessor; n,nd I am cer tain that this tradition can be continued, as it has in the case of world crises. A national domestic crisis also calls for bipartisa.n unity and solutions. We will not solve these problems by blaming any group or section for the legacy which has beerr handed down by past &enerations. But neither will these problems be solved by clinging to tne patterns of the past. Nor, finally, can they be solved in the streets, by lawless acts on either side, or by the physical actions or presence of any private group or public official, however appealing such melodramatic devices may seem to some. Durino- the weeks past, street demonstrations, mass picketing, ana parades have brought these matters to the Nation's attention in dramatic fashion in many cities throughout the United States. This has happened because these racial injustices are real and no other remedy was in sight. But, as feelings have risen in recent days, these demonstrations have increasingly endangered lives and property, inflamed emotions and unnecessarily divided communities. They are not the way in which this country should rid itself of r acial discrimination. Violence is never justified ; and, while peaceful communication, deliberation, and petitions of pro test con tinue, I want to caution against demonstrations which can lead to violence. This problem is now before the Congress. Umuly tactics or pressures will not help and may hinder the effective consideration of these measures. If they are enacted, there will be legal remedies available; and, therefore, while the Congress is completing its work, I urge all community leaders, Negro Emel white, to do their utmost to lessen tensions and to exercise self-restraint. The Congress should have an opportunity to freely work its will. M eanwhile, I strongly support action by local public officials and mer chants to remedy these grievances on their own. The lea-al remedies I have proposed are the embodiment of this Nation's basic posture of commonsense and common justice. They involve every American's right to vote, to go to school, to get a job and to be served in a public place without arbitrary discriminationrigh ts which most Americans take for granted. In short, enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1963 a t this session of the Congress- however long it may take and .however troublesome it may be- is imperative. It will go far toward providing r easonable men with the r easonable means of meeting these problems; and it will thus help end the kind of r acial strife whi.ch this Nation can h ardly afford. R ancor, violence, disunity, and national shame can only hamper our national standing and security. To par aphrase the words of Lincoln; \"In giving freedom to the Negro, we assure freedom to the free-honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve.\" 14 CIVIL RIGHTS I therefore ask every Member of Congress to set aside sectional and political ties, and to look at this issue from the viewpoint of the Nation. I ask you to look into your hearts-not in search of charity, for the Negro neither wants nor needs condescension-but for the one plain, proud, and priceless quality that unites us all as Americans; a sense of justice. In this year of the emancipation centennial, justice requires\u00b7us to insure the blessings of liberty for all Americans and their posterity-not merely for reasons of economic efficiency, world diplomacy, and domes t.ic tranquilit,:v- hut, above all, because it is right.

TITLE II- INJUKCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST DIS CRIMI KATIO N IN PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIOKS F I ND I NGS SEC. 201. (a) The America n people have become increasingly mobile dming tho last generation, a nd millions of Ameri can citi zens travel each year from State to S-tat e by rail, a ir, bus, automobile, and other mea ns. A substanti al number of such travelers are members of mi nority racial an d religious groups. These citizens, parti cul arly Negroes, a rc subj ec ted in ma ny places to discrimin ation a nd segregation, and they are frequently un able to obtain the goods a nd services availa ble to other interstate travelers. (b) Negroes an d members of other minority groups who travel interstate are frequently una ble to obtain adequate lodging acco mmod ations during their travels, with the res ul t that they may be compelled to stay a.t hotels or motels of poor and inferior quality, travel great distances from their norm al routes to find adequ at e accommodations, or make det ailed arrangements for lodging far in adva nce of scheduled interst at e travel. CIVIL RIGHTS 17 (c) Negroes aud members of other minority groups who travel interst at e are frequentlf unable to obtaiu adequat e food service at convenient places along their routes, with the result that many are dissuaded from traveling interstate, while others must travel considerable distances from their intended routes in order to obtain adequat e food service. (dJ Goods, ser vices, and persons in the amusement and entertainment indu. tries commonly move in interstate commerce, and t he entire American p eople benefit from the increased cult ural and recreational opport unities afforded thereby. Practices of audience discrimination and segregation artificially r estrict the number of persons to whom the interst ate amusement and entertainment indust ries may offer t heir goods and services. The burdens imposed on interstat e commer ce by such practices and the obstructions to the free flow of commerce wh ich r esult therefrom are serious and substantial. (e) Retail establishments in all States of the Union purchase a wide variety and a large volume of goods from business concerns located in other States and in foreign n ations. Discriminatory practices in such est ablishments, which in some instances have led to the withholding of patronage by those affected by such practices, inhibit and restrict the normal distribution of goods in the interst ate market. (f) Fraternal, religious, scientific, and other organizat ions engaged in interst at e operations are frequently dissuaded from holding conventions in cit ies which they would otherwise select beca.use t he public facilities in such cities are either not open to all m embers of racial or religious minority groups or are available on a segregated basis. (g) Business organizations are frequently hampered in obtaining t he servi ce\u00b7 of skilled workers and persons in the professions who are likely to encount er discrimination based on race, creed, color, or national origin in rest aurant s, ret ail stores, and places of amusement in t he area where t heir services are needed. Business organizat ions which seek t o avoid subjecting t heir employees t o such discrimination and to avoid the strife resulting therefrom are restrict ed in t he choice of location for their offices and plants. Such discriminat ion thus r educes the mobility of the national labor force and prevents the most effective aJlocation of national resources, including the interstate movement of indust ries, p articularly in some of the areas of the Nation most in need of indust rial and commer cial expansion and development. (h) The discriminatory pract ices described aboYe are in all cases encouraged, fost ered, or tolerated in some degree by the government al aut horities of the Stat es in which t hey occur, which license or protect the businesses involved by means of laws and ordinances and the activit ies of their executive and judicial officers. Such discriminatory practices, part icularly when their cumulative effect throughout t he Nation is considered, t ake on t he character of act ion by t he States and t herefore fall wit hin t he ambit of the equal protection clause of the fo urteent h amendment to t he Constitut ion of t he Unit ed States. (i) The burdens on and obst ruct ions t o commerce which are described above can best be removed by invoking t he powers of Congress under the fo urteent h amendment and the commer ce clause of t he Constitut ion of t he United States to prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin in certain public est ablishment s.

Claude Purcell State Office Building - 688-2390 UNITED CHUR CH W O MEN OF ATLANTA President: Mrs . P hil B. Narmore 872-5 862 RALPH Atlanta has sought in all things to be a responsible city. This is her great tradition. As early as December 1889, Henry W. Grady, whose name is on our modern and beautiful city hospital, on one of our finest schools, on one of our hotels, and whose statue stands in the heart of our city, said, in a speech made to the Merchants of Boston : \"The problem of race ... is so bound up in our honora ble obligation to the world th at we would no t disentangle it if we could ... I would rather see my people render back this question rightl y solved th an to see them gather all the spoils over which fac tion has contended since Cataline conspired and Caesar fought. \" This was Grady's basic a pproac h. His opinions, dealing with the context of hi s time, do not all jibe with tod ay's. But, he was rig ht in the great sense .. . it must be rightly solved. This is the city which welcomed back General Sherman, not many years after the war, and gave him a tremendous reception , including a dinner attended by Confederate veterans who directl y had opposed him-a nd who had been driven from the city which he proceeded , in time, to burn. This is the city which has always tri ed to look forw ard , not backward . It has never wa nted to be an old Southern city, caught like a fl y in amber, and dying of qu aintness and musty charm. From the tim e the so und of hammers and the ras p of saws bega n to be heard in the rebuilding of the city after Sherman's fires had died , we have sought to bu ild into th e city a belief in the principles of thi s country, of justice and opportunity. We have not always succeeded . T he record is not unm arred. But we h ave never ceased to try. One of our great strengths is that there have [ 2] ..L been attracted here the graduates of the many institutions over the nation. Every year we are pleased to carry items about the local alumni of Wisconsin , of Minnesota, of California, of Princeton , Yale, Harvard , Smith, Radcliff, Vassar, et al, who are to have a luncheon or dinner and are calling on the faithful to attend. Atlanta has attracted, too, many of the more ambitious young men and women from the smaller cities and towns of our own state and others of the South. We are a city of transportation and communication , and this has brought t\u00b7o us young executive and professional men . This press pack is an example. A great many persons, all volunteers, have worked on it. They want yo u to know that after the school decision by the U. S. Supreme Court, this was a city in which there was a debate and a continuing exchange of ideas. The White Citizens Councils, the Klans, and others of that mentality, could , and did, have their say. But they were answered. They did not dominate. They could not coerce or intimidate, as they did in neighboring states. The men and women who have compiled this press pack represent volunteer citizen organizatio ns wh ich have worked for public schools-and for the orderly processes of law. We, of the press, radio and television , have helped them have their say . We commend them to you. One never knows. The forces of evil and violence are unpredictable. But we believe that the overwhe lmin g sentim ent in thi s city is for lawf ul procedures. W hat we chiefly want yo u to know is that we have not been idle. We h ave not sa t with folded hands and wa ited. We h ave not left it for others to do. The people of the city have tried to organize public opinion , and , more important, to inform it. Th is press pack contains the essence of that effort.

' 'The highest value of the law is the keepin g of the peace- the Atlanta Police D epartment has fu ll responsibility and authority to maintain the peace and good order over the entire city, and espec iall y at and aro und the schools.\" August 1, 1961 [ 5] BACKGROUND: ATLANTA {19S4-1961) When the Supreme Court Decision of May 1954 put an end to legal segregation in the nation's schools, Georgia, like other deep South states, adopted an official policy of last-ditch legal resistance. Despite protests from the Georgia Education Association, the League of Women Voters and oth~r responsible citizens' groups, the General Assembly of 1955 adopted a \"Private School Plan\" which included , among other measures, a provision to cut off funds from any school system which attempted to desegregate. Secure in their legal \"Magi not Line\" and unhampered by fea r of Federal initiative in enforcing the ruling in \"Brown vs. Topeka,\" most Georgians felt the Supreme Court's emphasis was on the word \"deliberate\" rather than \"speed.\" Schools would continue in the traditional way; regional mores would remain unchanged. The bitter lessons of Little Rock and Norfolk were as yet unlearned. The changes in Baltimore, St. Louis and Louisville were not deep-South enough to stir Georgians from the blanket of apath y which then covered the entire school question. The first brush with realit y came in January 1958, when a group of Atlanta Negroes. in a \"class action ,\" filed suit agai nst the Atlanta School Board . The suit (Calhoun et al vs. Latimer ) asked that the School Board be enjoi ned from practicing racial discrimination in the public schools. When in June of 19 59 U. S. District Judge Frank Hooper ruled in favor of the pl aintiffs and ordered the Atlanta Board to submit a plan for desegregation by the fo llowing December, the handwriting was clearl y on the wall. The [ 6 ] School Board had no alternative but to submit a plan. Yet any plan to desegregate Atlanta's schools would be squarely in conflict with Georgia's m assive resistance laws and would automatically fo rce their closure. Meanwhile, in October of 1958, echoes from Norfolk and Little Rock began to reverberate along the Peachtrees. Anxious letters were written to the newspapers. Isol ated groups of citizens held meetings. In November, the School Committee of the Atl anta League of Women Voters publicly submitted ten questions to the School Board, the most important of which was, \"Will every school in A tlanta close if the Courts order integration?\" T he School Board withheld a public answer since the y were litigants in the pending Court suit; but an Atlanta Constitution columnist outlined the city's dilemma. On November 25th, under the auspices of the League of Women Voters, an open meeting was called to discuss ways and means of keeping schools open. A steering committee was fo rmed to seek coopera tion with the business and fi nanci al leadership of A tl anta. Since it was felt that a public stand at that time would be undesira bl e and premature, the steering committee neve r got off th e ground . T he disengagement of the loca l power structure , the unyielding \"never\" of the State political leadershi p and th e strident, often threatening segregationist voices clai ming th at \"no school s are better than in tegrated ones\" were powerful deterrents to organized community action. Yet because the Atlanta papers respo nsibly reported the news fro m other So uth ern cities, pointing out editoriall y the tragic consequences of m assive resista nce elsewhere, ma ny A tl antan s realized their public schools were in jeopardy and sought a way to save them. On December 9, 1958, eighteen white parents chartered HOPE, Inc. (Help O ur P ublic Education), choosing to avoid the integration vs. segregation iss ue by taking an u ncomplicated stand [ 7 ] for open public schools, period. Conceived primarily as an educational organization designed to clear up the fog of confusion engendered by \"massive resistance,\" \"interposition\" and other socalled alternatives to compliance, it rapidly became a rallying ground for moderates who previously had suffered to remain silent. With the fervor and enthusiasm only amateurs could maintain, HOPE spawned a welter of public manifestos (Ministers, Educators and Doctors, to name just a few) and generated enough interest by March of 1959 to hold a public rally which drew upwards of 1,500 people and some prominent speakers in support of open schools (Atlanta Mayor Hartsfield, Publisher Ralph McGill, Georgia Legislator M. M. (Muggsy) Smith and Editor Sylvan Meyer) . Favorable press, radio and television coverage Iof the March rally established a bona-fide \"Open Schools Movement.\" HOPE chapters formed in Gainesville, Marietta, Jonesboro, Rome, Athens, Macon and Savannah with other nuclei of interested supporters in cities and towns throughout the state. Inevitably there was opposition, much of it wellfinanced and organized. In addition to the States Rights Council led by Augusta politico, Ro y Harris, the Klans and White Citizens Councils, Atlanta-based centers of resistance such as MASE (Metropolitan Association for Segregated Education) and later GUTS (Georgians Unwilling to Surrender) headed by Lester Maddox, now a candidate in the five-cornered Atlanta m ayoralty race, sprang up to harass open school advocates. On November 30, 1959 the Atlanta School Board submitted a stair-step plan for desegregation of the public school s begi nning with the 12th grade (given in full elsewhere in this pamphlet) . Judge Hooper approved the plan on January 20, 1960 and ordered it into effect the following September; or as soon as the General Assembly of Georgia could enact statutes to allow Atlanta schools to operate. [ 8] In an attempt to influence legislative action, open school supporters mounted an educational crash program. Mayor Hartsfield proclaimed a \"Save Our Schools Week\" in Atlanta. Representatives of state-wide civic groups joined together in a coordinated effort. Legislators, business leaders and other opinion-makers throughout the state received repeated mailings underlinin\u00b7g the social, economic and educational disasters accompanying school closings elsewhere. The Fulton and DeKalb County legislative delegations which previously had withheld unanimous support, promised to seek legislative change. They were joined by a handful of salons from other parts of the state; but the prevailing sentiment when the General Assembly convened was to let Atlanta bear the brunt of school closings to preserve segregation elsewhere in Georgia. \u00b7 All during the legislative session public pressure in behalf of open schools grew stronger. Delegations of open school supporters called on Governor Vandiver, Senator Russell, Senator Talmadge and as many legislators as they could buttonhole. As a. result, the Legislature appointed a nineteenmember \"General Assembly Committee on Schools\" empowered to conduct hearings in each of the State's Congress ional Districts to find out whether \"the people of Georgia may wish to make a deliberate determination as to whether future education is to be afforded through direct tuition payments for use in private schools devoid of governmental control , or whether the public school system as it presently exists shall be maintained notwithstanding that the school system of A tlanta and even others yet to come may be integrated . . . \" Cynics regarded the Committee as a delaying tactic at best. It had power only to inquire and recommend and it was a foregone conclusion that most Georgians considered \"race-mixing\" far more disastrous than the abandonment of public education. Yet the strong grass-roots support for [ 9 ] open schools in nearly every part of the State was a surprise to almost everyone. The Committee had the good fortune to be chaired by widely-respected John Sibley, Chairman of the Board of the Trust Company of Georgia. Mr. Sibley conducted the hearings with good-humored dignity and impartiality. The importance of the \"Sibley Commission\" in awakening Georgians to the alternatives they faced cannot be overestimated. When the Committee issued its report in April 1960, the 11-member m ajority recommended a Freedom of Choice plan, somewhat similar to Virginia's. The 8-member minority_ stood fast for segregation, even at the cost of closed schools. The division within the Committee itself reflected the sharp differences of opinion in the state. Yet for the first time in the deep South, the majority of an all-Georgia committee appointed by the State Legislature with the blessings of the State Administration recommended that existing laws be changed to allow some desegregation . . . before a Negro ch ild actually applied to enter a w hite public school. After the publication of \"The Sibley Report,., Judge Hooper stayed integration of Atlanta schools for a year. On May 9, 1960, he amended the Atlan ta Plan to include desegregation of the 11th and 12th grades at the beginning of the J96 l school year. The Atlanta Plan was to become effect ive \"whether or not the General Assembly of Georgia at its session in January I 961 passes permissive legislation. \" In Judge Hooper's words, \"to order the Atlanta Public Schools to integrate . . . in September 1960 could mean but one thing; that is, the closing of Atlan ta's schools. To postpone this ... will give the Georg ia Legislature ... one last cha nce to prevent thi s closing. \" I mmedi ately fo llowi ng this fina l Court decision HOPE called a \"Georgia Open Schoo ls Co nference\" attended by 500 delegates in vited from some 87 Georgi a cities, towns or counties. Edward [ 10] R. Murrow televised this Conference in a nationwide documentary \"Who Speaks for the South.\" As it became more acceptable to speak out openly for legislative change, many came forward with strong public statements. As a Gainesville editor put it, \"You can hear minds changing all over Georgia.\" In the F all of 1960, open school advocates initiated \"Operation Las t Chance,\" taking their cue from Judge Hooper's words . Armed with forthright statements from Churches (all faiths and every important denomination, including the influential Georgia Baptist Convention) ; business leaders (the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, the Atlanta Jaycees and key individuals throughout the State); lawyers (the Atlanta and Georgia Bar Associations); educators (the Georgia Education Association , \"Mr. Jim\" Peters, venerable Ch airman of the State Board of Education) ; and m any others, the issue was kept constantly before the public. \"D ays of Deci sion\" Forums were held in Athens, Rome, A lbany, Columbus, Augusta and Savannah to plead the case for legislative change. The Georgia Chamber of Commerce conducted its own Legislative Forums, with Administration floor-leaders F r ank Twitty and Carl Sanders finding a preponderance of open-school sentiment and refl ecting this in their public statements. All this was played again st the backdrop of New Orlea ns which remained in the headlines throughout the F all. Coincident with the opening of the 1961 Legislati ve Session was the now-famous \"Athen's crisis. \" When two Negroes were ordered ad mitted to the Uni versity of Georgi a by U . S. District Judge W illi am A. Bootle, Governor Vandiver and the Legislature were prov ided a chaotic exa mpl e of what \"bitter-end \" resistance meant. Existi ng statutes wo uld fo rce closing Georgia's beloved University ( the nation's oldest state-supported institution of higher learn ing ) and this was too bitter a pill fo r even the strongest segregationists. On [ 11 ] January 18, 1961 , S. Ernest Vandiver, who had been elected Governor of Georgia only two years prior on a platform which said he would never permit desegregation , underwent a dramatic reversal. In o~der to save the schools of Georgia , he offered a \"Child Protection Plan ,\" through which a community can decide by local school board action or a referendum whether it wants to close its schools when it faces a court order to desegregate. If a community decides for open schools, tuition grants provide mone y for children not wishing to attend integrated schools. The Legislature promptly repealed the mandatory closing Jaws and adopted the Governor's four-bill package. The open schools advocates bad won their bat tle. Atlanta was now free to comply with its Court order, with no threat of school closings. Applications for transfer to the 11th arid 12th grades were submitted by 133 Negro children between May 1st and May 15th. After an exhaustive series of tests and interviews (required by the Atlanta Plan) ten were chosen to enter four previously allwhite high schools (Brown, Grady, Murphy and Northside) . 38 others are still in the process of appealing the Board's decision to reject their applications. One white child, Sandra Melkild, now attending Northside High School, has requested transfer to another presently all-white school , basing her request on \"freedom of association .\" The Atlanta School Board has denied her a transfer. On August 9th the State School Board overruled the Atlanta Board's decision ; but Judge Hooper has ordered a stay of the State Board of Education's ruling, pending a hearing. Once the conflict between State and Federal laws was resolved , emphasis shifted to desegregation with dignity. The organizations comprising the \" Open Schools Movement\" sent representatives to call on Dr. John Letson , Superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools, early last February to ask what citizens might do to help create a climate [ 12 ] of calm, dignified compliance with the law. It was suggested that church, business, service and youth groups outside the immediate jurisdiction of the school administration be encouraged to play a leading role in this effort through public discussion and dissemination of information. A new group, in fact an Organization of organizations, was formed with a broad base of community support. Its name: OASIS (Organizations Assisting Schools in September) an acronym Atlantans feel is descriptive of their city. OASIS, with its 53 affiliates, is divided into three sections-Religious, Civic and Service Groups and Youth-serving Agencies. Members range from service clubs and Girl Scouts to labor unions and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Its activity has been lowkey but intensive, seeking to work through already existing organizational machinery to reach hundreds of thousands of Atlanta's citizens. OASIS has stimulated hundreds of meetings throughout the long, hot Atlanta summer. 126 volunteer discussion leaders h ave been on call to assist at gatherings varying from 200 in the Southwest Community Council to half-a-dozen an~ious parents meeting in a neighbor's living room. A Speaker's Bureau, headed by an ex-president of The Toastmasters, provides information for business and service groups. A troupe of Theater Atlanta Players has presented improvised desegregation skits for teenagers at camps and youth centers all over town . OASIS has brought over one hundred white and Negro youth leaders together and encouraged Atlanta's more prominent citizens to speak out in behalf of responsible compliance. OASIS' Religio us Section spearheaded the observance of \"Law and Order Weekend (Friday, August 25th through Sunday, August 27th) during which Atlanta's prolifery of churches and synagogues conducted special prayers for peacefu l transition. Ministers were asked to take their [ I3 ] vacations before August 15th so that they would be on hand to give moral leadership. All faiths have participated in this effort, with leading clergy and lay representatives playing active roles as catalysts. All of these efforts have received considerable support from Atlanta's newspapers, television and radio stations. Mayor William B. Hartsfield's repeated assertions that Atlanta will preserve its reputation for .g ood race relations have been followed by public and private measures designed to prevent trouble. Police Chief Herbert T. Jenkins has had officers from his department observing racial disturbances in other cities for two and one-half years. The Chief has publicly proclaimed that law and order will be maintained and warned would-be violators of penalties. School Superintendent, Dr. John Letson, has told Atlantans that anything less than desegregation with peace and dignity will \"exact a price that will not be paid in full for a generation.\" And when school opens on August 30th, this city hopes to demonstrate that careful planning and intelligent preparation can prevent the violence that has accompanied school integration nearly everywhere else in the deep South. AN EDITORIAL P.S. WE HOPE YOU WILL READ In writing the forego ing p iece, we h ave tried to give you \"just the facts. \" Now Jet us tell you what's in our hearts. We had a double purpose in preparing this kit. If our schools desegregate smoothly and without incident- and the overwhelming majority of A tlantans are praying that they will- we wanted you to know why. If a rock is thrown or a demonstration staged, you ought to know that is not the whole story of our city. Ask any of our local newsmen to tell you about the \" Open Schools Movement.\" They'll say we\u00b7re [ 14] ,, a bunch of starry-eyed amateurs-a strictly grassroots-type operation held together chiefly with scotch tape and imagination. But they'll also tell you that we held together-through three interminable uphill years to accomplish what those who thought they knew all about Georgia said never would happen in our generation. Who took part in the \"Open Schools Movement?\" The ordinary people who live in Atlanta-and believe ir or not, much of Georgia. The printer who donated pamphlets and hand-bills on a \"pay if yo u get it\" basis. The businessmen wh-o gave an office and typewriter, stationery, erasers and all that scotch tape. The lawyers who voluntered their time and brainpower to unsnarl the tangled legal thickets. But most of all, the women of Atlanta who licked the stamps, organized the meetings and stayed on the telephone until they finished the job. Yes, the unsung heroines of the \"Open Schools Movement\" are mostly ordinary housewives and mothers who left beds unmade and meals uncooked to insure their children's educational future. Is it over yet? Not by a long shot. There are those with whom old ways die hard. We have beard the nation's most m ilitant racists are marshaling their forces to make a stand at this \"Second Battle of Atlanta.\" You must have heard it too- or most of you wouldn't be h ere. W hen the \"symbolic ten\" go to their classrooms, segregation in Georgia's common schools will be offici ally over. T here are those who wish the ten could be a thousand. There are many who object to even one. But whatever the views that divide them, A tlantans are united in a single hope : that the story that unfolds on August 30th will be m uch different from the one you might have expected . A nd when ten Negro children go to school on Wednesday, the heart of A tlanta will go i n with them. MRS.

[ 19 ] The Atlanta Public Schools: Some Facts and Figures Prepared by the Atlanta Department of Education THE FOUR SCHOOLS TO BE DESEGREGATED Brown High School, named for Joseph E. Brown, Civil War governor of Georgia, is located at 765 Peeples Street, S.W. West End, as the section is popularly known, is an old and established part of the city where the population now comprises low to middle income families, although many longtime residents still retain and live in their fine old homes. It is a section of strong loyalties and considerable pride of accomplishment. The principal of the school, Maxwell Ivey, formerly principal of Hutchinson Elementary School and former Director of Athletics and coach of champion football teams, is serving his first year as a high school principal at Brown. The school may be reached from City Hall by driving west on Whitehall, thence to Gordon, left on Peeples for three blocks. There are about 1200 students and 50 teachers in the school. In 1961 there were 131 graduates with approximately 45 % attending college. Both students and teachers are very loyal to the school and its fine tradition of good conduct and high ideals. Murphy High School was opened in 1930. Its present principal is George M. McCord whose tenure as principal began in 1942. Mr. McCord is well known in national camping circles, is very active in YM CA, and other youth serving organizations. Thei address of the school is 256 C lifton Street, S.E., adjacent to Memorial Drive. The school may be reached by going east on Memorial Drive for approximately 3 miles. There are approximate ly 1200 students and 50 teachers in the school. Of the 205 graduating this year, about 50% continued in college. The community is a section of moderate priced homes, law abidi ng citizens, and church-going population. The school is particularly noted for a balanced program of meeting student needs and interests. Henry Grady High School was created in 1947 from old Boy's High School and old Tech H igh School which was once situated in the same building and on the same grounds. Named for Henry W. Grady, famous orator a nd newspaperman, the school h as taken great pride in its preparation of students for college. Located at 929 Charles Allen Drive. N. E .. ( formerly Parkway Drive) the school is relatively close to the downtown section but is also accessible to very fine resident ial areas of the city. T he school population ranges from families of lower middle in- [ 20] comes to relatively high incomes, with considerable diversity in religious and ethnic composition. It may be reached by way of Peachtree, Ponce de Leon and Charles Allen Drive; or by Peachtree and 10th Street. The principal is Roger H . D erthick (i ncid entally, brother of Lawrence Derthick, former U. S. Commissioner of Education) who is president of the Atlanta Teachers Association. The school has an enrollment of about 1500 students and there are uO or more teachers. Approximatel y 80 % of the students continue their educatio n in college. Northside High School , whose address is 2875 Northside Drive, N .W. , is located in an upper income section of the city. Mr. W. H . Kelley has been principal of the schoo l since its inception in l 950. The school is in that portion of the c ity annexed in 1952. Former coach and Engl,ish teacher, he presides over the school with humor and dignity. The school has an enrollment of approximately 1100 a nd there are about 45 teachers. More than 88 % of the 242 graduates this year will conti nue in college. The school has maintained strong lead in football championships in recent years and is one whe re students indica te a strong school spirit. The school may be re ached by going north on the Expressway to Northside Drive, or by going Peachtree Road to West Wesley, turn left to Nortbside, then right one block.

N 1 ~ Information About the Transfer Students All of the ten transfer students, in the words of Deputy School Superintendent Rua! Stephens, \" have outstanding school academic records, made excellent scores on the tests given them and very favorable impressions\" when the y were interviewed by school officials. Some of the 10 were accepted in spite of the fact that their residences are nearer their present schools than the schools they asked to attend . School officials said that in such instances there were factors of \" overriding importance\" which figured in the decisions to accept the students. In one case, a youth aspired to go to the Naval Academy at Annapolis and was unable to get the ROTC training or special college preparatory courses in m athematics and physics at his present school. School officials m ade it clear from the beginning th at an important consideration in whether a Negro student was accepted or rejected would be his chances of doing well in a new school environm ent. Those finally accepted had composite test scores wh ich in most instances exceeded the median composite scores of the grades and schools to which the y are being transferred.

The primary function of newspapers is to communicate to the human race what its members do, feel and think. Journ a lism, therefore, demands of its practitioners the widest range of intelligence, of knowledge, and of experience, as well as natural and trained powers of observation and reasoning. To its opportunities as a chronicle are indissolvabl y linked its obligations as teacher and interpreter. II. To the end of findin g some means of codifying sound practice in just aspirations of Am erican Journ a lism these gains are se t forth: 1. RESPONS!BlLITY The right of a newspaper to attract and hold readers is restricted by nothin g but consideration of p ub lic we lfa re. The use a newspaper m akes of th e sha re of public attention it gai ns, se rves to determ ine its sense of responsibility whi ch it shares wi th ever y m ember o f its staff. A jo urn a list who uses his power for any selfish or o th erwise un wo rthy purpose is faithless to a h igh tru st. 2. FREEDOM OF THE P RESS Freedo m of th e press is to be guarded as a v ita l rig ht of m a nki nd. It is th e unqu estion able rig ht to di sc uss whatever is not explicitl y forbidden by law, incl uding the wisdom of any restrictive statu te. 3. I NDE PENDENCE Freedom fro m a ll ob liga tions, except th at o f fide lity, to th e pub lic in terest is v it al. A. Pro motion of any p ri vate interest, co ntrary to the ge nera l we lfa re, for whateve r reaso n, is not co mpatib le with honest journalism. So-called news co mmuni ca ti ons from private sources should not be published wi th o ut public notice of their sou rce or e lse substa ntiation of their claims to va lue as news, bo th in fo rm and substance.

ZIP Code, a five-digit coding system, is intended for all classes and types of m ail, he said. \"The first digit identifies the geographical area,\" the postmaster reported. \"The second and third .digits, together with the first, identify the major city or sectional center, and the fourth and fifth digits identify the post office or other delivery unit.\" C. Banks Gladden, Regional Director of the Atlanta region of the Post Office Department, said that the new program for distributing mail was \"born of necessity\" and may forestall postal rate increases. \"The postal service now handles nearly 70 billion pieces of mail annually,\" Mr. Gladden said. \"With the ZIP Code mail will be handled faster and at a lower cost.\" ZIP CODE will not reduce the number of postal employes, he reported. \"Using this new system the Post Office Department will not have to hire additional people to handle increased volumes of mail,\" Public co-operation is expected , Mr. Gladden said, \"because our goal is to reduce operating costs.\" { WHAT IS THE GR.EATER ATLANTA COUNCI~ ON HUMAN RELATIONS ?

FRIDAY, JULY 19, 1963 r \u00b7here Are Right and Wrong Reasons For Opposing the Civil Rights Bill Sen. Richard B . Russell's origin al op p osition to t he P resident's civil r ights bill belabor ed t he pr oposed cure--legisla tion - but ignored the ill-\u20acxistence of Neg ro grievances. In a televi ion i nterview h e h as now , stated t hat h e is \"well aware that we're , livin g in a social revolution.\" It seems to us this a step forward by h im toward the higher ground of recogn izing th at a p ro blem exi ts. The other half of the question still remains, h owever : What t o do about t he problem? Th e opponents of the President's bill ' in Congress w ill not have a stron g arg u' ment if-though t hey recognize exi stence of the national problem he i trying t o cope with-they avoid an y resp onsibility of th eir own for helpin g olve it. Much of t he Sou thern congressional opposition to t he bill is ba sed on ju t such an aveidance of responsibility, emptying the arguments to a large extent. The implication is th at even though a problem is conceded to exist, the Southerner in Congress is willing to block the P r esident's effort to do omething abo ut it while in turn offerin g the alternative of doing nothing about it. It i:eems to us this p os ition is 180 degr ees opposed and 100 per cent weake r than the position taken by the Boar d of the Atlanta Ch a mber of Commerce in i1s own r esolu tion opposing p assage of ~e P resident's bill. * * The Chamber opposition is b ased neith er on den ying that a problem exi ts n or upon the altern ative of doin g nothing a bout solvin g it. On . t he contrary, the Ch amber couples its opposition to the legi lation with a specific and fort hright alternative solu tary p rogress in stead of com pelled progre s. Li ke Sen . Russell, the Chamber ~ oard fo und tl-1.e pu blic accommodations portion of the bill to be \" particularly objectionable\" b ecause it would b ring intru sion of futther federal reg ulation int o private property. But unli ke Sen. Rus ell, t he Chamber Boar d reiterated an alternative t o the legisla tion; it appealed \" t o all businesses soliciting bu sine s from the general public to do so without regard to race, color or creed ,\" solving volu ntarily a p roblem w hose sol ution it does not want t o see federally com pelled. A tlanta itself is an example of a city t hat does not need the P re ident's pro posed law because it is recognizing the p roblem and solving it voluntaril y. T his, it seems t o u s, is the right reason for opposing the p ublic accommodations bill. If the Southern opposit ion to the bill in Congress would move up to this position which has already been taken at home, then i t seems to us the arguments would be geeatly strengthened, the solution of racial problems would be considerably advanced , and the dignit \u00b7 and r eputation of the South would be better served. h l1 M __,_ tt__y____._c~ Sen. l-lart Shifts tlie Ground, Puts ~ ife Into R ights Heari\u00b7n g WASHINGTON- The Negro spiritual goes : \" Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven, Ain't going ther~Heaven.\" WeH, they were talking about Heaven at, of aN places, the civil rights bearing before the Senate Commerce Committee.

In a ddition, the Depa rtments of State, Commerce, and Defense concur that such a study would be very useful. T h e Committee for the Study of t he Metric System of the American Geop hysical Union h as done notable work in this field. The committee h as polled \u00b7 a n umber of professions with r egard t o a dopting the m et ric syst em , a nd h as tur ned up some rather startling figures. The average of some 19 different groups contacted , who consider such a chan ge a dvantageous to them, was a very high 94 percent. Those who felt our export tra de was suffering because, we h a ve n ot adopted the metric system, was 69 per~ cent; and those who felt such a changeover is inevitable, 70 per cent. At this point Mr. President, I should like to h ave reprinted in the RECORD two documents; one the progress report of the committee and the second, an address by the comm ittee's chairman, Mr. Floyd W.

Call to Political Duty EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. FRED SCHWENGEL O F IOWA I N THE HOUSE OF R EPRESENTATIVES Thur sday, Au gust 15, 1963 Mr. SCHWENGEL. Mr. Speaker, in his keynote speech t.o the workshop meeting of the Republican Citizens Committee not long ago Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower called strongly upon \"political amateurs\" to participate in politics. This call is well worth remembering and pondering for the vast majority of cit izens who find it so much easier t.o sit back and do nothing and then complain because they are not governed as they would like t.o be. History plainly indicates that democracies remain strong only so long as their citizens remain actively interested in their governments. Therefore, I call the attention of every citizen t o former President Eisenhower 's r emarks in the article from the Saturday Evening Post of August 10, 1963, which follows below : / A C ALL T O POLITICAL DUTY After a n illustrious career in pu b lic service, no one would criticize Gen.

Another Federal Government dam a t Trotter Shoals on the Savannah River would give the Federal Government a complete monopoly over that great river. If the Federal Governmen t controls power and water, it will control people and t heir employment.

This is not of Interest just to South Carolin la.ns, but has far-sweeping interests to all taxpayers. The pseudoUberals, whatever par ty label they wear, like to call themselves \"The party with a heart,\" or \"The party of the people.\" This infers that conservatives a re heartless and unconcerned with people. But close exam1na~ton of the d octrine and programs of the\u00b7 liberals often discloses that, either their heart is blind or they are more interested in power than people. This is illustrated In the Trotter Shoals project. As a matter of heart, the liberals argue that all of the natural resources of the Nation \"belong to all the people.\" This is the argument they use to ju&tlfy Federal construction of hydroelectric dams, notwithstanding the fact that Federal electricity Is sold at cutrate prices to only a f avored few of the people. Speclfically, this is the argument behind Interior Secretary Udall's demand that Uncle Sam, rather than private enterprise, construct the $78.7 million Trotter Shoals Dam, a project which would remove 22,000 acres of land from State and locnl tax rolls. Would Federal construction of this dam help \"all the people?\" Here 1s what Is ln store for this area. (and other areas in time) if the Government does not build the dam: 1.

Mr. Speaker, why does Presiden t Kennedy refuse to trust the American people ? Why does be enter into secret negotiations with Khrushchev? What has he promised Khrushchev? Who is calling the shots, our President or th e Soviet dictator ? It is time the American people know Just wha t President Kennedy has in mind for t hem and wh at kind of country b e intends to'leave for our children. The r eports of secret agreements reached with Khrushchev should fill us with fearful foreboding. It seems to me Congr ess should dem and a full explan ation to the questions r aised in the following article from the Washington World of August 19, written by Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott. Even Averell Har riman , famous for his negotiations with the R ussians, says our goals and theirs ate absolutely irreconcilable. Therefore, any agreements acceptable to Khrushchev must be against the best interest of the United States. The ar ticle follows : KENNEDY AND KHRUSHCHEv MUCH CLOSER ON AGREEMENT THAN STATEMENTS INDICATE (By Robert S. Allen and Pau l Scott) President Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev are much closer to a step-by-step agreement on a nonagresslon p act between the West and\u00b7 the Soviet block than their public statements Indicate.

Yet we sit here in the Senate, on bill after bill, and vote millions of dollars of Federal taxpayers to continue an illegality. It is about time that we put Members of the Senate on the spot, and the senior Senator from Oregon intends to ..do it. He intends to go from coast to coast to call the roll of Members of the Senate who continue to vote to expend illegally Federa! taxpayers' money and who continue an unconstitutional act on the part of the Congress. Members will not be asked to vote on this issue program by program, but on the whole broad issue of funds going into segregated programs and a ctivities. This issue is becoming one on which we can no longer do any dillydallying. The issue is whether or not the Congress will keep faith with its right hand when its Members take the oath in this body to uphold the law. We cannot justify the appropriation of moneys for the continuation of Federal projects in which there is segregation. Let the people speak in respect to\u00b7 the rollcall that will be made in the Morse bill and similar proposals that seek to bring to an end the illegality that now exists in this country and that has characte1ized the treatment of civil rights in Federal programs. As the Senator from New York has heard me say before, the time has come for the white people of Ame1ica to deliver the Constitution of the United States to the colored people of America ; and I do not intend any longer to sit h ere and permit politicians to get by with what they have been getting by for years in the Senate and covering it with the alibi, when they get back home, \"It is the best we could do.\" I will tell Senators what the best we can do is. It is to act in accordance with the law; and the Supreme Court has made perfectl_y clear that segregation is unconstitutional. I \u00b7 intend to do what I can to take that record across this Republic in the months ahead, before the election of 1964. I do not care whether a Senator is a Republican or a Democrat--he ought to be beaten for reelection in 1964-others will be up for reelection in 1966 and others in 1968-if he does not uphold the law as laid down by the Supreme Court. Mr, JAVITS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have done precisely t h at, as recen,tly as last Wednesday in connection with the Labor-HEW appropriations bill. The reason I made the comment about bipartisanship is that I had the feeling that Members of Congress, when they vote, have an idea that party loyalty requires them to stand by the administration-it might have happened just as well on our side of the aisle if .our party were in the majority-and that they have to stand by and vote to table this kind of amendment. I think the Senator from Oregon has, with his eloquence and warmth, highlighted what I have tried to do, but which I am delighted to join him in highlighting-the fact that, of all the things done in the racial field, with all the fuel added to the fire, this is the worst. It is incon- l 1963 CON GRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE l nr workers or duplicate or repla-0e an existin g service in the same locality. The Service Corps will be a means wh ereby the local community can draw on th e knowledge and skills of the entire Nation . But the progr agm is designed so that these trained volunteers will work with a community, in a program developed by th e community it self . A great deal of careful st udy h as gone int o this pr ogram . More than 50 ideas for projects were submitt ed to th e Presiden t 's St udy Gr oup on a National Ser vice Corps by various State and local, p ublic and private . organ izations throughout th e Nation. Twelve of these suggested project s are outlined i.n detail in the h earing recor d. A glance at these projects will show the very practical work t hat corpsmen would be doing. On an Indian reservation, they could act as instructors for self-help housing programs, run nursery schools and clinics; in a h ospit al for the mentally retarded they would h elp regular personnel as teachers aids and recreational aids ; working with migrants, they would give basic education to adults and vocational guidance to the youngsters. I t is important to remember that these projects are n ot the brain children of a bureaucratic planner. They were worked out by men and women of wide experience wh o know the help that trained volunteers can be to them in -t ackling the problems of a community. Mr. President, th ere are many Americans, young and old, wh o are anxious and a ble to h elp our less fortunate citizens. The Corps will draw n ot only upon enthusiasm of our young people, but upon the wisdom and experience of ret ired persons. There ar e a vast number of people both young and old r eady to h elp if given a way. Obviously, 5,000 men and women can n ot solve all the age-old problems of h uman suffering. But their example will h ave an effect far beyon d their number. If every corpsman inspires 10 oth ers to work in th eir own hometowns , or to join the helping professions, the cost of this progr am will have r epaid itself 10 times over . I know that the dedicated work of th e Service Corps volunteers will show that our material success b as not blinded us to the sufferings of oth ers. T his program will be a true expression of the ideals which h ave m ade this Nation great. The proposed legislation has been con sidered as carefully as any measure with which I have been associated. I am sure that Senators are familiar with its genesis and the steps that have been taken in developing the program to the point where it ls now under general debate in the Senate. In first addressing himself to this noble project, the President called upon members of his Cabinet to develop policy for it. The Cabinet members so selected chose from their departments persons of great talent to undertake the staff work that is necessary to insure that the noble idea would not be emotionalized, but would become hard, tough. and practical in its development. That study group, while small in number, w~ uniquely dedicated to this cause. Once created, the st udy group has developed ideas which were embodied in the legislation t hat came t o the Senate. The m easure was r eferred to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, and assigned to the Subcommittee on Migratory Labor for fwt h er legislative action. Mr. J AVITS. Mr. Pr esiden t, will th e Sen ator yield? Mr. WILLIAMS of New J ersey. \u00b7 I yield. Mr. J AVITS. I am a cosponsor of this par ticular m easure. I believe it r epresen ts an effort to translate th e idealism which has been so pr ominent in the Peace Corps and which h as worked so well abroad to the domestic service of t h e United States. I am satisfied, too, th at the scheme which is proposed t o the Congress parallels, as far as is practical, t he successful patt ern evolved in respect of the Peace Corps, which I believe is one of the more successful initia tives of the United States in the employment, in its foreign aid and foreign development efforts, of the idealism, skill, and interest of young Americans. There is an ample n umber of pr ojects which can profit gr eatly from th e dedication which the National Service Corps will inspire. I feel, too, that it will be a very important channel through which volunteer services of young and old alike may go into areas--many of which have been described-of want, need, illness, and underprivilege, which are enclaves .of backwa.rdness in terms of econ omic advance, such as the areas of migratory farm workers. There the volunteers can be of great benefit. I am very much for the bill. I am a cosponsor, as I said. I have only two r eservations, Mr. President. I hink perh aps, \u00b7 if we n eeded a description of wh at is being done, the words \"practical idealism\" would describe it. I hope very m uch that the practical idealism which is r epresen t ed in the National Service Corps will not be marred by asking the dedicated people wh o will be involved to serve in establishm ents or institutions which follow a. practice of racial segr egation. This is som ething about which I ex pressed my deep concern In the committee. It is something which is the subject of an amendment I h ave h ad printed, which is on th e desk. I realize that t he argument can be made that those who are afflicted should receive help, and that this should be the case even if they are afflicted in a segregated institution. But I think t h e temper of the times is such that we are engaged in a struggle in which t h ere must be some casualties, and those who are the subjects of segregation are the readiest to accept the \"casualty\" of being unable to obtain the ministrations of the National Service Corps when there is a pattern of racial segreg-ation. I hope very much that some way may be found of working out what it seems to me would be so opposite to the patriotic dedication which 1s represented by the Corps. The other subject to which I hope my colleagues in the Senate will give a little 14025 thought is the possibility that we ar e dealing domestically- not abroad, as we did with the Peace Corps- with an an alogy t o the National Guard and th e R OTC. We could allow States to under~ take some of the responsibility for training corpsmen and using them within the respective States. I h ave prepared an amendment upon that score. \u00b7\u00b7 I h ope t o hear the discussion in respect to the bill, to determine wh eth er there is a sufficient amount of interest in the Senate, since th e amendment was turned down in the committee, to justify my offering the amendment. I think the plan is a very sound one, t o allow States to participate in t he process of selection and training, and to allow them to r et ain the trainees within the S tates, a t the same time m aintaining the. cachet of this elite corp, the Nation al Service Corps, exactly as we do with r espect t o National Guard officers and .men as they relate to the military forces of the Nation. The advantage would be that we would stimulf\\te a great increase in the number of people who could be trained, the speed of th eir training, and the speed of their u tilization, and we could invoke State as well as national pride in respect t o the trainees. So, with those two reservations, Mr. . P residen t, which I h ave describedwhich are n ot. in my opinion, reservat ions in any way to chan ge the quality and character of th e plan-having proved the validity of the idea in terms of inspiration to youth and in terms of its usefulness to th ose it serves through the P eace Corps, I believe we have arrived at the point where the National Service Corps is the next logical step in terms of undertaking to give our youth an oppor tunity to show their dedication and their idealism . I am grateful to my colleague for yielding. I am confident t hat by the time the vote occurs on the bill we shall have completely closed r anks in full support of it. Mr. WILLIAMS of New Jersey. Mr. President, I am gr at eful. indeed, for those commen ts by the senior Senator from New York. I am grateful also for his s tr ong support of the proposed legislation, his sponsorship of it, and the contributions h e made in the committee deliberations. ' As the Senator knows, after the bill was drafted 24 Members of the Sen ate joined in cosponsorship of the proposed legislation. The subcommittee which 1\u00b7eceived the bill h eld 9 days of hearings. The record is m ost complete. Not only did the subcommittee hold formal hearings in the Capitol, but also members of the subcommittee, togeth er with members of a committee from the House of Representatives, went on a field trip, to see for themselves how the program could be useful in certain areas. I am sure that Members of Congress who went on the trip will never forget the experiences we had at Osawatomie State Mental Hospital in the State of Kansas and how, beyond question, it was proved to us that even one volunteer can have a dramati- I 1963 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - AP~ENDIX The letter follows: The Job of Ending Job Discriminatio ECONOIIIIC Am ANAI,YZED: U .S. Goons AND SERVICES ACCOUNT FOR 90 P ERCENT, BELL EXTENSION OF R EMARKS SAYS To the EDITOR OF THE NEW y ORK TIMES : Some of your readers might have dra Incorrect inferences from figures you pu Usbed in section IV of your J uly 21 edit! regarding the rela tionship of economic t o the b alance of p a yments ot the Un S tates. You showed \" economic a id\" as a debit in the U.S. b ala nce of p ayments for 1962 a mounting to $3.5 billion- In a year in which the total deficit was $2.3 billion. An unwary r eader could easily h ave dra wn t he Inference t h at all we need to d o to remove the defic it would be to cut \" economic aid\" by $2.3 blllion. Such a n act ion would or course be ineffect ive. \"Economic aid\" as shown in your fig ures Includes \u00b7t he outflow of surplus agricult ural commodities under Publ!c La w 480 ( about $1.3 billion in 1962), plus the outflow of goods and services-and dollars-financed by loans a nd grants und er our f oreign aid. With the policies tha t a re now in effect, m ore than 90 percent of total \"economic aid\" r epresents U .S . goods and ser vlces--not dollar outflow. Under these circumstances, a cut 1n congressional a ppropriat ions would principally r educe U.S. exports--wlt hout affect ing the b ala nce -of-payments d eficit substantially. EFFECT OF CUTS ON EXPORTS Recognizing the difficulty of estimating precisely t he effects of a change in a single f actor in the b alance of p a ymen ts, it ca n be said as a rough a pproxima t ion tha t a \u00b7m eb illlon-dollar cut in \" econom ic aid\" would r educe U .S . exports b y $900 million a nd t h e d eficit 1n t he b alance of payments b y $100 million. (It t he h yp oth etical cut wer e as sumed to affect what Is ordinarily called foreign aid-and not to affect Public Law 480 and the Export-Import Bank-the proportions would be about $800 m1111on reduction In U .S . exports, and $200 million In the U .S. balance-of-paymen ts deficit. ) The conclusion Is clear. Under present p ol!cles, with economic and mlllta.ry assistance to other countries almost entirely taking the form of U.S. goods and ser vices, a lmost no gain to the balance-of-p ayments deficit can be achieved by reducing our foreign aid programs. Moreover, a foreign aid cut made on the mistaken assumption it would have a major impact on our payments deficit would instead serve chiefly to reduce U.S.-produced goods and services purchased for use abroad. I should also like to point out the positive gains to the United States from the establishment of progressive, growing economies abroad-which Is the main purposes of our economic assistance. U.S. exports to the Marshall Plan countries more than doubled from 1953 to 1962. Our exports to Japan more than tripled from 1950 to 1962. In many ot the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, where our economic aid goes today, aid-financed u.s. exports are finding acceptance and be- OF HON. WILLIAM FITTS RYAN OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF R EPRESENTATIVES T hursday, August 15, 1963 Mr. RYAN of New York. Mr. Speaker, the elimina tion of discrimina tion in employment is crucial to the civil rights battle. Until .t here is equality of job opportunity for all our citizens, full equality cannot be r ealized. A m a jor barrier has been discrimination in the apprenticeship progr a ms for skilled jobs. The worker of the future m ust be a skilled worker, and the Negro has been hurt in his search for a job because he is often, too often, unskilled. John F . H enning, Under Secretary of Labor and Manpower Administrator f or the Depa rtment of Labor has written a searching statemen t of the problems facing Government apprenticeship programs which appeared in the July 1963 issue of the American Federa tionist, the official m onthly of the AFL-CIO. I wish to bring his article to the a tten tion of my colleagues: E XPA.NDING APPRENTICESHIP FOR ALL AMERICANS (By J ohn F .

The stu dy estimated that in 1970 America w!ll need 42 p er cent more professional and technical workers than in 1960, 24 p ercent more sales and ser vice p ersonn el, 22 p er cent more skilled workers, and 18 percent more semiskilled.

For example, d uring the past 5 years, the national unemployment rate has approximated a disturbingly high 5.6 . percent, but 1n this p er iod the jobless rate among the unsk!lled has been at least twice that of the skilled . Whatever the course of the economy, the days of the unskilled a ppear numbered. Long ago Benjamin Franklln observed that he who hath a trade hath an estate. The d!fflculty is that he who rath a trade usually hath a white skin. As in Franklin's time, the one certain road to journeyman training ls the apprenticeship system. To some the road seems a narrow, twisted trail, bordered by b igotry and prlvllege. Whatever Its hazards, more than 150,000 young Americans today are found In registered apprenticeship programs. The average apprenticeship embraces 4 years of on-the-job training and normally entails 144 hours of related classroom Instruction a year.

I n July 196 1, t h en Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg announced the Department of Labor would t hereafter req uire the inclusion of a sp ec!flc nondiscrimination statement in all apprenticeship standards of firms handling Gover nment contracts. He further declared a slmillar p rovision wou ld be required in the registration of any new apprenticeship program regardless or Its relationship to Federal works. La bor Department action did not die with the G oldber g pronouncement. The followIng achievements merit attention: I . Within the p ast year, the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training assigned four minority consultants to the task of opening opportunities to Negroes and other minority peoples. Now located in Washington, New Yor k, Chicago, and San Francisco, they counsel with employers, joint apprenticeship committees and unions on a regional basis to encourage acceptance of qualified minority appl!cants. Additionally, they advise minority groups on apprenticeship fundamentals and admission processes. II. Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz on February 27, 1963, announced the appointment of a National Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunity in Apprenticeship and Training. The Committee consists of 15 members; 4 from management, from la bor, 5 from minority organizations, and 2 from the public. The Advisory Committee held its first meeting In Wa6hlngton on May 14 under the chairm a nship of the Under Secretary of Labor. The committee developed a five-point action program: ..

This was one of a number of conferences on civil rights h eld with busin essmen, educators, clergymen, an d lawyers. However, the President noted that genuine equality of opport unity could be meaningful only in a f ull employment economy. National morality and the times will permit nothing less than full job equality, but without full employment this means sh arin g job scarcity regardl ess of r ace, color, creed or n ational origin. Job equality mu.st m ean sharing the bounty, not the scarcity of n ational life. But apprenticeship at its fullest would hardly have the capacity to s olve youth unemployment.

DERWINSKI 0 11' ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES T hursday, August 15, 1963 . Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. S peaker, one of the proofs of retreat of the appease- ment-minded dreamers of the New Frontier is their h andling of the Soviet imposed Eastern European Red governments. The St. Louis Globe-Democrat, in an editorial on Monday, August 12, very concisely discusses our rela tions with Hungary, and under unanimous consent , I insert it into the R ECORD at this point : DIPL OMATIC R ELATIONS WITH A QUISLING As was widely predicted, t h e Un ited S tates is seeking to resume fu ll d1plomat!c relat ions with the H ungarian r egime. R eaders will recall that d1plomatlc ties were curtailed during the 1956 revolution against Soviet control. \u00b7 T he loss of that revolution yoked the H un garians with a quisling regime run by the traitor, Janos Kadar, the lia ison man with the Soviet tank commnnders who decimated his people. Doubtless, the new American move w!ll be hailed by those who seek to avoid irritants in our r elations with the Soviets. But what in the name of diplomacy do we have to gain by sending an American minister to APPENDIX excha n ge views with the special toad y of Mr . Khrushchev In Buda pest ? . Ca n a n yone actually b elieve tha t 7 years after the Buda pest bloodba th. the r egim e enscon ced a t the p oint of victorious Ru ssia n b a yonets Is now the legit imate r epresentative of t he H ungarian people?

The Legacy of Project Mercury EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. CHARLES H. WILSON OF CAL IFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, August 15, 1963 CHARLES H. WILSON. Mr. Speaker, one of the companies actively engaged in the conquest of space is the Garrett Corp. of Los Angeles. This company employs more than 10,000 skilled personnel and produced the important environmental control system (ECS ) for Pr oject Mercury. In the Spring issue of New F r ontiers, a Garrett publication, an article dealing with the aspects of both the Project Mercury program and the Proj ect Gemini progra m bas cau ght my interest. I know many Members of the House are constantly sear ching for more information on the r ace to the Moon, and I t h erefore bring this article to the attent ion of~ colleagues. The article is as follows : Mr. TBE LEGACY OF P ROJECT M ERCU RY (By J ohn W. Bold) He was the last to ~o. Sh epard, Grissom , Glenn , Carp enter, an d Schlrra already had experienced the tense countdown, t h e surge of r ocketing into space, the exhUira tl,Qn of weightlessness and the security of recovery. But Gordon Cooper's 22 -orbit flight was the longest and most precise. ms was, for 29 h ours, a textbook fli ght. But !n the last few hours the NASA-McDonnell t eam used \"all the p ages in the b ook.\" In the last fe w mi n u tes, an electrical problem forced the youngest astonau t to carefully position his s pacecraft, fi re the retro rockets and guide his Fai t h 7 spacecraft down t hrough t he a tmosphere-all by hand.

But now is the t ime for retrospection . The Wgh ly successftU Projec t Mercur ended . During this 5-year p rogram, wh at have we lear ned ? What new t h eories h ave evolved from this Nation's first mann ed space program? What new engineering con cepts wil help us In future spacecr aft d evelopment work? In particular, what have we learned A5241 f r om P roject Mercury that w ill aid us in Pr oject Gemini? An in sight int o the answers to these q u estions can be gained a t Garrett-A!Research , which produ ced the vital environmental control system (ECS ) for Project Mer cury, u nder contra ct to McD.onnell Aircraft Co. It ls now d eveloping a slm!lar system for Project Gexnin!, again un der a McDonnell contract. Both programs are under the tecb n!cal d ir ect ion of NASA's Ma n n ed Sp acecraft Center. Na turally, the experience of both com pa n ies gained in P roject Mercury tran scends into the Gem!ni pr ogra m. \"Exper ience ls the b est sch oolmast er, a nd it h as t a u gh t u s a grea t d eal ,\" r eflects R . Nelso11 , AiR for the Project Gem !ni en vironment al con t rol system . \"At an ear l y meetin g a t McDonnell,\" h e r eca lls, \" we were a ble to sit down a nd quickly determine and analyze problem areas. Imm ediately we foresaw ch anges in the ECS which would be n ecessar y b eca u se of ch a n ges in the mission profile and wh at we learned from Mercury. \"From our point of vtew,\" Nelson believes. \"there 's on e Important \u00b7 thin g we've learned f rom Mercury. Tha t's a bout the man. He h as shown tha t a well trained 'test p!lot ,' who can t hink and act Is more d esira ble t h a n t h e most sophistica t ed , a u tom atic equip ment yet designed .\" \"As a result,\" Nelson continues, \"the Gemini environmental cont rol system will h a ve less a utomatic control more xnanual operation. By reducing the complexity of the system we wlll increase rella b!lity. Since t h e Gemini astrona uts will h a ve ' time on t h eir ha.ncis' to think and act durl.n g their 2 week mission, less a u tom ation ls re quired .\" (F ollowing Gordon Coop er 's flight, Walter C. W!lJiams, associa te d1rector for NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center, told the p ress that if a m a n were not a board the Faith 7 h e dou b ted 1! It could have reentered and been recovered .) I n P roject Gemini, man's requirements wlll be b asically the same. T hus the f u nct ion of the ECS remains u nchanged- to provide two astrona u ts a safe and comfortable atmosphere f or 2 weeks ln space. The system wlll provide f r esh oxygen, cabin and suit pressurization, thermal control, water m a n agem ent and toxlc gas removal. To accompUsh these functions, the Gemini ECS can be grouped Into the following functions: the loop, or circuit, for suit cooling and p ressurization; the cabin loop for cooling and pressurization; the fr esh oxygen supplypr imary secondary, and emergency egress; t h e water management loop; the coolant loop. The egress oxygen supply ls part of the launch a bort system, slmllar to aircraft t ype ejection seat s . It will be u sed !n Gem ini in lleu of the escap e tower system wh ich wns u sed in Proj ect Mercury. The learning curve which \"lifted off th e p ad \" With Mercury h as d ictated som e changes in the Gemini system as compared t o Mercury. Nelson llst.s seven areas In which Mercury experience h as resulted !n Impr ovements : 1. Coolan t subsystems and t h ermal regulation. 2. P ressure r egulation. 3. Moisture rem oval. 4. Su it compressors. 5. System geometry and installation. 6. Testin g. 7. R ells bUity. In addi tion , t h e longer mission profile haa r esulted in new concepts in the following areas : 1. Oxygen su pplies. 2. Heat transfer equipment. 3. P ower su pplles. 4. System servicing. 5. Water management. A5242 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - For oxygen st orage: a different source replaces the high pressure system (7,500 pounds per square inch) used in Mercury. The new source, a supercritical system, will serve as the primary source of oxygen. A high pressure source (5,000 pounds per square inch) wm be secondary. Supercritical storage defies definition In layman's terms. However, it 1s oxygen compactely stor ed in a sta te between a gas and a l!qUld. In orbit the supercritical storage provides enough oxygen with ample r eserve for two men, for 14 days, in the Gemini spacecraft-occupying a minimum of space and weight. During reentry, the high pressure source, which also serves a backup for tt:re supercritical system, will supply the necessary oxygen, pressurization and cool!ng. In Project Mercury, cooling was totally dependent on a cabin and suit heat exchanger boiling water as the coolant. These wa ter boilers were ideal for the weight and short mission of Mercury. In fact, In some instances, water will continue to be used for cooling In Gemini. However, the cooling burden In Project Gemini will f all on sbi: heat exchangers using a recycling oil-type coolant Instead of water. Heat absorbed by the coolant will be radiated Into space instead or boiled off as steam as in Mercury. The constant manual control of the hea t exchangers will also be eliminated. This operatlOJ\\, slm1lar to adjusting a home a ir conditioning system, will be replaced by an automatic system with manual . override. This wm eliminate excessive temperatures Incurred before the bolling process stabilized temperatures in the spacecraft-usually before the end of the first orbit. Expulsion of the coolant in Mercury was accomplished in a pressurized tank with a bladder forcing the water out. The Gemini system wm comprise a closed loop unit including four parallel pumps--two In a loop-for more effective coola nt circulation. During each launch the Mercury l!thium hydroxide canister required special attention. Engineers kept an accurate count on the time each cannister was u sed and tested. This way, launch personnel were assured sufficient lithium hydroxide was available !or carbon dioxide removal tor the entire length of the mission. In Gemini, lithium hydroxide will be used again; however, the amount Installed In the re-entry module w111 be more than adequate. _ The water separator, which was a pneumatically operated sponge type, will be replaced by a static type separator with no moving parts. This development is an outgrowth or Garrett's extensive aircra ft air conditioning and pressurization experience. It ellmlnates the possibility or high moisture content (humidity) In the sp acecraft, and with no moving parts, Is more reliable. Sult and cabin compressors will have greater capacity (23 and 88 cubic feet per minute respectively) but wlll require little additional power. Conservation of electrical power has been a design objective throughout the Gemini program. But It Is not a n easy goa l. In Mercury, A!Research d elivered 49 different ECS components to McDonnell where they were assembled. The Gemini system contains 114. However, as Dick Nelson puts it, \" we are marrying many of the components here at A1Resear ch ,\" so that 84 components will be Integrated Into 11 modules. This m arriage, Instigated by McDon n ell, Insures optimized design and better -performance. The other 30 components will be d elivered ind ividually. T he marriage of componen ts into comp atible modules enables t he subsystem to b e quickly divorced from the sp acecraft. Thus, d u rin g t he countdown If a malfunction occurs In a module It can be quickly r emoved and r eplaced. I n fact t h e en t ire Gemini suit m odule ECS can be replaced in 40 minutes. By comparison, In Mercury it required 24 August 15 APPENDIX hours to r emove the carbon dioxide absorption ca nister alone. What is the status of the Gemini environmental control system ? In May, the first m ajor segment -of t h e Gemini environmental control system was shipped to McDonnell, St. Louis for testing. Dick Nelson took personal charge of the shipment. After telephoning several d epartment heads to insure proper p ackaging and shipment, Nelson swung his 6-foot, 6-inch, 220-pound frame around and said, \"I feel I'm send ing my first child 011 a trip.\" Without a doubt, every AiResearcher who h ad nursed the production of teh equipment a long felt t he same way. Today, comprehensive m anned tests are being conducted to prove the operational compatibility of the environmental control system to the man. These tests are being conducted in A!Research, Los Angeles and soon reliablllty and qualificat ion tests will begin in AiResearch's new lab in Torra nce. This new multimillion-dollar facility is replete with clean rooms a nd liigh altitude chambers (capable of simulating 240,000 feet a lt itude). New data acquisition equipment electronically records more than 300 measurements on each test. This equipment enables deta il-conscious engineers to a n a lyze t est d ata In hours when previously it required days, often weeks. The meticulous task of designing, fabricating and testing the Gemini environmental control system Is a carryover from Project Mercury. Much or the technology gained in Project Mercury ECS Is directly applicable to Gemini. As an example, Nelson cites the Gemini testing program: \"We are not trying to devise new testing procedures,\" be said. \"E,cperlence enables u s to retain the va.Jld concepts u sed In Mercury and add improvem en ts.\" \"The experience we gained In Mercury has gl ven us confidence In our Gemini work and in systems for the future,\" says Nelson. And what of the fu t ure ? Our national goal is to la nd a man on the moon. Just as experience galned ..from Project Mercury ls applied to Gemini, so will Project Gemini d ata be applicable to Project Apollo. The Apollo Spacecraft, with an AiResearch environmental control system aboard, will carry three men to the moon. Cost of the Nation's space program rests heavy on the Federa l budget. Today, cost conscious engineers are optimizing the1r design and using their creative ingenuity to minimize development \u00b7costs. Certainly, the carryover experience \"from Mercury to Gemini will result In vast savings. Wills.rd E. Wilks, In his new book \"The New Wilderness-Wha t We Know About Space\" notes that It will require an average of $7 b1lllon a year to accomplish our national space goal. \"It Is less than the $7.6 billion Americans spend ~nnually on cigars and cigarettes,\" be wrote. At first glance the cost of the Nation's space program seems as h1gh as the apogee of Gemini Itself. However, erudite plann1ng on the p art or the Nat ion al Aerona utics and Space Administra tion has kept costs n ominal. Already, nine n ew astronau ts are selected and are ga ining from experiences of the origina l s even. (At a recent Cape Canaveral pre.se conference, astronaut \"Deke\" Slayton, who is coordinator of Astronaut Activity, quipped to newsmen tha t they preferred to be called the \"original\" r ather than \"old\" astronau ts. ) Of astronauts Schlrra was assign ed the environm en tal oontrol system as his special assignment. In the n ew grou p, J ohn Young, a Navy pilot, will con centrate on the ECS. But it t.ook one of the \" original\" sages to place the manned space program in proper perspective. Astrona ut J ohn Glenn said , \"But the greatest of all benefits from manned space flight will un dou btedly come from some now-unforeseen discoveries occasioned by man's ability to assess the n ew things he encounters In the unknown.\" For the present little Is unforeseen or un known. The Nation's space program stands strong, bolstered by legs of ~xperience. Civil Rights by Bishop Andrew Grutka EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. RAY J. MADDEN I OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, August 15, 1963 Mr. MADDEN. Mr. Speaker, the following are excerpts from a pastoral letter by Bishop Andrew G. Grutka of the Gary, Ind., Catholic diocese. \u00b7 Bishop Grutka's diocese \u00b7contains the great Calwnet industrial region of Indiana. It is made up of many nationalities, races, and religions. This great cosmopolitan region for over a quarter of a century has been actively making a sincere effort to practice civil rights. Our area is probably more free from racial agitation than any area in the Nation. ~ Religious leaders like Bishop Grutka, business leaders, public officials, and all segments of business have been making a sincere effort to practice civil rights. The following is a news item on Bishop Grutka's message and also an editorial from the Gary (Ind.> Post Tribune commenting on the message : GRUTKA ASSAILS RACE PREJUDICE IN PASTORAL LETI'ER A pastoral letter Issued today by Bishop Andrew G. Grutka of the Gary Catholic diocese brands racial prejudice and Injustice as heinous crimes against God and man. Divided Into three p arts, the letter follows t he theme of rac!al Justice and charity. It explains Christian teaching, areas of cone.e m, and the roles of the church and the Individual in elimina ting racial d iscriminat ion, preJudlc~. and segregation. The bish op wrote that the letter wasn 't fulfillment of an official duty. \"It is rather the expression o! a d eep and painfully felt concern for many sorely tried and shrunefully treated members of our community, Negroes In particular.\" He cited the fact that Negroes a re pooling resources and energies and enduring hardships to get free exercise of human rights and dignities. He urged \"right-thinking persons and practicing Christians\" to len d Negroes a h and In this effort. Admitting the message offers no simple or easy solution for the elimination of prejudice, discrimination, or segregation , the bishop said It hopes f or a change in attitude and that Christians will follow the m ean\"ing of John 18 :34: \"A new commandmen t I give you that you love one another.\" Grutka explains the unity of t he h u man r ace by r eferences to the teachillgs of the story of creation In the Bible, to statements by Pope Plus XXII, Pope John XIII Md to action of t he bishops of the United States in 1958. The equalit y of all m en , the human dignit y of all m en and the honor of all men are cited In h is explanation. He explains how foreign Immigrants, once r ejected, have been asslm1lated In to our society and are not easily recognized as distinct ethnic grou ps. Then, he writes, \"Th e Negro is faced with slm llar challenges in h ousing, employment, [COMMITTEE PRINT] J U NE 20, H)63 PRINTED FOR THE USE OF THE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE 88TH CONGRESS 1 ST SESSION 5. /7J V IN ':l1HE SENATE OF THE UNITED s rrArrES J U NE , 1!)63 Mi:. __ _____ ___ introduced the following bill ; which w ns read t wice ::tnd r eferred to the Committee on Commerce A B LL To eliminate clisrrimination in pub1ic acconnnoclation~ affecting interstate commerce.

(a ) The American people ha.Ye become increa. - 7 ingly mobile during the last generation, and millions of 8 American citizens travel each year from State to State by 9 rail, air, bus, automobile, and other mean. . A substan6al 10 number of such travelers are members of minority racial J.20-104-1 2 1 and religious groups. These citizens, particularly Negroes, 2 are subjected in many places to discrimination and segrega- 3 tion, and they are frequently unable to obtain the goods and 4 services available to other interstate travelers. 5 (b) Negroes and members of other minority groups who 6 travel interstate are frequently unable to obtain adequate 7 lodging .a ccommodations during their travels, with the result 8 that they may be compelled to stay at hotels or motels of 9 poor and inferior quality, travel great distances from their 10 normal routes to find adequate accommodations, or make 11 detruled arrangements for lodging far in .advance of sr,heduled 12 interstate travel. 13 ( c) Negroes and members of other minority groups 14 who travel interstate are frequently unable to obtain adequate 15 foo d service at convenient places along their routes, with 16 the result that many are dissuaded from traveling interstate, 17 while others must travel considerable distances from their 18 intended routes in order to obtain adequate fo od erv1ce. 19 (cl) Goods, services, and persons in the amusement and 20 entertainment industries commonly move in interstate com- 21 merce, and the entire American people benefit from the in- 22 creased cultural a:nd recreationa.I opportunities afforded 23 thereby. 24 tion artificially restrict the number of persons to whom the 25 interstate amnsement and entertainment industries may offer Practices of audience discrimination and segrega- 3 1 their goods and services. 2 state commerce by such practices and the obstructions to the 3 free flo w of commerce which result therefrom are serious 4 and substantial.

Among other things, the distinguished Georgia lawmaker said \"no American citizen has the right to select the laws he will obey and those he will disobey.\" Referring lo Lhe wave oC racial demonstrations in recent weeks, he said the American system has always rejected the idea that one group of citizens may deprive another of legal rights in property by process of agitation, demonstration, intimi\u00b7 dation , law defiance and civil disobedience. The civil rights proposals sent to Congress by the President cont.a.in a section that should be repugnant to all Americans, regardless of race. This public accommodations proposal would cnab!e the federal government to enforce desegregation of private establishments catering to the general pltblic. It seems to Sen.

Othe rs Have Rignts, loo w 5 - ? - r We ~ sympathetic with the desire of the Negro race In America to obtain the full civil , educational and economic rights to which they are entitled under the U.S. Constitution , alt hough the bellicose attitude s hown recently by some Negro leaders makes us doubt their wisdom and self-control. But we ;ire emphatically opposed to that part of Presiaent Kennedy's\" civil rights\" program in Congress that would force a man in private business to serve customers against his will. This attitude is based on legal and moral princ iples whic h woul d hol d true eve n if th e ques tion of race were not involved. In the various discussions of this issue which \u00b7we have read recently we havefoundnowherea point which seems vital to us -- the difference between a public utility and a purely private business. Yet It is one that is clearly recognized in law. When a city , a county or a state enfranchises a public utility such as telephones, electricity, gas or transportation it is usually granted a monopoly. In return, it agrees to serve any person who can pay for its services. T he r eas on for this is obvious : if it did not do s o the ci tizen could not obtain the service anywhere else . He would be fo r ced to do without a necessity of life. In like manner it can be a rgued with some plausibility that any citizen, particularly any tax- payer, is entitled_ to any services offered by the Feder state, county or city governments . But a private ~ such as a restaurant, hotel, tllea or arber shop falls in ~either category. It is not a public utility wit h a monopoly franchise, nor is it a public ins titution. Private businesses of the type na med are many -Z-\u00b7 in number and operate in keen competition with each other. In Atlanta and JDQI! ities hundreds of them are operat~ groes for Negroes. It is only logical and r ight that 0thers are operated by white persons for an exelusively white patronage. (As a matter of fact, many s uch bus ine ss es wi li not adm it white pat ro11 s whom th c\u00b7y cons ide r un desi r ab le). lf the owner of such an establishment agrees voluntarily to accept Negro business -- as many in ,\\ t I a II r a r ece mly h a v c: ,; one ~- he has a pe rfec t r i\u00b7,hr to do s o.

But those who do not care for Negro business are not depriving a citizen of some needed service. There. are many other places where he can obtain it.

But what about ' majority rights\", including the right of any citizen to establi sh a legal bus iness Jnd corid ucr it as he sees fit, so long as he operates it honestly and within the law?

' I' Clo (! 7/r2J About Mrs. Murphy's Boar<ling House Atty. Gen. Robert Kennedy fa ces two prob\u00b7 ]ems in promoting a Jaw against racial discrimination in public accommodations. One is to define the businesess ter which the Jaw would apply. The other is to get the bill passed in any form. The attorney general has made it clear that he does not want the law to apply to small places such as \"Mrs. Mur phy's boarding house.\" Yet he objects to a dollar cut-off for affected businesses because it would not be right, and m ight not be constitutional, to tell large businesses they could not discriminate while small businesses could. Per haps he best solution is to leave Mrs. Murphy and the small business distinction out of it, and hinge- the application of the law on businesses \"substantially\" engaged in interstate commerce. That is what the administration originally proposed, and if the formula seems vague, at least it is one with which the courts have been able to deal in federa l regulations applying f, om everything from labor c ses to oleomargarine. In view of some of the Republican as well as Southern criticism of the proposal , this is the most controversial part of the admin istralion program. To Negroes it is one of the most important ; Roy Wilkins, executive secretary of the National Association for the Adva ncement of Colored P eople, says, \" The public accommodations problem is the one that irritates Negroes from morning to night.\" Yet the Chicago convention of the NAACP , though commending tJhe Kennedy program , calls it \" inadequate\" and seeks, in addition, a national fair employment law and power for the attorney general to sue in behalf of all ci vil \u00b7eQtQ ~I \u00b7the rights.

As a consequence, many Americans have heard only a case for the bill. This commentary is an attempt to present the other side. VIRGIN IA COMMISSION O CONSTITUTIO AL GOVER MENT Travelers Buildi.ng, Richmond, Virginia CIVIL RIGHTS AND LEGAL WRONGS T he logic is said to go something like this: All decent Americans should support good th ings. All decent Americans should oppose bad things. Racial discrimination is a bad thing. Bills to prohibit racial discr-i mination are good things. The President's pending Civil Rights Bill is intended to prohibit racial discrimination. Therefore, his bill is a good th in g, and all decent Americans should support it. If this were all there were to it-i f the problem were as simple as A plus B, and therefore C-noth ing could be gained by further discussion of the Presiden t's proposal. All decent Americans would be of one mind. But the problems that have produced this bill are not easy problems, and the bill is not a simple bill. O ne of the great distinctions of the American system is that we try always to distinguish between the means and the end- between the goal itself, and the wa y in ,vhich a goal is reached. Such careful distinctions need to be made in this case. We bel ie-ye th is bill is a very bad bill. In our vie'-'v, the mean s here proposed are th e wrong means. T he weapons the President woul d con trive against race prejudice are the wrong weapons. In the name of achieving certain \"rights\" for one group of citizens, this bill would impose some fa teful compu lsions on another group of citizens. The bill may be well-inten tioned-we question no man's motivation in supporting it- but good intentions are not enough. In th is area, we need good la\"\u00b7 An d the President's bill, in our view, is plain bad law. That is perhaps the least that could be sa id of it. In our judgment, this bill violates the Constitution in half a dozen differen t ways: It would tend to destroy the States' control of their own voting requirements. It would stretch the Commerce C lause beyond recognition . It wrongly would invoke the 14th Amendment. It would undermine the most prec ious rights of property. I It would raise grave questions of a citizen's right to jury trial. The bill would open new doors to the forces of government regimentation. And in the end, because of the violence that would be done to fundamental law, Americans of every race would suffer equal harm. The emotionalism of this turbulent summer is largely responsible for the serious attention now given the bill and for the eminent voices raised in its behalf. In a calmer climate, the bill's defects would be readily apparent. But this is not a calm time; it is a passionate time, and dispassionate thought comes hard. What is here proposed, in this brief pamphlet, is simply that we sit down and reason together. Those of us who strongly oppose the bill believe our position is sound. We should like to explain this position to you. THE BILL ITSELF Mr. Kennedy's omnibus Civil Rights Bill of 1963 (S. 1731 ) is divided into seven major titles. Briefly: Title I relates to \"voting rights.\" It would place ela~rate new controls upon the States' constitutional authonty to fix the qualifications of voters. Title II relates to \"public accommodations.\" It ~,ould co~pel the owner of almost every business establishment m the United States to serve all persons regardless of race. Title III, relating to the \"desegregation of public education,\" would vest sweeping new powers in the U. S. Commissioner of Education and the Attorney General to deal with \"racial imbalance\" in schools throughout the country. Title IV would set up a new Federal agency, the \"Community Relations Service.\" T itle V would continue the Commission on Civil Rights until 1967, and endow it with broad new authority. Title VI amends all statutes providin 0o financial assistance b)' the United States bv orant ' contract, loans, msurance, , b 2 guaranty, or otherwise. It would permit such assistance to be suspended upon a finding of racial or religious discrimin ation. Title VU authorizes the President to create a \"Commission on Equal Employment Opportunity,\" possessed of \"such povvers as may be conferred upon it by the President\" to prevent discrimination under contracts in programs or activities receiving direct or indirect fin ancial assistance from the United States government. This is what the bill is all about. At first glance, p erh aps, man y persons may see n othing \\Hong in the several p roposals. In this emotion al hou r, one is tempted to leap from a sincere conviction that discrimination is wrong, to a fa lse conclusion that a Federal law is the proper way to prevent it. \\ Ale do not believe th e intensely person al problems of racial feeling ca n be solved by a ny Federal law ; the roots go deeper than Congress can reach. In an y event, we believe that whatever might be ga ined by this particular Fede ral lavv, if an ything, the positive harm tha t would be done to constitutional government would far outweigh the hypothetical good . TITLE I-VOTING RIGHTS In the United States, beyond :;ill question, the right to vote is just that-a right to vote. For most Americans, p robabl y the ancient right of property ranks l-irst in their dail y lives; it is the oldest right of all. But as political beings, they view the right to vote as basic. As the Presiden t has said, it is ultimately the -right on which the security of all other rights depends. A moment's reflection, however, reminds us that the right to vote is not an absolute right. C h ild ren cannot vote. L unatics cannot vote. C ertain con victs cannot vote. Bevond these obvious limitations, it is evident that persons in Virgin ia ~annot vote for a Senator from New York. Residents of Alban v cannot vote fo r the \u00b7C ity Council of Schenectad~,. And the man who moves to Ma nhattan on a Monday cannot vote for the M ayor on Tuesday. T hese a re elementary considerations, of course, but it does no harm to spell them out . Wh y is all this so? It is because the right to vote, though it is described in the 15th Amendment as a right accrui ng to \"citizens of 3 the United States,\" is in its exercise a right accruing to citizens of the several separate States. It never should be forgotten that whenever we vote, we vote as citizens of our States. We never vote nationally. W e are always, at the polls, Virginians, New Yorkers, Texans, Missourians. As voters, we are never \"Americans.\" The idea is hard to get accustomed to; but it is so. The Constitution makes it so. Three provisions of the Constitution merit attention . First, the I 5th Amendment. It is very short: The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of 'race , color, or previous condition of servitude. [Emphasis added} . The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. The briefest perusal of M r. Kennedy's pending Civil Rights Bill will disclose that some of its most important provisions are not related to the denial or abridgment ,of the right to vote \"on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" T he 15th Amendment is not relied upon at all . If the bill were based clearly upon the Fifteenth, the position of th e Virginia Commission would be wholly different. W e might obj ect that a bill along these lines were u nwise, or unwarranted; but we would not oppose it as unconstitutional. N o. In its provisions relating to a standard literacy test, and in other provisions, the administration's bill has nothing to do with State deprivals in the area of \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" This bill applies to all citizens, everywhere. Therefo re, other provisions of the Constitution come into play. The first of these provisions appears in the second paragraph of Article I. It tells us who sh all be qualified to vote in what often are termed Federal elections-that is, who shall be qualified to vote for members of the Congress. It reads : The H ouse of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several States, and the electors in each State shall have the qualifocations requisite for electors of the m ost numeroiis branch of the State legislature. [Emphasis supplied}. 4 v1s10ns quoted. The bill would prohibit the use by any State of a literacy test unless such tests met Federal requirements-unless the tests were \"wholly in writing\" and unless a copy of such test were furni shed th e individu al registrant \"within 25 days of the submission of his vvritten request. \" Beyond this, the bill would provide that State literacy tests were of no consequence anyhow: Any person who had completed the sixth grade in a public school or an accredited private school would arbitrarily be deemed to possess \"sufficient literacy, comprehension , and intelligence to vote in any Federal election .\" W e take no position here on the merits of th ese proposals as such. They are as may be. Our contention is th at such proposals plainly deal with the qu alifications of electors in the several States. These proposals have nothing whatever to do with the \"times, places, and manner of holdin g elections.\" In our view, they are simply beyond the authority of the Congress to enact. They pl ainly encroach upon the power of each State to fix \"qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature.\" The President's bill continues with a provision aimed at certain of the Southern States, in which- in a scattering of counties- fewe r than 15 percent of the adult Negroes have registered to vote. The Virginia C ommission would make its own position clear : We h ave no patience with conspi racie~ or chica nery or acts of in timidation intended to deny genuinely quali fied Negroes th e right to vote. We have no patience with acts of bland partisanship that may give the vote to certain white persons and prohibit the vote to Negroes of equal stature. W herever such acts have occurred, they are to be emph atically condemned. We do say this: T here is abunda nt law on the books-there was abundant law on the books even prior to enactment of the C ivil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960-to prohibit and to punish such willful acts by local registrars. All that is required is th at the existing laws be enforced . If the Congress somehow is persuaded th at still further law is required to enforce the 15th Amendment, the Virginia Commission will raise no constitutional objection . In the area of \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the Amendment pl ainl y vests in Congress the power to adopt appropriate legislation . We come back to the larger point. T he key provisions of Title I, as a whole, have nothing to do with \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" T hese prov isions assert, on the part of the 6 There are two other such provisions, but it is needless to quote them. The second proviso impales the smallest hotdog stand upon the transportation of its mustard. There is not a neighborhood soda fountain in American , not a dress shop, not a hat shop, not a beauty parlor, not a single place or establishment beyond the tiniest roadside stand of which it may be said that a substantial portion of its goods, held out for sale or use, has not moved in interstate commerce. We would urge thoughtful Americans, wherever they may live, whatever their views may be on questions of race relations, to ponder the twisted construction here placed upon the Commerce Clause. When the Congress first began to regulate \u00b7'commerce among the several States,\" the object was to regulate the carriers i~ which the goods were hauled. In time, a second area of regulation developed, as the nature of the goods themselves came into the congressional povver. Then a third area developed, as Congress sought to regulate the conditions under which the goods themselves were manufac tured. In this bill, a fourth area is opened up. It is as wide as the world. Here the Congress proposes to impose a requirement to serve. Heretofore, such a requirement has been imposed solely in the area of public service corporations-the telephone companies, electric power companies, gas and water companies-the companies that operate as regulated public utilities. Now the restricted class of public service corporations is to be svvept aside. H ere Clancy's Grill and Mrs. Murph y's Hat Shoppe are equated with AT&T. The n eighborhood drug store is treated as the gas company : It niust serve. v\\lithin the realm of Section 202, the owner has no option ,, no right of choice. Yes, he may reject drunks, rowdies, deadbeats. But his right to discriminate by reason of race or religion- or any other related personal reason-is denied him under the pain of Federal injunction and the threat of prison sentence for contempt of court. At this point in our argument the Virginia Commission would beg the closest atten tion: We do not propose to defend racial discrimination. We do defend, with all the power at our command, the citizen's right to discriminate. However shocking the proposition may sound at first impression, we submit that under one name or another, this is what the Constitution, in part at least, is all abou t. This right is vital to the American systel'n. If this be destroyed, the vvhole basis of individual liberty is destroyed. T he American system does not rest upon some \"right to be right,\" as some legislative majority 11 may defin e \\.vhat is \"right.\" It rests solidly upon the individual's right to be wrong-upon his right in his personal life to be capricious, arbitrary, prejudiced, biased, opinionated, unreasonable-upon his right to act as a free man in a free society. W e plead your indulgence. Wheth er this right be called the right of free choice, or th e right of free association, or the right to be let alone, or the right of a free market place, this right is essential. Its spirit permeates th e Constitution . Its exercise colors our entire life. When a man buys union-made produ cts, for that reason alone, as opposed to non-union products, he discriminates. W hen a Virginian bu ys cigarettes made in Vi rginia, for that reason alone, as opposed to cigarettes made in Kentucky or N orth Ca rolina, he discriminates. W hen a housewife bu ys a na-tionall y advertised lipstick , for that reaso~ alone, as opposed to an unknown brand, she discrimin ates. \\ iVhen her husband bu ys an American automobile, for that reason alone, as opposed to a European automobile, he discriminates. Every one of these acts of \"discrimination\" imposes some burden upon interstate co111.merce. T he exa mpl es could be endl essly multiplied. Every reader of this discussion will think up his own examples fro m the oranges of Florida to the potatoes of Idaho. And the right to discriminate obviously does not end with questions of commerce. T he man who blindly votes a stra ight D emocra tic ticket, or a straight Republican ticket, is engaged in discrimin ation . H e is not concerned with the color of an opponent's skin ; he is concerned with the color of his party. Merit has nothing to do with it. T he man who habitu all y bu ys the Times instead of the H erald Tribune, or Life in stead of Look, or listens to M r. Bern stein instead of to Mr. Presley, is engaged in discrimination. W ithout pausing to chop logic, he is bringin g to bear th e accumulated experience.:_the prejudice, if you please-of a lifetime. Some non-union goods may be better than some union goods; some Democra ts may be better than some Republicans; some issues of Loole may be better than some issues of Life. None of this matters. In a free society, these choices-these acts of prejudice, or discrimination , or arbit ra ry judgment- u niversally have been rega rded as a man's right to make on h is own . T he vice of Mr. Kennedv's Ti tl e II is that it tends to destroy this concept by crea tin g a pattern for Federal intervention. For the firs t time, outside the fu ll y accepted area of public utilities, this bill undertakes to lay down a compul sion to sell. 12 W e raise the point : If there can constitutionally be a compulsion to sell, vvh y cannot there be, with equal justification, a compulsion to bu y? In theory, the bill is concerned with \"burdens on and obstructions to\" commerce. In theory, the owner of the neighborhood restaura nt imposes an intolerable burden upon interstate commerce if he refuses to serve a white or N egro customer, as the case may be. But let u s suppose that by obeying some injunction to serve a Negro pa tron , the proprietor of Clancy's Grill thereby loses the trade of ten white patrons. In the South, such a consequence is entirel y likely; it has been demonstra ted in th e case of South ern movie houses. Ca n it be said th at the refusal of the ten whites imposes no burden on intersta te commerce? Plainly, these ten intransigent customers, u nder the theory of this bill, have imposed ten times as great a burden on commerce among the several States. Shall they, then , be compelled to return to C lancy's for their meals? Where . does this line of reasoning lead us? How would all this be enfo rced? Under Title II , the Attorney G enera l woul d be req uired to in vestiga te complaints of denial of service. Persistent acts of discrimi nation would be prohibited by Federal inj unction s, obtained in the name of the United States. Any person who attempted to interfere with Clancy's decision would be subject to individu al injunction. And at the end of every such proceeding lies the th rea t of fin e or imprisonment fo r contempt of court. There would be no jury trials. This has been a very abbreviated summary of the \"public accommodations\" fea tu res of the Presiden t's bill. A definiti ve analysis could be much extended. Not only is the Commerce C lause di storted beyond recognition, th e provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment also are warped to cover individual action as opposed to State action. O ur hypothetical C lancy could not call upon the police to eject an , unwan ted customer, trespassin g upon his booths an d tables. Reliance upan local police to en force old laws of trespass, under this bill , would be regarded as an exercise of \"State action.\" C lancy has become th e State. Like Louis of old , he too may say, \"L'etat, c'est moi.\" TITLE III-DESEGREGATION OF PUBLIC EDUCATION Titl e III of the P resident's bill goes far beyond all decisions of the Supreme Court in the field of school desegregation , for it im- 13 r plicitly couples the formal desegregation of public schools in the South with the elimination of racial imbalance\" in schools throughout the land . Th e bill proposes to achieve these aim s by vesting broad new po,vers in th e Commissioner of Education and the Attorney General. Even private schools, if th eir pupils received tuition grants from a governmental source, would be brought into line. The opening prov isions of Title III authorize the C ommissioner, upon application from local school offici als, to engage in a wide variety of programs of advice, technical assistance, grants, loans, contracts, and training institutes. The Commissioner would con trol the amounts, terms, and conditions of such grants. They would be paid on the terms he prescribed. H e alone would fi x all \"rules and regul ations\" for carrying out these programs to promote desegregation and to relieve \"racial imbalance.\" Presumabl y, the authority of Congress to promote th is bu sywork for the Commissioner is to be found in the fifth section of th e 14th Amendment. This is the section th at empowers Congress to adopt \"appropriate legislation\" in support of the Equal Protection Clause. If th e Equ al Protection C lause trul y vvere intended to p rohibit a State from maintainin g raciall y separa te public schools, such legislation perhaps would be \"appropriate.\" The history of public education in th e United States, in the yea rs immediately following the purported ra tification of the 14th Amendment in 1868, utterly denies an y such intent ion. To this day, no law of the United States requi res desegrega tion . T hese programs of the Commissioner of Education are cart before horse; th ey are th e sort of programs that would implement a law if th ere were a lavv; but there is no law. There is the Supreme Court's opin ion of 1954 in Brown v . Board of Education, and there are oth er high court opinions emana ting from it, bu t impressive and historic as these decisions may be, they are still no more than judgments bindin g named defendan ts in particu lar lawsuits. It should be emph asized, aga in , th at th ese decisions have nothin g to do with \"racial imbalance\" in public schools. T hey are limited to judgments req uiring th at the States shall not den y to any person on account of race th e rioht to attend an v. school it maintains. The . 0 shi ftin 0o of studen ts from school to school in order to \"remove . racial imbalance,\" w ith or wi thou t Federa l aid and regulation, 1s not w ithin th e ambit of the deseo0 reoa tion decisions. U nder th is gross 0 distortion of the I 4th Amendment , school children th roughout the country w~uld become pawns in a game of power politics. 14 It seems to us desirable to keep this distinction in mind , bet,,, ,een laws en acted by the C ongress, and judgments imposed by the court. T he C onstitution is the supreme lavv of the land, but when the court acts in a suit arising under the Con stitution it acts judicially, not legislatively. If local school boards throughout th e South are to be prohibited by law from maintaining separate school systems, a law mu st be passed \"pursu ant to the Constitution\" to impose such a proh ibition. Until then , an y such grants and loans and trainin g programs as th ese vvould appea r premature. And we would take the position , in the light of th e history of th e 14th Amendment, that such a law would n ot be \"pu rsu ant to th e C onstitution.\" It would violate the plain intention both of those who framed the amendment and also of the States that ratified it. Such legislation would not be \"appropriate\" legislation . Mean while, we do n ot intend to be captious or legalistic . The Brow n decision h as been treated as if it were indeed legislation. For good or ill , the desegrega tion of public schools proceeds. Th ese particular p rovisions of T itle Ill are better subject to criticism simpl y as manifestation s of the burea ucratic Federal sprawl. M.ore serious, in our view, are the provisions of Titl e Ill th at would vest elabora te new powers in the Attorney General. Th e effect of these pro visions woul d be to th row the enti re massive weight of the D epartment of J ustice, with its unlimited resources, into th e scales of almost an y paren t in search of a free laws uit. The basic complaint would be th at some local school board \"had failed to achieve desegrega tion .\" But as we h ave tr ied to point out, in th e overwh elming majority of school districts in the South, th ere is now n o legal requirement that local school boards even attempt to achieve desegregation. Before there ca n be a fa ilure of a dut y, th e re mu st firs t be a dut y. These p rovisions of the bill simply ass ume th e duty, and leap to its fa il ure. Ou r appreh ension is that the awesome power here proposed, for a proli fera tion of suits \"in the name of the United States,\" would create more tu rmoil th an it would settle. T he \"orderl y progress of desegrega tion in publ ic educa tion\" would anced , but impaired, as rese ntments were stirred up that otherwise might be peacefu ll y resolved. And we cannot see _the,. .en d to the burea ucracy ~hat could be req ui red to prosecu te suits m th e name of the Umted States,\" once thi s precedent were set in the sin gle area of school desegregation. 15 TITLE IV-ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMUNITY RELATIONS SERVICE This title \\.vould create a new Federal agency, the \"C ommunity Relations Service,\" headed by a director at $20,000 a year. P resumably, it would ful fi ll some functions not now ful fi lled by the Civil Rights C ommission, the P resident's Fair Employment Practices C ommittee, th e established churches and va rious civic bodies, the countless racial commissions around the country, and the civ~l rights division of th e D epartment of Justice. The duties of this Service would be \"to prov ide assistance to communities and persons therein in resolving disputes, disagreements, or difficulties relatin g to discriminatory practices.\" [Emph asis supplied} . \\ Ve are not inclined to haggle over the amount of time, energy and money th at might be wasted by one more Federal agency in the civil rights fi eld. \\A.Te do ca ll attention to the italicized lan guage. In our own view, it simply is not the fun ction of Congress, under anv provisions of the United States Constitution, to dispa tch Feder;! agents to countless commu nities in order to resolve racial disagreements among \"persons therein.\" TITLE V-COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS The Virginia Commi ssion on Constitutional Government expresses neith er opposition to nor support of Title V of the President's bill. This portion of the bill would extend the life of the Commission on C ivil Rights to N ovember 30, 1967, and would lay down certain standardized rules for its fu rther hearin gs and investigations. In our own view, th e Commi ssion on Civil Rights has contributed little or nothin t:,o toward the unravel ino0 of the knottv tangles of \u00b7race relations in the United States. Its recommendations in the spring of 1963, proposin g the withd ravval of gra n ts, loans, and even contracts fro m South ern States th at did not meet its own notions of right condu ct, amounted to an outrageous proposal for denial of the v~ry equal p rotection s it professes to su pport. We perceive no useful achievements of thi s Comm ission, bu t we raise no constitutional objections to its con tinu ance. 16 TITLE VI-NONDISCRIMINATION IN FEDERALLY ASSISTED PROGRAMS T itle VI of the P resident's bill is not long. It had perhaps best be quoted in full: Sec. 601. Notwith standing an y provisions to the contrarv in an y law of th e United States providing or authorizin g dire;t or indirect fi nancial assistance fo r or in connection with any program or activity by \\,vay of grant, contract, loan , insurance, guara nty, or oth erwise, no such law shall be interpreted as requiring that such fi nancial assistance shall be furni shed in circumstances under which individu als participating in or benefi tting from the program or acti vity are discrimin ated against on the ground of race, color, rel igion, or national origin or are denied p3rticipation or benefi ts therein on th e ground of race, color, religion , or national origin . All contracts made in con nection with an y such program or activity shall contain such con ditions as the President may prescribe for the purpose of assuring th at th ere shall be no discrimin ation in employmen t by ar. y contractor or subcontractor on ' the ground of race, color, religion , or national origin. [Emphasis supplied}. T he thinly veiled intimidation of T itle VI goes back to a statement made by Attorney General Robert Kennedy in London in October of 1962. A t th at time, he speculated publicly that a threat to withdraw federal su bsidies, gra nts, loans, and contracts might be used as a club over the Southern States. Mr. Kennedy was quick to point out that such a threat woul d have to be used with great delicacy . He seemed un sure of its desira bi lity. He did not defend its constitutionality. H e wa s just thinki ng aloud. \u00b7 In April of 1963, the Civil R ights Commission evidenced no such fin esse. T he C ommission recommended Had y to the President tha t he seek power to suspend or cancel eith er all , or selected parts of, the Federal fi nancial aid that now Hows to such Sta tes as M ississippi, \"until la..,vs of th e United States.\" It was unclea r precisely how a judicial determination wou ld be reached that entire States had fa iled to com ply with the Constitution and laws of the United States, but this small question of due process apparentl y troubled the Commission not at all. 17 Th e question troubl ed Mr. Kennedy. !n his press conference of Ap ril 17, th e President blinked at this startling proposal and turned away from it: I don't have th e power to cut off aid in a general way as vva~ p roposed by the Civil Rights C ommission, and I would think it would probabl y be unwise to give the President of the United States that kind of power beca use it could start in one State and fo r one reason or another might be moved to another State w hich has not measured up as the P resident would like to see it measure up in one way or another. It is a fair question to ask what happened. W hat happened between April 17, when the President voiced these comments at his press conference, and June 19, when his majority leader . intreduced his Civil Rights Bill? H ow did a power that was \"probabl y umvise\" in April become a power th at was \"essential\" in June? T he obvious answer is th at the interim was marked by widespread racial demonstra tions. But 1t is not pl easa nt to conclude that the P resident of the Un ited States may be coerced , intimidated, or black jacked into changing his mind so swiftly on a legislative proposal of fatef ul importance. W hat h'lppened? W e ea rnestl y submit that the pun itive terms of Title VI of this bill threa ten gross violation of every p rinciple of due process of lavv. N o provision whatever is made fo r determin ing when individuals \"participating in or benefittin g from\" various programs are \"discriminated agai nst.\" The two sentences of this Ti tl e define no terms. T hey propose no judicial in qui ry. T hey leave hu ndreds of mill ions of dollars in \"Federal fu nds,\" pa id fo r b y all of the people- black, white, Liberal, C onserva tive-at the uncontrolled discretion of the President or someone else who may determin e this \"discrimination.\" These p rograms include aid to dependen t children, aid to the blind, aid to the permanentl y disa bled. T hey include funds for educa , hospital co nstruction, pu blic housing, the insu,rance of bank deposits. Federal personnel would be au thorized to supervise loans by banks an d building and loa n associations, farm financing of all kinds, govern men t su bsid ies, conservation programs, small business loa~s an d contracts in an y activity affected by government loans' in surance ' 0ouara nties ' or bora nts. If a Federa l aoencv made an 0 \u00b7 administrative fi ndin t,o th at discrimination exists, Federal support 18 could be withdrawn and the institution or program wrecked. To perm it a P resident-any President-to suspend such programs on his own unchecked conclusion that certain beneficiaries are \"discriminated again st\" wou ld violate the whole spirit of uniformity that pervades th e Constitution . T he supreme law of otir land provides that \"direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers.\" Duties, imposts and excises \"shall be uniform throughout the United States.\" There must be a \"uniform rule of n atu ralization\" and \"unifo rm Ja,.,vs on the subject of bankru ptcies.\" Many other provisions attest this same concept of equal treatmen t among the States. Only by a fa ntastic distortion of the congressional power under the 14th and I 5th Amendments could thi s Title VI be justified. Its effect would be to penalize th e many for the occasion~! unlawful conduct of the fe w. Its potential application would jeopardize the very lives and well-bein g of thousands of innocent and law-abiding persons, including veterans, blind persons, and disabled persons, in order to bludgeon a h andful of State officials into line with a President's desires. It seems to us sufficient merel y to quote the language of this tyrannical Title of the Presiden t's bil l. The language speaks most eloquently for itself. TITLE VII- COMMISSION ON EQUAL EMPLOYME NT OPPORTUNITY T his fin al substantive section of the bill authorizes the President to establish a \"Commission on Equal Employmen t O pportun ity.\" This permanen t agency of the government would be headed by the Vice P resident; the Secretary of Labor would serve as vice chairman. There would be up to 15 members in all. An executive vice chairman would run the opera tion . T he C ommission would be empawered to employ \"~u~h ~ther ? ersonnel as may be necessary.\" Th e bill defines the comm1ss10n s duties: It shall be the function of the Commission to prevent discrimination against employees or applicants for employment because of race, color, religion, or na tional origin by Government contractors and sub contractors, and by contractors and sub contractors participating in programs or acti vities in which 19 direct or indirect fin / ncial assistance bv the United States Government is provided by way of gra~t, contract, loan, insurance, guaranty, or otherwise. The Commission shall h ave such powers to e ffectuate the purposes of this title as may be conferred upon it by the President. The President may also confer upon the Commission su ch powers as he deem s appropriate to prevent discrimination on the ground of race, color, religion , or national origin in Government employment. [Emphasis supplied} . Again , it seems to us necessary merely to quote the provisions of the bill in order to make their autocratic nature evident to everv thoughtful observer. The power here proposed to be conferred upo~ the President is virtually unlimited. N o legislative limitations of an y sort a1e suggested. The President may confer upon the Commission \"such powers as he deems appropriate.\" And whether these include the power to impose criminal sanctions, or to seek civil injunctions, or to abrogate contracts awarded u nder sealed bid, no man can say. The Commission's powers would be whatever the President regarded as appropriate; and the defin ition of \"government employment\" is as wide as the Federal budget itself. T he administration's bill proposes, in effect, that the Congress abdicate, and turn its legislative powers over to the \\ i\\lhite H ouse. T he powers here demanded i.l rc not the powers rightfull y to be exercised by a President in a free country. T hese are the powers of a despot. There is a fi nal T itle VIII in the bill, authorizing the appropriation of \"such sums as are necess~ ry to carry out the provisions of this Act.\" What these sums might amount to, aga in, no man can say. This is the package Mr. Kennedy has asked of the Congress. H e has asked it in an emotional hour, under the pressures of demonstrators who h ave taken violentl y to the streets, torch in hand. W e of the Viroinia C ommission ask ;vour quiet consideration of b the bill. And we ask you to communicate you r wishes to the members of the C ongress who represent you in the H ouse and Senate.

GAMBLE, SR. Attorney-at-Law-Retired of New Orleans Bar HARRY PREFACE To those who respect Harvard wisdom, listen to the warning in 1958, of Dr. Mc llwain, a Professor of the Science of Government: \"Never in recorded history, I believe, has the individual been in greater danger from government than now; never has law been in greater jeopardy from arbitrary will; and never has there been such need that we clearly see the danger and guard aga inst it.\" He does not name al l t he sources of this danger; but those most obvious are: The President, when he commands Federal troops to invade States; or, for example, issues \" executive orders\" threatening to take bread from the mouths of thousands of working people, by withdrawing Federal funds appropriated for local projects, till his commands are obeyed; AND the Attorney General, who may and does pin the badge of a U.S. Marshal's authority on hundreds of bullyboys, and sends them out to intimidate local authorities to bring them to his views; AND bureaucrats who freely issue \"directives\" to control the daily lives of thousands of people, from one to two thousand miles distant from Washington; people whose local laws and culture may be very different, even repugnant, to those of the area of their upbringing; AND the Supreme Court commanding obedience to their indefensible decisions, under threat of unlimited deprivation of liberty and p roperty for noncompliance. It is true the Professor relies largely on an \"able, honest, learned, and independent judiciary\" to protect us from the aggressors, but adds: \"I am not defending indefensible decisions of our courts. I would not shield them from the severest criticism.\" It is these lawbreakers and unauthorized lawmakers who are dealt wi th in the follo w ing paper. New O rleans, Louisiana, July 14th, 1963. H A RRY P. GAMBLE, SR. O f the New Orle ans Bar N o te l : Pe rtine nt p rovisi o ns of th e Const itutio n a re fo und in the a p pend ix. Note 2: All e mphasis supplied by th e writer. l.an ti ARE THE LAWBREAKERS The parrot cry, \"Obey the law, \" is heard daily from Washington. Yet the chief lawbreakers are there; among them, the President, who issues unauthorized \"executive orders, \" and commands the Federal army to invade the States. But the cocks of the roost, are the nine men on the Supreme Judicial Bench of the United States. These nine men are uncontrolled. Their power is supreme, irresistible, and absolute, in our so-called democracy. Yet in every age in the long ages of government, it has been demonstrated, in the language of Lord Acton, often quoted, that: \u00b7 \"Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" There is no authority in our system to check these nine men; or correct their mistakes, however grievous; or nullify their seizure of unauthorized power; or punish their acts of tryanny. From time to time the earlier Judges sitting on that Bench have recognized their freedom from control, and asserted that it was not their function to go beyond \"judicial review.\" Chief Justice Marshall (1801-1835) briefly defining this Judicial Review said: \"The Court is merely a legal tribunal for the decision of controversies brought before them in legal form.\" Judicial review means in general, that in cases appealable to the Supreme Court, it will review the evidence introduced in the lower court, and weighing the law applicable, will affirm, reverse, or cor rect the judgment there rendered. The law applicable has never been held to mean that the Court may contrive, forge, or enact a law, which in its opinion fits the case, but shall render a de. cision on existing law enacted by the lawmaking power, constitutionally authorized so to do. If the law applied to the case below, in the opinion of the Courts is not constitutionally authorized, then it applies other existing law; still not contriving one of its own, either by strained interpretation, or downright enactment. No one has ever contended otherwise. -1 - A recent announcement of that limitation by Chief Justice Vinson ( 1946-1953) declares: \" Since we must rest our decisions on the ConstitutiG-n alone, we must set aside predilections on social pol icy and adhere to the settled rules which restrict the exercise of our power to judicial review.\" (346 J.S. 240 1953) Judge Harlan, father of the sitting Judge Harlan, stated the same thing in this language: \"When the American people come to the conclusion that the Judiciary is usurping to itself the function of the legislative department, and by judicial construction is declaring what should be the public policy of the United States, we will be in trouble. \" In referring to the 14th Amendment, fraudulentl y adopted in 1868, which has become a bottomless fish hatchery, from which the Cou rt has hooked some queer fish, never before suspected of inhabiting those waters, the eminent Judge Holmes (l 9021938) said: \"I cannot believe that the Amendment was intended to give carte blanc to embody our economic or moral belief in its prohibitions. \" Referring to the rights reserved to the states in th e 9th and l 0th Am e ndme nts, he re marked that: \"There is hardly a ny limit but the sky to invalidating these rights if they happen to strike the majority of this Court as for an y reason undesirable.\" 251 U.S. 580 ( 1930) And Chi ef Justice Hu g hes ( 1930-194 l) co mmented: \"It is not for the Court to amend the Constitution by judicial decree.\" This fra nk spoken jurist once observed, \" The Constitu ti on is what the Supreme Court says it is.\" Thi s asse rtion of a subme rg e d t ruth d id not much shock the careless American peo p le; thoug h d ispleasing to the Co urt. Judg e Doug las, still sitting, exp loded fu rio usly in the Ca lifornia-Colorado wate r di vers io n case, a g a inst th e ma jo rity d e cision, saying : \" This case wi ll be marke d as the baldest at- -2- I tempt by Judges in modern times to spin th ei r philosophies in the fabric of the law in derogation of the will of the legislature.\" It will come as a surprise when disclosed that th is same Judge (one of the law school teachers ap pointed, maybe a DEAN) in the earlier case of th e Black School decision of 1954, took a contra ry stand, and agreed to founding the decision in that case on the mind reading speculations of a Swe de, Gunar Myrdal, and associates, who figured that it would make the Negro children feel bad if they could not sit with white children in public schools. THEIR OWN WILL THE ONLY RESTRAINT OF THESE NINE MEN In reorganizing their absolute freedom from control, the Court has frequently stated, to use the words of Chief Justice Stone (1925-1946). \"The only check on our exercise of power is our own sense of self-restraint,\" Butler case. In th us admitting their freedom from control, they declare they are a super-governm ent. Such a super-government, not elected by the people, but appointed for life, is not tolerated by the great democracies of Europ e,-not by England, nor France, nor Germany, nor Italy. This fact is unknown to the great mass of the American people. The continuance of this uncontrollable power in the hands of nine men, is undeniable proof that a potent segment of our political leadership does not trust democratic processes; and have somehow contrived to surround these mere human beings with a halo of sanctity not merited in the experience of life, except by saints; a sanctity which endeavors to protect them from criticism, no matter what. It is as if assumed and asserted that the appointment by the President of a politically deserving friend (or to get rid of an opponent), w ill make that politi cian qualified to sit o n the highest Tribunal in the Nation . In more than one instan ce such an appointment by th e Presiden t has been charged to this mode of riddin g himself of an active opposition candidate. - 3- President Lincoln appointed Senator Samuel B. Chase to be Chief Justice in 1864, when Linco ln was a candidate for re-nomination of the Repub lican Party, and Chase was an avowed candidate for the same nomination. It has been printed that a political deal was made at the 1952 Republican National nominating convention between Governor Warren, who controlled the 72 votes of California, and Eisenhower managers-Eisenhower to get the votes for a decisive lead to the nomination, and Warren to be paid off by appointment to the Supreme Cou rt. This may or may not be true, but since Warr en was appointed shortly after Eisenhower assumed office - with no visible judicial qualifkations for that high office; low-minded persons could scarcely be censured for raising their eyebrows. It may be that a miracle can be performed by hanging a black cloth on a politic i an, to forthw ith convert him into a Judge; but few would believe such a ceremony preceded by a sordid poli tical deal, is a correct method to procure SUPE RMEN for the Supreme Bench. It may be accepted as an axiom in government that once a politician, always a politician. A pol itician cannot escape from a life long practice of proposing to amend and im prove existing law. His success in politics has been founded on such promise and performance. That mode of thinki ng has become second nature. And though politicians are an honorable necessity in a democracy, without whom it could not function, the highest tribunal in the land is no place for them. School boys know that it is not the business of Judges to make laws, or amend laws, but to interpret an d apply the laws enacted by the lawmaking power authorized so to do by the Constitution; and then onl y in cases duly brought before them. Re l yin g on self-restraint by men exercising uncontrolla ble power is the ze nith of folly-proven in all ages. Thomas Jefferson who spent fifty years wi th public men in public affai rs, expressed his distrust of judicial restraint in these words: \"The Judicia ry is the instrument which is to press us at last into one consolidated mass .. . . If Congress fails to shield th e States fro m dangers so pa lpable and so immin ent, th e States - 4- Can Southerners afford to be ti ht with their mone in must shield themselves, and meet the invader foot to foot.\" (Thomas Jefferson to Archibald Thweat, 1821) And: \"The Judiciary of the United States is the subtle corps of sappers and miners constantly working underground, undermining the foundation of our constitutional fabric.\" This worldly wise man did not mean to imply that the men who would serve on the Supreme Bench were dishonest or \u00b7traitors; but simply that their natural bent would be to make the National Government of which they were a part, supreme. In the long history of the Court, not more than one instance is suspected to have brought the shame of lack of integrity to the Supreme Bench. That is not t he charge. The charge is that when appoint ed they do not know anything about judicial restraint and ar e not l ikely ever to be much i mpressed by that limitation . For they are not appointed on the basis of their judicial training and learning. That these men not elected by t he people to reign over t hem, a t ta i n their appointments for politica l reaso ns, an d not for t hei r judicial qual ifications, is a b und antl y p roven by the fact that it is rare indeed t o a p point a member of a state Supreme Cou rt, o r a Judge from the Federal Judiciary, wh er e men of p r o v en a bi lity and many years of experience are to be found. In recent years, i n r espect to t h is \"judicial restraint\" a new note has been interjected by some now sitting on th e Bench, Judge Do ugla s among them; that it is within th e p r o v i nce of judicial action to do some lawmaking; wh ic h as we shall see, th ey have boldly done-united wi th its partner, lawbreaking. This far afield lawmaking and law breaking in recent years have drawn sharp a nd unusua l criticism from the official o rgan of A mer ican lawyers, the American Bar Asso1ciati o n; a nd t_ he official condemnation of an assembly of Chi ef Justices of state Supreme Benches. Judicial seizure of power has grown so intolerable, that an Amendment to the Federal Constitution is now in process of adoption for holding them in check, and reducing th eir powers of super- - 5- government. This Amendment has alread y b een adopted by several states. HOW THESE SUPERM EN BREAK THE LAW When these nine SUPERMEN do not like a law enacted by Congress or a State Legislature, th ey shatter it. All they have to do is to call it unconstitutional . That it is not authorized, or is prohibited, by the Federal Constitution; and since , in the words of Chief Justice Hughes, the Constitution is what they say it is, the law is broken, and an y decision which had before held it to be la w is also broken, however long that decision may have been held to be law. In our kind of democracy, there is no remedy. Often the law is busted by the vote of one of the SUPERMEN. Four say ' tis or 'taint const itutional; and four say 'taint or 'tis; then one decides the question-to make a majority of fi v e to four . Right here it is easy for the unawed mi nd to become confused with trying to keep up with th e \"now you see it, now you don ' t, \" juggling going on among the SUPERMEN . Fo r in one decision yo u see that five are truly SUPERMEN, and the ot her four are bush leaguers; bu t in the next d ecisio n, the bush leaguers are bac k in t he majo rs, and some of the former SUPERMEN are ba nishe d to the minors.

If in its decision the Court of last resort pronounces th is law to be constitutional, then it is the law. Somewhat carelessly, this decision is itself sometimes referred to as the law in question. Then business and government, state and national, may and often do, expend millions, even billions, on faith thereof. That to the ordinary mind seems logical. The questioned law is settled. Let's go. But to th e SUPERMEN , no! Any upcoming set of SUPERMEN may, and often do, assert that their predecessors were not the SUPERMEN that thei r contemp oraries thought. Not at all . That was a big mistake. They were bush leaguers, or old fogies who did not know what was what. This is most extraordinary, since their own claim to absolu te supremacy is founded on the proposition that as a body they are SUPERMEN. Their puzzling refusal to regard each other as SUPERMEN, while demanding that in a body they be so regarded by the people, is disclosed by the fact that: \"In the brief span of sixteen years, between 1937 and 1953, this Court has reversed itself not fewer than thirty-two times on questions of constitutional law.\" Kirkpatrick in \"The Sovereign States,\" p. 270. This work is less than 300 pages, by a distinguished journalist, quite understandable by laymen. Published by Henry Regnery Co., Chicago. In every one of these instances, and many more, befo re and afte r, where their predecessors had presu ma bly settled the question by declaring that a d isputed act of Congress or Legislature is constrtutional I and therefore the law, the reversal broke that law. In some of th ese instances, that law had been settled for ma ny years, in the meantime frequ ently referre d to and a p p roved by subsequent Supreme Court decisio ns. A case of reversa l and breaking, occurring since - 7- the above record of thirty-two times in sixteen years, is one which will presently be brought under inspection. That was a decision of the Supreme Court of 1896, declaring an act of the Legislature to be constitutional law. In the interim of nearly sixty years, Supreme Courts presided over by such eminent jurists as Chief Justices White, Taft, Hughes, and Stone, had quoted that decision with approval. It was the law. THE SEGREGATION LAW That law was an act of the Legislature requiring the separation of the races in passenger transportation. In a case before the Court in 1896, it was directly charged that this state law violated the 14th Amendment in not granting equal rights to Negro travellers. It was there decided that if the accommodations were equal, the separation of the races was not prohibited by the Amendment. This established the so-called doctrine of \"Separate if equal; \" and through the years up to 1954, hundreds of millions have been expended in separate schools and other construction, and in educating Negroes in separate schools. This was the case of Plessy vs. Ferguson; 163 U.S. 537. In referring to other contemporary laws requiring separati on of the races, not only in the South, but in the North, it was stated in that decision: \"The most common instance of this is the establishment of schools for white and colored children, which has been held a valid exercise of legislative police power even by Courts where the political rights of the colo red race have been longest and most earnestly enforced . It is true that in public education, which had to be supported by local taxation, the South was fa r behind the more prosperous North, which had been enriched by the Civil War, as the South had been impoverished. Added to the ravages of wa r, was the ten years of misgovernment and looting by adventurers from the North-called carpetbaggers because when they arrived in the South thei r whole worldly possessions we re contained in a piece of luggage made of material used in ca rpet making. These were maintained in office by the votes of the recently enfranchised N egroes, and thousands of Federa l bayon ets i n each South- Sou.t b.2 _,:o_.9.r. nfEa.cdJ.o.J:i.,_ti.a..b Lw.i.tb...th.@ i c roooe,v j ern state. Just as the same self-seeking class of Northern politicians are doing today, these carpetbaggers, instead of trying to do something of economic value for the Negroes, who, when they were freed by their Northern emancipators, were turn ed out to barren fields, without economic aid from their touted benefactors-these carpetbaggers used the Negro vote__to maintain themselves in office, paying off the Negroes with a minimum of participation in the looting, and a maximum of sweet talk about sterile \" equality. \" Among the Southern people, regrettable as it must be admitted, there was then, as there is today, a relative few who profited by deserting to the enemy. These, called scalawags, aided the carpetbaggers and the Negroes; and, with their descendants, were ostracized for three generations. When these carpetbaggers were forced to flee by the bargain of the Southern Democrat leaders of Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina, with the Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes, withdrawin g the Federal troops they left the Negro in the lurch.-just as their modern white models will do when the N orthern white voters turn on th em for exciting the Negro es to ins urrectio n in those pa rts. After the flight of the carpetbaggers, both white a nd blcick had to endure another forty years of poverty-though gradually decreasing; until in 1915, the European war, demanding cotton, lumber, and other natural resources of the South, permitted a more ra pid economic move ment upward . The \u00b7 Second World War accelerated this movement. In 1961 the Un ited States Cha mber of Commerce published certain conclusions relating to that development, referring to it as \" nothing short of spectacula r.\" Und er thi s improved e conomic p rosperity, the white s and b la cks o f th e South wer e making impressive advance in rational partnership wh en under N ew York prodding, the SUPERMEN led by Ea rl Warren, the a st ute politician from Ca lifornia , broke the la w of 1896 -separate if equa l. This ma n, w ith not an hour's traini ng a s a Judge, had just been appointed b y Presi d ent Eise nhowe r to be Chief J ustice o ve r the ot her e ig ht who had been sitting a s Ju d ges for several ye a rs. This appoint- - 9- ment was not so reprehensible as might first appear, since of these eight, seven had been put on the Bench without any Judicial training. It must be admitted, in all fairness , that one of them, Judge Black, still there, had been a Justice of the Peace down in Alabama. The case before them in 1954, in which they broke the old law of separate if equal of 1896, was where some Negroes in Kansas, Delaware, South Carolina, and Virginia (t he cases consoli dated) claimed that the segregated Negro schools of these locations were not equal to the white schools, and they wanted the advantages of the white schools for their children. The Court did not agree that they were not equal, saying: \" The Negro and white schools have bee n equalized, or are being equalized, with respect to building, curricula, qualifkations and salaries of teachers, and other 'tangibl e factors '.\" That under the existing law, and its approval by intervening Supreme Court decisions, should have ended the case; the Negroes continued in t hei r equal schools, and the separate if equal doctrine again affirmed. But the SUPERMEN said \"No. \" That did not end the case, they had found something their predecessors, the White, Taft, Hughes, Stone, Vincent, Court Judges did not know. The SUPERMEN said that they had re ad in a bo qk by a fellow by the name of Guna r Myrdal, wh o lived over in Sweden on the icy Baltic Sea wh e re there are no Negroes, in which he claimed it would make the Negro children feel bad if they could not sit with white children in public schools, though their own Negro schools migh t be equal to the white schools. He was cited as \" ample autho rity; an expert, in o t her words. The Cou rt noted the names of some half dozen othe r book writers, who penned more o r Iess t he so me sen ti men ts in their books. Now something peculiar hap pened in this casesomething unheard of in judicial procedure where the opinions of persons al le ged to be expe rts a re introd uce d to aid the Courts. In such cases it is common for the a lleged \" expe rt\" to be brought into Court so that it may be determined by due e xaminati on , and cross-examination by opposing -10- counsel , whether the witness is in fact an expert whose testimony will be of value to the Court. Unhappily for all concerned, the Judges as well as others, this was not done in this case . What a field day a competent cross-examiner would have had with this Swede; and incidentally, protecti ng th e Court from embarrassment in their subsequen t exaltation of the opinions of the Swede, an d his Communist tainted associates. W ha t a joy it would have been to question this residen t of t he Arctic regions on how he became acquain ted w ith what it took to make Negroes feel bad; w hat Negroes d id he consult; was the feeling on ly mental , or also physical ; what schools of me d icine d id he graduate from ; or was he a follower of the Austrian Freud, who emphasized sex in eva lua tin g men tal operations; or the German Ad ler, w ho stresse d fear more than sex in probing the mind ; o r had he strayed off w ith the Swiss Jung, wh o had a cqu ired some twists of his own in tho ught read in g. He could have been required to state w heth e r hi s in vestigations related only to what ma de N e gro e s feel bad, or if he had included th e ye ll o w Chin e se , the brown Malays, and the red Indians. Es pec ially he could have disclosed what made white c hildren feel bad, that is if they were impprtant eno ugh to be included in his roamings; and if by making col o re d childre n fe e l good by bring ing them into as socia ti on w ith w hite childre n, it migh t make t he white c hil dr en feel bad; and w hich, if either, was the mo re important, to co ntin ue th e coloreds in fee ling bad, and the whites no t, or make the col o reds fee l good at the expe nse of the wh ites? Th e e xamina tion would have disclose d wha t we hope th e J udges w ere ignorant o f, w he n the y accepted th e Swed e, a nd his co mpanion s, as \" am ple auth ority,\" a s t hey said . These a uth o rs we re rotten with Co mm uni st associations, some with mo re th a n a d o ze n Comm u ni sti c fro nt citations. O ne must wonde r wh e th e r, w hen they approved the Swede a s \" amp le author ity, \" they had read that part of his book d ec lar ing that wha t the Founding Fat hers di d wh e n th e y confected the Consti tution \"was a lmost a plot again st the com mon people .\" An instrum e nt of g o v e rnm e nt wh ich non -Comm unist statesmen have a cclai me d fo r o ne hundred and - 11- seventy-five years. And was he \" ample authority\" when he asserted that our Constitution \"is impractical and outmoded?\" Having agreed with the Swede that it would make the Negro children feel bad not to sit with white children; it was next in order to determine whether the authors of the 14th Amendment in 1868 had intended by it to turn over to the Federal Government Public Education in the States. If that Amendment did not do this then the SUPERMEN could not seize control of these schools. They concluded, happily for their intent, that from \"exhaustive investigation \" of the times and what was then said, the evidence was \"inconclusive. \" That opened the way for them to insert in it their own views of what ought to have been, or might have been; that is to amend it to suit what they had in mind-namely, that it did take away from the States the right to manage their own schools which they had taxed themselves to support; and turned over to the SUPERMEN the power to say how they should be operated. It is poetic justice that the fraudulent adoption of that Amendment permits equally fraudulent interpretations-like the one by the SUPERMEN, the latest and most disastrous-which has resulted in the bitter interruption of good relations between the races . That adoption was achieved in an atmosphere of rancour, followed by the very same kind of deception and betrayal of the Negroes by the carpetbaggers, as is certain to result from similar conduct of the modern form of carpetbagge ry. Having now so interpreted the Amendment that they could use it as a basis for their decisipn to adopt the Swede 's cozy views to bring the white and colored children together to make the colo red children feel better; that they proceeded to do . The Court 's precise language in ag reeing with -the Swede is as fol lows: \"To separate Negro children fr om ot hers of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race, generates a feeling of in feriority as to their sta t us in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikel y to ever be undone . The Court failed to discuss whether it would \"generate a feeling of inferiori ty\" in t he hearts -12- I Can Southerners afford to be tiaht with their money in I and minds of white children, if forced to sit with Neg ro children. Apparently the Swede had 'no musing on this point. The modern mania for equal rights evidently does not include within its vague crusade, the wh ite race. To digress for a moment: Every century or so a craze unaccountably seizes on the world, as this egalitarian craze has appeared in our times. In the 13th century thousands of children were preached in Europe into a march on Jerusalem to free the Holy Sepulcher from the infidel Saracens. These who did not starve or drown before they reached sea ports, were sold into slavery? The witch craze of the Middle Ages took the lives of 300,000 men and women in Europe; not forgetting the seventy-five (75) tortured and executed in Massachusetts in the 1600s. The South Sea and John Law Investment Bubbles of the 1700s impoverished tens of thousands in France and England. One which much resembles that of today, was the St. Vitus Dance mania, in Germany, where people went prancing about the country in swarms. Due to the more rapid and far distant communications, the egalitarian mania of today extends from Washington and New York to Africa; where th e natives of Angora and Congo \"demonstrate\" their claim to equality by perpetrating crimes on hund reds of white men, women , and children priests and nuns-so bestial as to be beyond any civilized imaginati on-the women raped before the eyes o f dying men bleeding to death from unprintable mutilations-being the mi ldest. Covetous of the riches of Africa, the white nations of Noto, including our own, hastily sweep these horrors under the rug, and hypocriti cally toady to the \"ambassadors\" from that country. The brand of hypocrisy is the same; whether the white politi cian is bootlicking for the Negro vote in America; or the international \" statesmen \" are kotowing to African ambassadors-the result will be th e same-the black man will end up with his pockets picked by thes e self-seeking fakirs. Writing of the cr usades, Well s remar ks: \" From the very first Aaming enthusiasm was mixed with baser elements. \" Return ing to th e integration dec isio n; strangely - 13- enough in this case, and all the others which have followed in respect to adult Negroes, an admission is inherent in what the Court said, and accepted by all who agree with the Court, including the \" demonstrating \" Negroes, that the Negro is inferior, and the only hope for his advance is \" forced \" close association with whites. Later disclosures of his advancement in a segregated society, will not support such a contention. BARRIERS WHICH THE COURT HAD TO ELUDE But the Court was confronted wi t h several apparently insurmountable obstacles. How could this constant association, required to improve the asserted inferiority of the Negro children in this case, and subsequent adu lt cases; and to make them a ll feel better; be achieved in the face of the seg regation laws of many states, North and South? The only answer was for the SUPERMEN to b rea k the laws requiring segregation. That th e y just haul ed off and did. They sa id the WHITE, TAFT, HUGHES AND VINSON COURTS did not know what they were talking about when they approved the \" separate if equal \" doctrine. The oldti mers did not have the benefit of the Swede 's d is covery that it would make th e Negro childre n fee l bad not to sit with th e whites; and, too, th ey mig ht not have been frank and cold enoug h, to say th at the N egro is inferior, and t hat t he onl y re medy for that is constant contact w ith th e w hi te. The knoc ko ut blow came in these precise w o rd s: \" Any language in Pl essy vs. Ferg uson (t he old decision of 1896) contrary to thi s fin d ing (tha t is what the y and the Swed e had agreed upon) is rejecte d.\" It may again be re peated t ha t the man who wrote this opinio n dow ngradi ng the o ld Judges, had ne ver be fo re his appointment served as a Judge . It may be added here t hat the practice of appointing deserving political fr iends has not ceased . A little while ago t he Preside nt appoi nted Mess rs.

In these cases, o ne was t he a ssociate of Bobby Sox, Atto rne y Ge nera l, w hose ju dgmen t of wha t are the q ua li fications of a Supreme Judge, may be measured by the fact that hi s first contact with any - 14- Can Southerne rs afford to be tight w ith their money in the face of this?

At a recent meeting held in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field, Martin Luther King, Jr., collected 35 thousand dollars. This is to be used to create more racial strife. Hollywood Stars Donate to King Sammy Davis, Jr., donated 20 thousand dollars.

The guests were given the usual hearts and flowers sob story, etc. Then they came to the point. According to King and Abernathy, they have to have one thousand dollars a day to keep th ei r organization operating. \"Who wants to pay for one day's operation?\" Actor Paul N ewman and his wife, Joanne Woodward, wrote out the first check for one thousand dollars. Singer Polly Bergen with her husband, Freddie Fields, gave the next check for one thousand dollars. Anthony Franciosa, who participated in the Wrigley Field meeti ng, gave another one thousand dollars. Actor Marlon Brando, gave a check for five thousand dollars. Lloyd Bridges, TV actor .gave five hundred and Mrs. Burt Lancaster the hostess, gave one hundred. Film stars supporting the Wrigley Field meeting were, right to left, Joanne Woodward, Paul Newman, Rita Moreno and mulatto Dorothy Dandrige. Judge, and frrst appearance in any Court, was lately before the Supreme Court in an integration case-a tremendous leap even for a Kennedy. If I may interject a personal statement: I come from a football family, and we all admired the stardom in that freld of \" Whizzer\" White. But he, J no doubt, would readily admit that decking a husky youngster out in football togs does not make a football star, anymore than hanging black cloth on a politician will make a Judge. That the benign Goldberg had a special ability, too, is admitted. If these two apply themselves to their Judicial duties as faithfully as in their preceding specialties, we may wishfully expect that in time they will attain Judicial stature . In the meantime, they share the power of the other SUPERMEN. It is never enough, however, just to say that an old la w is out of date and haul off and break it. Correct Judicial procedure requires that somewhere something professed to be superior must be found to justify the law break ing. W here better t han in the old reliable 14th Amendmen t? So these modern Isaac Waltons baited their hooks w ith the Swedish bait, and went fishing in those bottomless waters. W ha t th ey caugh t is the prize frsh story of all fish sto ri es, su rpassing in th at freld of e xaggeration a ll oth ers; e xcep t onl y th a t one banishing God from p ub lic sc hool roo ms. That part o f the Amendm ent to w hich the right fish sto ry co uld a p ply reads: \"N o state shall mak e o r e nforce any law which shall deprive an y p e rson w it hin its jurisdiction of th e equal prote cti on of t he law.\" Since the sc ho ols wer e equ a l in t he instant case, nobody had been deni e d t he equal protection of the law on that score. The Sw ed e solve d that obstacle. The se parati o n w oul d make the Negroes feel bad; but not the whites. So t he \" g e ne ration \" of this feeling bad was ad o pte d a s gr a nting the Federal J udiciary a new area of control in passing on laws enacted by the a ut ho rize d la wm aking Powers. . The Integration frsh had bee n land ed . The next, it may be expected, given time fo r ne w b re e d s to hatch-will be the miscegenation shark. This addition of the state of the feelings of I I 1 -15- groups of people in considering t he application of this Amendment, has opened a vast new field, so vast indeed that the imagination cannot encompass where it will end. Crowds of adult Negroes have lately been persuaded that a large number of th e ir relations with whites, heretofore not suspected, make them fee l bad-not eating at t he same tables, swimm ing in the same pools, sitting on the sa me toilets, an d such-and they are filling the Courts with d emands, and the streets with \" demonst rations,\" t hat they be made to feel better by intimate associatio n in these matters-forced by Jud ica l d e crees, and new law enactments. The inherent admission of implied inferiority to be cured by t hese inti mate social and school ties is ignored . Also ignored in these \"demonstrations\" is that the right to \" assemble and petition fo r a red ress o f g ri e vances \" requires that such assemblies be \" peaceable.\" Are they? The unexpected catch of this feel bad fish in the school case met with shouts of joy from t he su rprised New Yorke rs, who from t he first promoted only suits claiming inequality in su ch \"ta ngible\" things as building, curricul a, teache r q ua lifications, salaries, etc. Now the objective was quic kly chan ged, a nd the New Yorkers, mainly an organ iza ti on called the Association fo r the Advance ment of Colo re d Peop le, th e well- kn o wn NAACP, sent out emissar ies, at first only to th e South, bu t later to a ll parts of the country, to te a ch th e N egro e s how to feel bad about a variety of things b esides no t mixing in schools. This went e xaspera tingl y sl o w in the begi n ning , for the inn o cent N egro e s did not kno w that th e y should f ee l b a d about the se th ings. In fact, they w e re fee lin g pretty good abo ut the advan ce me nt they were making along al l lin es in Am e rica. An example of their progress is noted even in bad old Mississip pi . Govern o r Barnett of that State, quoted in th e Jun e 3 rd iss ue of the U.S. News a nd World Report, said: \" W e ha ve N e g ro es w ho own t hei r own businesses, q ui te a number of them wealthy businessmen. There are more than 27000 N egro farmers w ho own title to land valued at appro ximately l 00 million dolla rs. More than - 16- 27% of the privately owned homes in Mississippi are owned by Negroes. We have Negro professional people, such as lawyers, doctors, teachers, dentists, social workers, nurses and many others.\" Does that sound like the grade of inferiority that the Court must cure by \"side by side \" contact with whites? Is that really poor achievement for the Neg roes in the last fifty years, when both black and white in the South got the chance to move upward economically? Propagandists refer to the \"plight\" of the American Negro. What in fact is that plight? The Census Bureau has released figures for 1960 showing that the Negro in t he United States has an annual income exceeding that of the whole people of France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Norway, Mexico, Japan-and equal to that of Great Britain, $1150.00. Only Canada, Australia, Switzerland exceeds that level. Nevertheless, the agitators made progress, at first havin g to pay some of the Negroes to feel bad. Th e NAACP with its annual ex penditure of one million dollars, according to its public audit, was t he leader. But at once, Northern politicians, sensing votes to be had, hypocritically sprang into the act. Progressively in th e last year, discovering that f eeling bad about a ll sorts of th i ngs, and shouting \"eq uality, \" could get their names in a sensationseekin g press, and t heir pictures on TV, Negroes are fillin g t he st reets with hysterical yelling mobs of men, wom en and children, disturbing the p ub lic peace, lying down in public places, throw ing pop bottl es a nd stones; their ministers maki ng political speeches disguised as prayer; in short, having the time of th eir lives in all these forms of em otional excitem ent. Bored by the mo no ton ou s routi ne of preaching the gospe l, w hite min ist ers, not indi ffe rent to th eir names and pictu res being broadc ast, can persuade t hemsel ves th at th e y are martyrs by going to jail for a fe w days. Then there are othe r white minist ers who from higher stations in their cleri ca l organizations, speak wi th pompou s authorit y, who expect the po pu lace to be impressed that th ey had just rece ived a tele- - 17- phone message from God directing them to sp ring to the front of marching, lawbreaking Negroes, demand ing \" rights\" -claim ing the constitutional right of \" peaceable assembly. \" One w onders a t t he colossal conceit of these men, who imagine, o r profess to believe, that God had withheld such instructions from their learned and spiritual prede cessors; awaiting till these chosen ones should appear. One may suspect that among these, too, \" the itch for the praise of fools, \" is not absent. Teenagers, according to a pattern emerg ing all over the world join in \" demonstra ting. \" Ma iden ladies and frustrated w ives, lying down in the streets and offices, force police to drag them off bodily; not a little t itillated by indecent e xposure. Many of these come from distant places to do their bit; ignoring the opportunities in t heir own back yards . Dickens etched this type indelibly in Bleak House a hundred years ago, describing Mrs. Jellyby who was \" involving the devotion of all my energies, \" as she said , in improving t he cond iti o n of those unfortunates a w ay off yonde r-in he r case-Darkest Africa; while he r own ch ild re n were ill clad, unwashed, ill nou rished , one of them tumbling down sta irs, so that a visito r cou ld cou nt the sounds of his bump ing head as it st ruc k e ac h step; and another \"crying loudl y, fixe d by the neck between two iron railings,\" \"wh ile Mr. G uppy, with the kindest intentions poss ible en d ea vo red to drag him back by the legs, un d e r a general impressi o n that his head was compress ib le b y t hese means .\" To all of this, Mrs. Jellyby was serenely oblivious, while she made diapers for the babies of the Congo, and \"discussed the Brotherhood of Humanity, and gave expression to some beautiful sentiments.\" Not to be left beh ind the ir b ret hre n of the So uth in all th e se \" demo nst ra tio ns,\" the Northern Neg roes are going a t it o n so large a scale as to scare t he tar ou t o f t heir po li t icians; and the se , in th eir constern ati o n t h at t hey have aroused ba rbarou s em o ti o ns which they cannot control , a re c ra w ling o n thei r knees, b e gging for restraint, lest t hese ri o to us e ruptions turn Northern white vote rs ag a inst them, a nd t hey wi ll lose their jobs. Callous to a ll else, they ne ither think nor care what all this wi ll do to t he po or Negro. It takes no majo r prophet to foresee that a check in Negro advance-18- ment will come; a setback which may last for deca des; and the innocent Negroes will see that they have been deceived by heartless self-seekers, and will turn on the leaders, both white and black, wh o have cost them so much. FEELING BAD AS AN EXCUSE FOR BREAKING THE LAW As we have seen, the NINE MEN have as a reason for breaking the old law of separate if equal, that it made Negroes feel bad. How easy it will be to extend that feeling bad defense to persons charged with crime. We have State laws prohibiting and punishing all sorts of acts deemed against public safety; acts from the disturbance of the peace to stabbing, murder and rape . What a laugh it would be for a culprit called before the Courts for breaking one of these laws to plead: \"I reject that law. To condemn me as it requires, will make me feel bad.\" And what a carnival of crime would ensue. That is exactly what has happened from the lawbreaking judgment of 1954 of these politicians sitting on a supposedly Judicial Bench. Not only have mobs gathered in streets, marching and yelling, disturb ing the public peace under the mask of rig ht of assembly, making speeches to God under the blasphemous guise of the sacred rite of prayer; throwing pop bottles and stones at the police; but felonious crimes have multipliedmurders, rapes and stabbings. Most frightening of all, murderers and rapists, tried and condemned to death before State Courts, may now be observed peering fr om beneath the black rob es of Federal Judges, where for years they have basked in security; protected by some techn icality of the law discovered by these SUPERMEN. At this writing there are twenty-six (26) tried and condemned to execution in the Angola Penitentiary of Louisiana; three whites for murder; and twe ntythree Negroes, nine for aggravated rape and fourteen for murder. Four of the Negroes sentenced in 1957; 1 i.n 1958; 1 in 1959; 1 in 1960; 8 in 1961 a nd 2 in 1962. Two of the Negro rapists in Ango la were co ndemned for raping white women in the state capita l a t Baton Rouge. Their exemption from execution has encouraged the nephew of one of them to - 19- another rape of a white woman in that city, taking place July 6th , 1963. Police kno w that the rape of white women by Negroes has multiplied since 1954; not more than one out of six or seven being brought into the Court, the victims not wanting their shame publicized. Within the last week a Negro has been identified by his victims, and charged with attempted rape of one nun and the beating of another, within their convent walls; in New Orleans. How many in all Southern States? In Washington, where it was ex pected that the concentrated glare on integration would disclose everybody made happy, the contrary is proven by a record of crime since 1954, exceeding that of any city of comparable size in the country. Washington, where a white American soldier may be killed on the streets, scarcely noticed , while on the same day, trumpets blare for a murdered Negro buried in Arlington. Washington, where white women may be assaulted by a Negro in a chu rch in sight of the Capitol, and in their homes, while their men only whimper, lest they lose votes , or their jobs. Did I say men? Based on his personal observa ti ons, no doubt the Negro Congressman Adam Cla yton Powell bragged for the nation to read : \"We have the white man on the run. After him, men; sic 'em.\" Some Congressm en, unnamed, have been quoted as saying \" We shoul d take a recess.\" Take a powder, they mean. It is impossible to believe that even Washing ton would inflict that disgrace on the American people i n the face of approaching Negro thousands. Let them take heart. We are informed that right up front, there will be some of Hollywood's quickdraw heroes to keep order; along with some nice white gentlemen in clerical garb sidling up to the camera boys. What would the Father of his country say, if he could see this city named for him , become a jungle; a monument to the folly of the SUPERMEN? It is unbelievable, that when a young Negro was condemned to execution for raping and murdering an elderly white woman in Washington , and released by the Supreme Court; Mallory vs. U.S. 354 p. 441 in 1957,-one of the Judges is re-ported to have remarked afterward , \"After all he was bu t -20- a lad.\" The \" lad \" was reported to have promptly committed another offense in Pennsylvania, and kille d by Police. The technicality on which this convicted murderer and rapist was freed to commit another crime, is simply too i ncredible to put down if it were not verifiable by reading the decision. The question of guilt was of no concern. He was released because, for some reason he was committed to prison, and not questioned until seven hours had passed . It is not now in the recollection of th e writer whether the Court fixed a time with in whi ch the questioning must begin; say one hour, ten minutes, and twenty-five seconds, or possibly ten seconds longe r. But it is a fact that law enforcement officers the nation over are dismayed lest th is ridiculous and indefensible holding of the Court, results iri freeing many vicious criminals. Who is to blame for setting the example of lawbreaking? On whose shoulders should horrid responsibility settle for these crimes? THE ADV AN CEMENT OF THE NEGRO OBSTRUCTED BY THESE PAID AGITATORS More th an fifty years ago, June 4th, 1910, in the Outlook magazine, Theodore Roosevelt quoted with approval the state ment of Sir Henry R. Johnson: \"That no wh ere else in the world, certainly not in Africa, has the Negro been given such a chance of mental and physical development as in the United States. Intellectually he has attained his highest degree of advancement as y et in the United States. Pol itically he is freer there; socially he is happier than in any other part of the world. \" The ex-President added: \" The boo k is of great interest and permanent value; and should be in the library of every American who cares to devote a little thought to one of the largest of the problems of today. \" Quoted from Book Review, printed in the words of Theodore Rooseve lt, Vol. XI I, pp. 221 -2. This progress had continued up to 1954. Fine publ ic schools built solely for Negro children, ta ught by competent teachers of the ir own race who best understand them, have multiplied a ll over the South. This day go into hundreds of communi ties and one will see that the newest and most -21- modern schools and campuses a re for the Negroes, fact concealed f rom the Northern people. The greatest Negro Un iversity in America, is in Lou isiana-five miles from the State Capitol, beautiful ly located on the Father of Waters. This Negro Uni versity has all the trimmings that the white State Un iversity has; located two miles fr om the State Capitol. (Maybe that is an offense, being th ree miles further from the State Capitol than the wh ite). It has full academic courses, granting d egrees at a regular graduating exercise (upwards of 500 in June 1963); homecomings, fraternities a nd sororities, football and other sports, bands a nd cheerleaders. There is nothing collegiate, socia l, and cultural, on the white campus not also see n on the Negro campus. Negro graduates at other Negro colleges in the state total 401 , not including the p rivately endowed Dillard in New Orleans, a large and well -ma naged Ne gro University w hose attenda nce and g ra d uate level is not at the moment availab le to the write r. a In the school year just closing there were 286,605 Negro students in 164 Negro High Schools, with 8,876 graduates in Louisiana, w ith a total population in 1963, e sti mate d as 3,300,000less than the popu lation of Ch ica g o . It w o uld be interesting to compare these figu res with those in Chicago. In the smaller sta te of Mississ ippi, near the po pulation of Philadelphia, to q uote G o vernor Barnett again, there a re \" mo re than 4 00 0 Negro students in State supported colleges; 7,382 Negro school teachers in the Negro public schools with maste rs' degrees and abo ve; an d o f 190 mi llio n d o llars spe nt on public school s since 1953,\" in th is by no me ans rich State , \" 63 % went for N egro pub lic school faciliti es. 1' There is much more in the Governor's inte rvi e w by U.S. N ews and Wor ld Repo rt that wo uld show misi nformed N ortherners that the Ne gro is b etter o ff in Miss issi ppi , than in the g reat Northern cities. But p rese nti ng a fair picture o f the co ndition of the N egro in Mississippi, o r any o the r Southe rn state, to the N orthern people cannot be expected so long as the egalitarian mania persists. The re is some sense in the Negro making a plea for a job. He cannot stay on relief forever; be- 22- sides most of them have the pride of preferring to wo rk to mooching on the taxpayers; but the cry of lac k of employment is something recently thought up by those who profit by agitation . Heretofore those who presumed to speak for them; those whose real object is to cause racial division and clash; those who were stirring to howling complaints, sit-ins, lie-ins and butt-ins, were eloquent with phrases as meaningless as they are sonorous - \" human dignity, \" \"plight of the Negro, \" \" social rev olution .\" A favorite is \"second-class citizenship,\" used in a sense which disregards good conduct as the indispensable duty of \" citizenship. \" A la ter one is produced by Bobby Sox, - \" Human rig hts are superior to States ' Rights. \" Whatever mea ning Bobby attaches to this bombast, it is certain that for him States ' Rights do not exist. Anoth er is in constan t use , - \" discr iminate. \" Would the se good w hite men of the clerical cloth, who are op pose d to \" d iscrimination \" refuse a daughter 's han d to one of the lusty young Negro \"demonstrators?\" Maybe these particular show offs would not. As k them . IMPENDING DESTRUCTI ON Is th e ad vancement of the Negro made in the United States in the last hundred years, and especia lly in t he Sou t h in t he last fifty years, to be ign ored , obstructed , poss ibly destroyed by rs , finan c ial p rofite ers, and gullible dogooders? When the uns uspe cti ng Negro is being aroused to heights of insurrecti o n p a ssio n, w hite men and women of the So uth, of g ood w ill and compassion -and these are, or were, in t he vast majori tya re reluctantly compelled in se lf d e fense to rem ind a ll con cerned, that in his o w n country of Africa he ma de no advance whatever in the 6000 years that the wh ite man wa s p a infully creating the civilizati on of which now in Ame ric a n t he tr ansplanted Negro has the advanta g e. Is it unkind to s uggest to Ma rti n King , Wil kins, et al , that if their an c esto rs ha d re main e d in Africa; what with disease, tr iba l w a rs, a nd canniba lism, they might not have survived to beco me sires of these descendants now demandi ng so fro m the white man's civi lization in Ameri ca ? In those 6000 years that the N e gro achi eved -23- nothing in his own country of a hundred millionin Egypt, next door to him, her engineers constructed the Great Pyramid 5000 years ago, an amazing feat still puzzling to moderns. Separated from Caucasians of the West by the vast length and height of the Himalayas, the Yellow Chinese more than 2000 years ago built the Great Wal l 1400 miles long, to protect them from the Mongolian Hordes-the Empire then more than l 000 years old, with great cities, and art and literature . The Brown Japanese boast of a culture 2000 years old when Christ was born. And when Columbus crossed the sea, he found 3000 miles from Western civilization, the rich culture of the Red man, which Cortez and Pizarro pillaged in the Halls of Montezuma and Golden Palaces of the Incas. In referring to the kindly feeling existing between the races in the South before the Supreme Court caught its integration fish, I beg to interject a personal note. I was born and reared on a cotton plantation in North Louisiana; grew up with Negro playmates; know their good qualities whe n not deceived and misled; and I am saddened whe n I perceive what is in store for them under a leadership so fraudulent as to be criminal. One of my playmates, bedridden in his home in his last yea rs, I never failed to visit when frequentl y visiting his section of the State. We would spend a hap py hour recalling incidents of our boyhood an d early manhood. I can assure our Northern fello w citizens, that there were many thousands of suc h r elationships between Negroes and wh ites of the South. So far as the South is concerned t he r e is mo re seeming than fact in all this Negro hu r ra h. The Negro is by no means the fool t hat t he fr o nt runners of his race are making h i m ou t to b e. I haven 't the least doubt that the majo r ity of them within their own t houghts , w ish t hese disturbe r s would subside. But as is frequen t ly t he ca se w ith the whites, these remain quiet lest t hey be cen sured by the more voca l, o r ev en injured. BREAKING ONE LAW CALLED FOR THE BREAKING OF ANOTHER The poli t ici ans si tti ng o n t he Supreme Benc h in 1954 did not sto p wit h b r eaking the old la w of 1896. Having decid ed what will ma ke the Negro - 24- fee l bad, they went on to the next step, and determined that they must do someth ing to make him fee l good. But here they were confronted with another Const itutiona l obstacle; t he specific declaration in the very same 14 th Amendment (Sec. 5) that only \" Congress shall have t he power, by appropria te leg islation, to enforce the p rovisions of this Article.\" But w ha t if Con g ress did not ag ree with w hat the SUPERMEN professed to have discovered in this Arti cl e , since it w as not so written; and what if Co ngress di d no t ta ke an y stoc k in what the Swede & Co. said about it m a king the Negroes feel b ad if t he y cou ld not be righ t there by the side of th e whiteman in w hatever he was doingleaving th e p resu mption t hat he had no ideas, likings, busine ss, o r ch o ices of h is o w n. There are in fact many Congress men , es peci al ly those from the Sou th , who do no t believe an y such th ing . They have kn o wn and lived beside th e N e groes al l their lives, an d th ey are qu ite positively certain tha t the So ut he rn N egro w o uld prefe r to ha ve his own sc hools and teac hers, a nd run his own affa irs; a nd that all the co m motion whippe d up by N ew Yo rk, e t a l. is just so m uch profitable po p p yc ock. But since t he SU PERME N ha d gotte n away with it before , t hey decided to go it al o ne in this case. The judgmen t th e y issued req ui red th e Dist rict Judges: \" To ta ke s uc h pro ceed ing s, a nd enter such o rders and decrees, a s are necessary and proper to admit to p ub lic schools on a ra cia lly no nd isc riminatory ba si s with a ll d e li b e rate spe ed,\" the parti e s to the case. This has b een expa nd e d so, a s a matte r of cou rse the Federal Judges, and not Cong ress, are \"enfor~ing the provisions\" of th e 14th Am e ndm e nt. It will be note d that in the accompa nying specific instructions to the District J udges, the SUP ERM EN delegate to these Judges the rig hts a nd d utieswhich they had themse lves us u rped-to bre a k State laws or local ordinances, and enact others to take their places. These are the precise instructio ns given to the Di strict Judges: \" Full implementation of these co nstit uti onal -25- principles (meaning those which they had inserted in the Amendment) may require solution of local school problems .. to that end Courts may consider problems relating to administration, arising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and regulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems.\" \u00b7 Even King Jehosaphat did not assign such whopping jobs to his Judges. Presumably these District Judges know all the multiplied aspects of public school management required of a competent Superintendent of Public Education who has learned them by many years of observation and practice; or they must instantly learn them-in what school not stated. It is a marvel that more of them do not reluctantly assume these added executive duties; but maybe very many are reluctant but are scared of the SUPERMEN - except some who may be eager for earned promotion; such as ou r New Orleans District Judge Skelly Wright, whose quick promotion is expected to entice others to follow his example. That the SUPERMEN quite well understood that they were usurping the exclusive authority of Congress, is perceived in their evasion of the wo rd \"enforce\" when they instructed the District Judges to \"i mplement\" their judgment . In their embarrassment, they tried, not too cleve rly, to escape from the specific constitutional limitation , by adopting a word to take its place. They have said repeatedly that their decisions shall be \"implemented\" (meaning \" enforced\") by th e directions they gave to the lower Judges. The word implement as a verb is not found in any legal dictionary, the old reliable Bouvier, Ballantine, o r the 1951 edition of Black. The lowe r Judges have u nderstoo d their superiors quite well; and ha ve issued orders and decrees by the doze ns to \"enforce\" the provisions of the 14th Amendment, the exclusive right of Congress so to do be damned . Th e Courts have also adopted another word to se rve their purposes- - 26- \u00b7 desegregate \" which was not in any dictionary, academic or legal, until it was inserted in Webster's International Dictionary in 1959. So we find the Court in the business of supplementing the English language to convey its meaning in the assault on the Constitution. It will not be long before the Federal Judiciary will ease into the use of the word \" integrate, \" as a substitute for \" desegregate. \" Then it will have gone the whole hog. The thin mask will be completely off. There will be no need for Congress to exercise its specifkally granted and ex clusive power to \" enforce\" integration of the races in all cases where the lack thereof is alleged to make the Negro feel bad. The obliging Federal Judiciary will do it. STILL MORE LAWBREAKING AND LAWMAKING It soon becomes obvious that in lawbreaking by on a ll powerful governmental body like the SUPERM EN , some very serious and dangerous lawmaking must follo w in its wake to carry out their enact ments . The Court has ordered integration of the races w herever demanded by NAACP; and masks off, proposes to enforce their commands by expanding the rule of Contempt of Court to punish noncomplian ce. The world o ver when the lawmaking power enacts a statute where a compl ia nce is required or a violati on punished, the same law fixes a penalty for disobedience. The limitation of punishment is clearly stated, generally in such terms as \" fined not more than \" so many dollars, or \"imprisoned not exceeding \" a term stated. Again the world ove r, there the lawmaker stops. It is left to another and not self-interested authority to hear and condemn breaches, and assess punishment with the stated limits. There was a time three hundred years ago when the Divine Right Kings claimed the right, (called Prerogatives) to make laws, fix punishment for noncomp liance, try culprits, and clap them in jail; all witho ut the intervention of Parliament. Those Divine Right cl a ims petered out when one was exiled, and a nother had his head chopped off. A revival of that right is now claimed , or at least apparently threatened by Federal Judges. - 27 - Under the guise of well-known and admitted ri gh t to maintain decorum in their court rooms, to require witnesses to answer proper questions, and enforce a well-known general line of Cou rt orde rs, noncompliance with the ir integration laws, orders, and decrees is now threatened with unlim ited Anes or incarceration in ja i l, without the right, as ol d as Magna Carta of 1215, to a trial by jury of th eir peers . The authority for this taking away the p ro p erty and liberty of American citizens, specifical ly prohibited by Articles of the Constitution (appended), they will call Contempt of Court. In tha t procedure, the lawmaker, the prosecu t or, the Judge, and the executioner will al f be centered in one person,-contrary, it is repealed, to a uni versally admitted principl e, and specificall y prohibi ted by the Constitution. Some imaginati ve journalists have speculated o n the infliction of fines as much as one hun dred thousand dollars, and imprisonment up to ten years. It is remarkable that in mentioning t hese possibilities, these generally well-informed men , di d not express the slightest dismay. That is ho w fa r we have gone in our indifference t o t he warning of the Harvard Professor that, \" Neve r in recorded history has the individu a l been i n g r ea ter d a nger from government than no w .\" It may take the infliction of such puni shm ent to awaken co.mplacen t Ame ri cans t o t hei r peri l, lest their liberties so valian tl y a nd blood ily fo ught fo r by their ancestors, w i ll fa de a way unde r th e tyrannical rule of uncontrolle d SUPER M EN. \" Power corrupts; abso lute po we r corrupts absolutely.\" When the sage, Benja min Franklin, in his o ld age, was aske d b y a la dy, after the adopt io n o f th e Constitution in 1787, in th e con fecti o n of wh ich he too k an active part, \" W hat kind of g o ve rnm ent have we no w, M r.

OBEY THE LAWS? LET WASHINGTON SET THE EXAMPLE. -29- l APPENDIX PERTINENT PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION Article Ill Section I. The Judicia l power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crime shall have been; (Note: \"The Courts derive their powers from the grant of the people made by the Constitution and they are all to be found in the written law, and not elsewhere. \" Wheaton vs. Peters, 591, 658; Bucher vs. Cheshire, 125 U.S. 555. \" It must therefore find its power to punish the crime in laws of Congress passed in pursuance of the Constitution, defining the offenses and prescribing what courts shall ha ve jurisdiction over them. No act can be a crime against the United States which is not made so or recogni zed as such by federal constitution, law, or treaty.\u00b7\u00b7 U.S. vs. Hudson; 7 Cranch, p . 32; Cool ey Principles of Constitutional Law, p. 138. AMENDMENT V No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment of a grand jury . .. nor shall any person be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law ...

Every person, howeve r low, or degraded , or poor, is entitled to have h is righ ts tested by the same general laws which govern Cooley, pp. 235-6. AMENDMENT XIV. \"Section 1 . ... shall make or enforce any law which . .. shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" (Note: \"The guarantee of equa l to be un- -30- ( derstood, however, that every person in the land shall possess precisely the same rights and privileges as every other person. Ths amendment contemplates classes of persons, and the protection given by the law is to be deemed equal, if all persons in the same class are treated alike under like circumstances and conditions both as to privileges conferred and liabilities imposed.\" Cooley, p. 237. Citing authorities. \"Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\" With reference to enforcement, it may be said that no one will deny that when an authority is granted in the Constitution, it is exclusive, unless othe\"rwise stated. The application of the authority granted to the Congress here to enforce the provisions of the article, by appropriate legislation, denies to the Supreme Court the right to \"enforce its provisions\" by the enactment of any law by it; or to enforce its provisions by the formulation of \"orders and decrees\" which amount to enforcement. That is to say, that when Congress has enacted appropriate legislation to prohibit states from denying equal protection of the laws in any instance-in the racial cases here, the judiciary can a scertain when such legislation is violated, and apply the remedies se t out by t he Congress. W hat the Court has done in the school case, for instance, is this in effect: It has inserted in the Amendment substantially these words: \"The amendment contemplates Federal control of public education in the States. Therefore whe n a State enacts legi slation providi ng se parate schools for the races, tha t leg islation is prohibited as d e nying equal protection to t he Negro race .\" Having fo und, in effect, that la nguag e in th e Ame ndment, as o ne of its provisions, the next question should be whethe r Congress has e na cted appro priate legislation to prohibit state la ws violating the provision . If Congress did not know that such legislation by the States is prohibited by the Amendmen t; or if Congress shoald recogni ze this Judicial Amendment, but has not e nacted a ny legislation to e nforce the p roh ibition; does t hat g ive the rig ht to the judiciary to \"enforce\" it. The Supreme Court has answered that q uestion by ag a in inserti ng in the ame ndment, in effect, these words: \"But if Cong ress does not see ftt to e nforce the prohibition by a p propriate legislation, t he Supreme Court ma y do so by its own decision; \" , and may \"imple ment\" the ir decision by such \"orders and decrees\" as ma y be necessary to take th e place of t he missing act o r a cts of Congress, and \"may provide un limited punishment fo r no ncompliance with its decrees.\" In elud ing t he exclusive rig ht of Co ngress to \" e nforce the p rovisions\" of the Article, by using the word \"i mplementa ti o n,\" and other expressions, we observe a ll the a rts of a slick politician in writing this decision . The wonde r is tha t the oth e rs who had been on the Bench for some years, co uld be persuaded to fo llow him a long these twisting tra ils. - 31- Order this pamphlet from R.

Surely, the question is rather in what respects ra cial discrimination is properly the is concern of Congress under the Constitution. The concerns and powers r of Congress, moreover, are cumulative, not alternative. A deter mined Congress could strike at important segments of racial \u00b7discrimination with \u00b7the far reaches of its defeni,e powers (for _ example, discrimination which hame pers the defense \u00b7effor t ) ; its for eign affairs power (for example, .discrimr ination which affects our foreign reO la.tions, at least discrimination s against diplomats) ; its spending d power (fo r example, discriminat ion a by bodies or agencies which receive Federal funds) . There are also the powers of Congress t hat have been discussed. Of course, Congress can outlaw discrimination in interstate commerce, or which affects interstate com\u00b7 merce. Publlo- Authority's Complicity Congress can, in addition, pursuant to the 14th Amendment, strike a t discrimination for which the state is r esponsible, and at the widespread complicity of public authority in private discrim ination. It may be possible to \u00b7 draft a provision outlawing discrimination for which the state is reiiponsible, perhaps even leavi~g It t o t he courts to determine later where the 8t ate may properly be 1 held responsible. Congress could also forbid state and local officials to r equire, proe mote, encourage or enforce racial discrimination. In r egard to places of public accommodation, I am confident that s the Supreme Court would uphold an act of Congress which forbids local B judges and local police t o enforce ' discrimination , for example, through s trespass prosecut ions. These prohibi- tions on the acts of local cials could be enf orced by criminal pens alty, by injunction, by suits for monf etary damages. It is not either one power of Congress or another, nor a matter of in- canting several. The various powers of Congress can support various prof visions adding up to an effective civil rights act.

Physicist Backs Test Ban Selove Declares Agreement l!; in Interests of Both Sides The write1\u00b7 o/ the following ts professor of physics at the University of P ennsylv an1ia. TO TH!l EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As the test ban negotiations move ahead beyond initial agreement, it is strange to see the reluctance, if not opposition, to make such an agreement shown by some members of this Government. It is encouraging that a large number of Senators have joined in the remarkable Hpmphrey-Dodd resolution in support of an airspace-water test ban, and encoura;;;ing also that so highly informed and influential a Representative as Chet Holifield has indicated his feeling that such a ban should receive support. Why is there any question as to whether such a ban is in the interests of the Unitea ptates? I believe U1e opposition is due prjmarily t o two mistaken attitudes. First, there are those who believe that.this country can better achieve security by further nuclear weapons development rather than bY \"trusting\" the Soviet Union to adhere to the airspace-water ban. '!'his is a gross mistake. For one thing, no \"trust\" is necessary. More important, no foreseeable development ( at least in the next decade, as far as can now be seen) will change the ability of each of the two nuclear giants to utterly devastate each other. Orbiting Bombs Indeed, if nuclear tests of large weapons continue we would probHerman Kahn's ably move closer \"doomsday\" mac)lines - perhaps with each side w 0 rl<ing toward orbiting bomb1 of trLlndreds of megatons. A very few such bombs from continuous orbit could be used to set fire \\ o the entire eastern coast of this country. we have the judgment of Secretary McNamara that no really effective anti-missile defense is visible, and we can expect that prospect ~o become stronger with the passage o! time. The second mistal<e made by opponents of a test bll-n has to do with simple distrust of the other side. The question posed is essentially the following ( and Could be used by Soviet opponents of 9 test ban as well as by our own ) : Why should the \"other\" side want !I test ban unless it is to t heir advaJltage, and consequently, i t is ini_p)jed, t o our own disadvantage ? TM mistake h~re is to think that a test ban can b~ or must be t o t he to life a.nd his honor to be used to the best moral interests of his country. Your view [editorial J uly 17] would deny. him any moral dignity of his own. Segregation is morally wrong, and any citizen, military or otherwise, has the right and the moral obligation to make known, even by demonstrating, his views in reference to it. If the Brown Shirts aJld the German regular army 8Jld the German citizens had taken to demonstrations, rather than bowed to accepted immoral tradition, perhaps the cost to European Jewry would not have been so devastating. Historical precedent and honored tradition have their place in society, but they should not be above the individual's right publicly to make known his own moral standards. I wou\"ttl have thought The New York Times would have been the first to defend such rights and obligations. JOSEPH COLLINS. Rhinebeck, N. Y.,\" July 18, 1963. Taxing Foreign Securities Administration Proposal Declared No Cure for Present Gold Outflow To THE Eorron OF THE N EW Y ORK Tl.MES: The Times is to be congratulated for having immediately pointed out [editorial July 19] the dangers of the Atlministration's proposed tax on American purchase of foreign securities. These dangers have not been eliminated by its more recent proposal to exempt new Canadian issues. Indeed, the Canadian exernp. tion dramatizes how completely arbitrary this kind of currency regu. lation and manipulation is sure to be. When the niceties a.re stripPed away, the proposed tax is a forrn of exchange control, defined as an effort by Government to limit and to restrict the use of its own currency. Such restriction on foreign trans. actions was widely practiced by Nazi Germany and is the stocl< in trade of all totalitarian regimes. It is the entering wedge for other types of control over the domestic economy. The President wants the taJC in order to stanch the outward flow of American investment doilars which is augmenting the deficit in our balance of payments. But the proximate cause of this outflo\\1/ is that United States interest rat es are lower than in many other countries, which both encourages United Stflles citizens to buy foreign securities !Ul.d likewise encourages foreign cotn. panies to float t heir securities i n our markets on easy terms. It 1s notable and regrettable that the P r.esi~ent ~as no Intention of ,.:/{~; \u00b7, Founding Fathers' Intent Citing 18th Century Leaders in Support of Religion Disputed The w riter of the following letter is M inist er of Edu cation for the First Chttrch in B oston, Unitarian. TO THE E DITOR OF THE N~ Y ORK T IMES: The current debate on your editorial page about the intentions of th~ Founding Fathers in drafting, enacting and ratifying the \"establishment of religion\" clause of the First Amendment discloses more about the condition of American religion th8Jl it does about the historical problem of whether the clause was intended to apply to the establishment of a national religion based upon an \"es- \u00b7 sential consensus respecting God, i man and the moral law.\" Especially revealing is the zeal with which Christian leaders, lay and clerical, have clasped the Founding Fathers to t heir bosoms as upholders of this \"essential consensus.\" No matter how much we should like to re-create our Revolutionary saints in our own image, historical fa cts cannot be ignored without endangering both our honesty and our sense of history's vicissitudes. Recent research indicates that John Adams, Jefferson, Washington, Paine, Madison and F ranklin were deists. While they differed on particular points of doctrin~, they agreed that, in Franklin's words, \"there is one Godi who made all things,\" and that \"the most a cceptable service of God is doing good to man.\" In short, the religion of the most eminent Founding Fat hers was based largely on Genesis i, 2 and Matthew iv, 7. The deist position is clearly embodied in Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, where he r efers to \"the laws of nature and of nature's god.\" Deist Theology A comparison of the essentials of deist t heology and the docfrines of Judaism and Christianity shows that t he West's two great religions have properly regarded deism as their enemy. For, as expounded by most of its followers, deism denies the possibility of a covenant a nd of a savior. I can but marvel, therefort a t the Industry of Chr istian leaders in finding champions in the Founding F athers and in treating their religious testimonies as if anchored in the bedrock of theological orthodoxy. If we iu\u00b7e to believe that America's \u00b7essential consensus is embodied in the ideas of Jefferson and his friends, we must admit this nation ls not and never has been rooted in the J 11claeo-Chri\u00b7tian -:-break the \"white\" nuclear monopoly.

Such a voice was heard when Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. of Atlanta testified before the Senate Commerce Committee in support of President Kennedy's bill to prohibit racial discrimination in stores, restaurants and other public accommodations. On the basis of the very substantial accomp lishments that his city of a half-million, the largest in the Southeast, has made in desegregating publicly owned and privately owned facili ties, he migh t have come as a champion of \"states' rights\" and of the ability of localities to banish discrimination without F ederal law. Certainly, he would h ave had much more warrant to es{?ouse that view than the Barretts, the Wallaces and the other arch-segregationists who raise the specter of F ederal \"usurpation\" as a device for keeping Southern Negroes in subjection. But Mr. Allen was not in Washington to boast. He was there to warn that even in cities like Atlanta the progress that had been made might be wiped out if Congress turned its back on the Kennedy \u00b7 proposal and th us gave implied en. dorsement to the concept that private businesses were free to discriminate. He left behind this charge to finish t he job started with the Emancipation Proclamation a century ag : \"Now the eliminat ion of segregation , which is slavery's s tepchild, is a challenge to all of us t o make every American free in fact as well as in theory - and again to establish our n ation as t he true champion of the fr ee world. \" The Fiddlers The Jong-legg ed, r a sp-win ged insects now come Jpto their own, and we won't hear the last of them till hard frost a rrives. They are t he leaping fiddlers, the grasshopl?ers, the crickets and the katydids. Grasshoppers are spoken of in the Bible as \" locusts,\" and their hordes have contributed in many lands, including our own West, to the l?ng history of insect devastation an d human famme. Walk through any meadow now, or a lo ng ~ny weedy roadside, and you will see t h em leapm.g ahead of yo u, hear t he rasping rattle of their harsh wings in brief flight. But they do little real fiddl ing. The fidd lers now are t.}le crickets. . Listen on any hot afternoon or warm evenmg, particularly in the country, and you will hear the crickets even though you seldom see them. In the afternoon you will hear the black field crickets, chirping as we say, and often into the warm evening. But in the evening, from dusk on through the warm night, the more insistent sound will be the trilling of the pale green tree crickets. Individually the tree cricket's trill is not so loud, but because all those in the neighborhood synchronize their trills the sound can be a s insistent as were the calls of the spring peepers back in April. The loudest fiddlers of all are the katydids, which look like green, hunch-backed grasshop\u00b7 pers. Night after night they rasp wing on wing and make that monotonous call, shrill and seem\u00b7 ingly endless. But the katydids won't be heard for another two weeks or so. Meanwhile the crickets possess late July, chirping and trilling the warm hours away as though summer endured forever, ana IL is noL Lne 11au which is accustomed to getting it. Whether the other half will learn anything from the incident is doubtful, of course, because a setness of way began a long time ago in a certain garden, a snake and apple being present. But it is July now, and throughout the world there are thousands of summer bachelors.

I warned of \"a rising tide of discontent tha t threa tens th e publ_ic safety\" in many parts of the country. I emphasized that \"the events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cri es for equality that no city or State or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them. \" \"It is a time to act,\" I said, \"in the Congress, in State and local legislative bodies and, above all, in all of our daily lives.\" \u00b7 In t he days that have followed, the freclictions of increased violence have been tragically borne out. The ' fires of frustration and discord\" have burned hotter than ever. 85011- 6 3 -1 _,. . . . -ill,JGHTS . At the same in:ie, the response of the Am erican people to this appeal to their principles and obligations has been Teassuring. Private progress__:_by merchants and unions and local organizations-has been marked, if not uniform, in many areas. Many doors long closed to Negroes, North and South, have been opened. Local biracial committees, under private and public sponsorship, have mushroomed. The ma.yors of our major cities, whom I earlier addressed, have pledged renewed ac tion. But persisting inequalities and tensions make it clear that Federal action must lead the way, providing both the N ation's standard and a nationwide solution. In short, the tin1e has come for the Congress of the United States to join with the executive and judicial branches in making it clear to all that r ace has no place in American life or law. On F ebruary 28, I sent to the Congress a message urging the cnnc trn ent this year of three important pieces of civil rights legislat ion: 1. Voting.-Legislation to assure the availability to all of a b as ic and powerful right-the right to vote in a free American electionby providing for the appointment of temporary Federal v otii:w referees while votino- suits are proceeding in areas of demonstrated need; by giving such suits preferential and expedited treatment in the Federal comts; by prohibiting in Federal elections the application of differ ent tests and standards to different voter applicants; and by providing that, in voting suits pertaining to such elections, the completion of the si.-.::th grade by any applicant creates a presumption that he is literate. Armed with the full and equal right to vote, our Negro citizens can help win other rights through political channels not now open to them in many areas. 2. 'Civil Rights Oommission.-Legislation to renew and expand the authority of the Commission on Civil Ri~hts, enablin~ it to serve as a national civil rights clearinghouse offenng informat10n, advice, and technical assistance to any public or private agency that so requests. 3. School desegregation.-Legislation to provide Federnl technical and financial assistance to aid school districts in the process of desegregation in compliance with the Constitution. Other measures introduced in the Coniress have nlso received the support of this ad.ministration, including tnose aim.eel at assuring equal employment opportunity. Although these r ecommendations were transmitted to the Congress some time ago, neither House has yet had an opportunity to vote on any of these essential meas m es. The Negro's drive for justice, however, has not stood still-nor will it, it is now clear, until full equali ty is achieved. The growing and understandable dissatisfaction of Negro citizens with the presen t pace of desegregation, and their increased determination to secme for themselves the equality of opportunity and treatment to which they are rightfully entitled, have underscor ed what should already have \u00b7been clear : the necessity of the Congress enacting this year-not only the measures aJrnady proposed-but also additional legislation providing legal remedies for the denial of certain individual rights. The venerable code of equity law commands \"for every wrong, a remedy.\" But in too many communities, in too many parts of t he country, wrongs are inflicted on Negro citizens for which no effective r emedy at law is clearly and readily available. State and local laws may even affirmatively seek to den y th e rights to which these citizens I 3 CIVIL RIGHTS are fairly entitled-and this cn,n result only in a decreased respect for the law and increased violations of the law. In the continued absence of congressional action, too many State and local officials as well as businessmen will remain unwilling to accord these rights to all citizens. Some local courts and local merchants may well claim to be uncertain of the law, while those merchants who do recognize the justice of the Negro's request (and I believe these constitute the great majority of merchants, North and South) will be fearful of being the first to move, in the face of official, customer, employee, or competitive pressures. Negroes, consequently, can be expected to continue increasi ngly to seek the vindication of these rights tlu-ough organized direct action, with all its potentially explosive consequences, such as we have seen in Birmingham, in Philadelphia, in Jackson, in Boston, in Cambridge, Md., and in mn,ny other parts of the country. In short, the result of continued Federal legislative inaction will be continued, if not increased, racial strife-causing the leadership ou both sides to pass from the hands of reasonable and responsible men to the purveyors of hate and violence, endangering domestic tranquillity, r et::i.rding our Nation's economic and social progress and weitkening the r espect with which the rest of the world regards us. No -American, I feel sure, would prefer this course of tension, disorder, and diYision- ancl the great majorit~, of our citizens simply cannot accept it. For these reasons, I am proposing that the Congress stay in session this year until it has enacted-preferably as a single omnibus billthe most responsible, reasonable, and urgently needed solutions to this problem, solutions which should be acceptable to all fair-minded men. This bill would be known as the Civil Rights Act of 1963, and would include-in addition to the aforementioned provisions on voting rights and the Civil Rights Commission-additional titles on public accommodations, employment, federally assisted programs, a Community R elations Service, and education, with the latter including my previous recommendation on this subject. In addition, I am requesting certain legislative and budget amendments designed to improve the trainin&', skills, and economic opportunities of the economically distressed. and discontented, white and Negro alike. Certain executive actions are also reviewed here; but legislative action is imperative. \u00b7\u00b7 J. E QUAL A cco MMODATIONS 11- PunLrc FA CILITIES Events of r ecent weeks have again underlined how deeply om Negro citizens r esent the injustice of being arbitrarily denied equa.l access to those facilities and accommodations which are otherwise open to the general public. That is a daily insult which has no place in a country proud of its heritage- the heritage of the melt,ing pot, of equal rights, of one nation and one people. N o one has been barred on account of bis race from fighting or dying for America-there are no \"white\" or \"colored\" signs on the foxholes or graveyards of battle. Smely, in 1963, JOO years after emancipation, it should not be necessary for any American citizen to demonstrate in the streets for the opportunity to stop at a hotel, or to eat at a lunch counter in the very department store in which he is shopping, or to enter a motion picture 4 CIVIL RIGHTS h~use, on th\u00b7e s111ne terms as any other customer. As I stated in my message to the Congress of February 28, \"no action is more contrary to the spirit of our democracy and Cons titution-or more rightfully resented by a Negro citizen who seeks only equal treatmen.t-than the barring of that citizen from restaurants, hotels, theaters, recreational areas, and other public accommodations and facilities.\" The U.S. Government has taken action through the courts and by other means to protect those who are peacefully demonstrating t o obtain access to these public facilities ; and it has taken action to bring an end to discrimination in rail, bus, and airline terminals, to open up restaurants and other public facilities in all buildings leased as well as owned by the Federal Government, and to assure full equality of access t-0 all federally owned parks, fores ts, and other recreational areas. When uncontrolled mob action directly threatened the nondiscriminatory use of transpor tation facilities in Ma.y 1961, F e1eral ma.rshals were employed to restore order and prevent potentially widespread personal and proper ty damage. Growing nationwide concern with this problem, however, makes it clear that further Federal action is needed now to secure the right of all citizens to the full enjoyment of all facilities which 11re open to the general public. Such legisl11tion is clearly consistent with the Constitution and with om\u00b7 concepts of both human rights and property rights. The argument that such measmes constitute 11n unconstitutional interference with property rights has consistently been rejected by the courts in upholding ll1ws on zoning, collective bargaining, minimum wages, smoke control, and countless other measures designed to make certain that the use of private property is consistent with. the public interest. While the legal situations are not parallel, it is interesting to iiote that Abraham Lincoln, in issuing the Emancipation Proclamation 100 years ago, was also accused of violating the property rights of slaveowners. Indeed, there is an age-old saying that \"property has its duties as well as its rights\"; and no property owner who holds those premises for the purpose of serving at a profit the American public 11t la.rge can claim 11ny inherent right to exclude a part of that public on grounds of race or color. Just as the law requires common c111Tiers to serve equally n11 who wish theiT services, so it c11n require public 11ccommodations to 11ccommod11te equally all segments of the general public. Both lrn mn,n rights and proper ty rights are found11tions of om society- and both will flourish as the result of this measure. In a society which is increasingly mobile and in an economy which is increasingly interdependent, bu.sine s establishments which serve the public- such as hotels, rest11urants, theat ers, stores, and othersserve not only th e members of th eir immediate communities but travelers from other tates and visitors from abroad. Their goods come from all over tJ1 e I11,tion. This participation in the :flow of interstate commerce has given these . business establishments both increased prosperity and n.n increased responsibility to provide equal access and service to all citizens. Some 30 States,1 the District of Columbia, and numerous citiescovering some two-thirds of this country and well over 'Alaska, Massachusetts, Mich gan, Mlnllesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hompslure, Now Jersey, New Menco, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, P ennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, ancl Wyoming.

CIVIL RIGHTS 5 its people-have already enacted laws of varying effectiveness against discrimination in places of public accommodation, many of them in response to the recommendation of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights in 1947. But while their efforts indicate that legislation in this area is not extraordinary, the failure of more States to take effective action makes it clear that Federal legislation is necessary. The State and local approach has been tried. The voluntary approach has been tried. But these approaches are insufficient to prevent the free flow of commerce from being arbitrarily and inefficiently restrained and distorted by discrimination in such establishments. Clearly the Federal Government has both the power and the obligation to eliminate these discriminatory practices: first, because they adversely affect the national economy and the flow of interstate commerce; and secondly, because Congress has been specifically empowered under the 14th amendment to enact legislation making certain that no State law permits or sanctions the unequal protection or treatment of any of its citizens. There have been increasing public demonstrations of resentmen t. directed against this 1..'i.nd of discrimination-demonstr_ations which too often breed tension and violence. Only the Federal Governmen t, it is clear, can make these demonstrations unnecessary by providing peaceful remedies for the grievances which set them off. For these reasons, I am today proposing, as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1963, a provision to guarantee all citizens equal access to the services and facilities of hotels, restaurants, places of amusement, and retail establishments. This seems to me to be an elementary right. Its denial is an arbitrary indignity that no American in 1963 should have to endure. The proposal would give the person aggrieved the right to obtain a court order against the offending establishment or persons. Upon receiving a complaint in a case sufficiently important to warran t his conclusion that a suit would materially further the purposes of the act, the Attorney General-if he finds that t.he aggrieved party is unable to undertake or otherwise arrange for a suit on his own (for lack of financial means or effective representation , or for fe11,r of economic or other injury)- will first r efer the case for voluntary settlement to the Community Relations Service described below, give the establishment involved time to correct its practices, permit State and local equal access laws (if any) to Op()rate first, and then , and only then, initiate a suit for compliance. In short, to the extent that these unconscionable practices can be corrected by the individual owners, localities, and States (and r ecent experience demonstrates bow effectively and uneventfully this can be done) , th e Federal Governm ent bas no desire to intervene. But an explosive national problem can not await city-by-city solutions; and t hose who loudly abhor Federal action only in vite it if they neglect or evade their own obligations. This provision will open doors in every part of the country which never should have been closed. It,s enactment will hasten the end to practices which have no place in a free and united nation, and thus help move this potentially dangerous problem from the streets to the courts. 6 CIVIL RIGHTS II. D ESEGRE GATIO N OF SCHOOLS In my message of F ebrua.r y 28, while commending the progress akeady made in achieving desegregation of education at all levels as foquired by the Constitution, I was compelled to roint out the slowness of progress toward primary and seconda,r y schoo desegregation. The Supreme Court has recently voiced the same opinion. M any Negro children entering segregated grade schools at the time\u00b7 of the Supreme Court decision in 1954 will enter segr egated high schools this year, having suffered a loss which can never be regained. Indeed, discrimination in education is one basic cause of the other inequities and hardships inflicted upon our NegTO citizens. The lack of equal educational opportunity deprives the individual of equal economic opportunity, restTicts his contribution as a citizen and community leader, encourages him to dTOp out of school and imposes a heavy burden on the effott to elimin ate discrimin atory practices and prejudices from our nation al life. \u00b7 The F ederal courts, pursuant to the 1954 decision of the U .S. Supreme Court and earlier decisions on institutions of higher learning, have shown both competence and courage in directing the desegregation of schools on the local level. It is appropriate to keep this responsibility largely within the judicial arena. But it is unfair and unrealistic to expect that the burden of initiating such cases can be wholly borne by private litigants. Too often those \u00b7entitled to bring suit on behalf of their children lack the economic ineans for instituting and main taining such cases or the ability to withstand the personal, physical, and economic harassment which sometimes descends upon those who do ins titute them. The same is true of students wishing to attend th e college of their choice but un able t o assume the burden of litigation. These difficulties are among the principal reasons for the delay in carrying out the 1954 decision; and this delay cannot be justified to those who have been hurt as a result. Rights such as these, as the Supreme Court r ecently said, are \"present rights. They are not merely h opes to some fu ture enjoyment of some formalistic constitut ional promise. The basic guarantees of our Constitution are warrants for the here and now * * *.\" In order to achieve a more ord erly and consistent complia.n ce with the Supreme Court's school and college desegregation decisions, therefore, I recommend that the Congress assert its specific constitu tional ~u thority to implement the 14th amendment by including in th e Civil Righ ts Act of 1963 a new title providing the following: (A) Au thority would be given the Attorney General to initiate in the Federal district courts appropriate legal proceedings against local public school boards or public institutions of higher learning-or to in tervene in existing cases-whenever(1) be has received a written complaint from students or from the parents of students who are being den ied equal protection of the laws by a segregated public school or college; and (2) he certifies that such persons are unable to undertake or otherwise arrange for the initiation and maintenance of such legal proceedings for lack of financial means or effective legal representation or for fear of economic or other injury ; and (3) he determines that his initiation of or intervention in such suit will materially further the orderly progress of desegregation I [_ CIVIL RIGHTS 7 in public education . For this purpose, the Attorney General would establish criteria to determine the priority and relative need for Federal action in those districts from which complaints have been filed. (B) As previously recommend ed, technical and financial assistance would be given to those school districts in all parts of the country which, voluntarily or as the result of litigation, are engaged in the process of meetino- the educational problems flowing from desegregation or racial imbJance but which are in need of guidance, experienced help, or financial assistance in order to train their personnel for this changeover, cope with new difficulties and complete the job satisfactorily (including in such assistance loans to a distri ct where State or loral funds have been withdrawn or withheld because of desegregation). Public institutions already operating without racial discrimination, of comse, will not be affected by this statute. Local action can always make Federal action unnecessary. Many school boards have peacefully and voluntarily desegreo-ated in recent years. And while this act does not include private c~leges and schools, I strongly urge them to live up to their responsibilities and to recognize no arbitrary bar of race or color-for such .bars have no place in any institution, least of all one devoted to the truth and to the improvement of all mankind. III. F A IR AND FULL EMPLOYMEN T Unemployment falls with special cruelty on minority groups. The unemployment rate of N egro workers is more than twice as high as that of the working force as a whole. In many of our larger cities, both North and South, the number of jobless Negro youth-often 20 percent or more-creates an atmosphere of frustration, resentment, and unrest which does not bode well for the future. Delinquency, vandalism, gang warfare, disease, slums, and the high cost of public welfare and crime are all directly related to unemployment among whites and Negroes alike-and recent labor difficulties in Philadelphia may well be only the beginning if more jobs are not found in the larger northern cities in particular. Employment opportunities, moreover, play a major role in determining whether the rights described above are meaningful. There is little value in a Negro's obtaining the right to be admitted to hotels and restaurants if be has no cash in his pocket and no job . Relief of Negro un employment reqt1ires progress in three major areas: (1) More jobs must be created through greater economic growth.The Negro-too often unskilled, too of ten the first to be fired and the last to be hired- is a primary victim of recessions, depr essed areas, and unused industrial capacity. Negro unemployment will not be noticeably diminished in this country until the total demand for labor is effectively increased and the whole economy is headed toward a level of full employment. 1Vhen our economy operates below capacity, Negroes are more severely affected than other groups. Conversely, return to full employment yields particular benefits to the Negro. Recent studies have shown that for every 1 percentagepoint decline in the general unemployment rate there tends to be a 2 percentage-point r eduction in Negro unemployment. Prompt and substantial tax reduction is a key to achieving the full employment we need. The promise of the area redevelopment i . 8 - . - -~- - - which tive town.rd the deep-seated economic distress-mus t no t be stifled for want of sufficient authorization or adequate finan cing. The accelerated public works program is now gaining momentum; States, cities, and local communities should press ahead with the projects financed by this measure. In addition, I have instructed the Departments of Labor, Commerce, and Health , Education, and Welfare to examine how their programs for the relief of unemployment and economic hardship can be still more intensively fo cused on those areas of hardcoi:e, long-term unemployment, \u00b7 among both white and nonwhite workers. Our concern with civil rights must not cause any diversion or dilution of our efforts for economic pro~E~ss-for without such progress the Negro's hopes will remain unfu1111led. (2) J..101\u00b7e education ancl tmining to raise the level of skills.-A clistressing number of unemployed Negroes are illiterate and unskilled, r efugees from farm automation, unable to do simple computations or even to read a help-wanted advertisement. Too many are equipped to work only in those occupations where technology and other changes have reduced the need for manpower-as farm labor or manual labor, in mining or construction. Too many have attended segregated schools that were so lacking to adequate funds and faculty as to be unable to produce qualified job applicants. And too many who have attended nonsegregated schools dropped out for lack of incentive, guidance, or progress. The unemployment rate for those adults with less than 5 years of schooling is a.round 10 percent; it has consistently been double the prevailing rate for high school graduates; and studies of public welfare recipients show a shockingly high proportion of parents with less than a primary school education. Although the proportion of Negroes without adequate education and training is far higher than the proportion of whites, none of these pro bl ems is r estricted to Negroes a.Ione. This Nation is in critical need of a massive upgrading in its education and training effort for all citizens. In an age of r apiclly changing technology, that effort today is failin g millions of our youth. It is especially failing Negro youth in segr egated schools and crowded slums. If we are ever to lift them from the morass of social and economic degradation, it will be th.rough the strengthenin~ of our edu cation and trainin g services-by improving the quality of instruction; by enabling our schools to cope with rapidly e:;,.J)anding enrollm ents;. and by increasing op:portunities and incentives for all individuals to complete their educat10n and to con tinue their self-development during adulthood. I have ther efore reques ted of the Congress and r equest again today the enactment of legislation to assist education at every level from grade school through graduate school. I have also .r equested the enactment of sever al measures which provide, by various means and for various age and educational groups, expanded job training and job experience. Today, in the new and more urgen t context of this message, I wish to renew my request for these measures, to expand their l?rospective operation and to supplemen t them with additional provisions. The additional $400 million which will be r equired beyond that contained in the J anuary budget is more t han offset by the various budget reductions which I have already sen t to the Congress in the last 4 months. Studies show, moreover, that the loss of 1 yea1s income clue to unemployment is mo1'e -- CIVIL R.IGH'l'S 9 (han the total cost of 12 years of education through high school; and, when . welfare and other social costs are added, it is elem\u00b7 that failure to take {hese steps will cost us far more than thefr enactment. There is no more profitable investment than educa tion, and no greater waste than ill- I trained youth. Specifically, I now propose: (A) That additional funds be provided to broaden the manpower de velopment ancl tmining program, and that the act be amended, not only to increase the authorization ceiling and to postpone the effec.: tive date of State matching r equirements, but also (in keeping with the recommendations of the President's Committee on Youth Employment) to lower the age for training allowances from 19 to 16, to allocate funds for literacy training, an d to permit the payment of a higher proportion of the program's training nllowances to out-of-school youths, with provisions to assure t.lrnt no on e drops out of school t.o t ake :idvimtage of this progmm ; . . (B) That additional funds be provided to finnnce the pending uouth emvloymerit bill, which is designed to channel the energies of ou t-of-school, out-of-work youth into the constructive outlet offered by hometown improvement proj ects and conservation work; (C) That t,h e pending vocational education amendments, which would greatly update nnd expimd this progmm of teaching job skills to those in school, be strengthened by the nppropriation of additional funds, with some of the added money em\u00b7marked for those areas with a high incidence of school dropouts and youth unemploym ent, and by the addition of a new program of demonstration youth train.ir1g projects t o be conducted in these ar eas; \u00b7 (D) That the vocational education progrnm be furth er amended to provide a worlc-study vrogram for youth of high school age, with F edernl funds helping their school or ot,her local public agency employ them part time in order to ennble and encourage them to coinplete their training; . (E) That the ceiling be raised on the adillt basic education provisions in the pending education progrnm, in order to help the States ten.ch the fund amental tools of li teracy and learning to culturally deprived adults. More than 22 million Americm1S in nll parts of th e country have less than 8 yenrs of schooling; nnd (F) That the public welfare worlc-reli~f ancl training program, which the Congress added last year, be amended to provide Federal fin ancing of the supervision and equipment costs, and rnore F ederal demonstration and training proj ec ts, thus enco uraging Sta.te and locnl welfare agencies to put employable but unemployed welfare recipients to work on local proj ects which do not displace ot,her workers. To make the above r ecommendations effective, I call upon more States to adopt enabling legislation covering un employed fathers under the aid-to-dependent children program, thereby gaining their services for \"work-relief\" jobs, and tq moYe ahead more Yigorously in implementing the manpower deYelopment and tru.ining program. I am asking the Secretaries of Labor and HEW to make use of th eir authority to deal directly with communities and yocationa.1 schools whenever State cooperation or progress is insufficient, particularly in _those areas where youth unemployment is too high. AboYe all , I urge the Congress to enact all of these measures with aln.crity and foresight. H. Doc. 124, 88-1 - 2 - 10 CIVIL RIGHTS For even the complete elirnination of ra cial discrimination in employment-a goal toward which this Nation mus~ strive (as discussed below)-will not put a single un employed Negro to work unless he has the skills required and unl ess more jobs hav'e been created-and thus the passage of the legislation described above (under bo th secs. (1) and (2)) is essential if the obj ectives of this message are to be met. (3) Finally racial discrimination in employment must be eliminated. D enial of the right to work is W1fair, regardless of its victim. It is doubly unfair to throw its burden on an individual because of his race or color. . Men who served side by side with each other on the field of battle should have no difficul ty working side by side on an assembly l~ne or construction project. \u00b7 'fherefore, to combat this evil in all par ts of the country, (A) The Committee on Equcil Employment Opportunity, under the chairmanship of the Vice President, should be given a permanent statutory basis, assuring it of adequate financing and enforcement procedures. That Committee is now stepping up its efforts to remove rncial barriers in the hiring practices of Federal depa.r tments, agencies, and Federal contractors, covering a total of some 20 million employees and the Nation's major employers. I have requested a company-bycompnny, plant-by-plant, union-by-union 1;eport to assme the implementation of this policy. (B) I will shortly issue an Executive order extending the authority of the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity to include the construction of buildings and other facili ties undertaken wh olly or in past as a result of F ederal grant-in-aid programs. . (C) I have directed that all F ederal construction programs be review.eel to prevent any racial discrimination in hiring!ractices, either directly in the rejection of presently available qualifie Negro workers or indirectly by the exclusion of Negro applicants for apprenticeshi p training. (D) I have dil'ected the ecr'etary of Labor, in the conduct of his duties under the Federal Apprenticeship Act and E xecutive Order No. 10925, to require that the admission of young workers to apprenti ceship programs be on a completely nondiscriminatory basis. (E) I have dii-ectecl the Secretary of Labor to make certain that the job counseling and placement responsibilities of the Federal-State Employment Service a.r e carried out on a nondiscriminatory basis, a.n d to help assure that full and equal employment oppor tunity is provided nil qualified Negro applicants. The selection and referral of applica,nts for employment and for training opportunities, and the administration of the employment offices' other services a.nd facilities, must be carried on witho ut regaTd to race or color. This will be of special importance to Negro es graduating from hi gh school or college this month. (F) The Departn.1ent of Justice has intervened in a case now pendino- before the NLRB involviug charges ofracinl discrimination on the part of certain union locals. (G) As a part of its new policy on Federal em ployee organizations, this Government ,vill recognize only those that do not discriminate on grounds of mce or color. (H) I have called upon t he leaders of organize<l labor to. end discrimination in their membership policies; and some 118 unions1 representing 85 percent of the AFL--CIO membership, have signea CML RIGHTS i 11 nondiscrimination agreements with the Committee on Equal Emplojrme'nt Opportunity. More are expected. (I) Finally, I renew my support of pending Federal fair employment practices legislation, applicable to both employers and unions. Approximately two-thirds of the Nation's labor force is already covered by Federal, State, and local equal employment opportunity measures_.:..__ including those employed in the 22 States and numerous cities which hav\u00b7e enacted such laws as well as those paid directly or indirectly by Federal funds. But, as the Secretary of Labor testified in Januar)' 1962, Federal legislation is desirable, for it would help set a standarcl for all the Nation and close existing gaps. This problem of unequal job opportunity must not be allowed to grow, as the result of either recession or discrimination. I enlist every employer, every labor union, and every agency of governmentwhether affected directly by these measures or not-in the task of seeing . to it that no false lines ar e drawn in assuring equnlity of the right and opportunity to make a decen t living. IV. COMMUNITY RELATIONS SERVICE I lrnxe rep eatedly \u00b7stressed the fact that progress in race r elations, while it cannot be delayed, can be more solidly and more peacefully nccomplished to the extent that legislation can be buttressed by voluntary action. I have urged each member of the U.S. Conference of Mayors to establish biracial human relations committees in every city; and I hope all communities will establish such a group, preferably through official action. Such a board or committee can provide invaluable services by identifying community tensions before they reach the crisis stage, by improving cooperation and communication between the races, and by advising local officials, merchants, and organizations on the steps which can be taken to insure prompt progress. A similar agency is needed on the Federal level- to work with these local committees, providing them ,vith advice and assistance- to work in those commw1ities which lack a local committee-and generally to help ease tensions and suspicions, to help resolve interracial disputes and to work quietly to improve r elations in any community tbreatened or torn with strife. Such an effort is in no way a substitute for effective legislative guarantees of human rights. But conciliation and cooperation can facilitate the achievement of those rights, enablin g legislation to operate more smoothly and more effectively. The D epartment of Justice and its Civil Rights Division have already performed yeoman service of this nature, in Birmingham, in J ackson, and throughout the country. But the problem has grown beyond the time and energies which a few otherwise burdened officirtls can make available- and, in some areas, the confidence of all will be greater in an intermediary whose duti es are completely separated from departmental functions of investigation or litigation. It is my intention , therefore, to establish by Executive order (until such time as it can be created by statute) an independent Community Relations S ervice- to fulfill the fun ctions described above, working through regional, State, and local committees to the extent possible, and offering its services in tension-torn communi ties either upon its own mot.ion or upon the request of a local official or other party. 12 CIVIL RIGHTS Authority for such a Service is included in the proposed omnibus bill. It will work without publicity and hold all information imparted to its officers in. strict confidence. Its own resources can be preserved by its encouraging and assisting the creation of State and local committees, either on a continuing basis or in emergency situations. Without powers of enforcement or subpena, such a Service is no substitute for other measures; and it cannot guarantee success. But dialogue and discussion are always better than violence-and this agency, by enabling all concerned to sit down and reason together, , can plfty a major rol e in achieving peaceful progress in civil rights. V. FEDERAL PROGRA.i\\lS Simple justice requires that public funds ,' to which all taxpayers of all races contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes, or results in racial discrimination.' Direct discrimination by F ederal, State, or local governments is prohibited by the Constituti9n. But indirect discrimination, th.rough the\u00b7 use of Federal funds, is just as invidious; and it should not be necessary to resort to the courts to prevent each individual violation. Congress and the Executive have their responsibilities to uphold the Constitution also; and, in the 1960's, the executive branch has sou~ht to fulfill its responsibilities by banning discrimination in federally financed housing, in NDEA and NSF institutes, in federally affected employment, in the Army and Air Force Reserve, in the training of civilian defense workers, and in all federally owned and leased facilities. Many statures providing Federa.l financial assistance however, define with such precision both the administrator's roie and the conditions upon which specified amounts shall be given to designated recipients that the amount of administrative discretion remainingwhich might be used to withhold funds if discrimination were not ended- is at best questionable. No administrator has the unlimited authority to invoke the Constitution in opposition to the mandate of the Congress. Nor would it always be helpful to require unconditionally-as is often proposed-the wi thdrawal of all Federal funds from programs urgently needed by Negroes as well as whites ; for this may only penalize those who least deser ve it without ending discrimination. Instead of permitting this issue to become a political device often exploited by those opposed to social or economic progress, it would be better at this time to pass a single comprehensive provision making it clear that the Federal Government is not r equired, under any statute, to furnish any kind of financial assistance-by way of grant, loan, ?0!1tra_ct, gt~aranty 1 ins~ua1;1c~ or_ otherwise- to ~ny program or activity ill which racial discrrmU1at10n occurs. This would not permit the Federal Government to cut off all Federal aid of all kinds as a means of punishing an area for the discrimination occurring therein- but it would clarify the authority of any administrator with respe?t to Federal funds or financial assistance and discriminatory practices. CoNcLusro Many problems remain that cannot be ignored . The enactment of the legislation I have recommended will not solve all our problems of race relations. This bill must be supplemented by action in every CIVIL RIGHTS 13 branch of government at the F ederal, State, and local level.' It must be supplemented as well by enlightened private citizens, private businesses and private labor and civic organizations, by responsible educators and editors, and cer tainly by r eligious leaders who r ecognize the conflict between racial bi0 \u00b7otry and the Holy Word. This is not a sectional prob1em- it is nationwide. It is not a partisan problem. The proposals set forth above arn based on, a careful consideration of the views of leaders of both par ties in both Houses of Congress. In 1957 and 1960, members of both parties rallied behind the civil rights measures of my predecessor; n,nd I am cer tain that this tradition can be continued, as it has in the case of world crises. A national domestic crisis also calls for bipartisa.n unity and solutions. We will not solve these problems by blaming any group or section for the legacy which has beerr handed down by past &enerations. But neither will these problems be solved by clinging to tne patterns of the past. Nor, finally, can they be solved in the streets, by lawless acts on either side, or by the physical actions or presence of any private group or public official, however appealing such melodramatic devices may seem to some. Durino- the weeks past, street demonstrations, mass picketing, ana parades have brought these matters to the Nation's attention in dramatic fashion in many cities throughout the United States. This has happened because these racial injustices are real and no other remedy was in sight. But, as feelings have risen in recent days, these demonstrations have increasingly endangered lives and property, inflamed emotions and unnecessarily divided communities. They are not the way in which this country should rid itself of r acial discrimination. Violence is never justified ; and, while peaceful communication, deliberation, and petitions of pro test con tinue, I want to caution against demonstrations which can lead to violence. This problem is now before the Congress. Umuly tactics or pressures will not help and may hinder the effective consideration of these measures. If they are enacted, there will be legal remedies available; and, therefore, while the Congress is completing its work, I urge all community leaders, Negro Emel white, to do their utmost to lessen tensions and to exercise self-restraint. The Congress should have an opportunity to freely work its will. M eanwhile, I strongly support action by local public officials and mer chants to remedy these grievances on their own. The lea-al remedies I have proposed are the embodiment of this Nation's basic posture of commonsense and common justice. They involve every American's right to vote, to go to school, to get a job and to be served in a public place without arbitrary discriminationrigh ts which most Americans take for granted. In short, enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1963 a t this session of the Congress- however long it may take and .however troublesome it may be- is imperative. It will go far toward providing r easonable men with the r easonable means of meeting these problems; and it will thus help end the kind of r acial strife whi.ch this Nation can h ardly afford. R ancor, violence, disunity, and national shame can only hamper our national standing and security. To par aphrase the words of Lincoln; \"In giving freedom to the Negro, we assure freedom to the free-honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve.\" 14 CIVIL RIGHTS I therefore ask every Member of Congress to set aside sectional and political ties, and to look at this issue from the viewpoint of the Nation. I ask you to look into your hearts-not in search of charity, for the Negro neither wants nor needs condescension-but for the one plain, proud, and priceless quality that unites us all as Americans; a sense of justice. In this year of the emancipation centennial, justice requires\u00b7us to insure the blessings of liberty for all Americans and their posterity-not merely for reasons of economic efficiency, world diplomacy, and domes t.ic tranquilit,:v- hut, above all, because it is right.

TITLE II- INJUKCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST DIS CRIMI KATIO N IN PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIOKS F I ND I NGS SEC. 201. (a) The America n people have become increasingly mobile dming tho last generation, a nd millions of Ameri can citi zens travel each year from State to S-tat e by rail, a ir, bus, automobile, and other mea ns. A substanti al number of such travelers are members of mi nority racial an d religious groups. These citizens, parti cul arly Negroes, a rc subj ec ted in ma ny places to discrimin ation a nd segregation, and they are frequently un able to obtain the goods a nd services availa ble to other interstate travelers. (b) Negroes an d members of other minority groups who travel interstate are frequently una ble to obtain adequate lodging acco mmod ations during their travels, with the res ul t that they may be compelled to stay a.t hotels or motels of poor and inferior quality, travel great distances from their norm al routes to find adequ at e accommodations, or make det ailed arrangements for lodging far in adva nce of scheduled interst at e travel. CIVIL RIGHTS 17 (c) Negroes aud members of other minority groups who travel interst at e are frequentlf unable to obtaiu adequat e food service at convenient places along their routes, with the result that many are dissuaded from traveling interstate, while others must travel considerable distances from their intended routes in order to obtain adequat e food service. (dJ Goods, ser vices, and persons in the amusement and entertainment indu. tries commonly move in interstate commerce, and t he entire American p eople benefit from the increased cult ural and recreational opport unities afforded thereby. Practices of audience discrimination and segregation artificially r estrict the number of persons to whom the interst ate amusement and entertainment indust ries may offer t heir goods and services. The burdens imposed on interstat e commer ce by such practices and the obstructions to the free flow of commerce wh ich r esult therefrom are serious and substantial. (e) Retail establishments in all States of the Union purchase a wide variety and a large volume of goods from business concerns located in other States and in foreign n ations. Discriminatory practices in such est ablishments, which in some instances have led to the withholding of patronage by those affected by such practices, inhibit and restrict the normal distribution of goods in the interst ate market. (f) Fraternal, religious, scientific, and other organizat ions engaged in interst at e operations are frequently dissuaded from holding conventions in cit ies which they would otherwise select beca.use t he public facilities in such cities are either not open to all m embers of racial or religious minority groups or are available on a segregated basis. (g) Business organizations are frequently hampered in obtaining t he servi ce\u00b7 of skilled workers and persons in the professions who are likely to encount er discrimination based on race, creed, color, or national origin in rest aurant s, ret ail stores, and places of amusement in t he area where t heir services are needed. Business organizat ions which seek t o avoid subjecting t heir employees t o such discrimination and to avoid the strife resulting therefrom are restrict ed in t he choice of location for their offices and plants. Such discriminat ion thus r educes the mobility of the national labor force and prevents the most effective aJlocation of national resources, including the interstate movement of indust ries, p articularly in some of the areas of the Nation most in need of indust rial and commer cial expansion and development. (h) The discriminatory pract ices described aboYe are in all cases encouraged, fost ered, or tolerated in some degree by the government al aut horities of the Stat es in which t hey occur, which license or protect the businesses involved by means of laws and ordinances and the activit ies of their executive and judicial officers. Such discriminatory practices, part icularly when their cumulative effect throughout t he Nation is considered, t ake on t he character of act ion by t he States and t herefore fall wit hin t he ambit of the equal protection clause of the fo urteent h amendment to t he Constitut ion of t he Unit ed States.

This is her great tradition. As early as December 1889, Henry W. Grady, whose name is on our modern and beautiful city hospital, on one of our finest schools, on one of our hotels, and whose statue stands in the heart of our city, said, in a speech made to the Merchants of Boston : \"The problem of race ... is so bound up in our honora ble obligation to the world th at we would no t disentangle it if we could ... I would rather see my people render back this question rightl y solved th an to see them gather all the spoils over which fac tion has contended since Cataline conspired and Caesar fought. \" This was Grady's basic a pproac h. His opinions, dealing with the context of hi s time, do not all jibe with tod ay's. But, he was rig ht in the great sense .. . it must be rightly solved. This is the city which welcomed back General Sherman, not many years after the war, and gave him a tremendous reception , including a dinner attended by Confederate veterans who directl y had opposed him-a nd who had been driven from the city which he proceeded , in time, to burn. This is the city which has always tri ed to look forw ard , not backward . It has never wa nted to be an old Southern city, caught like a fl y in amber, and dying of qu aintness and musty charm. From the tim e the so und of hammers and the ras p of saws bega n to be heard in the rebuilding of the city after Sherman's fires had died , we have sought to bu ild into th e city a belief in the principles of thi s country, of justice and opportunity. We have not always succeeded . T he record is not unm arred. But we h ave never ceased to try. One of our great strengths is that there have [ 2] ..L been attracted here the graduates of the many institutions over the nation. Every year we are pleased to carry items about the local alumni of Wisconsin , of Minnesota, of California, of Princeton , Yale, Harvard , Smith, Radcliff, Vassar, et al, who are to have a luncheon or dinner and are calling on the faithful to attend. Atlanta has attracted, too, many of the more ambitious young men and women from the smaller cities and towns of our own state and others of the South. We are a city of transportation and communication , and this has brought t\u00b7o us young executive and professional men . This press pack is an example. A great many persons, all volunteers, have worked on it. They want yo u to know that after the school decision by the U. S. Supreme Court, this was a city in which there was a debate and a continuing exchange of ideas. The White Citizens Councils, the Klans, and others of that mentality, could , and did, have their say. But they were answered. They did not dominate. They could not coerce or intimidate, as they did in neighboring states. The men and women who have compiled this press pack represent volunteer citizen organizatio ns wh ich have worked for public schools-and for the orderly processes of law. We, of the press, radio and television , have helped them have their say . We commend them to you. One never knows. The forces of evil and violence are unpredictable. But we believe that the overwhe lmin g sentim ent in thi s city is for lawf ul procedures. W hat we chiefly want yo u to know is that we have not been idle. We h ave not sa t with folded hands and wa ited. We h ave not left it for others to do. The people of the city have tried to organize public opinion , and , more important, to inform it. Th is press pack contains the essence of that effort.

JENKINS, CHIEF OF THE ATLA NTA POLICE DEPA RTMENT \"T he Board of E ducati on and the Superintendent of Schools bas original and \u00b7complete jurisdiction to operate the public schools of Atlanta.

' 'The highest value of the law is the keepin g of the peace- the Atlanta Police D epartment has fu ll responsibility and authority to maintain the peace and good order over the entire city, and espec iall y at and aro und the schools.\" August 1, 1961 [ 5] BACKGROUND: ATLANTA {19S4-1961) When the Supreme Court Decision of May 1954 put an end to legal segregation in the nation's schools, Georgia, like other deep South states, adopted an official policy of last-ditch legal resistance. Despite protests from the Georgia Education Association, the League of Women Voters and oth~r responsible citizens' groups, the General Assembly of 1955 adopted a \"Private School Plan\" which included , among other measures, a provision to cut off funds from any school system which attempted to desegregate. Secure in their legal \"Magi not Line\" and unhampered by fea r of Federal initiative in enforcing the ruling in \"Brown vs. Topeka,\" most Georgians felt the Supreme Court's emphasis was on the word \"deliberate\" rather than \"speed.\" Schools would continue in the traditional way; regional mores would remain unchanged. The bitter lessons of Little Rock and Norfolk were as yet unlearned. The changes in Baltimore, St. Louis and Louisville were not deep-South enough to stir Georgians from the blanket of apath y which then covered the entire school question. The first brush with realit y came in January 1958, when a group of Atlanta Negroes. in a \"class action ,\" filed suit agai nst the Atlanta School Board . The suit (Calhoun et al vs. Latimer ) asked that the School Board be enjoi ned from practicing racial discrimination in the public schools. When in June of 19 59 U. S. District Judge Frank Hooper ruled in favor of the pl aintiffs and ordered the Atlanta Board to submit a plan for desegregation by the fo llowing December, the handwriting was clearl y on the wall. The [ 6 ] School Board had no alternative but to submit a plan. Yet any plan to desegregate Atlanta's schools would be squarely in conflict with Georgia's m assive resistance laws and would automatically fo rce their closure. Meanwhile, in October of 1958, echoes from Norfolk and Little Rock began to reverberate along the Peachtrees. Anxious letters were written to the newspapers. Isol ated groups of citizens held meetings. In November, the School Committee of the Atl anta League of Women Voters publicly submitted ten questions to the School Board, the most important of which was, \"Will every school in A tlanta close if the Courts order integration?\" T he School Board withheld a public answer since the y were litigants in the pending Court suit; but an Atlanta Constitution columnist outlined the city's dilemma. On November 25th, under the auspices of the League of Women Voters, an open meeting was called to discuss ways and means of keeping schools open. A steering committee was fo rmed to seek coopera tion with the business and fi nanci al leadership of A tl anta. Since it was felt that a public stand at that time would be undesira bl e and premature, the steering committee neve r got off th e ground . T he disengagement of the loca l power structure , the unyielding \"never\" of the State political leadershi p and th e strident, often threatening segregationist voices clai ming th at \"no school s are better than in tegrated ones\" were powerful deterrents to organized community action. Yet because the Atlanta papers respo nsibly reported the news fro m other So uth ern cities, pointing out editoriall y the tragic consequences of m assive resista nce elsewhere, ma ny A tl antan s realized their public schools were in jeopardy and sought a way to save them. On December 9, 1958, eighteen white parents chartered HOPE, Inc. (Help O ur P ublic Education), choosing to avoid the integration vs. segregation iss ue by taking an u ncomplicated stand [ 7 ] for open public schools, period. Conceived primarily as an educational organization designed to clear up the fog of confusion engendered by \"massive resistance,\" \"interposition\" and other socalled alternatives to compliance, it rapidly became a rallying ground for moderates who previously had suffered to remain silent. With the fervor and enthusiasm only amateurs could maintain, HOPE spawned a welter of public manifestos (Ministers, Educators and Doctors, to name just a few) and generated enough interest by March of 1959 to hold a public rally which drew upwards of 1,500 people and some prominent speakers in support of open schools (Atlanta Mayor Hartsfield, Publisher Ralph McGill, Georgia Legislator M. M. (Muggsy) Smith and Editor Sylvan Meyer) . Favorable press, radio and television coverage Iof the March rally established a bona-fide \"Open Schools Movement.\" HOPE chapters formed in Gainesville, Marietta, Jonesboro, Rome, Athens, Macon and Savannah with other nuclei of interested supporters in cities and towns throughout the state. Inevitably there was opposition, much of it wellfinanced and organized. In addition to the States Rights Council led by Augusta politico, Ro y Harris, the Klans and White Citizens Councils, Atlanta-based centers of resistance such as MASE (Metropolitan Association for Segregated Education) and later GUTS (Georgians Unwilling to Surrender) headed by Lester Maddox, now a candidate in the five-cornered Atlanta m ayoralty race, sprang up to harass open school advocates. On November 30, 1959 the Atlanta School Board submitted a stair-step plan for desegregation of the public school s begi nning with the 12th grade (given in full elsewhere in this pamphlet) . Judge Hooper approved the plan on January 20, 1960 and ordered it into effect the following September; or as soon as the General Assembly of Georgia could enact statutes to allow Atlanta schools to operate. [ 8] In an attempt to influence legislative action, open school supporters mounted an educational crash program. Mayor Hartsfield proclaimed a \"Save Our Schools Week\" in Atlanta. Representatives of state-wide civic groups joined together in a coordinated effort. Legislators, business leaders and other opinion-makers throughout the state received repeated mailings underlinin\u00b7g the social, economic and educational disasters accompanying school closings elsewhere. The Fulton and DeKalb County legislative delegations which previously had withheld unanimous support, promised to seek legislative change. They were joined by a handful of salons from other parts of the state; but the prevailing sentiment when the General Assembly convened was to let Atlanta bear the brunt of school closings to preserve segregation elsewhere in Georgia. \u00b7 All during the legislative session public pressure in behalf of open schools grew stronger. Delegations of open school supporters called on Governor Vandiver, Senator Russell, Senator Talmadge and as many legislators as they could buttonhole. As a. result, the Legislature appointed a nineteenmember \"General Assembly Committee on Schools\" empowered to conduct hearings in each of the State's Congress ional Districts to find out whether \"the people of Georgia may wish to make a deliberate determination as to whether future education is to be afforded through direct tuition payments for use in private schools devoid of governmental control , or whether the public school system as it presently exists shall be maintained notwithstanding that the school system of A tlanta and even others yet to come may be integrated . . . \" Cynics regarded the Committee as a delaying tactic at best. It had power only to inquire and recommend and it was a foregone conclusion that most Georgians considered \"race-mixing\" far more disastrous than the abandonment of public education. Yet the strong grass-roots support for [ 9 ] open schools in nearly every part of the State was a surprise to almost everyone. The Committee had the good fortune to be chaired by widely-respected John Sibley, Chairman of the Board of the Trust Company of Georgia. Mr. Sibley conducted the hearings with good-humored dignity and impartiality. The importance of the \"Sibley Commission\" in awakening Georgians to the alternatives they faced cannot be overestimated. When the Committee issued its report in April 1960, the 11-member m ajority recommended a Freedom of Choice plan, somewhat similar to Virginia's. The 8-member minority_ stood fast for segregation, even at the cost of closed schools. The division within the Committee itself reflected the sharp differences of opinion in the state. Yet for the first time in the deep South, the majority of an all-Georgia committee appointed by the State Legislature with the blessings of the State Administration recommended that existing laws be changed to allow some desegregation . . . before a Negro ch ild actually applied to enter a w hite public school. After the publication of \"The Sibley Report,., Judge Hooper stayed integration of Atlanta schools for a year. On May 9, 1960, he amended the Atlan ta Plan to include desegregation of the 11th and 12th grades at the beginning of the J96 l school year. The Atlanta Plan was to become effect ive \"whether or not the General Assembly of Georgia at its session in January I 961 passes permissive legislation. \" In Judge Hooper's words, \"to order the Atlanta Public Schools to integrate . . . in September 1960 could mean but one thing; that is, the closing of Atlan ta's schools. To postpone this ... will give the Georg ia Legislature ... one last cha nce to prevent thi s closing. \" I mmedi ately fo llowi ng this fina l Court decision HOPE called a \"Georgia Open Schoo ls Co nference\" attended by 500 delegates in vited from some 87 Georgi a cities, towns or counties. Edward [ 10] R. Murrow televised this Conference in a nationwide documentary \"Who Speaks for the South.\" As it became more acceptable to speak out openly for legislative change, many came forward with strong public statements. As a Gainesville editor put it, \"You can hear minds changing all over Georgia.\" In the F all of 1960, open school advocates initiated \"Operation Las t Chance,\" taking their cue from Judge Hooper's words . Armed with forthright statements from Churches (all faiths and every important denomination, including the influential Georgia Baptist Convention) ; business leaders (the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, the Atlanta Jaycees and key individuals throughout the State); lawyers (the Atlanta and Georgia Bar Associations); educators (the Georgia Education Association , \"Mr. Jim\" Peters, venerable Ch airman of the State Board of Education) ; and m any others, the issue was kept constantly before the public. \"D ays of Deci sion\" Forums were held in Athens, Rome, A lbany, Columbus, Augusta and Savannah to plead the case for legislative change. The Georgia Chamber of Commerce conducted its own Legislative Forums, with Administration floor-leaders F r ank Twitty and Carl Sanders finding a preponderance of open-school sentiment and refl ecting this in their public statements. All this was played again st the backdrop of New Orlea ns which remained in the headlines throughout the F all. Coincident with the opening of the 1961 Legislati ve Session was the now-famous \"Athen's crisis. \" When two Negroes were ordered ad mitted to the Uni versity of Georgi a by U . S. District Judge W illi am A. Bootle, Governor Vandiver and the Legislature were prov ided a chaotic exa mpl e of what \"bitter-end \" resistance meant. Existi ng statutes wo uld fo rce closing Georgia's beloved University ( the nation's oldest state-supported institution of higher learn ing ) and this was too bitter a pill fo r even the strongest segregationists. On [ 11 ] January 18, 1961 , S. Ernest Vandiver, who had been elected Governor of Georgia only two years prior on a platform which said he would never permit desegregation , underwent a dramatic reversal. In o~der to save the schools of Georgia , he offered a \"Child Protection Plan ,\" through which a community can decide by local school board action or a referendum whether it wants to close its schools when it faces a court order to desegregate. If a community decides for open schools, tuition grants provide mone y for children not wishing to attend integrated schools. The Legislature promptly repealed the mandatory closing Jaws and adopted the Governor's four-bill package. The open schools advocates bad won their bat tle. Atlanta was now free to comply with its Court order, with no threat of school closings. Applications for transfer to the 11th arid 12th grades were submitted by 133 Negro children between May 1st and May 15th. After an exhaustive series of tests and interviews (required by the Atlanta Plan) ten were chosen to enter four previously allwhite high schools (Brown, Grady, Murphy and Northside) . 38 others are still in the process of appealing the Board's decision to reject their applications. One white child, Sandra Melkild, now attending Northside High School, has requested transfer to another presently all-white school , basing her request on \"freedom of association .\" The Atlanta School Board has denied her a transfer. On August 9th the State School Board overruled the Atlanta Board's decision ; but Judge Hooper has ordered a stay of the State Board of Education's ruling, pending a hearing. Once the conflict between State and Federal laws was resolved , emphasis shifted to desegregation with dignity. The organizations comprising the \" Open Schools Movement\" sent representatives to call on Dr. John Letson , Superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools, early last February to ask what citizens might do to help create a climate [ 12 ] of calm, dignified compliance with the law. It was suggested that church, business, service and youth groups outside the immediate jurisdiction of the school administration be encouraged to play a leading role in this effort through public discussion and dissemination of information. A new group, in fact an Organization of organizations, was formed with a broad base of community support. Its name: OASIS (Organizations Assisting Schools in September) an acronym Atlantans feel is descriptive of their city. OASIS, with its 53 affiliates, is divided into three sections-Religious, Civic and Service Groups and Youth-serving Agencies. Members range from service clubs and Girl Scouts to labor unions and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Its activity has been lowkey but intensive, seeking to work through already existing organizational machinery to reach hundreds of thousands of Atlanta's citizens. OASIS has stimulated hundreds of meetings throughout the long, hot Atlanta summer. 126 volunteer discussion leaders h ave been on call to assist at gatherings varying from 200 in the Southwest Community Council to half-a-dozen an~ious parents meeting in a neighbor's living room. A Speaker's Bureau, headed by an ex-president of The Toastmasters, provides information for business and service groups. A troupe of Theater Atlanta Players has presented improvised desegregation skits for teenagers at camps and youth centers all over town . OASIS has brought over one hundred white and Negro youth leaders together and encouraged Atlanta's more prominent citizens to speak out in behalf of responsible compliance. OASIS' Religio us Section spearheaded the observance of \"Law and Order Weekend (Friday, August 25th through Sunday, August 27th) during which Atlanta's prolifery of churches and synagogues conducted special prayers for peacefu l transition. Ministers were asked to take their [ I3 ] vacations before August 15th so that they would be on hand to give moral leadership. All faiths have participated in this effort, with leading clergy and lay representatives playing active roles as catalysts. All of these efforts have received considerable support from Atlanta's newspapers, television and radio stations. Mayor William B. Hartsfield's repeated assertions that Atlanta will preserve its reputation for .g ood race relations have been followed by public and private measures designed to prevent trouble. Police Chief Herbert T. Jenkins has had officers from his department observing racial disturbances in other cities for two and one-half years. The Chief has publicly proclaimed that law and order will be maintained and warned would-be violators of penalties. School Superintendent, Dr. John Letson, has told Atlantans that anything less than desegregation with peace and dignity will \"exact a price that will not be paid in full for a generation.\" And when school opens on August 30th, this city hopes to demonstrate that careful planning and intelligent preparation can prevent the violence that has accompanied school integration nearly everywhere else in the deep South. AN EDITORIAL P.S. WE HOPE YOU WILL READ In writing the forego ing p iece, we h ave tried to give you \"just the facts. \" Now Jet us tell you what's in our hearts. We had a double purpose in preparing this kit. If our schools desegregate smoothly and without incident- and the overwhelming majority of A tlantans are praying that they will- we wanted you to know why. If a rock is thrown or a demonstration staged, you ought to know that is not the whole story of our city. Ask any of our local newsmen to tell you about the \" Open Schools Movement.\" They'll say we\u00b7re [ 14] ,, a bunch of starry-eyed amateurs-a strictly grassroots-type operation held together chiefly with scotch tape and imagination. But they'll also tell you that we held together-through three interminable uphill years to accomplish what those who thought they knew all about Georgia said never would happen in our generation. Who took part in the \"Open Schools Movement?\" The ordinary people who live in Atlanta-and believe ir or not, much of Georgia. The printer who donated pamphlets and hand-bills on a \"pay if yo u get it\" basis. The businessmen wh-o gave an office and typewriter, stationery, erasers and all that scotch tape. The lawyers who voluntered their time and brainpower to unsnarl the tangled legal thickets. But most of all, the women of Atlanta who licked the stamps, organized the meetings and stayed on the telephone until they finished the job. Yes, the unsung heroines of the \"Open Schools Movement\" are mostly ordinary housewives and mothers who left beds unmade and meals uncooked to insure their children's educational future. Is it over yet? Not by a long shot. There are those with whom old ways die hard. We have beard the nation's most m ilitant racists are marshaling their forces to make a stand at this \"Second Battle of Atlanta.\" You must have heard it too- or most of you wouldn't be h ere. W hen the \"symbolic ten\" go to their classrooms, segregation in Georgia's common schools will be offici ally over. T here are those who wish the ten could be a thousand. There are many who object to even one. But whatever the views that divide them, A tlantans are united in a single hope : that the story that unfolds on August 30th will be m uch different from the one you might have expected . A nd when ten Negro children go to school on Wednesday, the heart of A tlanta will go i n with them. MRS. DAVfD N E IMAN Public Information Chairman OASIS ( Organizations Assisting Schools in September) [ 15 ] Atlanta Public Schools CTTY HALL ATLANTA 3, GEORGIA To Representatives of the Press, Radio and Television: Citizens of Atlanta have long recognized that good schools are an essential part of a great city.

N 1 ~ Information About the Transfer Students All of the ten transfer students, in the words of Deputy School Superintendent Rua! Stephens, \" have outstanding school academic records, made excellent scores on the tests given them and very favorable impressions\" when the y were interviewed by school officials. Some of the 10 were accepted in spite of the fact that their residences are nearer their present schools than the schools they asked to attend . School officials said that in such instances there were factors of \" overriding importance\" which figured in the decisions to accept the students. In one case, a youth aspired to go to the Naval Academy at Annapolis and was unable to get the ROTC training or special college preparatory courses in m athematics and physics at his present school. School officials m ade it clear from the beginning th at an important consideration in whether a Negro student was accepted or rejected would be his chances of doing well in a new school environm ent. Those finally accepted had composite test scores wh ich in most instances exceeded the median composite scores of the grades and schools to which the y are being transferred.

The primary function of newspapers is to communicate to the human race what its members do, feel and think. Journ a lism, therefore, demands of its practitioners the widest range of intelligence, of knowledge, and of experience, as well as natural and trained powers of observation and reasoning. To its opportunities as a chronicle are indissolvabl y linked its obligations as teacher and interpreter. II. To the end of findin g some means of codifying sound practice in just aspirations of Am erican Journ a lism these gains are se t forth: 1. RESPONS!BlLITY The right of a newspaper to attract and hold readers is restricted by nothin g but consideration of p ub lic we lfa re. The use a newspaper m akes of th e sha re of public attention it gai ns, se rves to determ ine its sense of responsibility whi ch it shares wi th ever y m ember o f its staff. A jo urn a list who uses his power for any selfish or o th erwise un wo rthy purpose is faithless to a h igh tru st. 2. FREEDOM OF THE P RESS Freedo m of th e press is to be guarded as a v ita l rig ht of m a nki nd. It is th e unqu estion able rig ht to di sc uss whatever is not explicitl y forbidden by law, incl uding the wisdom of any restrictive statu te. 3.

Pro motion of any p ri vate interest, co ntrary to the ge nera l we lfa re, for whateve r reaso n, is not co mpatib le with honest journalism. So-called news co mmuni ca ti ons from private sources should not be published wi th o ut public notice of their sou rce or e lse substa ntiation of their claims to va lue as news, bo th in fo rm and substance.

FRIDAY, JULY 19, 1963 r \u00b7here Are Right and Wrong Reasons For Opposing the Civil Rights Bill Sen. Richard B . Russell's origin al op p osition to t he P resident's civil r ights bill belabor ed t he pr oposed cure--legisla tion - but ignored the ill-\u20acxistence of Neg ro grievances. In a televi ion i nterview h e h as now , stated t hat h e is \"well aware that we're , livin g in a social revolution.\" It seems to us this a step forward by h im toward the higher ground of recogn izing th at a p ro blem exi ts. The other half of the question still remains, h owever : What t o do about t he problem? Th e opponents of the President's bill ' in Congress w ill not have a stron g arg u' ment if-though t hey recognize exi stence of the national problem he i trying t o cope with-they avoid an y resp onsibility of th eir own for helpin g olve it. Much of t he Sou thern congressional opposition to t he bill is ba sed on ju t such an aveidance of responsibility, emptying the arguments to a large extent. The implication is th at even though a problem is conceded to exist, the Southerner in Congress is willing to block the P r esident's effort to do omething abo ut it while in turn offerin g the alternative of doing nothing about it. It i:eems to us this p os ition is 180 degr ees opposed and 100 per cent weake r than the position taken by the Boar d of the Atlanta Ch a mber of Commerce in i1s own r esolu tion opposing p assage of ~e P resident's bill. * * The Chamber opposition is b ased neith er on den ying that a problem exi ts n or upon the altern ative of doin g nothing a bout solvin g it. On . t he contrary, the Ch amber couples its opposition to the legi lation with a specific and fort hright alternative solu tary p rogress in stead of com pelled progre s. Li ke Sen . Russell, the Chamber ~ oard fo und tl-1.e pu blic accommodations portion of the bill to be \" particularly objectionable\" b ecause it would b ring intru sion of futther federal reg ulation int o private property. But unli ke Sen. Rus ell, t he Chamber Boar d reiterated an alternative t o the legisla tion; it appealed \" t o all businesses soliciting bu sine s from the general public to do so without regard to race, color or creed ,\" solving volu ntarily a p roblem w hose sol ution it does not want t o see federally com pelled. A tlanta itself is an example of a city t hat does not need the P re ident's pro posed law because it is recognizing the p roblem and solving it voluntaril y. T his, it seems t o u s, is the right reason for opposing the p ublic accommodations bill. If the Southern opposit ion to the bill in Congress would move up to this position which has already been taken at home, then i t seems to us the arguments would be geeatly strengthened, the solution of racial problems would be considerably advanced , and the dignit \u00b7 and r eputation of the South would be better served. h l1 M __,_ tt__y____._c~ Sen. l-lart Shifts tlie Ground, Puts ~ ife Into R ights Heari\u00b7n g WASHINGTON- The Negro spiritual goes : \" Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven, Ain't going ther~Heaven.\" WeH, they were talking about Heaven at, of aN places, the civil rights bearing before the Senate Commerce Committee.

In a ddition, the Depa rtments of State, Commerce, and Defense concur that such a study would be very useful. T h e Committee for the Study of t he Metric System of the American Geop hysical Union h as done notable work in this field. The committee h as polled \u00b7 a n umber of professions with r egard t o a dopting the m et ric syst em , a nd h as tur ned up some rather startling figures. The average of some 19 different groups contacted , who consider such a chan ge a dvantageous to them, was a very high 94 percent. Those who felt our export tra de was suffering because, we h a ve n ot adopted the metric system, was 69 per~ cent; and those who felt such a changeover is inevitable, 70 per cent. At this point Mr. President, I should like to h ave reprinted in the RECORD two documents; one the progress report of the committee and the second, an address by the comm ittee's chairman, Mr. Floyd W.

Call to Political Duty EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. FRED SCHWENGEL O F IOWA I N THE HOUSE OF R EPRESENTATIVES Thur sday, Au gust 15, 1963 Mr. SCHWENGEL. Mr. Speaker, in his keynote speech t.o the workshop meeting of the Republican Citizens Committee not long ago Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower called strongly upon \"political amateurs\" to participate in politics. This call is well worth remembering and pondering for the vast majority of cit izens who find it so much easier t.o sit back and do nothing and then complain because they are not governed as they would like t.o be. History plainly indicates that democracies remain strong only so long as their citizens remain actively interested in their governments. Therefore, I call the attention of every citizen t o former President Eisenhower 's r emarks in the article from the Saturday Evening Post of August 10, 1963, which follows below : / A C ALL T O POLITICAL DUTY After a n illustrious career in pu b lic service, no one would criticize Gen. Dwigh t D. Eisenhower if h e decided to take it easy in h is r etirem ent. But t h e former President seems to b e going stron ger than ever. Recen t ly he has shown a zest for close political com b a t unlike a nything that he sh owed during h is \"active\" career. Not Jong a go a grou p of distinguished Republicans from all sections of t he country gathered a t Hershey, P a., :for a worksh op meeting of the Repu blican Citizens Commit tee.

As a matter of \"heart,\" which would do more for the m ost people, t h e Federal Government or private enterprise ?- Mr. DORN'._ Mr. Speaker , th e textile industry is the leading industry in the Carolinas IJJld Georgia. This great industry, the very backbone of our econ omy, must never become dependen t upon the Federal Government for its power. Another Federal Government dam a t Trotter Shoals on the Savannah River would give the Federal Government a complete monopoly over that great river. If the Federal Governmen t controls power and water, it will control people and t heir employment. The following editorial. is from t he August 3, 1963 issue of South ern Textile News : PRIVATE VERSUS SOCIALIZED POWER With the textile Industry's vital interest in taxes and electrical power, clooe watch should be k ept on proposals for Uncle Sam t o construct the Trotter Shoals Dam on t he Savannah River in South Carolina r ather than for private enterprise. This is not of Interest just to South Carolin la.ns, but has far-sweeping interests to all taxpayers. The pseudoUberals, whatever par ty label they wear, like to call themselves \"The party with a heart,\" or \"The party of the people.\" This infers that conservatives a re heartless and unconcerned with people. But close exam1na~ton of the d octrine and programs of the\u00b7 liberals often discloses that, either their heart is blind or they are more interested in power than people. This is illustrated In the Trotter Shoals project. As a matter of heart, the liberals argue that all of the natural resources of the Nation \"belong to all the people.\" This is the argument they use to ju&tlfy Federal construction of hydroelectric dams, notwithstanding the fact that Federal electricity Is sold at cutrate prices to only a f avored few of the people. Speclfically, this is the argument behind Interior Secretary Udall's demand that Uncle Sam, rather than private enterprise, construct the $78.7 million Trotter Shoals Dam, a project which would remove 22,000 acres of land from State and locnl tax rolls. Would Federal construction of this dam help \"all the people?\" Here 1s what Is ln store for this area. (and other areas in time) if the Government does not build the dam: 1.

Mr. Speaker, why does Presiden t Kennedy refuse to trust the American people ? Why does be enter into secret negotiations with Khrushchev? What has he promised Khrushchev? Who is calling the shots, our President or th e Soviet dictator ? It is time the American people know Just wha t President Kennedy has in mind for t hem and wh at kind of country b e intends to'leave for our children. The r eports of secret agreements reached with Khrushchev should fill us with fearful foreboding. It seems to me Congr ess should dem and a full explan ation to the questions r aised in the following article from the Washington World of August 19, written by Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott. Even Averell Har riman , famous for his negotiations with the R ussians, says our goals and theirs ate absolutely irreconcilable.

Yet we sit here in the Senate, on bill after bill, and vote millions of dollars of Federal taxpayers to continue an illegality. It is about time that we put Members of the Senate on the spot, and the senior Senator from Oregon intends to ..do it. He intends to go from coast to coast to call the roll of Members of the Senate who continue to vote to expend illegally Federa! taxpayers' money and who continue an unconstitutional act on the part of the Congress. Members will not be asked to vote on this issue program by program, but on the whole broad issue of funds going into segregated programs and a ctivities. This issue is becoming one on which we can no longer do any dillydallying. The issue is whether or not the Congress will keep faith with its right hand when its Members take the oath in this body to uphold the law. We cannot justify the appropriation of moneys for the continuation of Federal projects in which there is segregation. Let the people speak in respect to\u00b7 the rollcall that will be made in the Morse bill and similar proposals that seek to bring to an end the illegality that now exists in this country and that has characte1ized the treatment of civil rights in Federal programs. As the Senator from New York has heard me say before, the time has come for the white people of Ame1ica to deliver the Constitution of the United States to the colored people of America ; and I do not intend any longer to sit h ere and permit politicians to get by with what they have been getting by for years in the Senate and covering it with the alibi, when they get back home, \"It is the best we could do.\" I will tell Senators what the best we can do is. It is to act in accordance with the law; and the Supreme Court has made perfectl_y clear that segregation is unconstitutional. I \u00b7 intend to do what I can to take that record across this Republic in the months ahead, before the election of 1964. I do not care whether a Senator is a Republican or a Democrat--he ought to be beaten for reelection in 1964-others will be up for reelection in 1966 and others in 1968-if he does not uphold the law as laid down by the Supreme Court. Mr, JAVITS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have done precisely t h at, as recen,tly as last Wednesday in connection with the Labor-HEW appropriations bill. The reason I made the comment about bipartisanship is that I had the feeling that Members of Congress, when they vote, have an idea that party loyalty requires them to stand by the administration-it might have happened just as well on our side of the aisle if .our party were in the majority-and that they have to stand by and vote to table this kind of amendment. I think the Senator from Oregon has, with his eloquence and warmth, highlighted what I have tried to do, but which I am delighted to join him in highlighting-the fact that, of all the things done in the racial field, with all the fuel added to the fire, this is the worst. It is incon- l 1963 CON GRESSIONAL RECORD- SENATE l nr workers or duplicate or repla-0e an existin g service in the same locality. The Service Corps will be a means wh ereby the local community can draw on th e knowledge and skills of the entire Nation . But the progr agm is designed so that these trained volunteers will work with a community, in a program developed by th e community it self . A great deal of careful st udy h as gone int o this pr ogram . More than 50 ideas for projects were submitt ed to th e Presiden t 's St udy Gr oup on a National Ser vice Corps by various State and local, p ublic and private . organ izations throughout th e Nation. Twelve of these suggested project s are outlined i.n detail in the h earing recor d. A glance at these projects will show the very practical work t hat corpsmen would be doing. On an Indian reservation, they could act as instructors for self-help housing programs, run nursery schools and clinics; in a h ospit al for the mentally retarded they would h elp regular personnel as teachers aids and recreational aids ; working with migrants, they would give basic education to adults and vocational guidance to the youngsters. I t is important to remember that these projects are n ot the brain children of a bureaucratic planner. They were worked out by men and women of wide experience wh o know the help that trained volunteers can be to them in -t ackling the problems of a community. Mr. President, th ere are many Americans, young and old, wh o are anxious and a ble to h elp our less fortunate citizens. The Corps will draw n ot only upon enthusiasm of our young people, but upon the wisdom and experience of ret ired persons. There ar e a vast number of people both young and old r eady to h elp if given a way. Obviously, 5,000 men and women can n ot solve all the age-old problems of h uman suffering. But their example will h ave an effect far beyon d their number. If every corpsman inspires 10 oth ers to work in th eir own hometowns , or to join the helping professions, the cost of this progr am will have r epaid itself 10 times over . I know that the dedicated work of th e Service Corps volunteers will show that our material success b as not blinded us to the sufferings of oth ers. T his program will be a true expression of the ideals which h ave m ade this Nation great. The proposed legislation has been con sidered as carefully as any measure with which I have been associated. I am sure that Senators are familiar with its genesis and the steps that have been taken in developing the program to the point where it ls now under general debate in the Senate. In first addressing himself to this noble project, the President called upon members of his Cabinet to develop policy for it. The Cabinet members so selected chose from their departments persons of great talent to undertake the staff work that is necessary to insure that the noble idea would not be emotionalized, but would become hard, tough. and practical in its development. That study group, while small in number, w~ uniquely dedicated to this cause. Once created, the st udy group has developed ideas which were embodied in the legislation t hat came t o the Senate. The m easure was r eferred to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, and assigned to the Subcommittee on Migratory Labor for fwt h er legislative action. Mr. J AVITS. Mr. Pr esiden t, will th e Sen ator yield? Mr. WILLIAMS of New J ersey. \u00b7 I yield. Mr. J AVITS. I am a cosponsor of this par ticular m easure. I believe it r epresen ts an effort to translate th e idealism which has been so pr ominent in the Peace Corps and which h as worked so well abroad to the domestic service of t h e United States. I am satisfied, too, th at the scheme which is proposed t o the Congress parallels, as far as is practical, t he successful patt ern evolved in respect of the Peace Corps, which I believe is one of the more successful initia tives of the United States in the employment, in its foreign aid and foreign development efforts, of the idealism, skill, and interest of young Americans. There is an ample n umber of pr ojects which can profit gr eatly from th e dedication which the National Service Corps will inspire. I feel, too, that it will be a very important channel through which volunteer services of young and old alike may go into areas--many of which have been described-of want, need, illness, and underprivilege, which are enclaves .of backwa.rdness in terms of econ omic advance, such as the areas of migratory farm workers. There the volunteers can be of great benefit. I am very much for the bill. I am a cosponsor, as I said. I have only two r eservations, Mr. President. I hink perh aps, \u00b7 if we n eeded a description of wh at is being done, the words \"practical idealism\" would describe it. I hope very m uch that the practical idealism which is r epresen t ed in the National Service Corps will not be marred by asking the dedicated people wh o will be involved to serve in establishm ents or institutions which follow a. practice of racial segr egation. This is som ething about which I ex pressed my deep concern In the committee. It is something which is the subject of an amendment I h ave h ad printed, which is on th e desk. I realize that t he argument can be made that those who are afflicted should receive help, and that this should be the case even if they are afflicted in a segregated institution. But I think t h e temper of the times is such that we are engaged in a struggle in which t h ere must be some casualties, and those who are the subjects of segregation are the readiest to accept the \"casualty\" of being unable to obtain the ministrations of the National Service Corps when there is a pattern of racial segreg-ation. I hope very much that some way may be found of working out what it seems to me would be so opposite to the patriotic dedication which 1s represented by the Corps. The other subject to which I hope my colleagues in the Senate will give a little 14025 thought is the possibility that we ar e dealing domestically- not abroad, as we did with the Peace Corps- with an an alogy t o the National Guard and th e R OTC. We could allow States to under~ take some of the responsibility for training corpsmen and using them within the respective States. I h ave prepared an amendment upon that score. \u00b7\u00b7 I h ope t o hear the discussion in respect to the bill, to determine wh eth er there is a sufficient amount of interest in the Senate, since th e amendment was turned down in the committee, to justify my offering the amendment. I think the plan is a very sound one, t o allow States to participate in t he process of selection and training, and to allow them to r et ain the trainees within the S tates, a t the same time m aintaining the. cachet of this elite corp, the Nation al Service Corps, exactly as we do with r espect t o National Guard officers and .men as they relate to the military forces of the Nation. The advantage would be that we would stimulf\\te a great increase in the number of people who could be trained, the speed of th eir training, and the speed of their u tilization, and we could invoke State as well as national pride in respect t o the trainees. So, with those two reservations, Mr. . P residen t, which I h ave describedwhich are n ot. in my opinion, reservat ions in any way to chan ge the quality and character of th e plan-having proved the validity of the idea in terms of inspiration to youth and in terms of its usefulness to th ose it serves through the P eace Corps, I believe we have arrived at the point where the National Service Corps is the next logical step in terms of undertaking to give our youth an oppor tunity to show their dedication and their idealism . I am grateful to my colleague for yielding. I am confident t hat by the time the vote occurs on the bill we shall have completely closed r anks in full support of it. Mr. WILLIAMS of New Jersey. Mr. President, I am gr at eful. indeed, for those commen ts by the senior Senator from New York. I am grateful also for his s tr ong support of the proposed legislation, his sponsorship of it, and the contributions h e made in the committee deliberations.

Not only did the subcommittee hold formal hearings in the Capitol, but also members of the subcommittee, togeth er with members of a committee from the House of Representatives, went on a field trip, to see for themselves how the program could be useful in certain areas. I am sure that Members of Congress who went on the trip will never forget the experiences we had at Osawatomie State Mental Hospital in the State of Kansas and how, beyond question, it was proved to us that even one volunteer can have a dramati- I 1963 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - AP~ENDIX The letter follows: The Job of Ending Job Discriminatio ECONOIIIIC Am ANAI,YZED: U .S.

You showed \" economic a id\" as a debit in the U.S. b ala nce of p ayments for 1962 a mounting to $3.5 billion- In a year in which the total deficit was $2.3 billion. An unwary r eader could easily h ave dra wn t he Inference t h at all we need to d o to remove the defic it would be to cut \" economic aid\" by $2.3 blllion. Such a n act ion would or course be ineffect ive. \"Economic aid\" as shown in your fig ures Includes \u00b7t he outflow of surplus agricult ural commodities under Publ!c La w 480 ( about $1.3 billion in 1962), plus the outflow of goods and services-and dollars-financed by loans a nd grants und er our f oreign aid.

Under present p ol!cles, with economic and mlllta.ry assistance to other countries almost entirely taking the form of U.S. goods and ser vices, a lmost no gain to the balance-of-p ayments deficit can be achieved by reducing our foreign aid programs. Moreover, a foreign aid cut made on the mistaken assumption it would have a major impact on our payments deficit would instead serve chiefly to reduce U.S.-produced goods and services purchased for use abroad. I should also like to point out the positive gains to the United States from the establishment of progressive, growing economies abroad-which Is the main purposes of our economic assistance. U.S. exports to the Marshall Plan countries more than doubled from 1953 to 1962. Our exports to Japan more than tripled from 1950 to 1962.

WILLIAM FITTS RYAN OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF R EPRESENTATIVES T hursday, August 15, 1963 Mr. RYAN of New York. Mr. Speaker, the elimina tion of discrimina tion in employment is crucial to the civil rights battle. Until .t here is equality of job opportunity for all our citizens, full equality cannot be r ealized. A m a jor barrier has been discrimination in the apprenticeship progr a ms for skilled jobs. The worker of the future m ust be a skilled worker, and the Negro has been hurt in his search for a job because he is often, too often, unskilled. John F . H enning, Under Secretary of Labor and Manpower Administrator f or the Depa rtment of Labor has written a searching statemen t of the problems facing Government apprenticeship programs which appeared in the July 1963 issue of the American Federa tionist, the official m onthly of the AFL-CIO.

To some the road seems a narrow, twisted trail, bordered by b igotry and prlvllege. Whatever Its hazards, more than 150,000 young Americans today are found In registered apprenticeship programs.

Within the p ast year, the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training assigned four minority consultants to the task of opening opportunities to Negroes and other minority peoples. Now located in Washington, New Yor k, Chicago, and San Francisco, they counsel with employers, joint apprenticeship committees and unions on a regional basis to encourage acceptance of qualified minority appl!cants. Additionally, they advise minority groups on apprenticeship fundamentals and admission processes. II. Secretary of Labor W.

DERWINSKI 0 11' ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES T hursday, August 15, 1963 . Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. S peaker, one of the proofs of retreat of the appease- ment-minded dreamers of the New Frontier is their h andling of the Soviet imposed Eastern European Red governments. The St. Louis Globe-Democrat, in an editorial on Monday, August 12, very concisely discusses our rela tions with Hungary, and under unanimous consent , I insert it into the R ECORD at this point : DIPL OMATIC R ELATIONS WITH A QUISLING As was widely predicted, t h e Un ited S tates is seeking to resume fu ll d1plomat!c relat ions with the H ungarian r egime. R eaders will recall that d1plomatlc ties were curtailed during the 1956 revolution against Soviet control. \u00b7 T he loss of that revolution yoked the H un garians with a quisling regime run by the traitor, Janos Kadar, the lia ison man with the Soviet tank commnnders who decimated his people. Doubtless, the new American move w!ll be hailed by those who seek to avoid irritants in our r elations with the Soviets. But what in the name of diplomacy do we have to gain by sending an American minister to APPENDIX excha n ge views with the special toad y of Mr . Khrushchev In Buda pest ? .

The Legacy of Project Mercury EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. CHARLES H. WILSON OF CAL IFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, August 15, 1963 CHARLES H. WILSON. Mr. Speaker, one of the companies actively engaged in the conquest of space is the Garrett Corp. of Los Angeles. This company employs more than 10,000 skilled personnel and produced the important environmental control system (ECS ) for Pr oject Mercury. In the Spring issue of New F r ontiers, a Garrett publication, an article dealing with the aspects of both the Project Mercury program and the Proj ect Gemini progra m bas cau ght my interest. I know many Members of the House are constantly sear ching for more information on the r ace to the Moon, and I t h erefore bring this article to the attent ion of~ colleagues. The article is as follows : Mr. TBE LEGACY OF P ROJECT M ERCU RY (By J ohn W. Bold) He was the last to ~o. Sh epard, Grissom , Glenn , Carp enter, an d Schlrra already had experienced the tense countdown, t h e surge of r ocketing into space, the exhUira tl,Qn of weightlessness and the security of recovery.

But !n the last few hours the NASA-McDonnell t eam used \"all the p ages in the b ook.\" In the last fe w mi n u tes, an electrical problem forced the youngest astonau t to carefully position his s pacecraft, fi re the retro rockets and guide his Fai t h 7 spacecraft down t hrough t he a tmosphere-all by hand.

What new t h eories h ave evolved from this Nation's first mann ed space program? What new engineering con cepts wil help us In future spacecr aft d evelopment work? In particular, what have we learned A5241 f r om P roject Mercury that w ill aid us in Pr oject Gemini? An in sight int o the answers to these q u estions can be gained a t Garrett-A!Research , which produ ced the vital environmental control system (ECS ) for Project Mer cury, u nder contra ct to McD.onnell Aircraft Co. It ls now d eveloping a slm!lar system for Project Gexnin!, again un der a McDonnell contract. Both programs are under the tecb n!cal d ir ect ion of NASA's Ma n n ed Sp acecraft Center. Na turally, the experience of both com pa n ies gained in P roject Mercury tran scends into the Gem!ni pr ogra m. \"Exper ience ls the b est sch oolmast er, a nd it h as t a u gh t u s a grea t d eal ,\" r eflects R .

By reducing the complexity of the system we wlll increase rella b!lity. Since t h e Gemini astrona uts will h a ve ' time on t h eir ha.ncis' to think and act durl.n g their 2 week mission, less a u tom ation ls re quired .\" (F ollowing Gordon Coop er 's flight, Walter C. W!lJiams, associa te d1rector for NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center, told the p ress that if a m a n were not a board the Faith 7 h e dou b ted 1! It could have reentered and been recovered .) I n P roject Gemini, man's requirements wlll be b asically the same. T hus the f u nct ion of the ECS remains u nchanged- to provide two astrona u ts a safe and comfortable atmosphere f or 2 weeks ln space. The system wlll provide f r esh oxygen, cabin and suit pressurization, thermal control, water m a n agem ent and toxlc gas removal. To accompUsh these functions, the Gemini ECS can be grouped Into the following functions: the loop, or circuit, for suit cooling and p ressurization; the cabin loop for cooling and pressurization; the fr esh oxygen supplypr imary secondary, and emergency egress; t h e water management loop; the coolant loop. The egress oxygen supply ls part of the launch a bort system, slmllar to aircraft t ype ejection seat s . It will be u sed !n Gem ini in lleu of the escap e tower system wh ich wns u sed in Proj ect Mercury. The learning curve which \"lifted off th e p ad \" With Mercury h as d ictated som e changes in the Gemini system as compared t o Mercury. Nelson llst.s seven areas In which Mercury experience h as resulted !n Impr ovements : 1. Coolan t subsystems and t h ermal regulation. 2. P ressure r egulation. 3. Moisture rem oval. 4. Su it compressors. 5. System geometry and installation. 6. Testin g. 7. R ells bUity. In addi tion , t h e longer mission profile haa r esulted in new concepts in the following areas : 1. Oxygen su pplies. 2. Heat transfer equipment. 3. P ower su pplles. 4. System servicing. 5. Water management. A5242 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - For oxygen st orage: a different source replaces the high pressure system (7,500 pounds per square inch) used in Mercury. The new source, a supercritical system, will serve as the primary source of oxygen. A high pressure source (5,000 pounds per square inch) wm be secondary. Supercritical storage defies definition In layman's terms. However, it 1s oxygen compactely stor ed in a sta te between a gas and a l!qUld. In orbit the supercritical storage provides enough oxygen with ample r eserve for two men, for 14 days, in the Gemini spacecraft-occupying a minimum of space and weight. During reentry, the high pressure source, which also serves a backup for tt:re supercritical system, will supply the necessary oxygen, pressurization and cool!ng. In Project Mercury, cooling was totally dependent on a cabin and suit heat exchanger boiling water as the coolant. These wa ter boilers were ideal for the weight and short mission of Mercury. In fact, In some instances, water will continue to be used for cooling In Gemini. However, the cooling burden In Project Gemini will f all on sbi: heat exchangers using a recycling oil-type coolant Instead of water. Heat absorbed by the coolant will be radiated Into space instead or boiled off as steam as in Mercury. The constant manual control of the hea t exchangers will also be eliminated. This operatlOJ\\, slm1lar to adjusting a home a ir conditioning system, will be replaced by an automatic system with manual . override. This wm eliminate excessive temperatures Incurred before the bolling process stabilized temperatures in the spacecraft-usually before the end of the first orbit. Expulsion of the coolant in Mercury was accomplished in a pressurized tank with a bladder forcing the water out. The Gemini system wm comprise a closed loop unit including four parallel pumps--two In a loop-for more effective coola nt circulation. During each launch the Mercury l!thium hydroxide canister required special attention. Engineers kept an accurate count on the time each cannister was u sed and tested. This way, launch personnel were assured sufficient lithium hydroxide was available !or carbon dioxide removal tor the entire length of the mission. In Gemini, lithium hydroxide will be used again; however, the amount Installed In the re-entry module w111 be more than adequate. _ The water separator, which was a pneumatically operated sponge type, will be replaced by a static type separator with no moving parts. This development is an outgrowth or Garrett's extensive aircra ft air conditioning and pressurization experience. It ellmlnates the possibility or high moisture content (humidity) In the sp acecraft, and with no moving parts, Is more reliable. Sult and cabin compressors will have greater capacity (23 and 88 cubic feet per minute respectively) but wlll require little additional power. Conservation of electrical power has been a design objective throughout the Gemini program. But It Is not a n easy goa l. In Mercury, A!Research d elivered 49 different ECS components to McDonnell where they were assembled. The Gemini system contains 114. However, as Dick Nelson puts it, \" we are marrying many of the components here at A1Resear ch ,\" so that 84 components will be Integrated Into 11 modules. This m arriage, Instigated by McDon n ell, Insures optimized design and better -performance. The other 30 components will be d elivered ind ividually. T he marriage of componen ts into comp atible modules enables t he subsystem to b e quickly divorced from the sp acecraft. Thus, d u rin g t he countdown If a malfunction occurs In a module It can be quickly r emoved and r eplaced. I n fact t h e en t ire Gemini suit m odule ECS can be replaced in 40 minutes. By comparison, In Mercury it required 24 August 15 APPENDIX hours to r emove the carbon dioxide absorption ca nister alone. What is the status of the Gemini environmental control system ? In May, the first m ajor segment -of t h e Gemini environmental control system was shipped to McDonnell, St. Louis for testing. Dick Nelson took personal charge of the shipment. After telephoning several d epartment heads to insure proper p ackaging and shipment, Nelson swung his 6-foot, 6-inch, 220-pound frame around and said, \"I feel I'm send ing my first child 011 a trip.\" Without a doubt, every AiResearcher who h ad nursed the production of teh equipment a long felt t he same way. Today, comprehensive m anned tests are being conducted to prove the operational compatibility of the environmental control system to the man. These tests are being conducted in A!Research, Los Angeles and soon reliablllty and qualificat ion tests will begin in AiResearch's new lab in Torra nce. This new multimillion-dollar facility is replete with clean rooms a nd liigh altitude chambers (capable of simulating 240,000 feet a lt itude). New data acquisition equipment electronically records more than 300 measurements on each test. This equipment enables deta il-conscious engineers to a n a lyze t est d ata In hours when previously it required days, often weeks. The meticulous task of designing, fabricating and testing the Gemini environmental control system Is a carryover from Project Mercury. Much or the technology gained in Project Mercury ECS Is directly applicable to Gemini. As an example, Nelson cites the Gemini testing program: \"We are not trying to devise new testing procedures,\" be said. \"E,cperlence enables u s to retain the va.Jld concepts u sed In Mercury and add improvem en ts.\" \"The experience we gained In Mercury has gl ven us confidence In our Gemini work and in systems for the future,\" says Nelson. And what of the fu t ure ? Our national goal is to la nd a man on the moon. Just as experience galned ..from Project Mercury ls applied to Gemini, so will Project Gemini d ata be applicable to Project Apollo. The Apollo Spacecraft, with an AiResearch environmental control system aboard, will carry three men to the moon. Cost of the Nation's space program rests heavy on the Federa l budget. Today, cost conscious engineers are optimizing the1r design and using their creative ingenuity to minimize development \u00b7costs. Certainly, the carryover experience \"from Mercury to Gemini will result In vast savings. Wills.rd E. Wilks, In his new book \"The New Wilderness-Wha t We Know About Space\" notes that It will require an average of $7 b1lllon a year to accomplish our national space goal. \"It Is less than the $7.6 billion Americans spend ~nnually on cigars and cigarettes,\" be wrote. At first glance the cost of the Nation's space program seems as h1gh as the apogee of Gemini Itself. However, erudite plann1ng on the p art or the Nat ion al Aerona utics and Space Administra tion has kept costs n ominal. Already, nine n ew astronau ts are selected and are ga ining from experiences of the origina l s even. (At a recent Cape Canaveral pre.se conference, astronaut \"Deke\" Slayton, who is coordinator of Astronaut Activity, quipped to newsmen tha t they preferred to be called the \"original\" r ather than \"old\" astronau ts. ) Of astronauts Schlrra was assign ed the environm en tal oontrol system as his special assignment. In the n ew grou p, J ohn Young, a Navy pilot, will con centrate on the ECS. But it t.ook one of the \" original\" sages to place the manned space program in proper perspective. Astrona ut J ohn Glenn said , \"But the greatest of all benefits from manned space flight will un dou btedly come from some now-unforeseen discoveries occasioned by man's ability to assess the n ew things he encounters In the unknown.\" For the present little Is unforeseen or un known. The Nation's space program stands strong, bolstered by legs of ~xperience. Civil Rights by Bishop Andrew Grutka EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. RAY J. MADDEN I OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, August 15, 1963 Mr. MADDEN. Mr. Speaker, the following are excerpts from a pastoral letter by Bishop Andrew G. Grutka of the Gary, Ind., Catholic diocese. \u00b7 Bishop Grutka's diocese \u00b7contains the great Calwnet industrial region of Indiana. It is made up of many nationalities, races, and religions. This great cosmopolitan region for over a quarter of a century has been actively making a sincere effort to practice civil rights. Our area is probably more free from racial agitation than any area in the Nation. ~ Religious leaders like Bishop Grutka, business leaders, public officials, and all segments of business have been making a sincere effort to practice civil rights. The following is a news item on Bishop Grutka's message and also an editorial from the Gary (Ind.> Post Tribune commenting on the message : GRUTKA ASSAILS RACE PREJUDICE IN PASTORAL LETI'ER A pastoral letter Issued today by Bishop Andrew G. Grutka of the Gary Catholic diocese brands racial prejudice and Injustice as heinous crimes against God and man. Divided Into three p arts, the letter follows t he theme of rac!al Justice and charity. It explains Christian teaching, areas of cone.e m, and the roles of the church and the Individual in elimina ting racial d iscriminat ion, preJudlc~. and segregation. The bish op wrote that the letter wasn 't fulfillment of an official duty. \"It is rather the expression o! a d eep and painfully felt concern for many sorely tried and shrunefully treated members of our community, Negroes In particular.\" He cited the fact that Negroes a re pooling resources and energies and enduring hardships to get free exercise of human rights and dignities. He urged \"right-thinking persons and practicing Christians\" to len d Negroes a h and In this effort. Admitting the message offers no simple or easy solution for the elimination of prejudice, discrimination, or segregation , the bishop said It hopes f or a change in attitude and that Christians will follow the m ean\"ing of John 18 :34: \"A new commandmen t I give you that you love one another.\" Grutka explains the unity of t he h u man r ace by r eferences to the teachillgs of the story of creation In the Bible, to statements by Pope Plus XXII, Pope John XIII Md to action of t he bishops of the United States in 1958. The equalit y of all m en , the human dignit y of all m en and the honor of all men are cited In h is explanation. He explains how foreign Immigrants, once r ejected, have been asslm1lated In to our society and are not easily recognized as distinct ethnic grou ps.

The civil rights proposals sent to Congress by the President cont.a.in a section that should be repugnant to all Americans, regardless of race.

Othe rs Have Rignts, loo w 5 - ? - r We ~ sympathetic with the desire of the Negro race In America to obtain the full civil , educational and economic rights to which they are entitled under the U.S. Constitution , alt hough the bellicose attitude s hown recently by some Negro leaders makes us doubt their wisdom and self-control. But we ;ire emphatically opposed to that part of Presiaent Kennedy's\" civil rights\" program in Congress that would force a man in private business to serve customers against his will. This attitude is based on legal and moral princ iples whic h woul d hol d true eve n if th e ques tion of race were not involved. In the various discussions of this issue which \u00b7we have read recently we havefoundnowherea point which seems vital to us -- the difference between a public utility and a purely private business. Yet It is one that is clearly recognized in law. When a city , a county or a state enfranchises a public utility such as telephones, electricity, gas or transportation it is usually granted a monopoly. In return, it agrees to serve any person who can pay for its services. T he r eas on for this is obvious : if it did not do s o the ci tizen could not obtain the service anywhere else . He would be fo r ced to do without a necessity of life. In like manner it can be a rgued with some plausibility that any citizen, particularly any tax- payer, is entitled_ to any services offered by the Feder state, county or city governments . But a private ~ such as a restaurant, hotel, tllea or arber shop falls in ~either category. It is not a public utility wit h a monopoly franchise, nor is it a public ins titution. Private businesses of the type na med are many -Z-\u00b7 in number and operate in keen competition with each other. In Atlanta and JDQI! ities hundreds of them are operat~ groes for Negroes. It is only logical and r ight that 0thers are operated by white persons for an exelusively white patronage. (As a matter of fact, many s uch bus ine ss es wi li not adm it white pat ro11 s whom th c\u00b7y cons ide r un desi r ab le). lf the owner of such an establishment agrees voluntarily to accept Negro business -- as many in ,\\ t I a II r a r ece mly h a v c: ,; one ~- he has a pe rfec t r i\u00b7,hr to do s o.

But those who do not care for Negro business are not depriving a citizen of some needed service. There. are many other places where he can obtain it. The air is filled these days with cries of \"minority rights\". But what about ' majority rights\", including the right of any citizen to establi sh a legal bus iness Jnd corid ucr it as he sees fit, so long as he operates it honestly and within the law?

' I' Clo (! 7/r2J About Mrs. Murphy's Boar<ling House Atty. Gen. Robert Kennedy fa ces two prob\u00b7 ]ems in promoting a Jaw against racial discrimination in public accommodations. One is to define the businesess ter which the Jaw would apply. The other is to get the bill passed in any form. The attorney general has made it clear that he does not want the law to apply to small places such as \"Mrs. Mur phy's boarding house.\" Yet he objects to a dollar cut-off for affected businesses because it would not be right, and m ight not be constitutional, to tell large businesses they could not discriminate while small businesses could. Per haps he best solution is to leave Mrs. Murphy and the small business distinction out of it, and hinge- the application of the law on businesses \"substantially\" engaged in interstate commerce. That is what the administration originally proposed, and if the formula seems vague, at least it is one with which the courts have been able to deal in federa l regulations applying f, om everything from labor c ses to oleomargarine. In view of some of the Republican as well as Southern criticism of the proposal , this is the most controversial part of the admin istralion program. To Negroes it is one of the most important ; Roy Wilkins, executive secretary of the National Association for the Adva ncement of Colored P eople, says, \" The public accommodations problem is the one that irritates Negroes from morning to night.\" Yet the Chicago convention of the NAACP , though commending tJhe Kennedy program , calls it \" inadequate\" and seeks, in addition, a national fair employment law and power for the attorney general to sue in behalf of all ci vil \u00b7eQtQ ~I \u00b7the rights.
