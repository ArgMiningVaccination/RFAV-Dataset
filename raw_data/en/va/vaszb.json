I used a similar blend from a MLM before, and since discovering Protect, I won't buy anything else now! I have it diffusing currently while my hubs and I are both feeling under the weather. Plus the warm scent is perfect for fall. Thanks JB! Keek Verified Buyer I recommend this product Health benefits, yes, but the fragrance brings back childhood memories of Christmas time. 5 Dec 26, 2019 I received Protect in the Nov 2019 Collectors Club subscription. I'm on Christmas vacation and decided it was time to clean up bags and boxes of yarn that have been collecting for the last three years. I packed it all up in 56 qt clear plastic storage bins, then vacuumed and dusted. In the midst of doing that cleaning, I found my essential oil diffuser and thought I'd try some Protect to refresh the room. This just goes to prove to myself that I need to stop judging essential oils by the strong smell of turpenes when sniffing them right from the bottle. I added 2-3 drops in the diffuser and placed it in front of the non-lit fireplace. My diffuser has a large range of changing colors radiating through Himalayan salt crystals and it reflected nicely off the glass fireplace screen. Ambiance. While most people are touting Protect's health benefits, I'm blown away by the fragrance. If you want to add to your list of holiday fragrances, Protect needs to be on the top of the list. It is the perfect blend of everything I remember as a kid at Christmas time. The brain is an amazing thing. I may forget names and events over the years, but fragrances, never. Like a scented candle from over 50 years ago which brought back memories of Christmas music by Andy Williams, Bing Crosby, Perry Como and Dean Martin, and ice skating all day long until our feet were so frozen we could barely walk home. Please never change the formulation of Protect. It's perfect as it is. Allison Verified Buyer I recommend this product I adore Protect. 5 Nov 13, 2019 I adore Protect. As soon as I feel a cold coming on or sick season starts I start diffusing this, and when I shower I dab a drop on my shower walls to dissipate with the steam. It is incredibly soothing and uplifting. I think I prefer the lemon in the blend over the orange used in DoTerra's OnGuard. It makes it feel brighter somehow. When I use Protect in my shower ritual, it helps my sore throat and congestion in a huge way- we are talking overnight difference! I can't say enough about this blend. The other bonus is that it simply smells awesome for fall or holiday season as an aromatherapy blend. Sort by Rating Newest Helpfulness Marci Verified Buyer I recommend this product Wonderful blend to have and use as it may help with immunity. 5 Nov 17, 2021 Advantages Available in multiple sizes. Great prices. Disadvantages Not planning correctly and running out. Comment I use this all the time. I make my own hand sanitizer with it., using grain alcohol, aloe vera, Protect and Lavender. I use a drop of Protect on each the 4 \"corners\" of my facemasks. I'm a Licensed Massage Therapist and am within 6' of someone for over 15 minutes. Sometimes I rub a couple drops between my hands and apply to my shoulders before going out in public. NOTE: most people need to use a carrier oil before applying to the skin. I absolutely love this product! High quality and the price is very fair. One of the first oils I got. Such a unique blend. Reminds me of colder holidays. Perfect for those who have a compromised or want to improve upon their immunity. Pairs well with other Protect products. Very thin!! Be careful. When I received it, I started to put a few drops in my diffuser and it literally poured out of the bottle and I ended up with way too much! I've never had that happen before! I started the diffuser and within a few minutes started coughing and sensing irritation and turned the diffuser off. I'm sure it was because there was way too much for my 100ml small office diffuser. I will need to be more careful next time. This oil is amazing. It smells wonderful and I love the blend. Disadvantages It literally spills out of the bottle. A complete waste. Normally, essential oil bottles are made to dispense a drop at a time. There is no way to count drops, because it pours out of the bottle. Comment I would love to give this 5 stars, but unfortunately the bottle is not made well, and I have used half of this already and I've only had it a few days. Tipping it to dispense a drop causes way too much to dispense.
