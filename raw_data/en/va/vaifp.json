Institutional Constraints in Promoting IK: Community Access to Social Networks and Formal Institutions ............................................................................................................................... ....... 266vii n 1996, we articulated a vision for the World Bank to become a \"Knowledge Bank\" that intermediates ideas as well as financial resources. At the First Glo-bal Knowledge Conference in Toronto in 1997, po- litical leaders and civil society representatives from developing countries endorsed this vision. They calledupon the World Bank not only to provide its own know- how, gained through more than 50 years of development experience, but to equally learn from the practices ofcommunities so as to leverage the best in global and local knowledge systems. The World Bank has responded to this challenge. We recognize that knowledge is not the exclusive domain of technologically advanced societies. We need to give a new meaning to empowering poor people and helping to givethem voice\u2014not as recipients of knowledge, but as con- tributors and protagonists of their own development. In 1998, we launched the Indigenous Knowledge for Development Program to help learn from community- based knowledge systems and development practices, and to incorporate them into Bank-supported programs. Acore activity was the publication and dissemination of a series of IK Notes , where development practitioners re- port on successful local solutions for local developmentproblems. The present publication, marking half a decade of the IK program, is a collection of 60 such narratives. Thematic lead articles introduce the cases, synthesizingthe lessons learned and discussing the impact indigenous knowledge can make on our development efforts and on helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs).Foreword The cases presented here demonstrate how communi- ties and local practitioners use indigenous knowledge sys- tems and practices to help increase their crop yields,educate their children, reduce suffering from HIV/AIDS, decrease infant and maternal mortality, heal the impact of conflict, learn from each other, and empower them-selves. The cases also suggest that the communities are quite willing, indeed eager, to combine global knowledge and modern technology with their indigenous knowledgeand institutions to obtain better results. Traditional Birth Attendants in the Iganga District of Uganda, for example, use modern walkie-talkies to refer critical casesto the public health system, thus contributing to reduc- ing maternal mortality substantially, one of the MDGs. I am confident that this collection of successful grassroots community experiences will prove to be a valu- able resource in improving our understanding of how communities empower themselves to manage their owndevelopment in the larger context of globalization. Build- ing on such practices and helping scale up the more suc- cessful ones is critical to ensuring results. It will alsoenrich the development process, making it more equi- table and sustainable. James D. Wolfensohn President The World BankIix his publication is the five-year-milestone of the Indigenous Knowledge for Development Pro- gram in the Africa Region of the World Bank.The main goal of the program is to learn from the knowledge embedded in the practices of local communities. A core activity of the program is the publi-cation of the IK Notes \u2014a monthly periodical that appears in print and online in English, French and, occasionally, in Portuguese, Swahili, and Wolof. We present here 60 ofthe IK Notes, in which development practitioners de- scribe how successful indigenous practices enrich the de- velopment process. We learn, for example, how communities have applied their traditional judicial system to reduce or prevent con- flict in Ghana, how rural women in India have empow-ered themselves by developing their own capacity, how youth in Senegal have improved their skills and competi- tiveness, how cooperating with traditional healers in-creases the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS projects, and how communities in Uganda combine traditional and modern knowledge to help reduce maternal mortality. In addition, this publication includes several new the- matic articles by leaders, scholars, and development prac- titioners that synthesize the lessons from the variousthemes of the Notes and discuss the conditions that make the incorporation of indigenous knowledge into develop- ment work successful. And, as His Excellency, the Presi-dent of Tanzania concludes in his introduction to this publication, the most important condition is that deci- sion-makers and development partners must be ready tolearn from communities and to help them shape their own development agenda. The World Bank has contributed to this process by helping clients enhance their capacity to develop their in- digenous knowledge base and by creating more opportu-Preface nities for local communities to be involved in develop-ment. In Uganda, for example, the Bank has supported the development of a national strategy that incorporatesindigenous knowledge into the country's poverty reduc- tion program. In Ethiopia, the Bank is supporting the de- velopment of medicinal plants for the domestic market.The Bank also brokered cooperation for the scientific validation of traditional medicinal practices between lo- cal research organizations, NGOs, practitioners, and theglobal scientific community. The Bank has also integrated indigenous knowledge into Bank-supported programs to obtain better results.In a number of West African countries, programs to com- bat HIV/AIDS include regular consultations with the tra- ditional healers. In Burkina Faso, the Bank is helping topromote a traditional water harvesting and soil conserva- tion technology throughout the country. Bank-supported social protection projects in Malawi, Tanzania, andNorthern Uganda build on community-based institutions for local management of the projects. Over the past five years we have learned a lot about the efficacy and sustainability of indigenous practices in de- velopment. We also see a growing pattern of integration of indigenous practices in development programs for im-proved development results. With this new compilation of IK Notes and related thematic lead articles we offer the development community a collection of good practicesand ideas that can help in designing programs that em- power communities through the validation and use of in- digenous knowledge systems. Callisto E. Madavo Vice President Africa RegionTxLocal Pathways to Global Development This publication is the result of an international partnership by a network of promoters, practitioners, and protagonists of indigenous knowledge. The editors wish to record their gratitude to all the contributors.For over five years, the authors of the IK Notes have taken the time and effort to share their experiences, impressions, and lessons learned. The editors trustthat they will extend our thanks to those who are the source of the knowledge discussed here: the communi- ties, women farmers, traditional healers, birth atten-dants, village elders, herdsmen, and many others. The editors wish to express their profound gratitude to His Excellency, The President of the United Repub-lic of Tanzania, Benjamin W. Mkapa, who has been kind enough to author the introduction to this publi- cation and whose central message we have adopted inour title: local pathways to global development. The authors of the lead articles have patiently en- dured the editors' proposals for amendments in for-mat, style, and diction. We thank them for engaging us in a fruitful discussion on context and content\u2014up to the very last minute.The editors further wish to thank the team members of the Indigenous Knowledge for Development Pro- gram and other World Bank staff, who provided useful commentary and contributions.

We do not know where the three walkers inthe \"cradle of mankind\" came from, where they went and what their plans were. But it is reasonable to assume that were they capable of speech they would have shared thoughts, ideas, knowledge, while walking along the plainsome three and a half million years ago. Ever since humans walked on earth, they have sought more knowledge to feed their families, stay healthy, argue with their neighbors, getting a better understanding of their environment orjust have some distraction from an otherwise rather challenging life. For hundreds of millennia, local needs and constraints and day-to-day chal- lenges drove the quest for knowledge. Scientific approaches to knowledge gen-eration, as we know them today are, historically speaking, a very recent phenomenon. These modern approaches have brought about tremendous re- sults: we have the capacity to feed more than six billion people satisfactorily;vaccinations protect our children from once deadly diseases, we communicate with the help of satellites around the globe and we compete on global market places with our products. Yet, despite these achievements, we still have crisesof hunger, HIV/AIDS, illiteracy, isolation, and conflicts and abject poverty. While the debate on the causes of poverty is not closed, we have learned that science and technology alone cannot provide all the answers or solutions tothese unsolved problems or how we can overcome living in a disparate world characterized by unequal distribution of wealth and opportunities. As scientists struggle to respond to global challenges, they have increasingly distanced themselves from local ways of solving problems. Local solutions were even discriminated against as hindering progress, outdated, \"old wives tales\" or simply just unfashionable. As we \"modernized\" our societies, a \"de-gree\" in traditional or indigenous knowledge was not planned for. Hence, we overlooked its potential as a resource and even further neglected the knowl- edge that women and men, families and communities had developed them-selves for centuries. The sixty cases presented in this collection of IK Notes demonstrate that in- digenous knowledge (IK) is a resource that can help to solve local problems, aresource to help grow more and better food, to maintain healthy lives, to share1. Indigenous Knowledge\u2014a Local Pathway to Global Development Benjamin Mkapa Benjamin Mkapa is President of the United Republic of Tanzania.2Local Pathways to Global Development wealth, to prevent conflict, to manage local affairs, and thus contribute to global solutions. Indigenous knowl- edge has contributed to building solidarity in communi-ties affected by globalization and shielded them against some of its negative impacts. There is not one of the Mil- lennium Development Goals to whose achievement indig-enous knowledge cannot contribute. The sixty cases contained in this publication successfully underline the crucial role indigenous knowledge can play in develop-ment: IK has helped to reduce hunger and poverty in In- dia, it has improved primary education and enrollment by using local language as a means of instruction in WestAfrica, it has enabled men in Senegal to understand the impact of female circumcision on women and empowered women to move towards eradicating the practice, it hashelped to reduce child mortality in Eritrea and maternal mortality in Uganda, it provides primary healthcare to millions of Africans, it has helped communities inMozambique to manage their coastal natural resources, and it has helped to build partnerships between the weak and the strong in Ghana to share wealth. Sixty persuasive arguments and yet we find it difficult to convince so many scientists, politicians, development experts and administrators to systematically use indig-enous knowledge in the development process. The plural of anecdotes is not evidence, they say; scientific proof for most of its claims has yet to be found. However, for thecommunities where indigenous knowledge has worked, these cases are not anecdotes but reality. Had they waited for the scientific proof for the treatments they receivedfrom local healers, four thousand HIV/AIDS patients in Tanga, Tanzania without access to modern antiviral drugs would not have been alive today. But these sixty cases provide more lessons than just the benefits of the particular practices or approaches to de- velopment. The most pertinent ones relate to ownershipof development, local capacity, self-reliance, and empow- erment. Ownership has been at the center of the development discourse over the last years. The sustainability of many externally induced development projects hinges on the ownership by the beneficiaries. When building on indig-enous knowledge, ownership does not even arise as an is- sue. Indigenous knowledge is locally managed and owned. Studying, understanding and building on theknowledge of communities will substantially reduce the risk of failures of the development approach and the in- vestments by governments and bi- and multilateral do-nors. The increased sustainability does not only arisefrom particular indigenous practices that would be in- cluded in the context of a development project. The very process of learning from the community recognizes thecommunity and the bearers of indigenous knowledge as partners in development who bring as much, if not more to the process as the providers of global knowledge. Capacity building essentially assumes a vacuum on the side of the beneficiaries of capacity building efforts, ever so often camouflaged by the term capacity strengthening.Undoubtedly, African farmers, communities, administra- tors, engineers and politicians have much to learn to cope with an increasingly complex and ever changing eco-nomic and political global environment. Yet, have com- munities and farmers not coped with an ever-changing environment in the past? Political experiments, inad-equate institutions to market their crops or failing ser- vices have not prevented them from prevailing and adapting to find their own solutions to survive. The com-munities not only have knowledge about practices, they also have knowledge of how to adapt to adverse environ- ments, institutions and policies. Self-reliance, as political tradition in Tanzania since in- dependence, is one of the key characteristics of building on indigenous knowledge. Yet, many chose to interpretself-reliance as isolation, reaffirming the assumption that knowledge sharing and learning among African commu- nities is against tradition, and that the risk associatedwith that is the loss of power and control. These cases tell us differently. Communities are eager to learn and share, because their environment teaches them one lesson al-most on a daily basis: only those who learn will prevail. Self-reliance is a genuinely local approach to develop- ment\u2014no less so in an economic sense. When our latePresident Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere first promoted self-reliance after Tanzania's independence, learning was a primary means for the country's development. If theorthodox sciences were as open to learning from indig- enous knowledge, as local communities are ready to learn from others and the outside world, both sides would ben-efit substantially. Empowerment is a central icon of the development dis- course. Development planners and implementers gogreat lengths to help empower the poor, the women, the vulnerable. The cases in these IK Notes teach us that em- powerment cannot come from the outside. Lasting em-powerment is self-empowerment. The communities, farmers, women, innovators, teachers whose stories are presented here have all chosen to empower themselves.3 They were given space and opportunity either through education, through intermediaries such as NGOs, a re- search station, an extension agent or a ministry, but theyall had to go the last mile themselves. This reflects well what Mwalimu Julius Nyerere said at the inauguration ceremony of the South Commission on 20 October 1987: \"From the elders of my tribe I learned a story. Here it is in going? I am going to kill the Elephant.Can you do it? Well, I'll try, and try again.'It is in this spirit that I recommend to development ex- perts and planners, researchers and practitioners, politi- cians and bureaucrats, teachers and students to humblylearn from these cases. They are not blueprints or recipes or shortcuts to development, nor do they seek to romanti- cize indigenous knowledge or traditions or suggest thatglobal knowledge is irrelevant. Rather, they show that, indigenous and global knowledge working together in a democratic, self-determined way is the best combinationto foster sustainable development. It remains for us, the politicians and decision makers, to provide the space for this to happen. Only those who learn will prevail.42. Indigenous Capacity Enhancement: Developing Community Knowledge Frannie Leautier When asked, communities are quick to identify solutions to address local de- velopment problems. For communities to realize their development choices, enhancement of their own capacity to deliver and manage these solutions is acritical necessity. In the introduction to this publication, His Excellency, the President of Tanzania remarks that African communities and farmers have always coped with changing environments and that \"communities not onlyhave knowledge about practices, they also have knowledge of how to adapt to adverse environments, institutions, and policies.\" The IK Notes in this publi- cation offer a vivid illustration of three basic principles that underpin capacityenhancement (CE) in the context of indigenous knowledge (IK). First, capacity enhancement should not assume a vacuum of knowledge, a void of institu- tions, a lack of skills or a deficiency of willingness. Many of the cases show thatwith the right approach, development actors can identify and tap into local capabilities in the areas of knowledge, skills, and practices. Second, capacity enhancement efforts without the opportunity to apply that very capacity in alocal context are likely to be ineffective. Adults learn best when the knowledge and skills gained are of direct relevance to the problems they are seeking to solve. Third, the enhancement of indigenous capacity is a key to the empower-ment of local communities and their effective participation in the development process. People are better able to adopt new ideas when they can be seen in the context of existing practices and ways of doing. In this context, one may distinguish three levels of capacity; one represent- ing the more technical skills acquired in relation to a set of concrete develop- ment problems dealing with a specific situation (e.g., managing an orphanage,keeping dairy cattle, organizing an awareness campaign, etc.). The other level is concerned with skills and approaches that are critical to the management of an organization. These relate, for example, to managing local affairs and meet-ing the interests of local residents. The third level relates to the question of balancing interests and negotiating with central and local authorities, and is central to the empowerment of communities and the development of society.For example, the technical skills acquired when building a school in a commu- nity may be secondary to the community's experience gained in managing the project, supervising contractors, keeping the process transparent, and con-cluding it without much external assistance. Based on some of the insights from these IK Notes , this article discusses how communities can take charge of their own capacity enhancement on all three levels and what developmentpartners can do to support this process.Frannie Leautier is Vice President of the World Bank Institute.5 Communities can take charge of their own capacity enhancement The IK Notes contained in this compilation illustrate a wide range of community-based capacity enhancement initiatives. They include adapting literacy programs; in-troducing local knowledge approaches into school cur- ricula; women's initiatives to manage natural resources; healing of war-affected children; farmers' access to mar-kets, appropriate technology, and financial institutions; research design and dissemination; documenting indig- enous knowledge and protecting the intellectual propertyrights of communities. They tell the stories of outstanding individuals, or ordi- nary individuals doing extraordinary work, of dedicatedCBOs or NGOs, of curious researchers or practitioners\u2014 all engaged in achieving the same goal: improving liveli- hoods of the communities in which they live. Finally, theydocument how communities have empowered themselves by engaging authorities or development partners to be more responsive to local development perspectives. The following three boxes illustrate how different ac- tors have built on their own knowledge systems, mobi- lized external expertise and helped improve livelihoods intheir communities. In Mali, local communities use literacy and numeracy programs as a platform to enhance their capacity to man-age development activities that affect their daily lives. They apply newly acquired skills to design their own management systems for agricultural cooperatives. This case may almost appear to be a provocation to con- ventional development planning. Had the problem beenidentified as \"weakness in the governance of cooperative societies\" the standard approach would likely have been to train more accountants at all levels (build the rightskills to control), conduct awareness raising seminars (in- form and therefore get buy in), and introduce computers and a management information system (transparent pro-cess of making information available and tracking key decisions). Such a project would most likely have targeted the literate and those well conversant with the existingsystem. Instead, a completely unrelated activity\u2014an adult literacy program\u2014prompted participants to de- velop their own accounting systems and managementprinciples for the cooperatives, at a level of understand- ing that was immediately relevant in the village, and hence allowing such systems to slowly adapt to new tech-nologies, on the appropriate organizational backbone. Eventually, the cooperatives were not only managed bet- ter, but ownership and control had shifted appropriatelyand to the right level. The next case from India suggests that even in very tra- ditional settings, the most unlikely \"candidate\"\u2014a lowcaste woman\u2014can become a change agent by first devel- oping her own capacity and transferring what she knows to others. Confidence in implementing change for herself,translates into the ability to build confidence in others. Knowledge of what would be most effective for her and her community is rightly applied to make such ideasmore widely acceptable in a region. Extension workers had tried for years to introduce im- proved dairy management and land use technology in thesame communities, yet failed\u2014according to the case study\u2014because of their perceived lack of understanding Cotton has been cultivated and marketed in southern Mali for over thirty years, and the working of textiles from various fibres is a culture of centuries in Mali. Most recently, cotton companies and their affiliatescommonly used to control the purchase of cotton from farmers and its transport to processing centers. To- day, village organizations have almost entirely as-sumed these functions. Representatives of farmers' associations or their federations are now fully respon- sible for weighing the crop, paying producers, stock-ing the products, transporting them to processing centers, and reselling them to the processors, as well as for the necessary organizational and accountingtasks, and development of related policy. The feat wasaccomplished thanks in large measure to literacy and non-formal education programs, which enabled a core of adolescents and adults to acquire reading, writing, and accounting skills in their own local lan-guage. Based on these new skills, the participants developed and applied their own vernacular and bi- lingual management systems for the farmers' asso-ciations. 1 Farmers in Mali now manage the vertically integrated chain of production and process logistics, as they used to in past centuries, when vil-lages made their own fabric. An indigenous skill of logistics management that was latent for many years is again in use.Re-establishing command of the supply chain to farmers in Mali6Local Pathways to Global Development of the local context. The improved management system as successfully promoted by a low-caste woman is not much different from the system proposed by extension workers. Yet, changing the change agent from an externalinto an internal one, made all the difference in achieving the desired outcomes. 3 The last example from a USAID research project in West Africa has a very subtle message that omits the \"skill building\" theme altogether. Instead of identifying skill gaps and needs, the actors inverted the approach,surveyed existing indigenous knowledge, and reflected the results back to the respondents and their communi- ties. This established a useful knowledge base on existingtechnical, operational, and managerial skills in the infor- mal sector. But more importantly, it also helped empower the communities by making them realize that their ownknowledge is valuable and useful. The challenge for development practitioners, govern- ments, and development partner organizations is to de-termine what they can do to help stimulate processes that are similar to the ones described in these cases.Local change agents contribute to enhancing local capacity Previous experiences of communities in interacting with governments and development projects have often led to communities adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Often, it is not the entire community or its leader, but an indi-vidual or a group within the community with a particular interest, that sets the change process in motion: women, elders, youth, coffee producers or even the poorer seg-ments of the community or occasionally an exceptional individual. The three examples illustrated in the boxes, as well as experience from other cases, indicate that thereis no single \"best practice\" to bring about change and empowerment through local capacity enhancement. Ex- cept when faced with severe external shocks, societiestend to prefer gradual, social, and economic change, espe- cially when existing conditions are already fragile. Any change, especially a sudden one, brings risks that thepoorer segments of the population might neither be able to anticipate nor be willing to take. Risk aversion is a cop-Local catalyst promotes change in rural India In rural India a socially disenfranchised woman gained acceptance in her community and beyond by challeng-ing the local context through her technical ingenuity and her capacity to broker external knowledge into the communities. She convinced communities to adoptmeasures for the improvement of their lives. She did this by introducing improved land and dairy cattle management, first to her own landholding, then to hercommunity, and finally throughout her region. Exten- sion agents had hitherto failed to achieve a similar out-come, primarily because the community perceived the extension agents as outsiders who could \"not under-stand and appreciate the local context and conditions.\" Having lived in conditions similar to or even worse than those of the other community members providedthe woman change agent not only with the credibility to promote change and enhance capacity, but with the critical knowledge of where to start, and how to getbroader acceptance of new ideas. 2 The USAID-funded ABEL Project (Achieving BasicEducation and Literacy) has successfully developed methods for disseminating studies carried out by Afri- can researchers around the theme \"decentralizationand local capacity-building.\" The research themes in- cluded the acquisition of skills in the informal sector, management of women's cooperatives, NGO-govern-ment cooperation in providing non-formal education services, and experiments in informal primary school- ing. The research approach emphasized the involve-ment of the disseminators and target audience in acritical review of the studies, documenting and analyz- ing personal experiences, and drawing practical policy conclusions from the results. The ABEL project ap- proach defines research as \"a conversation about indig-enous knowledge, its refinement, and its practical applications.\" Those responsible for the work struggled to make existing studies understandable in practicalterms and help their \"clients\" recognize the fruits of their own experience as research worth comparing with work done elsewhere. 4Unleashing the potential of local knowledge in West Africa7 ing strategy that centers around resisting most exter- nally induced approaches to change. External change agents tend to underestimate these risks, as they usuallydo not have to bear these themselves. However, the lessons of experience also tell us that be- ing an insider is not sufficient to bring about social andeconomic change. The insider needs at least to have had some external exposure, stimulus, and the ability to dem- onstrate that it is possible to merge local and externalknowledge into a working model. The advantages of local change agents are that they know the local context, \"how to work the system.\" The narrative of how women inMalicounda, Senegal challenged and then abolished the practice of female genital mutilation is a model example of the benefits for a community of having internal changeagents who have been empowered as a result of external exposure. 5 Local context, cultural idiosyncrasies, and usually local management and ownership tend to determine the pace and direction of change. Once communities accept to be supported, pulled, or driven by a change agent, they tendto exploit their own and the change agents' explicit and tacit knowledge to address their social, institutional, or economic concerns. Self-paced learning at the local level through struc- tured literacy programs often plays a catalytic role in the process of change. The impact of self-paced learning canbe most easily seen when looking at adult education in rural areas, which has played a significant role for mem- bers of a community to become active, to organize, and tostart addressing a problem. 6 While the objectives of the education projects in such literacy programs are prima-rily directed at increasing literacy, they typical generate secondary outcomes focused on empowerment. For ex- ample, in addition to receiving literacy training, the par-ticipants in such programs would agree to address a critical problem of relevance to their community, making the learning immediately relevant and allowing local resi-dents to learn a skill that can be used to implement other activities in the village. Contrary to general perceptions 7 regarding the secre- tive nature of some form of IK, and the unwillingness of indigenous knowledge bearers to learn from others, IK Notes authors have recorded a remarkably high propen- sity among communities to learn, both from other com- munities and from available global knowledge. Literacy is a key mechanism that enables communities to engage insuch knowledge exchange. Innovative literacy efforts documented in the IK Notes show that instruction in the local language and the use oflocal language teaching materials (which often empha- sizes local context through story-telling, local history, or literature) tend to be more successful in achieving higherliteracy rates. The use of local language is not only more effective, it underscores the value of cultural norms and practices in development planning and practice. This alsocreates opportunities for endogenous capacity enhance- ment, as the two examples in the next box demonstrate. The role of development partners As in other areas of development cooperation, partners can support governments to create the political and eco- nomic environment that fosters indigenous capacity en- Another case describes the effectiveness of locally se- lected and retained seed for the improvement of landraces. Communities were able to tap into their knowl- edge (as retained in the local varieties of seeds) and al- ready existing capacity (farmers have cultivated andselected seed for centuries), not only to expand this ca- pacity but also turn it into an opportunity not avail- able under previous agricultural extension services. 9 This case illustrates how a traditional top-down exten- sion service can be transformed into an enabling insti- tution for the development of local capacity.In Nwodua, Ghana illiterate farmers, school drop-out youth, and village authorities started and managed in-novative health, economic, and educational initiatives. This approach was more useful than the ideas they could adopt from recommendations by external changeagents. In an environment where the only substantial remaining locally managed and controlled economic ac- tivity is subsistence production, any additional, worth-while activity that can be owned and managed by the local community is an attractive proposition. 8 They would succeed because they were able to use latent capac-ity, embedded in how they managed subsistence farming, towards managing health and educational initiatives.Capacity is embedded in the practices of a community8Local Pathways to Global Development hancement, assist communities directly by providing op- portunities to demonstrate their innovativeness, and act as brokers to help exchange experiences across communi-ties, countries, and even regions. An enabling environ- ment includes mechanisms that identify local innovators, while at the same time ensuring more than just incre-mental learning by providing platforms for knowledge exchange and learning. A rational approach to support- ing indigenous capacity enhancement initiatives wouldalso concentrate on areas that are most relevant for the country; for instance, several African countries have now started initiatives that link up traditional healers withthe public health service. Apart from health, the areas most likely to yield results are agriculture, natural re- sources management, education and, increasingly impor-tant, conflict prevention and resolution. Development partners can play a critical role in helping to scale up successes of transferable or replicable indig-enous innovations. Once it has been reasonably well es- tablished that innovations and the capacity to manage them could be replicated elsewhere in the country or theregion, with similar or equal benefits, development part- ners and governments could invest in the dissemination of local innovations as well as in the further developmentof that capacity. As a first step, governments could seek to establish processes that document the scope and degree of capacity to innovate at the community level in thecountry. They could then seek to support initiatives that aim at sharing and learning. Finally, they could help document and disseminate the lessons learned acrosscommunities and countries. Some newer development approaches, such as Commu- nity Driven Development or Social Action Fund 10 type projects not only provide opportunities for capacity en- hancement, but also opportunities for this capacity to be applied.Conclusion Capacity building or enhancement measures are often critical to programs or projects that aim to introduce newtechnologies, change institutions, or improve services. Many development agencies use this functional ap- proach, built around the capacity requirements of thesystems to be introduced. The IK Notes have demon- strated that assuming the perspective of the communities and their existing capabilities\u2014i.e., available knowledgeand institutions\u2014helps create increased ownership, sustainability, and relevance of capacity enhancing mea- sures. This involves applying the principles that emergefrom the cases described in the IK Notes \u2014that is, assum- ing a substantial level of existing knowledge and compe- tence of institutions, including indigenous knowledge;providing opportunities to apply enhanced capacities; and accepting capacity enhancement not only as an end in itself but as a means for empowerment. While commonsense might suggest these to be obvious, we have also seen that the described social or economic results could only be achieved after development actors have acceptedthese principles in a theoretical fashion and as categori- cal guidelines in the design of their community interac- tions and their approaches to implementation. Applyingthe principles we outlined in this series will contribute to a more substantive empowerment of communities, as they move from being recipients of aid to shapers of theirown destiny. 1 IK Notes 9 . 2 IK Notes 58 . 3 IK Notes 60 describes a series of cases with similar characteristics from India. 4 IK Notes 14 . 5 IK Notes 3 . 6 IK Notes 3 . 7 IK Notes 53 . 8 IK Notes 7 . 9 IK Notes 43 . 10 Over the last few years The World Bank developed Community Driven Development (CDD) and Social Action Fund projects to better address poverty by involving the beneficiaries in problemidentification and finding local solutions, wherever possible.93. Education and Indigenous Knowledge Peter B. Easton The relations between education and indigenous knowledge (IK) in African countries are critical and complex. They are also potentially a two-way street as brought out by several of the IK Notes in this compendium. Educational ac- tivities provide one of the prime means for transmitting, accumulating, en- hancing, and transforming IK; and traditions of indigenous knowledge and learning may themselves offer models or patterns for organizing the provisionof education. To understand the relationship, however, it helps first of all to get a better grasp of each of the terms of the equation. Meanings of indigenous knowledge Members of ENDA-Tiers Monde in Dakar, an NGO active in many phases of local development, make some useful distinctions that are themselves a direct outgrowth of IK work in education and can be very helpful in further refiningour sense of the multiple connections between the two. 1 They suggest that there are three meanings or operational levels of indigenous knowledge: \u007f IK as a heritage from the past, including specific bodies of knowledge in dif- ferent areas like botany, medicine and social governance; \u007f IK as the embodiment of a different and particularly African mode of thought which present learners and teachers apply to the acts of learning and instruction; and \u007f IK as a means of articulating what people know and\u2014for the future \u2014 creat- ing new knowledge from the intersection of their capacities (in the first twosenses above) and the challenges of development. That third level of IK\u2014creation of new knowledge from the intersection of cultural heritage, personal genius, skills and insights gathered through a life- time, and pressing challenges of local development\u2014broadens the notion and reveals a proactive dimension. In particular, it makes it evident that much ofIK activity is fundamentally educational, for it does not involve people in dis- covering and preserving existing canons of knowledge\u2014it enables them to \"make\" new knowledge. And in fact the majority of case studies linking IK toeducation in the set included in this volume are of that nature: they describe people finding ways to recognize, extend and reinvent tradition. 2Peter B. Easton is Professor of Adult Education and Human ResourcesDevelopment in the Department ofEducational Foundations and PolicyStudies at Florida State University.10Local Pathways to Global Development Meanings of education Education itself comes in many forms. The distinctions among \"formal,\" \"nonformal,\" and \"informal\" educationoriginally made by Coombs and Ahmed (1974) are still serviceable in defining rough underlying categories that are relevant to our understanding of the uses of indig-enous knowledge. Formal education in their terminology refers to the sort of \"institutionally graded and hierarchically struc-tured\" learning that leads to diplomas with official equivalence\u2014in short, all the various branches of the of- ficial system of education, from primary schools to uni-versities. Nonformal education , on the other hand, denotes \"any organized, systematic educational activity carried on out-side the framework of the formal system to provide se- lected types of learning to particular subgroups in the population, adults as well as children.\" It thus includes awide variety of undertakings\u2014from traditional age- group initiation or scouting, through adult literacy and basic education programs, and on to out-of-school reli-gious or civic education and much locally provided voca- tional instruction or training in business and industry. Informal education, finally, is taken to mean \"the life- long process by which every person acquires and accumu- lates knowledge, skills and insights from daily experiences and exposure to the environment\"\u2014more orless systematic or serendipitous, according to circum- stances, but not collectively organized, recognized, and structured. The boundaries among these domains are obviously a bit blurry and hybrid forms abound, but the cross-hatch- ing of the two kinds of distinctions just mentioned\u2014i.e.,between education as a vehicle for IK and IK as a model for education, on the one hand; and among formal, nonformal, and informal varieties of learning on theother\u2014brings to light a whole series of avenues poten- tially linking the two. The result is depicted in the table below. Some of the dimensions of linkage illustrativelyhighlighted are covered in the articles from IK Notes in- cluded in this volume that deal, directly or indirectly, with education. As indicated in the central column of the table, perhaps the most general characteristic of the process of indig- enous learning that may itself have an influence on thedelivery of education is its contextualization . Indigenous knowledge is typically tied to and incarnated in specific social, cultural, and economic activities within the con-cerned community, and it is typically acquired by some form of participation in those activities, at once func- tional and ritualistic. Much of formal and/or organizededucation in African communities, however, is largely decontexutalized and involves learning things\u2014and learning in ways\u2014that show little relation with the so-cial, cultural, and economic habits of the host community. Cross-cutting effects of gender and religion Indigenous knowledge is usually not gender-neutral and this fact likewise affects its educational functions. IK is in many cultures the particular province (though not the exclusive prerogative) of women, who conserve prescrip-tions and understandings, stories, and botanical insights from the reservoir of oral tradition and historical experi- ence\u2014even where these are characterized by male-domi-nated culture as \"old wives' tales.\" Examples of relationships between indigenous knowledge and education obtained by cross-hatching types of education with modes of relationship Education as vehicle for IK IK as model for education Formal education Introduction of local history, ethno- botanical knowledge, traditional music or crafts, etc. into the formal school or university curriculum Use of local languages as a vehicle for learning in schools; adoption of traditional apprenticeship formats as part of instructional delivery Nonformal education Training local extension agents or administrative personnel in intervention methods that blend IK & \"Western\" scientific approaches. In addition to the above, building new educational dimensions into existing age group societies and traditional associations Informal education Making available through a variety of media information on different types of IK and their applications. Increased use of context learning and contextualized instruction At a communal level, promoting increased contact and commerce with \u2014and increased observation of\u2014 traditional artisans by the rest of the population. 11 Much could be said about the interaction of IK and gen- der. Suffice it here to note the example of teaching per- sonnel. In countries where primary schools, andparticularly those in rural areas, are staffed in good part by local women with the requisite qualifications\u2014as is the case in India and a small but growing number of Afri-can nations\u2014teachers may in fact find ways, both con- scious and unconscious, of introducing contents and approaches drawn from local IK into the classroom expe-rience. In much of francophone Africa, however, rural primary schools have been predominantly staffed by men\u2014and often, through explicit administrative policy,by men from other cultural regions of the country\u2014a characteristic that has reinforced their function as a decontextualized instructional system designed to ini-tiate children to \"modern\" society and to a universal or national culture having little to do with local traditions. The intersection of religion and indigenous knowledge likewise has many meanings for education in Africa. There are typically three cardinal points on this compass: (a) local religious traditions; (b) the doctrines and prac-tices of world religions (for the most part, either Chris- tianity or Islam, though not infrequently both); and (c) the culture of \"lay\" or State-focused schooling. BothChristianity and Islam have been adapted to African cul- ture and even \"Africanized\" to varying extents during the history of their transmission across the continent\u2014mostly accomplished through education of one type or another\u2014though proponents of Islam would, if anything, deny this sort of syncretism even more vigorously thanChristian missionaries (e.g., Mugambi 2002, Monteil 1964). And both have likewise influenced and been influ- enced by national ideologies of development to varyingdegrees, depending on the particular religious complex- ion of the State during a given period of time. Religion complicates the picture because of the way in which it can affect the meaning of what is indigenous, what is imported. The contrast among the influences of local culture, international religions, and the colonial re-gime of capitalism stands out with particular clarity in works like Ceddo , the renowned film by Senegalese au- thor and cinematic director Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne (2001[1977]), in which the Islamic imam , the Catholic mission- ary, the defenders of local tradition, and the representa- tives of colonial power all vie for dominance. Incircumstances like those of 20 th century Senegal, where schooling and State power were largely monopolized by an entente between State and Christian missions, Islamic institutions themselves come to be seen in some sense as repositories of \"indigenous\" knowledge\u2014that is, sourcesof an African tradition oppositional to the colonial state with roots going back through generations of local soci- ety. Semb\u00e8ne pointedly reminds the film-goer that Islamwas itself an outside imposition at one time. The scene is strikingly similar, in some ways, to the circumstances re- counted in IK Notes Number 4, \"From Sacrilege to Sustainability,\" on reforestation and organic farming in Forikrom, Ghana, though the major protagonist there is evangelical Christianity. Understanding the relationship In a sense, most of the articles in this collection speak at least indirectly of the relation of indigenous knowledge toeducation, because for \"traditional\" ways and reservoirs of perception to have an impact on the conduct of devel- opment they must be articulated and mobilized. Oncethey are, to whatever end, then these bodies of knowledge and experience acquire the critical mass necessary for transmission through\u2014and for incorporation into\u2014ex-isting forms of societal learning, whether as subject mat- ter or as model for process. But those articles that deal explicitly with concerns of education (formal, nonformal or informal) ,3 even if only in part, are fewer in number, and the principal ones among them are worth briefly highlighting here. Theirdistribution and their nature are illustrative of a number of points made above, though, if read in detail, the texts reveal facets of a complex and dynamic reality that gowell beyond a few generalizations. It is significant that none of the articles bears prepon- derantly on the uses of IK in formal schooling, whether atthe primary school or the university level. Though not exemplified in these papers, the blend is potentially less of a problem in higher education, where both politicalcorrectness and the normal purview of topics like history, anthropology, philosophy, and sociology can make a place for critical consideration of local knowledge and Africantraditions\u2014if not for pedagogies and the type of contextualized learning typical of indigenous education. At the primary and secondary level, however, the struggleis more difficult. Even the use of African languages\u2014 themselves stratified between a large number of local speech traditions and a smaller number of vehicular oneslike Swahili and Hausa\u2014has been a practice more often recommended than sustained (cf. Bunyi 1999). However, some articles 4 do deal with incorporation of IK contents and learning processes into community schooling \u2014those unchartered versions of elementary or secondary instruction that have been established by vil-12Local Pathways to Global Development lages and local associations, and sometimes promoted by State authorities as well, as a means of absorbing excess demand for schooling or of addressing acute problemslike youth unemployment and social maladjustment. Un- fortunately, as the studies relate, the nearer these locally engendered forms of schooling get to the formal system,the more they end up having to abandon IK contents and processes, like use of maternal languages. Multiple forms of nonformal education are evident in the articles\u2014as a means to mobilize local energies and augment local skills for the challenges of development; 5 as a facility for capturing indigenous knowledge and ap- plying it to current challenges like democratization;6 and as the centerpiece of alternate knowledge traditions like Koranic studies.7 The very variety of foci in this field, which, in a manner typical of nonformal education, spans concerns from agricultural marketing through local gov- ernance, health and human rights, provides multiple in-terfaces for articulating and developing local knowledge. Numerous patterns of interaction manifest themselves, where adult education and vocational courses serve as aplatform for reinvigorating local government in rural Ghana, 8 which recount how alternate apprenticeship sys- tems and \"rites of passage\" have been developed for ur-ban youth and war-ravaged communities in Kenya, the Sudan and Mozambique, 9 and, where a program devoted to articulating Senegalese women's \"ways of knowing\"ended up forging a new means of combating female geni- tal mutilation, without condemning the culture in which it took place. 10 Last but not least, the venues and avenues of informal education and its relations to indigenous knowledge are still more diverse, since almost any activity devoted to ar-ticulating local understandings and then applying them to current development problems\u2014or to blending them with other sources of knowledge in conservable form\u2014may have in and of itself a profound educational impact on participants and bystanders alike. This is quite obvi- ously the case in situations like those analyzed in educa-tional research in Benin, 11 on village bankers in Fand\u00e8ne, Senegal,12 on women bean farmers in Kenya,13 on local strategies for ecological preservation on the West Africancoast, 14 and on Fulani literature as a nonprofit busi-ness.15 For educational institutions to be able to draw on a corpus of relevant and applicable lessons from indig- enous knowledge, someone must continually pioneer itsapplications and adaptations. \"Informal education\" ac- tivities like those described in the referenced issues per- form, inter alia, this function. Putting it all together In fact, there is potentially a funnel or circuit linking the interaction of indigenous knowledge with the three kindsof education highlighted here. Experiences of informal education like publishing, environmental protection, and local banking that involve applying indigenous knowl-edge to\u2014or broadcasting it in\u2014new arenas create the grist for cycles of nonformal training and thereby enrich a corpus of lessons, applications, and understandingsthat may progressively work its way into formal school- ing as well. The recognition and dissemination that it re- ceives then hopefully transforms the environment a bit,reinforces the informal impulse, and re-ignites the cycle. None of the stages in this cycle is guaranteed, however. Each requires dedication, hard work and a measure ofgood luck or providence. Though habitual portrayals of the education system put formal education at the center and institutions of higher learning at the top, arguablythe spark plug of the process described here lies in what the staff of ENDA call the capacity for new knowledge creation in indigenous culture and therefore the informalactivities in which that aptitude is first realized. 1 IK Notes 42. 2 IK Notes 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 20, 22, 23, 25, 31 and 46. 3 IK Notes 5, 7, 11, 13, 18, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 38 and 42. 4 IK Notes 5, 29, 42. 5 IK Notes 9. 6 IK Notes 16. 7 IK Notes 11. 8 IK Notes 7. 9 IK Notes 20 and 33. 10 IK Notes 3 and 31. 11 IK Notes 14. 12 IK Notes 6. 13 IK Notes 23. 14 IK Notes 8. 15 IK Notes 38.134. Women's Indigenous Knowledge: Building Bridges Between the Traditional and the Modern Mamphela Ramphele Women in most societies of the world, as mothers, grandmothers, wives, sis- ters, or daughters, often represent the first line of health care, prepare meals for the family, convey values, and provide the first role models for behavior. Inmany rural societies of developing countries, women carry the burden of farm labor and on-farm transport; they arrange for household energy (mostly fire- wood) and water. During periods of hunger, women know which plants canprovide emergency meals to help keep their families alive. Beyond the provision of livelihoods for local communities in the areas of family health, growing of staple crops, conflict management, and bio-diversityconservation, women have also found local answers to broader issues such as trade, tourism, education, health, and employment. Despite the essential contributions to the lives of their families and commu- nities, women still face many constraints in exercising more influence over their living conditions. These constraints include an excessive workload, the difficulties of accessing or controlling the key factors of production, and a lackof training opportunities and appropriate information, extension and advi- sory services. 1 Some IK Notes in this compilation present specific cases where women's in- digenous knowledge and practices help them, their families, and their commu- nities to address local development challenges successfully. This article highlights some of these cases and calls for more recognition of women's indig-enous knowledge and its integration into the development process. In the past, indigenous knowledge related to family health care or subsistence food pro- duction has received little research and attention. Existing constraints are re-inforced, perpetuating gender inequality partly because technical or institutional knowledge associated with women's work often remains unap- preciated or is not valued. 2 While patriarchal traditions in many societies have contributed to these perceptions, we increasingly see evidence of women be- coming the promoters of their own development priorities, including ways to challenge such traditions.Dr. Mamphela Ramphele is Managing Director of the World Bank.14Local Pathways to Global Development Addressing local challenges We know from the findings presented in the IK Notes that in Senegal, the women of Malicounda initiated a cam-paign to put an end to the practice of female genital muti- lation. 3 For years, external agents, such as development organizations, and advocacy groups had called for theabolition of this practice in Senegal. Yet the eventual change was made possible only after the women of Malicounda had decided to use indigenous structures toovercome the practice from within their communities, rather than as a response to external calls. This is a powerful story of empowerment and social change, with important lessons. In a nutshell, the women convinced the village council to abolish the practice in the village. However, not satisfied with this result, thewomen created a team (including a few of their hus- bands) to visit neighboring villages. They spoke to women there and helped them win the support of theircommunities. They also managed to convince the tradi- tional leaders, including the religious Imam of Malicounda to support the women's agenda and involvethemselves actively as agents of change. This approach has increased ownership of the change process in the communities and beyond. In the event, this grassrootsmovement led to the \"Declaration of Malicounda\" by a congress of 18 village leaders from the region who com- mitted to abandon the practice in their communities. Oneyear later, the President of Senegal proposed the \"Oath of Malicounda\" as a model for national adoption. In less than three years, this grassroots movement had spread tomore than 200 communities nationwide and several com- munities in other countries as well. 4 Researchers have also found that women have taken a lead role in preserving natural forests and bio-diversity in high-risk and marginal regions. In Senegal's West Coast region of Popenguine, for example, local womenformed an association for the protection of the environ- ment 5 to address the issues they were most concerned about. These included loss of bio-diversity, diminishingvegetable stock, an inappropriate tourism strategy, youth unemployment, and lack of capital. The association in- volved traditional leaders, urban women, and youth, en-couraging entire communities across the region to participate. It planted firebreaks with endogenous spe- cies around the entire perimeter of their forests, estab-lished a cooperative distribution network for wood, charcoal, and gas to regulate fuel consumption, thereby supporting local efforts to control deforestation. Theycollected household waste for the compost needed in thenursery producing tree seedlings and formed savings and loan groups and a regional network of women associa- tions. 6 Other IK Notes7 point to the substantial contribution of women to maintaining agro-biodiversity. Droughts pe- riodically affect many regions in Africa, often causingwidespread famine. In their role as principal providers of food in the event of food shortages, women have devel- oped coping strategies to maintain food security at thehousehold level. They often rely on minor crops or semi- domesticated plants, more tolerant to droughts and pests, providing a reserve for extended periods of eco-nomic hardship. 8 Many of the plants women use also have medicinal value.9 However, women's indigenous post-harvest technologies, such as storage, and process-ing practices related to underutilized plants, are in dan- ger of disappearing. 10 Today, projects focusing on the conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants in-creasingly collaborate with women on in-situ and ex-situ conservation efforts, such as the cultivation of medicinal plants in home gardens. 11 The role of women's IK in relation to farm animals is also underestimated. Although animal ownership in most societies is associated with men, women often collect fod-der for cattle, look after their health, milk them, and col- lect and use dry cow dung for energy purposes. 12 As a result, gender differentiated research in this area is be-ginning to discover that women have acquired a substan- tial stock of husbandry and ethno-veterinary knowledge that complements existing scientific knowledge. Contributing to global goals Research on indigenous knowledge has highlighted the ways in which women have developed effective strategiesto help achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In the Tanga Region of Tanzania, for instance, a local NGO run mostly by women provides prevention,testing, counseling, home-based care, and income genera- tion opportunities to local AIDS patients. Because of the treatment provided by traditional healers, patients areable to resume their daily lives and live longer. The NGO assists women who provide home-based care to HIV/ AIDS patients. It has also set up day-care centers forHIV/AIDS orphans, provides education to school chil- dren, and involves traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in awareness raising related to HIV/AIDS. 13 The work of the NGO has a direct impact on people living with HIV/ AIDS (PLWHA) by enabling them to lead productive lives15 again. By organizing community-based care of PLWHA, the NGO also helps facilitate a better management of women's increased total workload, allowing them to takecare of their other essential tasks such as food production and family health care. In West Africa, women have redefined adult education programs with respect to functional literacy and skill building. Following their participation in literacy pro- grams, women returned to their communities, empow-ered not only by their new skills, but also by realizing that their traditional skills and knowledge, comple- mented with external knowledge could be put to use ad-dressing local community problems. Their increased self-awareness enabled them to address harmful indig- enous practices, such as FGM, which was described ear-lier. 14 By forming regional associations and promoting adult literacy programs, they encouraged other women to replicate their experiences.15 Another innovative educa- tion project in Mali used cultural symbols and indigenous practices to initiate a dialogue about women's pregnancy and health risks within the family and the community.Project participants have also learned to use modern me- dia, such as videos, flipcharts, and badges to promote community awareness about women's health risks. 16 The cases relating to education reveal the complexity of indigenous knowledge and underscore the role of women in this context. While women are undoubtedly a valuableresource of indigenous knowledge, some of the con- straints mentioned above are a result of actual or per- ceived cultural traditions. The IK Notes on education lead to an interesting conclusion: culturally ingrained but harmful practices such as FGM have shown great re- sistance to external efforts to abolish them, whereas in-ternal and even indigenous ways to address them in a sustainable manner appear to have had a much higher chance of success. However, these indigenous approachesrequired the external stimulus\u2014e.g., the adult literacy program\u2014that gave the women the confidence to address the issue, take it up with their traditional leaders, andconvince them to make it their issue as well. The result of both processes\u2014the literacy program as well as the fight against FMG\u2014led the women to be recognized as an em-powered group in their communities and beyond. In another case, the cooperation between the modern public health sector and traditional birth attendants inthe Iganga District of Uganda demonstrates how women's indigenous and modern knowledge can be lever- aged to help achieve one of the MDGs. The project man-aged to bridge the perceived gap between the traditional and modern knowledge systems and lead to impressive outcomes: a reported 50 percent reduction in maternalmortality in three years. 17 Next to literacy, income generation provides additional opportunities for the empowerment of women. For ex-ample, a number of self-help groups have emerged to sup- port women with skills development and opportunities for income generation. It is quite common for men to takeover activities from women once these activities generate cash proceeds (e.g., when subsistence crops become cash crops) and seize responsibilities from women once theyprovide cash proceeds, especially in food production. Hence, efforts to support income-generating projects for women have to consider such gender roles to ensure thatthe opportunities offered can be fully utilized by the women. Combining such efforts with savings schemes in- creases the likelihood for women to remain in controlover the proceeds. In India, for example, women formed over 175 self-help groups in the rural district of Pratabghar in NorthernIndia, such as the Kaveri Mahela Self Help Group. Formed in 1995, the Kaveri group initially comprised 15 members. At first, each member saved the equivalent of10 cents per month, which they increased four to eight times over the next six months. Today, each member saves up to $6 per month. The funds are saved in the localbank under a joint fund called the Kaveri Self Help Fund. Having saved a fair amount, the women started an inter- nal lending scheme within the group. They also took outindividual loans worth $100-200 from the local bank to invest in modern technologies, such as a sugar cane pro- cessor. These self-help groups have also become effectiveagents of social change in the countryside and have ad- dressed several sensitive issues, such as the dowry sys- tem. Today, a large number of women in this district canread, write, and comprehend complex aspects of their business transactions. 18 Building on these experiences, in the small town of Embalam in South India, women run \"Village Knowledge Centers\" for their own and neighboring villages. This en- ables women to educate themselves further, not only inavenues available to them through the government and other NGOs but also on subjects of their own choice, such as local diseases and treatments for humans and farmanimals. 19 As is the case in Senegal, the empowerment of women through education in India has allowed them to address cultural obstacles to their own development.16Local Pathways to Global Development Leveraging women's indigenous knowledge: a challenge for development agents The series of factual accounts from the IK Notes provides fascinating insights into various areas where women's IK can have an impact on development. Whether it is localproduction or political expression through advocacy, women have managed to influence community leaders, politicians, and development partners. They have raisedand addressed serious issues such as female genital muti- lation, HIV/AIDS, food security, and the loss of sustain- able production practices while promoting innovativecommunity institutions, such as savings and credit groups, natural resource management cooperatives, and drought management committees. More systematic research is needed to complement studies on the socio-economic roles of women in their so- cieties and on power relationships, concentrating on theirindigenous knowledge and wisdom. This would help de- velopment practitioners to better understand, value, and eventually validate such contributions to development.The price of overlooking women's IK outside their \"tradi- tional,\" domestic knowledge domains could eventually re- sult in losing a substantial body of knowledge. This posesa specific challenge for development workers: they need to help develop more space and opportunities for women to express, apply, and share their knowledge of solvingdevelopment problems. Women as bearers of indigenous knowledge, can\u2014prob- ably better than men\u2014act as bridge builders betweenrepresentatives of the various knowledge systems. In the area of family health, for example, where women have the distinct advantage of being considered by most people asthe leading practitioners, opportunities for integration and mutual learning exist, as the Iganga experience dem- onstrates. 20 Local women are also better positioned to overcome the barriers that harmful traditional practices have imposed on their lives, rather than exogenous ap- proaches, as the Malicounda example suggests.21 These cases point to opportunities for governments, develop- ment partners, and the World Bank alike to help facili- tate the integration of various knowledge systems for thebetterment of the local communities.Conclusion One of the central messages of the IK Notes is that women's IK can make a significant contribution toachieving sustainable outcomes in development. There- fore, there is a need to make sustained and focused ef- forts towards facilitating the incorporation of women'sknowledge into broader development efforts. To enable women to maximize their IK contribution to the development process, national governments and de-velopment partners need to go beyond gender-balanced participation of women in development activities and de- velop approaches that provide them with:\u007fSpace, in the form of fora where women can present their experiences, learn from their peers, and encoun- ter representatives from the established knowledgesystems for fair and equitable exchange and learning; \u007fOpportunities, in the form of substantially improved access for women to the knowledge systems and infra-structure in their countries in a way that is not pre- scriptive in its methods and outcomes. From primary school to adult literacy programs, education is a center-piece of such an approach; its effectiveness depends on appropriate participation and inclusion not just of numbers of participants, but of contributors to a devel-opment solution; and \u007fRecognition , through a commitment by governments and development partners to direct specific researchtowards IK of women; to identify, document, and appro- priately disseminate women's IK; to help strengthen existing women's knowledge networks; and to providefora for the exchange of knowledge between women and the formal sciences. Recognition, of course, also in- cludes the possibility for traditional women practitio-ners to gain income from their IK and not be taken advantage of in arrangements that deprive them of pos- sibilities to practice their skills. \"Recognition\" dependsabove all on an inclusive and participatory process be- tween the public and private actors in development. By providing them with opportunities of the type de-scribed in the IK Notes , women can become agents of change rooted in their traditions and yet be able to le- verage learning from outside their communities.17 1 Austria Development Corporation, CTA, Hellenic Development Corporation; 1999: \"The economic role of women in agricultural and promoting income-generating activities.\"Seminar Report.

Indigenous Responses to AIDS in Africa Edward C. Green The IK Notes in this volume clearly illustrate that many solutions to the prob- lems of the poor lie within those communities and populations. A discussion of the responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa demonstrates that local so-lutions to the spread of the disease are equally or more valid, efficient, and ef- fective than those designed on external models. Evidence is mounting that the global model of AIDS prevention has been ineffective in Africa. The model is based on risk-reduction or \"remedies\" inter- ventions (condoms, treating sexually transmissible infections [STIs] with drugs), rather than on risk avoidance (mutual monogamy, abstinence, or delayof age of first sex). 1 The remedies-based prevention model does not actively promote partner reduction, or even address multi-partner sex. When HIV/AIDS first appeared in Africa, most governments preferred not to deal with the issue. There was indignation for blaming Africans for the origin of a deadly pandemic. There was also fear that evidence of AIDS would ruin tourism and foreign business investment. Yet at least two African govern-ments responded very quickly to AIDS: Uganda and Senegal. These two coun- tries are now recognized as the first two AIDS success stories in Africa.; and it is important to look carefully at these programs, which were developed largelyby the countries themselves, and before Western AIDS organizations had geared up to assist Africa in the fight against AIDS. Both Uganda and Senegal developed AIDS prevention programs that em- phasized primary behavior change, 2 along with risk reduction interventions. Put another way, they dealt with AIDS as a behavioral issue requiring behav- ioral solutions, rather than merely as a medical problem requiring medical so-lutions. Both countries were successful in drastically reducing HIV prevalence (Uganda) or in preventing HIV from even entering the general (non high-risk) population (Senegal). No country in the world can match Uganda's 66 percentoverall decline in infection rates. It is accurate to say that these African governments, later assisted by their NGOs, relied on indigenous knowledge to design effective programs. Thisshould come as no surprise. Influencing behavior, or changing deeply en- trenched behavioral and social patterns, is not the same as promoting a drug or a vaccine.Edward C. Green is Senior Research Scientist at the Harvard Center forPopulation and Development.19 Risk-reduction model The AIDS prevention paradigm that was exported to Af- rica in the later 1980s was developed for high-riskgroups, such as men who have sex with men in US cities like San Francisco. Part of the risk reduction model was not to address sexual behavior. It was argued that this would amount to making value judgments, which is un- scientific and would only drive away those who needed to be reached. AIDS experts settled for risk or harm reduc-tion approaches, which assume that behavior is difficult or impossible to change, and that efforts ought to be made to mitigate the consequences of risky behavior.Thus, condoms and clean needles (where legal) were pro- vided to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted and blood-to-blood HIV infection respectively. There was andis no discouragement of any form of sexual behavior, or injecting drug use. AIDS experts applauded themselves for their open-mindedness and realism. This approach might have been suitable for San Fran- cisco, or even S\u00e3o Paulo or Bangkok. But when this was exported to Africa, there was little attempt to adapt themodel to local cultural settings or epidemic patterns, de- spite claims to the contrary. In the US, Europe and most of Asia, HIV infections are concentrated in a few fairlywell defined high-risk groups. In (Sub-Saharan) Africa, most infections are found in the general population. Ac- tually, many are opposed to this distinction, arguing,\"let's not single out particular risk groups. That will stig- matize them\u2014blame the victims\u2014and make the general public feel that they are not at risk.\" So our messageshould be, \"we are all at risk of AIDS.\" This has a nice, egalitarian ring; we are all in this together. Nevertheless, differences in epidemiological patterns and cultural set-tings are real, calling for\u2014among other things\u2014different approaches to prevention in different settings. AIDS prevention in Africa How has the risk-reduction model fared in Africa? Most efforts have focused on condom supply and promotion. There is no evidence to date that mass promotion ofcondoms has paid off in the decline of HIV infection rates at the population level. The UNAIDS multi-center study, published in a special edition of AIDS in 2001, found that condom user levels made no significant difference in de- termining HIV prevalence levels (Buve et al. 2001). And a very recent UNAIDS review of condom effectiveness(Hearst and Chen 2003) concludes, \"There are no definiteexamples yet of generalized epidemics that have been turned back by prevention programs based primarily on condom promotion.\" Some argue that not enough condoms are being used in Africa to have made a difference yet, and that condoms would have an impact if only they were made easily avail-able in the billions instead of the mere tens of millions. Possibly, but what we do know from recent USAID data is that, after more than 15 years of intense condom socialmarketing (a field I have worked in) in Africa, the result is an average of only 4.6 condoms available (not necessar- ily used) per male per year in Africa in recent years(Shelton and Johnston 2001). That figure was actually a bit higher in the mid-1990s; it has declined somewhat even since then in spite of the explosion of AIDS in south-ern Africa. The problem seems to be low demand rather than supply. Uganda's home-grown approach In addition to condoms, the other relatively expensive AIDS prevention programs currently funded by major donors are mass treatment of STIs, voluntary counseling,and testing and prevention of mother-to-child transmis- sion through Nevirapine. Like condom marketing, these are medical remedies rather than a promotion of behav-ioral change. These programs, along with condom social marketing, had not yet started in Uganda when infection rates began to decline in the late 1980s. Yet Uganda hasexperienced the greatest decline of HIV infection of any country. Its home-grown prevention program was based largely on a message expressed in a local metaphor:\"zero-graze.\" This means only graze your beast in your own field; do not graze elsewhere (i.e., do not have sex outside of marriage or stable relationship). Responding toforeign expert advice about AIDS, President Museveni observed in 1991, \"Just as we were offered the \"magic bullet\" in the early 1940s, we are now being offered thecondom for 'safe sex.' We are being told that only a thin piece of rubber stands between us and the death of our continent. I feel that condoms have a role to play as ameans of protection, especially in couples who are HIV- positive, but they cannot become the main means of stemming the tide of AIDS.\" Within a mere three to four years of the start of Uganda's prevention program, behavioral surveys (cor- roborated by biological data) began to show much lowerlevels of casual sex, a delayed age of first sex, and rela- tively high condom user rates among the few who still20Local Pathways to Global Development engaged in casual sex. Uganda also pioneered approaches in reducing stigma, bringing discussion of sexual behav- ior out into the open, involving HIV-infected people inpublic education, persuading individuals and couples to be tested and counseled, and improving the status of women. The genius of Uganda's ABC program ( Abstain, Be faithful, or use Condoms) is that it focuses on the \"proximate determinants\" or immediate causes of HIV infection, as well as on what individuals themselves can do to change (or maintain) behavior, and thereby avoid or reduce the risk of infection. But it also tackled the diffi- cult social and institutional problems that only commit-ted governments can address over the near to intermediate term. These programs were led by the gov- ernment (especially the Ministry of Health), but also in-volved many NGOs and community-based local organizations. Senegal's indigenous solutions Like Uganda, Senegal was one of the first countries in Africa to acknowledge HIV/AIDS and to begin imple- menting significant HIV/AIDS prevention and controlprograms. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (BUCEN); like Uganda, \"Senegal has been a success story, as the government has managed to keep the epi-demic from getting out of control\" (BUCEN 2000:1). Ac- cording to UNAIDS, Senegal currently has one of the lowest HIV seroprevalence rates in Sub-Saharan Africa,and it appears to be stable at under 1 percent or less of the general population (BUCEN 2000). A UNAIDS assessment of Senegal's response to its AIDS epidemic (Sittitrai 2001:9) highlights the following elements: \u007f As in Uganda, politicians in Senegal were quick to move against the epidemic once the first cases appeared in the second half of the 1980s. \u007f Since 93 percent of Senegalese are Muslims, the gov- ernment made efforts to involve religious leaders; HIV/ AIDS became a regular topic in Friday sermons in mosques, and senior religious figures talked about it ontelevision and radio. \u007f Many other levels of Senegalese society joined in. By 1995, 200 NGOs were active in the response, as werewomen's groups with about half a million members. \u007f HIV prevention was included when sex education was introduced in schools. Parallel efforts reached out toyoung people who are not in school (Sittitrai 2001:9).Again as in Uganda, we find evidence of primary behav- ioral change in Senegal, that is, partner reduction and rise in age of sexual debut. According to the DHSwebsite, 3 the median age of sexual debut has risen more than in any other African country for which DHS data exist, from 16.6 to 17.4. And the UNAIDS author notesfrom a review of demographic and behavioral data: Senegalese women in their early 20s did not have sex until they were almost 19 or older. For their mothers'generation\u2014the women who were between 40 and 49 in 1997\u2014the median age was closer to 16 (Sittitrai 2001:11). A 2001 study of never-married females in Dakar aged 15-23 was conducted by Family Health International, with USAID and CDC funding, through the SenegaleseMinistry of Health. Only 29 females out of a random sample of 699 reported ever having had intercourse. This means that 95.9 percent were delaying sex; only 4.1 per-cent were having sex (Hygea/FHI 2001: 31). This repre- sents a very low proportion of girls and young women having early sex, by almost any country's standard, espe-cially since about 11 percent of the sample is in the age group 20-23. Most (55 percent) of the 29 young women in the FHI study who reported having any number of part- ners in the 201 study reported just one partner (Hygea/ FHI 2001:35). Like Uganda, Senegal enlisted the support of religious organizations in AIDS prevention, began AIDS education in primary schools, and deliberately used fear arousal as a prevention strategy. This does not correspond to theWestern model of AIDS prevention. What occurred in Uganda and Senegal are indigenous, African responses to AIDS. And they worked. African paradigm worked best On the intervention side, there are similarities between Africa's two success stories, beginning with the fact thatboth programs were largely indigenous. If anything, Senegal seems to have been even bolder than Uganda in telling the major donor agencies that, while their supportwas wanted and needed, they should not tell Africans ex- actly how best to prevent AIDS. According to Demo- graphic and Health surveys, Senegal and Uganda standout among African countries in the high proportions of surveyed people who say they learned about AIDS from face-to-face, local contacts, as distinct from radio, printmaterials, or formal health workers. Senegal stands out as a country where women feel personally at risk of get-21 ting AIDS (even though its HIV prevalence is the lowest in continental sub-Saharan Africa, about 0.50 percent), and Uganda stands out as a country where women feelthey can refuse unwanted sex or insist upon condom use. These two countries also mobilized both their religious leaders and their traditional healers at the beginning oftheir respective epidemics. THETA (Traditional Healers and Modern Practitioners Together Against AIDS), a Ugandan NGO, promotes collaboration between tradi-tional and modern health practitioners in the fight against AIDS. 4 This NGO developed a model of collabo- rating in prevention and treatment of AIDS, drawingupon the many thousands of traditional healers in Uganda. The Africa-wide, Senegal-based NGO PROMETRA is coordinating AIDS programs that involveindigenous African healers throughout the continent. 5 The governments of Uganda and Senegal recognized where their strength lay when it came to transmittingculturally appropriate messages to their broad popula- tions. It came largely from community leaders. In a 1998 World Bank exercise, the author was able to estimatethat between 4,500 and 6,750 Ugandan religious clergy were trained annually in HIV/AIDS prevention at district levels between 1995-1998. Fully a third of all Ugandandistricts also trained traditional healers, meaning that over 1,800 healers were trained every year for four years. Of course, this estimate is based on written records. Evenallowing for considerable inflation of figures, this still amounts to a greater number of indigenous healers offi- cially involved in HIV/AIDS prevention than in most\u2014perhaps any\u2014other country in Africa. THETA, the Ugandan NGO, was the model for the training of indig- enous healers. In short, two African countries drew upon their respec- tive cultures, along with what for them was common sense, and proceeded to do what was needed to preventAIDS effectively. And they did this largely on their own. The unfortunate thing is that most African countries did very little or nothing until well-meaning experts showedup, and as a result, most African countries have AIDS programs that tend to reflect external notions of what to do. If we are to be entirely objective, it is hard to concludethat HIV/AIDS prevention programs have worked well elsewhere, since HIV infection rates appear to be going up (again) among key groups in the United States andEurope (e.g., Gross 2003; MAP 2000).Providing more options It has been difficult for donor agencies and consulting firms involved in AIDS prevention to accept evidencethat suggests that what they have been doing may not have been very effective in Africa; meanwhile something they have not supported directly has worked better. Somehave dismissed the ABC approach as simplistic, narrow or reductionist. Yet, the ABC approach adds primary be- havior change (the A and B of ABC) to programs favoredby donors, programs that for the most part do not go be- yond \"C,\" beyond condoms and D-for-drugs remedies. Adding primary behavior change therefore providespeople with more options for preventing HIV infection than are currently available in most programs, and these are sustainable options that do not depend on relativelyhigh-cost imports. Care, support and treatment Going beyond prevention, there are other sets of issues associated with care, support and treatment of PLWHAs (people living with HIV/AIDS) and their families. Thetreatment issue that currently dominates global dis-course has to do with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, and how to lower the price of these in order to make them available to the poor through complex systems of profes-sional health care operating in biomedical health care fa- cilities. Certainly, effective drugs (even if expensive) ought to be available to those who need them most, evenif they are poor and hard to reach. But it should also be recognized that it will take at least several years to work out all the problems involved in providing ARVs in an eq-uitable way in Africa. Meanwhile there are low-cost, home-based care and support programs already operat- ing in Africa that could be receiving more support fromforeign donors. The Tanga AIDS Working Group (TAWG) is an excellent example of a low-cost, sustainable pro- gram based on indigenous knowledge. 6 \"TAWG's work is an outstanding example of how positive results can be achieved in the fight againstAIDS by synergistically combining local expertise, in- digenous knowledge, and modern health workers to provide effective low cost treatment for people livingwith AIDS.\" 722Local Pathways to Global Development TAWG in Tanzania and THETA in Uganda are both community-based programs that provide herbal medi- cines for the treatment of the opportunistic infections ofHIV/AIDS. In addition to anecdotal evidence, there are data from clinical trials (which are always hard to finance when they involve unpatentable natural products) toshow that at least some of these medicines are effective. For example, clinical trails have confirmed the efficacy of one of THETA's locally available herbal medicines forHerpes Zoster and AIDS-related diarrhea (Homsy et al. 1999). Due to cost and access issues, it is likely that in- creasing numbers of Africans will rely primarily or exclu-sively on phytomedicines and indigenous therapies for the infections associated with AIDS. The pharmaceutical industry has started to recognize the value of the\"ethnomedical\" approach to bioprospecting for new, mar- ketable drugs, that is, starting such research on natural product medicines already in use by traditional healersand/or entire indigenous populations. 8 And the World Bank has recognized the economic development value of conserving medicinal plants in situ, and growing themcommercially ex situ. 9 \"Given the central cultural role of traditional heal- ers in communities, they provide one of the best hopes for treating and stemming the spread of AIDS. But healers rely on medicinal plants and there hasbeen a significant decrease in the abundance of many important medicinal plant species as their habitats are lost through deforestation, cultivation, overgraz-ing, burning, droughts, desertification, etc.\" 10 Some community-based programs for people infected and affected by AIDS provide information and advice on improved nutrition, psychosocial and spiritual issues, participation in support groups, stress avoidance, promo-tion of good general immune system health, cessation of smoking and alcohol consumption, development of posi- tive attitudes, and the like. Considering only the role ofimproved nutrition, it has been established that concen- trations of HIV in the genital tract are increased by vita- min A deficiency (Mostad et al. 1997), thussupplementation of this vitamin alone might play a role in prevention of HIV as well as treatment. And vitamin A can come from local fruits and vegetables. In fact, thebest community programs do not rely on outside tech- nologies, commodities, or ideas.\"The Ethiopian government, with World Bank as- sistance, will soon start to implement the first con-servation and sustainable use of medicinal plants project in Sub-Saharan Africa. The overall objective of the project is to initiate support for conservation,management and sustainable use of medicinal plants for human and livestock health care.\" 11 Community based programs related to AIDS can give hope to those who are, or suspect they might be, HIV- positive. The message of these programs is that infectedpersons can live longer, more productive lives if certain steps of self-care are taken. This approach and message contradict the widespread belief in Africa that AIDS islittle more than a death sentence. It contradicts fear, so- cial stigma, and defeatist thinking. Fear and stigma leads to PLWHAs hiding their HIV status (and, for that matter,not being tested for HIV), abandoning hope, and weaken- ing their immune system and health further with fear and anxiety, a vicious downward cycle; and, of course, notbecoming involved in AIDS education as happened in Uganda. There are some who argue that programs that rely on natural products and indigenous resources merely reflect a \"double standard of health care,\" with \"second-class medicine for the rural masses\" while the best of orthodoxmedicine is reserved for the rich countries and the local urban elite. This has long been one of the arguments used against any sort of collaboration between biomedical andindigenous health practitioners in Africa (cf. Green 1994). Indeed, why not insist on expensive medicines for the poor as well? The answer to this is, certainly, weshould insist upon the best medicines for the poor, if we can find a way to pay for them. But keep in mind that ARVs are very expensive, even generic versions, and weare talking about providing them in countries that spend less than $10 per year per person on all of peoples' health care, from cradle to grave. Moreover, we ought not to de-value and dismiss indigenous medicines and locally avail- able therapies, without unbiased consideration of available evidence relating to their efficacy. Of course it would be optimal to find ways to pay for ARVs, distribute them equitably, and support self-reli- ant, community-based programs that rely on indigenousknowledge, technologies, and structures. Most of the ma- jor donor organizations seem focused solely on the23 former. The World Bank's Indigenous Knowledge for De- velopment Program is an exception, and therefore it has several pointers to offer about the many important thingsthat are needed in addition to ARVs. Even when ARVs become widely available, there will still be a need for sus- tainable, community-based programs of care, supportand treatment, which are based on natural products, in- digenous therapies, local organizations and flexible pay- ment systems of health financing. \"In many developing countries, the inadequacy of current health financing arrangements, typified byprogressively declining budgetary allocations and more cost sharing schemes have led to the explora- tion of additional and alternative approaches to im-prove the financing situation. Among the alternatives suggested are risk sharing mechanisms that include community-based schemes that tap thepotential of traditional social arrangements.\" 121 This dichotomy is imperfect because reduction in the number of sexual partners would have to be classified as risk reduction, not avoidance. 2 John Richens proposed the term primary behavior change to denote fundamental changes in sexual behavior, such as partner reduction or abstinence that do not rely on devices or drugs. 3 http://www.measuredhs.com/ 4 IK Notes 26, 54. 5 IK Notes 26.6 IK Notes 51 . 7 Ibid. 8 IK Notes 15 . 9 IK 35 . 10 IK Notes 30 . 11 IK Notes 35 ; the project has already started and is presently mid- term. 12 IK Notes 48 .246. Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods: Local Knowledge Innovations in Development John Aluma Agriculture probably comprises the largest collection of indigenous practices worldwide. Farmers and pastoralists grew crops and kept animals in the hu- mid, boreal, arid or temperate locations, developing production systems thatwere well adapted to these locations and the gradual development of these sys- tems to respond to changes in the environment. Many of these systems were sustainable only under \"low-input-low-output\" regimes. The introduction ofmechanization, fertilizers and phytomedicines has turned some of these sys- tems into high-input-high-output systems, most of which could only be sus- tained with external 1 support. However, a considerable number of these high-input systems were either not sustainable or did not produce the high outputs that were expected. While the political environment2 was often a factor constraining primary producers from capitalizing on these new systems, most commonly through market restrictions or land use rights, another common constraint was inap- propriate technology transfer. Examples include (a) the use of few cultivars fora variety of environments; (b) the introduction of tillage developed for temper- ate locations often resulting in loss of organic matter and erosion in humid or tropical soils; (c) disease- and pest-plagued plants and animal breeds that hadnot developed immunities or resistance. The modernization of agriculture and other land use changes have also brought about a reduction of genetic variability. Researchers and producersare counteracting this trend by re-introducing indigenous species back into the gene pool of domestic crops and livestock. While efforts in this direction are increasing, the funding available for research is minimal, given the lack ofresources for public agricultural research in general. 3However, an increasing number of national agricultural research institutions in developing countries include the study, development, and commercialization of indigenous knowl-edge-based production practices, especially plant products with a promising future for medicinal, nutraceutical or industrial use. 4 Clearly, the benefits of modernized agriculture and the green revolution are undisputable\u2014and without them, the world could hardly feed more than six billion people. However, evidence suggests that in the event of severe short- ages of the major staples, many communities in Africa revert as a short- termJohn Aluma is Deputy Director General of the National Agricultural ResearchOrganization, Uganda (NARO).25 survival mechanism to \"traditional\" plants and crops that have received but a fraction\u2014if at all\u2014of the re- search attention of the major crops. This indicates anunderutilized potential worth exploring, to raise the un- derstanding of communities' responses to livelihood chal- lenges. In this context, three major questions arise:\u007f In what ways have indigenous knowledge and practices and innovations enhanced livelihood in a manner that is ecologically sustainable, economically viable and so-cially acceptable, and more specifically, in what way has IK contributed to the three most important factors in food security: availability, access and utilization? \u007f Who are the drivers of IK innovation or adaptation? \u007f What are the circumstances that foster or constrain them, in support of or as challenges to the scaling-up ofsuccessful practices? The IK Notes in this collection demonstrate local ap- proaches that may provide some answers to these ques- tions. An overriding principle in indigenous responses to the challenges of rural life appears to be a comprehensiveapproach that extends beyond the \"purely technical.\" In- stead, the community approach is embedded in a general response to issues relating to poverty, household food andnutrition security, health, sustainable agriculture, off- farm employment, participation, social and human capi- tal formation, access to institutions and social networks,to name but a few. Reviving a traditional practice for better livelihoods in Mali The Jatropha Curcas Plant 5 Project in Mali promotes the production and processing of Jatropha (Physic Nut;Euphorbiaceae family). Growing the plant helps to con- trol erosion and to improve the soil in a semi-arid envi- ronment. Processing (extracting seeds) the Jatropharesults in income (especially for women) renewable en- ergy and contributes to poverty reduction. Jatropha, of Latin American origin, was originally introduced for pro-ducing lubricant oil. It is a drought-resistant perennial and can be used as a natural fence. Jatropha hedges pro- tect food crops and gardens from livestock and reduce soilerosion. The hedges also help to reduce conflicts between the farmers and livestock owners over animals causing crop damage. 6 The revival of the traditional practice by women who harvested the seeds for medical purposes and local soap production has led to profitable soap-making enterprises managed by women and a reduction of pov-erty. The press cake, which remains after oil extraction, is a high-grade organic fertilizer. Jatropha oil also works as a diesel fuel substitute for small engines that drive grainmills and water pumps. Initially, the German Technical Assistance (GTZ) sup- ported Jatropha cultivation activities within the frame-work of a renewable energy program, but after learning from communities, the project has now expanded into a comprehensive approach to agricultural development,environmental protection, income generation, and social cohesion. The team learned the following lessons. The approach: \u007f Builds on valuable, local IK practice \u007f Demonstrates multiple uses of the product (plant, seed- oil, erosion control, property delineation) \u007f Addresses immediate community concerns \u007f Encourages women's involvement in economic initia- tives and promotes home based industries \u007f Links ecological sustainability with economic develop- ment \u007f Encourages use of locally available raw material. While it is not very common for a single crop to have such a multiplicity of applications, 7 the use of Jatropha has had a significant impact on the livelihood prospects of the community involved; it has provided income for women and has helped to empower the communities. Driving the innovation In Honduras in 1999, the Association of Advisors for a Sustainable, Ecological and People-Centered Agriculture(COSECHA) decided to study farmers' innovations. It eventually documented 82 technologies developed by 52 farmers. 8 Those identified as worthy of further valida- tion and dissemination are shown in the next table. The numbers reflect the typical, primary biophysical constraints of small farmers in developing countries:pests, diseases and weeds. Hence, control practices con- tribute to more than half of the innovations. The study further noted that no innovations were made in areasthat researchers and scientists would have considered equally important, in this particular location: water har- vesting and management of tree crops. The study con-cludes that farmers made no efforts to innovate in technologies that they considered outside their scope of resources (water harvesting) or that would show onlylong-term effects (tree management).26Local Pathways to Global Development Supporting farmer experimenters and innovators The Government of Uttar Pradesh state in North India integrated indigenous knowledge into a World Bank-sup- ported Sodic Land Reclamation Project. Started in 1993,the project assisted farmers in reclaiming over 68,000 hectares of sodic soils. 9 Farmers in the Uttar Pradesh re- gion created local site implementation committees andself-help groups that worked in collaboration with project managers and non-governmental organizations in order to adapt indigenous knowledge and constantly innovatein order to develop locally appropriate strategies. The project strengthened local institutions, empowered the beneficiaries and developed a model for transferring ser-vice delivery to communities. Modern practices, such as the use of chemical fertiliz- ers, pesticides and new farming technologies promoted bythe government were combined with farmer developed indigenous technologies, such as the ap- plication of gypsum for land reclamation,the building of contour bunds, leaching the soil, multi-cropping, green manur- ing, crop rotation, natural compost andplowing the land. These indigenous prac- tices were cost-effective and environ- mentally friendly. As a result, farmers have reclaimed land belonging to 247,000 families, crop- ping intensity has increased from 37 per-cent to 200 percent, crop yields and farmer incomes have risen by 60 percent over five years, and land values havequadrupled. Indirect results include thegeneration of income for women's self-help groups through diversified activities, such as poultry farming and horticulture and labor wage rates have doubled be-cause of increased economic activities in the area. The most important impact on mainstreaming and scaling-up the activities derives from a farmers' school, where farm-ers themselves teach and develop the curriculum jointly with the instructors to maintain and further develop lo- cal knowledge innovations. Rural development, food security and indigenous knowledge These and other examples in the IK Notes 10 that reflect on agriculture, food security and rural development re- spond to the three questions raised in the introduction tothis article: the contribution of IK to food security and rural livelihoods, drivers of the rural innovation process and enabling conditions. The contribution that indigenous knowledge and farm- ers' innovation make in the context of food security can- not be underestimated. The table below presents themajor issues of food security\u2014availability, access and uti- lization\u2014and their constituent factors to which IK could contribute. The IK Notes discussions on agriculture and food secu- rity\u2014or rural livelihoods as a whole\u2014reveal that the pri- mary drivers for local change are a deteriorating naturalresource base (loss of natural habitat, deforestation, soil degradation) ), declining agriculture productivity, loss of indigenous cultivation practices, and conflicts over accessto and the utilization of natural resources. Ecological sustainability of the improved practices has been at the center of many innovations.Farmer innovations in local technologies in Honduras (1999) Technology category Number of technologies Insect control 15 Fertilization 10 Control of plant disease 8 Weed control 2 Food preparation 2 Animal husbandry 2 Plant propagation 1 Green manuring 1 Soil conservation 1 Others 3 Total 45 Food security issue Possible role/contribution of IK Availability increased and/ or sustainable production11 technology12 better storage facilities and reduced losses13 Access stability of production (ecologically sound production) 14 markets, services, information, rights, social entitlements15 purchasing power 16 Utilization consumption17 hygiene, water, sanitation, food safety, quality18 childcare, feeding practices, preparation, habits, intra- household distribution19 Frame conditions research20 food emergency preparedness21 physical health of consumers and producers22 27 While the cited examples do not allow for an assess- ment of the long-term impact of IK on livelihoods, imme- diate and mid-term effects are apparent in all cases. Thedrivers of innovations and change are mostly individuals, often acting in or through groups (women, youth, farm- ers, participants of an adult literacy training, and soforth) established through a common concern or interest, rather than formal structure. In most instances, the \"in- novators\" have had contact with \"global knowledge\" tothe extent that they could also better appreciate the knowledge and experience available within their own en- vironment and realize the potential ofchange from within. This finding is im- portant for the role of external agents, such as donors, agricultural research, andextension and other actors in the rural space with a mandate to assist communi- ties to improve their livelihoods. Whilemany of these institutions have changed their roles from being delivery systems of centrally formulated recommendations topartners of communities, understanding or valuing indigenous knowledge is often not part of their mandate. An environment that is conducive to the valuation and promotion of indig-enous knowledge practices not only en- ables institutions to utilize IK in a more rational and efficient manner, it also sig-nals to the communities that their contri- butions to science and technology are valuable, possibly inducing more innova-tive creativity. For example, the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) in Uganda has recently devel-oped an approach to incorporate indig- enous knowledge into its activities in support of the National Program to Mod-ernize Agriculture. By adapting a simple, yet effective decision flow matrix, indig- enous practices are screened and eitherdisseminated subjected to further studies or rejected. Based on this matrix, the or- ganization can decide quickly where to al-locate resources, where to link with outreach and where to advise against un- desirable indigenous practices. The approach of NARO (in conjunction with other actors in Uganda) has initiated a process in Uganda that fosters thestudy and use of indigenous knowledge and innovations and their eventual scale-up. In the context of a national strategy for the sustainable development of IK and its in-tegration into the national poverty eradication process, Uganda provides a framework in which practitioners, as well as researchers are encouraged to promote the useand the dissemination of indigenous practices. At the same time, legislation has been drafted that looks to pro- tect the innovators of indigenous knowledge. Identify problem Define the action Does IK related to problem exist?

Researchersand practitioners are continuously refining these tech- nologies. To explore and utilize indigenous knowledge to improve on these technologies, researchers and otherstakeholders need to go one step further towards indig- enous knowledge. Researchers and policy makers need to understand better that livelihood practices are not justthe manifestation of culture. Instead, there is a need to appreciate that indigenous practices are the outcome of \"trial and error\" research undertaken (and ongoing) bygenerations of practitioners in an environment that is not standardized. These indigenous practitioners largely chose not to protocol their results and have, for a varietyof causes, omitted to share them across communities and borders in a systematic manner. Agricultural research and rural development face two, essentially contradicting, requirements when confronted with the challenge of incorporating indigenous knowl- edge. Many of the bearers of indigenous knowledge be-long to the elder generation and will take their knowledge with them once they pass away. At the same time, demands to contribute to poverty reduction andfood emergency prevention often require large-scale solu- tions. Many of the IK practices are localized and cannot be scaled up easily before one is reasonably certain thatthey will work. Hence, research will be faced with the de- cision to document as many practices as possible or se- lect, at the risk of missing \"the best,\" a limited number ofpractices, breeds or stock for dissemination and scale up. Nevertheless, successful scale-up is possible (for example, Kenya is developing a few medicinal and aromatic plantsfor commercial and industrial use), especially where the private sector can play a role in providing the required investments. However, for many rarely or underutilizedcrops and vegetables, 23 this may not be sufficient to save them from vanishing from the menu.Communities widen the knowledge base Transport and telecommunication infrastructure are gradually reaching even remote communities in rural Af-rica. This provides opportunities for them to start shar- ing their problems, experiences, and solutions with other communities and jointly developing their own knowledgebase. In South Africa, a group of Rooibos tea-growing farmers visited another community to learn about mar- keting. Following the exchange the group formed a farm-ers' association, improved its marketing system, and is now exporting the tea to Europe, multiplying its income. Practitioners from East Africa and South Asia met in aregional exchange to learn from each other about the con- servation and production of medicinal plants. 24 Re- searchers, extension agents and other rural serviceproviders can help communities to find matches for ex- changes, research can broker collaboration between prac- titioners, accompany farmer-led experimentation andsupport communication beyond the physical exchange. The following example demonstrates how communities document their own knowledge and how informationtechnology has helped communities to share experiences. The Uluguru Mountains Agricultural Development Project (UMADEP) in Tanzania is designed to involve lo-cal farmers in the documentation of local knowledge re- lated to Natural Crop Protection (NCP). Farmers then spread this knowledge to their peers in the area using ap-pealing and locally relevant education materials and training workshops. 25 This approach involves the local community throughout the process of collection of theknowledge, documentation, and dissemination. Conclusion The IK Notes examples discussed above suggest that ru- ral communities are acutely aware of their livelihood is- sues. They adapt indigenous knowledge in order to transform traditional institutions and generate resourcesrequired for addressing community-specific problems. Governments and development partners can play a vital role to help set up mechanisms for documentation, vali-dation, dissemination, exchange, and integration into the national development process. Finally, such institutional and financial support provided by the government anddevelopment agencies that foster locally defined liveli- hood efforts of communities are likely to result in mul- tiple positive outcomes.29 1 External not in the sense of foreign development assistance but external to the local production system, e.g., mineral fertilizer rather than organic fertilizer produced on the farm. 2 Enabling policies address more than the technologies and econom- ics of food production\u2014whether at subsistence or commercial level. Other issues include buffer stocks, food aid and foodprices, research, extension and responding to the challenges of globalization of food technology, trade and competitiveness and the market distortions created by subsidies in industrializedcountries. 3 \" It is notable, for example, that Monsanto, a life-sciences multina- tional based in St Louis, Missouri, has a research and developmentbudget that is more than twice the R&D budget of the entire worldwide network of public-sector tropical research institutes\" J.

Local communities have adapted the plant to a variety of uses, including ornamental ones. 7 Reportedly, the plant with the highest number of uses is the coconut tree which provides for nutrition, health, shelter, transport, art, fiber, to name but a few. Yet, as with so many other crops, research into coconut has concentrated on its primary product, i.e.,fat; this is where the coconut faces the toughest competition of all its uses from other crops.8 IK Notes 49 . 9 IK Notes 48 . 10 IK Notes 2, 4, 24, 43, 44, 44, 45, 49. 11 IK Notes 2, 4, 44, 45, 58. 12 IK Notes 23, 24, 43, 47, 58. 13 IK Notes 47. 14 IK Notes 2, 8. 15 IK Notes 9, 15, 19, 23, 27, 28, 34, 43, 57, 58. 16 IK Notes 6. 17 IK Notes 47. 18 IK Notes 44, 47, 52 . 19 IK Notes 36 . 20 IK Notes 14, 36, 39, 49, 54 . 21 IK Notes 39, 44. 22 IK Notes 15, 26, 30, 32, 35,37, 41, 51, 52, 54. 23 As described in IK Notes 44 , there are quite a variety of rarely used, often not domesticated plants used in emergency situations. These plants are underutilized and under-researched. While during\"normal\" periods, people have clear preferences for the major staple crops, these \"reserve\" plants may have properties that could be exploited further. 24 IK Notes 55 . 25 IK Notes 34 .307. Indigenous Knowledge and Natural Resource Management Achim SteinerGonzalo Oviedo Achim Steiner is Director General of IUCN\u2014The World ConservationUnion, Gland, Switzerland. Gonzalo Oviedo is Senior Adviser for Social Policy of IUCN. Information forthis article has been contributed byIUCN's Regional Office for SouthernAfrica (ROSA).To judge from the breadth of issues that IK Notes cover, the importance of indigenous knowledge for development and the environment is now increas- ingly acknowledged by researchers and practitioners. Research and practicalexperience from all over the world, and perhaps most notably from Africa, show that indigenous knowledge has not only been a key factor in the develop- ment of local cultures and in their continued adjustment to modifications intheir environments, but also an increasingly important contribution to actions undertaken outside the local community realm. The establishment of the Indigenous Knowledge Program by the World Bank in 1998 was a welcome enterprise for IUCN\u2014The World Conservation Union, which had started working on indigenous knowledge in Southern Af- rica in the early 1990s. Today, IUCN continues working on indigenous ecologi-cal knowledge issues in that region, through its Regional Office for Southern Africa, as well as globally, and has firmly integrated topics relating to the knowledge of indigenous peoples and local communities in its global program. Africa is a continent rich in natural resources, such as forests, wetlands, wildlife, minerals, fisheries, and many others. Effective systems of manage- ment can ensure that these resources not only survive, but also in fact in-crease while being used rationally, thus providing the foundation for sustainable development and for a stable national economy. Natural resources have for centuries been an important part of peoples' diet, economy, and culture. For people living in or near forests, plants and animals provided food, medicine, hides, building materials, incomes, and a source of inspiration. Rivers provided transportation and fish, and water and soils pro-vided a permanent source of sustenance. It is well documented that traditional communities derive both their socio- cultural and spiritual identity from the land. The respect for the land wasbuilt into the use of the land. Indigenous practice was based on a sense of har- mony with the natural environment, which resulted in sustainable practice and sustainable use. The traditional use of natural resources was based on tra-ditional values. In many developing countries, the use of natural resources such as wildlife, is necessary for the well-being of their people. For centuries, their way of life31 has comprised mechanisms of conserving or ensuring sustainable utilization of such resources through a sys-tem of values and taboos. (See box.) For instance, in Barotseland in the Upper Zambezi Val- ley in central Southern Africa, it was a serious offence tokill a fertile female animal. The killing of animals was re- stricted to male and older animals. Certain animal spe- cies could not be hunted during certain seasons (such asthe breeding season), avoiding the risk of depleting the resources. This system is similar to the culling practice for the sustainable \"harvesting\" of wildlife. The commu-nities were able to ensure continued population growth of their wildlife resources, while at the same time benefiting from the protein, which was usually lacking in environ-ments, where livestock keeping was difficult because of tsetse flies. Both the Barotse people and the Bemba of Luapula Province of Zambia had a tradition of avoiding the catch- ing of very small fish. Communities observed fishing sea- sons usually through a set of traditional ceremonies.Such a ceremony would usually open the fishing season for a given period. These practices ensured that sustain- able resource exploitation.In these societies a fairer distribution of income was possible, both at the inter-generational and intra-genera- tional levels, because the communities themselves re-spected the temporal dimensions of the exploitation of these resources. The resources belonged to the communi- ties, and thus they exploited them keeping in mind theinterests of future generations. Under traditional re- source management regimes, redistribution was an ac- cepted practice. Communities usually passed on their indigenous knowledge of resource management to the next genera- tion through oral transmission. The continued existenceof such systems depended heavily on the passing down of this knowledge. Hence, the continuity and transmission of that knowledge and its associated culture from onegeneration to another, and its more effective distillation into practical applications that are socially and economi- cally beneficial, are critical factors in the survival and dy-namics of the culture. In the absence of economic benefits and incentives as- sociated with traditional practices, some forms of devel-opment and exploitation will lead to a loss of knowledge and sustainable practices. The 'chitemene' system of cul- tivation is an example of an indigenous knowledge sys-tem in danger of disappearing. This is because the local communities of Northern, Luapula, North-Western and Central Provinces of Zambia who practice 'chitemene'have no incentives to do so any longer. The Forest Act set aside large tracts of land as forest lands, reserved and closed to local communities. It further took steps to stopor discourage chitemene cultivation, which government specialists considered a simple slash-and-burn technique. However, chitemene was critical to traditional subsis-tence farming that has been sustainable for centuries. Today, a combination of population pressure and shrinking land availability due to public restrictions onland use reduces the effectiveness of the chitemene sys- tem by shortening the fallow cycles. Villages used to clear only mature vegetation before planting; now successionvegetation will be cleared after only five or ten years. For- merly, the diversity of crops cultivated reduced the risk of total crop failure and the ample variety of foods enrichedthe diet. Intercropping and land rotation prevented land degradation and increased productivity. Now, the prevail- ing commercial farming, as promoted by some public poli-cies, is causing the collapse of the traditional systems. This leads to erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge in the area.Sustainable wildlife management In Barotseland in the Upper Zambezi Valley in cen- tral Southern Africa, it was a serious offence to kill a fertile female animal. The killing of animals was re-stricted to male and older animals. Certain animal species could not be hunted during certain seasons (such as the breeding season), avoiding the risk of de-pleting the resources. This system is similar to the culling practice for the sustainable \"harvesting\" of wildlife. The communities were able to ensure contin-ued population growth of their wildlife resources, while at the same time benefiting from the protein, which was usually lacking in environments, wherelivestock keeping was difficult because of tsetse flies. Both the Barotse people and the Bemba of Luapula Province of Zambia had a tradition of avoiding thecatching of very small fish. Communities observed fishing seasons usually through a set of traditional ceremonies. Such a ceremony would usually open thefishing season for a given period. These practices en- sured that sustainable resource exploitation.32Local Pathways to Global Development IK and the spiritual element Nearly half of the IK Notes that relate to natural re- sources indicate that spirituality has a strong influenceon their management. 1 The traditional water conserva- tion practice in Forikrom, Ghana, where the regulation of water access and use is based on spirituality is one suchcase. 2 For many local communities, the planet and its re- sources are considered sacred and deserve utmost re- spect. This often leads to management systems forcrucial and fragile natural resources that are based on spiritual norms and institutions. One of the most interesting institutions derived from traditional knowledge and practices is the establishment of sacred natural sites. Taboos and indigenous manage- ment codes commonly restrict access to these sites to par-ticular activities and members of a community. Many sacred sites have survived for hundreds of years and act thus as important biodiversity reservoirs. Sacred naturalsites also contribute to forming an ethnic identity and play a key role in local communities' culture and lifestyles. However, state and conservation agencies, policies and laws have overlooked and undervalued the contribution of sacred sites to conservation. While community-basedcontrols once helped protect sacred natural sites, today rural communities are increasingly vulnerable to politi- cal and economic pressures beyond their control. Withoutsecurity of tenure and active participation in decisions that affect them and their land use, it is impossible for local communities to protect their lands and resources ef-fectively. Integrating IK into changing environments One of the most interesting aspects brought out by IK Notes in several areas related to natural resource man- agement is the application of IK in conditions of social, economic, and cultural change. Success stories regardingthe application of indigenous knowledge to solving con- crete environmental challenges point to the following fac- tors that characterize the role of IK:\u007f Some elements of indigenous knowledge as preserved by elders and traditional institutions, sometimes linked to spirituality, have worked successfully for a long pe-riod of time. 3 \u007f External and internal factors have led progressively to the erosion of indigenous knowledge and practices; newneeds have emerged putting pressure on traditionalmanagement systems; availability of lands and re- sources shrank due to population dynamics and compe- tition with other users, 4 which often resulted in a reduction of the livelihood supporting role of the natu- ral environment for the communities. In many in- stances, this has pushed communities into situations ofconflict and resulted in the breakdown of traditional institutions. 5 \u007f Emerging forces\u2014such as youth and empowered women groups, with the help of external catalysts\u2014 bring in new knowledge and practices through organi- zational approaches that go beyond traditionalinstitutions. 6 \u007f These emerging forces strive to achieve a fundamental objective: turning indigenous knowledge and tradi-tional rules into legal institutions that the government and the broader society accept. 7 The IK Notes thus communicate a lesson that is worth reflecting about. For indigenous knowledge to survive as a vital element of the community life and livelihood strat-egy, it has to be put into the context of contemporary so- cial, economic and cultural change, and has to endure the test of adapting to the new conditions. For this to happensuccessfully, two approaches seem to be critical: \u007f The combination of indigenous knowledge with formal science, interacting on an equal footing at the communitylevel and acting on the principle of mutual support. \u007f The amalgamation of traditional .practices and institu- tions with formal regulations and structures, so as toprovide renewed stronger foundations to indigenous knowledge while making the larger society aware of its values and contributions. \"The challenge... is how toblend traditional systems of regulation, myth, and ritual with a necessary administrative armature to build new communally shared meanings and a new cul-ture of natural resource management.\" 8 IK in perspective There are many ironies in the history of indigenous knowledge in the contemporary world. One of them is that centuries ago communities created protected or natural areas subject to strict regulations to keep themundisturbed based on sacredness and spirituality. In modern times, protected areas created under the secular model of the Yellowstone Park in the United States oftenoverlap with the lands and resources of traditional com- munities. Yet, regulations often deny the traditional com-33 munities inhabiting them the rights of use or access to lands and resources, and sometimes even expel or treat them as intruders. Fortunately, today the world recog-nizes the need to change protected area policies and prac- tices to give due consideration to the needs and rights of local communities. This includes the revaluing of theirindigenous knowledge and its integration into protected areas management. 9 Another irony, with equally or perhaps more dire conse- quences, is the fact that indigenous knowledge\u2014often stigmatized as ignorance and superstition\u2014has helped to bring about many of the great fortunes of the biotechno-logical industry. The pharmaceutical industry, for ex- ample, has produced medicines for global markets from plants and animals of traditional medicinal value to localcommunities. The same can be said about the food indus- try. Traditional healers and local communities providing that knowledge have rarely ever received any adequatecompensation from these industries. At the same time, such communities have become poorer. The Biodiversity Convention initiated a debate and ac- tion on the issues related to the wider application of in- digenous or traditional knowledge beyond local communities. Governments and civil society are calledupon to address questions such as: Who should primarily benefit from it? Should commercial or non-commercial uses be stressed? What is the role of governments? It isnot the intention of this article to debate such issues in detail. We believe in the usefulness and value of indig- enous knowledge for natural resource management, andthus maintain that its wider application would be of great benefit to the entire world; but equity and justice are cor- nerstones in dealing with this issue.A final point of this article is the great challenge of pre- serving indigenous knowledge. In the presence of massive and increasingly aggressive forces of cultural change, in-digenous knowledge faces enormous risks. Indigenous knowledge, as stressed in the definition provided by the Indigenous Knowledge for Development Program andthe experiences recorded in the IK Notes , is largely uncodified, tacit, and transmitted orally or by example. Nowadays, knowledge that is based exclusively on thesefeatures does not have guaranteed survival. In a few de- cades, perhaps most of the indigenous knowledge of the world will be lost, unless it is strengthened in a way thatcan endure the challenges of cultural change. This re- quires great innovation, creative measures that take ac- count of communities' needs and rights, and strongcommitment from all relevant institutions\u2014educational, environmental, development cooperation, and finance. Guided by its own policies, perspective, and mission, IUCN is firmly committed to supporting the preserva- tion, revitalization, and application of indigenous knowl- edge to biodiversity conservation, and sustainable use,within a framework of equity and respect for cultural di- versity, as mandated by its Congress. To this end, IUCN works together with local communities and their institu-tions, and builds partnerships with relevant global and national actors. We still have the opportunity to save one of the greatest bodies of the intellectual production of humankind\u2014one that may have embedded in it the solutions to many prob- lems of the present and the future of the planet. We allmust commit to doing it. 1 IK Notes 4, 46, 48. 2 IK Notes 4 . 3 IK Notes 4, 46, 48 . 4 IK Notes 23, 46, 48. 5 IK Notes 23, 45. 6 It could be youth associations working on environmental issues, such as the \"Mobisquad\" in Forikrom, ( IK Notes 4 ) or women's groups such as the Association of Women of Popenguine for theProtection of the Environment in Senegal (IK Notes 8 ), or producer committees such Mussel Rocks ManagementCommittee of Zimelene, Mozambique ( IK Notes 46 ). 7 This often involves lengthy, complex, and sometimes painful dealings and negotiations with authorities, which unfortunatelyare not always ready to listen to the voice of the communities. 8 IK Notes 46 . 9 This was a strong message given by the IUCN-organized Vth World Protected Areas Congress in 2003, held in Durban, SouthAfrica, in September 2003. A ten-yearly event, the WorldProtected Areas Congress brings together organizations andexperts to share their experiences and recommend approachesand actions to strengthen the role of protected areas inconserving biodiversity.348. Indigenous Knowledge and Science Sibusiso Sibisi Dr. Sibusiso Sibisi is President and of the Council for Scientific and Indus-trial Researh (CSIR), South Africa.Indigenous knowledge is today considered relevant in the social and human development domains. Its contribution to science and technology is often un- derestimated or not known. For example, the Maasai pastoralists actively im-munized their herds by inoculating healthy animals with saliva froth of freshly diseased ones. Similar was the practice of English midwives, who stored molding bread with their delivery utensils and cloths. Yet, Pasteur re-ceived recognition for pioneering vaccination and Fleming for the discovery of penicillin. For centuries, local communities have relied on their indigenous knowledge and expertise to cope with the challenges posed by harsh environments: ex- tended droughts, flash floods, epidemic pests, or infertile soils. Farmers have developed their own systems of weather forecasting by observing cloud forma-tions, bird migration patterns, seasonal winds and other seasonal or a-sea- sonal factors, or worked out complex, sustainable land use systems. In this sense, IK has evolved into a science and technology of its own, with farmersand communities performing as scientists and innovators\u2014observing, draw- ing conclusions, and taking action. In Burkina Faso, meteorologists and farm- ers now work together to forecast weather. 1 Modern science and technology has helped increase food security and agri- cultural production globally through the propagation of high yielding varieties (HYV). Occasionally, these HYV were more appropriately described as highresponse varieties: they perform to their full potential only when sufficient nutrients and water are available and pests, diseases, and weeds are under control. In many locations, this required the establishment of efficient and ef-fective systems for input supply, irrigation, extension services, and down- stream arrangements such as marketing and processing. The failure to establish these institutions made the Green Revolution much less successfulin Africa than in Asia. Indiscriminate use of fertilizer and pesticides also caused environmental and health hazards. Agricultural research and industry responded with the development of less demanding varieties, often relying ongenetic stock developed by farmers over generations into \"land races.\" However, many farmers responded as well. They reverted to their indig- enous knowledge and practices. To prevent soil erosion in Burkina Faso, they35 used the old Za\u00ef (demi-lunes) technology or built ridges. In Northern Tanzania and Kenya, small holders returned to agroforestry, a complex system of a highly interwovenand interdependent mix of annual and perennial plants that international research only now begins to under- stand fully. While these systems did not provide the sameyields of a single crop under high external input regimes, they were much less risky, better adapted to local condi- tions, and usually more sustainable. In Malawi, old andnew technologies related to sanitation, soil fertility, and education are combined for the development of an agenda for researchers and communities. 2 In Latin America, farmers have demonstrated their ability to innovate in the context of participatory technology development ac- tivities.3 The Honey Bee Network in India supports local innovators and promotes their inventions. Health care is another area where indigenous knowl- edge substitutes for modern yet inaccessible orunaffordable drugs or healthcare. In Africa, most people have only limited access to modern drugs and the ratio of traditional healers to modern doctors is over eighty toone. As a result, traditional medicine still contributes substantially to primary healthcare and many traditional healers have developed cures for many common diseases. The world knows about the high incidence of HIV/ AIDS in Africa. Little is known about how traditional healers have developed treatments for the opportunisticdiseases of HIV/AIDS. 4 The Tanga AIDS Working Group in Tanzania (TAWG)\u2014a consortium of traditional heal- ers, modern doctors, nurses, and people living withAIDS\u2014has treated over 4,000 patients with herbs pre- scribed by local healers. The treatment has enabled pa- tients to resume their daily lives, which have beenprolonged by five to ten years. TAWG has developed a wealth of information on plant collection and prepara- tion, methods of preparation, treatments, and indicatorsof efficacy. Challenges of modern science The above examples illustrate the richness of indigenous knowledge systems and their contribution to science and technology. The basics of astronomy, pharmacology, and even mathematics, food technology or metallurgy derivefrom traditional knowledge and practices. But the un- precedented progress of science and technology over the last 100 years has created an implicit bias that considersany practice, not developed in a scientific laboratory or a corporate research and development (R&D) department,to be of lower value or quality, and attributes technologi- cal achievements or inventions to formally educated re- searchers and engineers. Learning from indigenousknowledge is still the exception rather than the rule. Scientific validation Indigenous knowledge and modern science can comple- ment each other in many ways, as has been demonstratedin the case of agriculture and healthcare. However, scien- tific validation remains a critical challenge for indigenous knowledge practitioners. Health regulations and re-search protocols require that treatments in medicine or processes in other disciplines are clearly described and subjected to critical analysis and that they reproduce rep-licable results. They are expected to provide documented evidence of the efficacy of their claims in academic jour- nals. However, much of indigenous knowledge is rootedin oral traditions and is not systematically documented in written form (with some notable exceptions of traditional medicine from India and China). Indigenous knowledge islargely held in the custody of the elders in a community and usually not shared across communities. As a growing number of local languages are disappearing so may a vastbody of knowledge and culture. Hence, the challenge for modern scientists and traditional practitioners is to bridge the gap between their worlds of different method-ologies, knowledge exchange, verification and validation and, eventually, applications. For this to happen, the science and research communi- ties (and their associated industries) need to develop stra- tegic partnerships between scientists and IK practitioners. This calls for an open mind and the willing-ness on both sides to learn from each other. Scientists need to understand and accept the context specificity of IK, and IK practitioners need to understand and acceptthat knowledge sharing and critique are essential prereq- uisites for the maintenance and development of any knowledge. Efforts are also needed to enhance the capacity of IK practitioners to document their work systematically to enable them to withstand the scrutiny of modern science.This requires resources and technical assistance from the scientific community and international organizations. Iin this context, the World Bank's Indigenous KnowledgeProgram organized a workshop, bringing together devel- opment practitioners from East Africa, scientists from the US National Institutes of Health, George WashingtonUniversity Hospital, and Bank staff. The focus was on36Local Pathways to Global Development learning from traditional health practices in Africa. The main outcome was an agreement between the partici- pants to work together on validating herbal treatments ofHIV/AIDS-related opportunistic infections. In South Africa, research organizations such as the Medical Research Centre (MRC) and the Council for Sci-entific and Industrial Research (CSIR) are, with govern- ment support, making inroads into the scientific validation of traditional medicines. The CSIR'sBioprospecting Programme, formed in 1988, focuses its efforts on the transformation of African Traditional Medicines into minimally processed, scientifically vali-dated herbal medicines; the discovery of new pharmaceu- tically active ingredients; and the establishment of community-based agro-processing businesses for the pro-duction of medicinal and aromatic crops. Intellectual property rights Science thrives on a cycle of verification, falsification, im- proved models and experimental verification, in an envi-ronment of global sharing and critique, allowing for substantial progress of knowledge including paradigm changes. Today, technology (and innovation) thrives onthe protection of property rights, at least during the ini- tial years of production. Traditional practitioners espe- cially in the health sector prefer sharing their knowledgewithin their families, producing only incremental im- provements of knowledge and practices. When tradi- tional practitioners will be invited to the global sharingand exchange of knowledge, they will also need some pro- tection that avoids depriving them of their livelihoods. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has collaborated with other UN agencies to address this challenge of intellectual property rights (IPR) for tradi- tional knowledge holders. 5 In 1992, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) aimed to address these issues by acknowledging the value of indigenous knowledge and resources. It established a framework for providing ac-cess to genetic resources and a means for fair and equi- table benefit sharing. 6 Two years later, the WTO's Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreementcame into force and created an international standard for minimum IPR protection. WIPO has begun to provide training to IP offices, gov- ernments, NGOs, and communities at the grass roots level to increase the understanding of the role of IPRs in the protection of traditional knowledge. Creating newstandards for documentation would provide a frameworkto help manage IPR implications in the IK documenta- tion process. This will enable national IP offices to inte- grate the IK documentation into their existingprocedures for conducting prior art searches to examine applications for patents related to IK-based inventions. 7 Innovative approaches to protect IK are necessary be- cause existing arrangements may not be applicable to the specifics of IK. The normal criteria for patenting a pro- cess do not exist with IK: traditional knowledge is pre-served through oral tradition and demonstration rather than documentation. Some initiatives may help, such as encouraging local communities to register traditionalpractices. Other evolving forms of protection of IK in- clude Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs), involving the provision of material (resources or information) inexchange for monetary or non-monetary benefits. Ex- amples of fair and equitable benefit sharing between us- ers and custodians of traditional knowledge can be foundin several countries today. 8 According to a recent report by WIPO,9 \"indigenous people possess their own locally specific systems of juris-prudence with respect to the classification of different types of knowledge, proper procedures for acquiring and sharing knowledge, and the rights and responsibilities at-tached to possessing knowledge, all of which are embed- ded uniquely in each culture and its languages.\" Therefore, the scientific community needs to study andunderstand these indigenous protocols governing their knowledge systems, and give them due recognition and respect. However, while protection of IPR may be a necessary condition for addressing the valuation and validation of IK, it is not sufficient. Much of indigenous knowledge andpractices is in the public domain (for example in agricul- ture). The establishment of IPR will not prevent infringe- ments, and traditional practitioners or local communitiescommonly have no means for legal recourse. As with modern medicine, only the establishment of own stan- dards of efficacy and efficiency (and in the case of medi-cine, safety) and agreed protocols for practicing and professional ethics will help to validate and value tradi- tional practitioners. These standards do not need to be inopposition to\u2014or total compliance with\u2014those of mod- ern science. In developing these standards, traditional practitioners should be encouraged (and assisted) to carry out their own, more systematic research. Often, local communities do not have access to laboratories and technical expertiseto conduct research. The institutions that exist in devel- oping countries are frequently under-funded and under-37 resourced. To encourage the discovery of new drugs de- rived from IK and reward its custodians, developed coun- try research institutions should engage in twinningarrangements with research institutions in least devel- oped countries. This would help to enhance research ca- pacity of traditional practitioners as well as the researchand development (R&D) capacity of national drug labora- tories to undertake clinical trials on herbal treatments derived from IK. A partnership could develop betweenthe local healers and scientists to share their knowledge of medicinal plants and the subsequent economic gains derived from marketed products. Several research facul-ties in industrialized countries offer exchange programs and fellowships to experts from developing countries to learn about their advanced technologies and in turnshare their indigenous knowledge and expertise. This is another way to bridge the gap between traditional and modern science. To support these efforts to scale up the science of IK, it is also critical that governments develop national strate- gies in support of studying and developing IK. The minis-tries of health and agriculture, for instance, could take the lead in assessing the role of IK in furthering their de- velopment objectives. In Uganda, for example, the Na-tional Commission for Science and Technology (UNCST) has begun to champion IK into its research priorities. At the policy level, it has integrated IK into the country'sPoverty Eradication Action Program (PEAP). A case study, which represents an impressive approach that could serve as a model for similar types of partner-ships built around the scale-up and protection of IKS sys- tems to enrich the development process, has unfolded in South Africa in recent years. A CSIR-patented pharmaceutical formulation for obe- sity control generated worldwide attention in recent years. The story of P57\u2014as this natural anti-obesityagent was dubbed\u2014and its invention has its roots in in- digenous plants, which have formed part of the diet of communities in rural South Africa for centuries. During the early 1960s, an investigation was launched to determine the nutritional value and also any possible long-term toxic effect of \"food from the veld.\" The Na-tional Food Research Institute of CSIR, one of the insti- tutes now incorporated into CSIR Bio/Chemtek, led this investigation. The genus hoodia was studied because certain species of this succulent plant were known to be consumed by the San as a substitute for food and water. Following six yearsof attempts to isolate and identify the chemical substance responsible for the anorectic effect of extracts of thehoodia plant, the project was moth-balled because the repertoire of chromatographic and spectroscopic tech- niques available to chemists and biochemists, simply wasnot sufficient. During 1983, twenty years after the P57 research started at CSIR, the organization acquired state-of-the-art nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry for the identification of chemical structures of complex natural products and the investigation was re-launched. As a re-sult, a new chemical entity was discovered, representing a family of molecules not known before to have anorectic properties. Other milestones followed: The CSIR patented P57 in 1996, and in 1997 licensed Phytopharm plc, a listed UK company, to undertake the further development and com-mercialization of the patented discovery. In its attempts to commercialize P57, Phytopharm signed a licensing agreement with Pfizer Inc. in 1998. With commercializa-tion a real possibility, the CSIR took up discussion with the San people in 2002, publicly acknowledging the im- portance of the traditional knowledge of the San in thiscase study. A Memorandum of Agreement around the sharing of potential benefits was signed by the CSIR and the South African San Council in March 2003, with theCSIR committing to paying the San 8 percent of all mile- stone payments it receives from its licensee, UK-based Phytopharm, as well as 6 percent of all royalties that theCSIR receives once the drug is commercially available. This benefit-sharing model ensures that the San will re- ceive equitable benefits if the drug is successfully com-mercialized. While Pfizer has since reverted its rights to Phytopharm and endeavors to take P57 to market con-tinue, South Africa has already benefited in terms of the transfer of world-class drug development technology to South Africa. The CSIR is equipped to collect, extract,and screen plant samples from the country's 24,000 in- digenous plant species. Working relationships and formal agreements with traditional healers and communities arein place and will be key in future successes from the coop- eration between science and indigenous knowledge. The CSIR, South Africa is a leading center of excellence in science and technology in Africa. Over the past three decades it has been working together with the San people to develop a model framework to address the twin chal-lenges of scientific validation and IPR identified earlier. This case study represents an impressive approach that could serve as a model for similar types of partnershipsbuilt around the scale up and protection of IK systems to enrich the development process.38Local Pathways to Global Development Conclusion The question raised in the title of this article can be an- swered with an emphatic plea for concurrence. Knowl-edge grows only when shared, applied, and challenged. The world today cannot afford to omit the abundant body of indigenous knowledge to address its problems as ex-pressed in the Millennium Development Goals. Conflict and contradictions between the different \"knowledge worlds\" will vanish once the gap between traditional andmodern scientists and practitioners can be closed through mutual acceptance of standards, continuous ex- change, protection of rights, and recognition and rewardfor contributors. This will also provide the basis for an intrinsic abolishment of harmful indigenous practices that have had their share in discrediting traditional cul-tures and practitioners.1 IK Notes 39 . 2 IK Notes .

Indigenous Approaches to Conflict Resolution in Africa Fred Ben-Mensah Fred Ben-Mensah is Assistant Professor of International Relations,Howard University, Washington.The validity, appropriateness, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of indigenous1 solutions for local problems are the themes of this compilation of sixty IK Notes . What has been proven valid for the areas of education, agricul- ture and natural resource management, and health holds true for conflict resolution systems in Africa.2 The futility of efforts to resolve conflicts in Af- rica at the national level has been the primary reason for the extensive in-volvement of regional organizations, private military companies, nongovernmental organizations, and the United Nations, though with limited success. Modern conflict resolution principles and methods are generally notcontinuations or adaptations of those of its indigenous populations. 3 There is a perceived gap or \"disconnect\" between modern and indigenous conflict reso- lution philosophies and practices. Chances for peaceful resolution of Africa'sconflicts can be enhanced considerably if the region's indigenous principles, skills, and methods of conflict resolution are understood and harmonized with those of the modern nation-state. The IK Notes in this publication touch on a crucial aspect of indigenous Afri- can conflict resolution systems, principles, procedures, reintegration of ex- combatants, and rehabilitation of war victims. Apart from the well-known conflicts, such as the civil wars in Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, and Senegal, most of Africa's conflicts are communal. They oc-cur in the hinterland and are rarely reported, though they contain the seeds of escalation. They claim thousands of lives, create internally displaced persons and refugees, and limit economic activity thus preventing a nation or commu-nity from extending its production-possibility frontiers. 4 A few key questions need to be addressed: What was the nature of conflicts in pre-colonial Africa? What systems of conflict resolution existed? How doconflicts in traditional Africa compare with those of the region's contemporary ones? In what way, if any, can an understanding of the indigenous conflict resolution approaches reduce present conflicts? Can common forms and spiritof indigenous conflict resolution be scaled up to develop a broader conflict resolution framework? Can indigenous methods be combined with modern and foreign methods? 5 Can the region develop an alternative dispute resolu-40Local Pathways to Global Development tion (ADR)6 system that will enable it to cope with its ever-increasing and apparently intractable conflicts? Conflict in traditional Africa A significant part of anthropological research in Africa places emphasis on the consensus model in which com- munities are seen to be coherent, self-contained systemsin which economic, political, social, and religious prac- tices complement and reinforce one another in a well-or- dered and harmonious fashion. Interests that woulddevelop from, e.g., marriage or economic cooperation be- tween different ethnic or descent groups, would tend to evolve into certain norms of institutions that impose con-straints upon community members who would otherwise choose to utilize the option of violence in situations of conflict of interest. 7 With this model of social control, conflicts were neutralized by social institutions, conven- tions, norms, values, beliefs, and moral principles, which primarily emphasized tendencies toward social equilib-rium. 8 The primary function of institutions, therefore, was to emphasize areas of mutual benefits instead of in- centives to cause harm to others. It is empirically verifiable, too, that, as in any human society, conflicts were part and parcel of indigenous Afri- can communities. Disputes could result from a breach ofcontract, theft, slander, and witchcraft and sorcery accu- sations. They could also result from marital misunder- standings, injuries against persons, and damage toproperty. Fights could result from misunderstanding over inheritance and the difficulty of determining land bound- aries, as well as over access to political office. Conflictcould also occur between people of different communities or ethnic groups normally over the determination of rights ownership of natural resources and raid of live-stock. Thus, a meaningful search for viable alternative con- flict resolution systems for Africa must start with a rec-onciliation of this contradiction. Most African societies emphasized social harmony as the overriding ideology of social control. This has been well-demonstrated in theconception and application of the philosophies of ubuntu among the indigenous communities of Southern Africa and kanye ndu bowi 9 among the Buem of the Ghana- Togo border area.Indigenous African conflict resolution systems The main indigenous conflict-handling fora identified in Africa are summarized below: Mediation is the most popular dispute-settling forum in traditional Africa. The managers of mediation are usu- ally lineage elders, priests, and influential individualswho are known for their wisdom, skills, and trustworthi- ness in their official and professional capacities and pri- vate dealings. These individuals, who are referred toelsewhere 10 as du nkuwo, (or the eyes of the city or com- munity) enjoy excellent reputation within their commu- nities and have the capability to persuade individualswho have been summoned to attend hearings. It often happens that lineage heads or influential individuals who have excelled in the art of negotiation, persuasion, con-ciliation, and advice are often invited to mediate conflicts outside of their own kin groups or communities. Media- tion normally avoids overt display of power, winner-losermentality, social scars, and bitterness that are normally associated with adjudication. Disputants seek mediation generally because it is considered affordable, flexible, andadaptable. As a conflict resolution method, mediation helps to achieve a settlement through negotiation, con- ciliation, persuasion, inducement, and compromise. Itwas logical and common for the people to seek mediation because disputants usually looked for a more congenial and less adversarial conflict settlement to continue to livetogether amicably. Adjudication is a more elaborate process than media- tion. It usually proceeds in stages and normally involvesintensive cross-examination and assembling of witnesses and, where necessary, exhibits would be tended in as evi- dence. 11 People in general prefer mediation to adjudica- tion, primarily because the former is not only less time-consuming and cheaper, it also avoids a winner- loser outcome, which makes post-settlement conciliationmore difficult. Also, cases that were submitted for adjudi- cation normally include those that had either failed to be resolved by mediation or arbitration or were constitu-tionally defined as criminal. 12 The resort to mystical powers to resolve conflict was a common practice in pre-colonial Africa. Trial by ordealwas a practice whereby recourse could be made to mysti- cal bodies, e.g., the fetish to determine guilt and/or inno- cence. If evidence was so conflicting that the judges ormediators were finding it difficult to come to a decision they could resort to the application of trial by ordeal.41 These were normally cases in which the facts were diffi- cult to ascertain through secular means.13 It was also common for people to resort to the use of witchcraft and/or sorcery to settle conflict in Africa. People would resort to these mystical means when they did not want to bring their grievances into the open in order to be redressed byeither adjudication or mediation. In African thought in general, witchcraft refers to the use of non-material mys- tical means in attacking one's adversary, whereas the useof sorcery involves both the use of non-material mystical means and material objects. The efficacy and destructive powers of witchcraft and sorcery were firmly believed andfeared in most African communities. Traditional African societies and communities dealt with the challenges of maintaining peaceful relationshipswith their neighboring ethnic groups through diplomacy . A failure of diplomacy would lead to war or the resump- tion and or escalation of a conflict. Central to the diplo-matic efforts were clan elders, or, in the case of centralized political systems, delegates of the reigning monarch. These diplomats\u2014often referred to as \"mes-sengers,\" \"linguists,' or \"heralds\" were, like mediators, individuals who had acquired exceptional skills in the use of language and had distinguished themselves in the artof negotiation, persuasion, and conciliation. 14 Other methods of dispute settlement in traditional Af- rica included fission, \"slanging-match,\" and joking rela-tionships. Fission , also referred to as \"split\" or \"secession\" was a practice whereby one faction or party to the dispute moved and created a new settlementelsewhere. 15Communities resorted to \"slanging- matches \" where the disputing parties wanted to dilute the intensity of the tension, which, if not done, could leadto violence. Parties to the conflict would challenge each other to an exchange of insulting songs and words. A jok- ing relationship had a similar cathartic effect as a slang- ing-match. Parties to the conflict insulted each other playfully, but, challenged by the larger society or commu- nity not to react in aggressive or revengeful manner dur-ing such exchanges. In principle, one was supposed to be more tolerant of those with whom one had a joking rela- tionship. While it could be practiced by people within thesame community or society (as in the case of the Fulbe of Nigeria, Senegal, and Niger), it could also exist between peoples of different societies or communities (as in thecase of the Fulbe and Tiv of Nigeria). 16 The individual vis-\u00e0-vis the community and con- flict resolution . There was a close connection between individuals and their kin groups and/or even the larger community vis-\u00e0-vis conflict resolution. As a bearer of thelineage or community name, individuals were expected to uphold a positive image of themselves in their social con- duct. Lineage and community members, too, were ex-pected to unfailingly stand by a member who was involved in any manner of dispute. Lineage heads in par- ticular would be expected to make sure that any memberof the group who was summoned for any form of wrong- doing attended the court hearing and paid the court fines that might be imposed. Recidivism in particular was,therefore, severely sanctioned by lineage leaders and the community as a whole, whose duty it was to provide the public officials with support in enforcing thecommunity's normative order. 17 In his contribution, Wolff extended the conflict resolu- tion role of kinship structures and its underlying ideol-ogy, when he discussed attempts in Eritrea to offer protection to thousands of children who were victims of the county's thirty-year conflict. 18 In this program, not only were the children's extended families sought in or- der to be assigned the responsibility of protecting these orphans, an alternative plan was also designed wherebyhomes, based on the people's indigenous extended family values and structures, were being created for the protec- tion of children whose biological extended families couldnot be found. In most African societies and/or communities, social or- der could be sustained through the imposition of \"intrin-sic sanctions.\" These were subtle but pervasive means by which members of the community could be molded into complying with the rules of social control. These intrinsicsanctions are both positive\u2014the psyche rewards that the people could receive when they conformed to the ap- proved mode of behavior\u2014and negative\u2014the feeling ofmoral discomfort that they experience when they default. Thus, the sustenance of the ideology of harmony as in the case of kanye ndu bowi among the Buem 19 or ubuntu in southern Africa (explained below) involves an emphasis on community myths, beliefs, values, and motives. Enforcement of judicial decisions . Fragility of the political order and limited capability of the enforcement mechanisms influenced the enforcement of judicial deci- sions in the pre-colonial setting. Unlike the modern na-tion-states, most pre-colonial African societies lacked organized and standing police and the institution of im- prisonment. 20 How did these societies enforce their judi- cial decisions in order to maintain law and order? The search for an explanation to this apparent enigma directs attention to the following socio-structural elements. Institutional and personal trustworthiness. Suc- cessful settling of conflict in pre-colonial Africa by judi-42Local Pathways to Global Development cial officials would meet not only the expectation of the disputants that their conflict was resolved, it would also reinforce a conviction among their subjects that the po-litico-judicial officials could bring about the resolution of other disputes in the future. In most of the pre-colonial African societies, the political officials\u2014chiefs, fetishpriests, lineage heads, and influential individuals\u2014were also judicial officials, such as adjudicators, mediators, and arbitrators. 21 Contrary to the modern experience where such a concentration of societal power can be a recipe for autocracy and despotism, political leaders of pre-colonial Africa utilized their roles in conflict manage-ment by demonstrating their skills, capabilities, and trustworthiness and, in doing so, enhanced their legiti- macy and political standing before their subjects. The ideational context . In pre-colonial Africa, the philosophical orientation, which under-girded conflict resolution was as important as the skills and the moralintegrity of the conflict resolution officials. For example, in most African communities, disputing parties needed to concur with the decisions of the courts to consider theconflict resolved. For example, the Tiv of Nigeria believe that \"a good judge does not force a decision on the parties but gets them to concur if he can.\" 22 In this context, the politico-judicial officials were expected to ensure that parties to a dispute unanimously concurred on the fair- ness of the judicial decision.23 The implications of this in- digenous principle for the contemporary peace talks in the region are enormous. 24 The use or the threat of use of supernatural sanctions on intransigent parties in the implementation of peace agreements was crucial. If a person refused to abide by a decision of the court, the chief and his eldersmight, by imprecation compel him or her to do so. 25 As a verdict enforcement mechanism, curses served as power- ful sanctions to ensure obedience to the court's decision.Since the dominant traditional religious entities in Africa mostly consisted of ancestral worship, the role of mystical forces in enforcing judicial decisions in the region cannotbe separated from the supportive role of kin groups or community members. Religious ritual and community support were central elements in post-conflict recon-struction in some communities in Mozambique and Angola, in the economic, political, and psychological re- habilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants and vic-tims of war. 26 Ostracizing is a judicial procedure applied against re- cidivistic members of the community. These individuals\u2014 referred to as \"the bad lot\" 27\u2014 are habitual criminals, apparently incorrigible, who constantly steal, rape, ormurder but fail to submit themselves to the orders of the courts. The Buems of Ghana thought ostracism was equivalent to life imprisonment. This was because, onceostracized, the individual is cast out of any social event, thus assuming a status of the \"finally intolerable,\" 28 a pariah and an anathema to his or her kin group. He orshe was \"stripped of the soul.\" 29 Thus, the fear of ostra- cism in the traditional African setting was so great that it offered leaders of communities in which it was practicedan opportunity to pressurize intransigent parties to sub- mit themselves to court hearing when summoned and to abide by judicial decisions. Immediately on attaining political independence, Africa's founding fathers acknowledged the \"disconnect\" between African traditions and practices and those thatwere transplanted by the colonizers. They also saw the need for utilizing the region's indigenous principles, val- ues and ideological symbols, and models as the basis forpolitical modernization, nation-building, and the cre- ation of democratic governance. In this Leopold Senghor Kwame Nkrumah\"Consciencism,\" Julius Nyerere \"Ujamaa,\" and Kenneth Kaunda \"Humanism.\" 30 A similar attempt can be found in the adoption of the indigenous African kinship ideol-ogy by the post-colonial African leaders to enhance their legitimacy. Ranging from the conservative Houghouet- Boigny of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to the radical Nkrumah of Ghana,most of these leaders have in one way or the other in- voked the ideology of kinship as the basis for creating le- gitimate governance. This took the form of the\"metaphor of father and family,\" which was a vision of governance derived from an idealized notion of authority and behavior within the African family systems. 31 The national judicial systems in Africa recognize the existence of traditional conflict resolution systems for their relative competence in matters of local traditionsand customs. Some countries have even incorporated them into the national statute. 32 Thus, cases deemed ten- able under the relevant indigenous laws are often re-ferred from the national courts to these traditional courts. For example, disputes arising from land or mar- riage contracts executed under a particular local custom,but brought before the national court system are often referred back to the traditional courts for redress. The traditional courts are deemed more competent in casesthat demand knowledge of local customs and history since much of this has not been written and it is the chiefs and their elders who could be relied upon assources of such knowledge. 3343 There have, however, been problems in the implemen- tation of this judicial juxtaposition initiative. This is be- cause some of the principles of the legal systems of theethnic constituents are in apparent irreconcilable conflict with those of the modern nation-states that have estab- lished jurisdiction over them. Some authors believe thatthe implementation of a national land law alongside an existing indigenous one can give rise to \"intercode ambi- guity,\" a situation whereby two or more persons orgroups can advance different, though apparently legiti- mate claims, to the same piece of land at the same time. This has contributed vastly to the causes of communalconflicts that have engulfed most of Africa's agrarian communities. Given the centrality of land in the eco- nomic, political, and sociocultural lives of these commu-nities, conflict emanating from the problems of determining rights in land can be considered the key source of conflict in the region. Conclusion The following observations and recommendations may be of use to African governments, their development part-ners, and Africanist scholars with an interest in African conflict resolution: 1. It is not suggested that a wholesale application of Africa's indigenous principles and methods will resolve the region's contemporary conflicts. However, African policy-makers and their international partners must lookfor the means by which relevant aspects of the indig- enous principles and practices can be integrated and har- monized with those of the modern nation-states of theregion as well as across the diverse indigenous systems themselves. 34 2. Indigenous philosophies with a perceived reconcilia- tory role such as ubuntu in the deliberations of post- apartheid South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the proposed adoption of\"gacaca\" in Rwanda must be acknowledged, selectively explored, and their spirit incorporated into the countries' judicial, political, and civic cultures. For example, in thecase of the South African TRC's deliberations, the appli- cation of the spirit of ubuntu \u2014an expression of \"collec- tive personhood\" that subsists on such values as groupsupport, compromise, caring, empathy, co-operation, and solidarity\u2014was in harmony with the primary objective of the TRC, creating a non-adversarial relationship betweenoffenders and their victims. 353. African policy makers can also explore some of the enduring qualities of the main indigenous African con- flict resolution processes and seek ways and means of ap-plying them to the contemporary conflict resolution practices in the region. These include: \u007f the sanctity of the presiding mediators or the judges in terms of demonstrated moral uprightness, neutrality, and honesty in their private and public behaviors; \u007f full and free discussion of the complaints by the dispu- tants, leading to a high measure of agreement between all present; and \u007f the losing side's recognition of the justice in the win- ning side's case and its acceptance of the fairness of the process. 4. The adoption of Africa's indigenous principles and values as the basis for political development, including conflict resolution, does not offer automatic success. Thishas been demonstrated by the extent of governance prob- lems in most of the African countries even though most of these countries' post-colonial leaders have in one way orthe other adopted the indigenous principles and values but disappointed in the behavioral obligations enshrined in the indigenous principles and their underlying normsand values. 5.To adopt, refurbish, and sustain Africa's indigenous conflict resolution principles, three key issues, must betaken into account. First, there is a need for role models, in this case the active use of the region's men and women in mediation. These individuals must be the du nkuwo (the eyes of community) who have been recognized, not only for effective performance in particular spheres of human endeavor such as politics, civil administration,scholarship, military, liberation struggle, and entrepre- neurship, but also for the demonstration of unquestion- able moral uprightness. Second, effective conflictresolution depends on good governance. Third, African governments and the various agencies of political social- ization in the region need to educate the public in generaland the younger generation in particular on the region's vital indigenous principles that have been handed down over the years. African governments and Africa's regional organiza- tions need to devise the means and political will to resolve the horrendous and growth-retarding conflicts in the re-gion. After all, the ability of a state or a community to enact and enforce laws that govern behavior, including conflict resolution, is an unquestionable measure of itsdevelopmental capacity. 3644Local Pathways to Global Development 1 For the purpose of this paper, the term \"indigenous\" is used interchangeably with the terms \"traditional,\" \"customary,\" and \"pre-colonial.\" 2 The term \"conflict resolution\" is used in this article in a broader sense to include all manner of management, which prevents, reduces, or even resolves conflict.

Indigenous Knowledge: The Way Forward Nicolas Gorjestani Nicolas Gorjestani is Senior Adviser and Chief Knowledge and LearningOfficer in the Africa Region of the World Bank .This concluding article reviews the context for and the achievements of the World Bank's Indigenous Knowledge for Development Program, discusses the main lessons learned to date, and outlines a possible way forward to promoteIK in the future in the context of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In doing so, the article draws on the lessons that emerge from the 60 IK Notes , as well as on the recommendations made by the contributing authors in thepreceding thematic lead articles, and, finally, on the experiences gained during the first five years of the IK Program. Together, these point to the following: there is considerable potential for successful indigenous practices to enhancethe sustainability and impact of development efforts; and the development community should increase its support to programs that help enhance the ca- pacity of local communities to share IK and apply it to get better developmentresults. Context As indicated in the foreword to this publication, the World Bank launched the Indigenous Knowledge for Development Program in 1998 in response to the challenge articulated by government and civil society leaders at the Global Knowledge Conference in Toronto, Canada in 1997. The start of the programalso coincided with a newly formulated vision of a Knowledge Bank. Within this vision, and recognizing that it is not just a storehouse of universally appli- cable and transferable knowledge, the Bank would seek to:\u007f Empower its clients to tap a variety of knowledge sources, including indig- enous knowledge systems embedded in local communities, \u007f Help connect clients to one another and to other sources of experience,\u007f Learn from and with clients about what works in a given setting and why. The \"business case\" for using IK rests on the following premises: that un- derstanding the local context allows for better adaptation of global knowledge; that using local knowledge sources increases ownership and eventually pro- duces better results on the ground with enhanced sustainability; 1 that learn-46Local Pathways to Global Development ing from and building on the knowledge systems embed- ded in local communities helps to empower these commu- nities and fosters a sense of equity in their interactionswith governments and external development partners; that building on IK could only be achieved in partnership with the communities themselves, with governments andcivil society, and with development partners and academia, in order to leverage scarce resources and maxi- mize the comparative advantage of the respective part-ners; 2 and, most importantly, that investing in the exchange of IK and its integration into development pro- grams supported by the Bank and its development part-ners would help achieve the overriding development objective, the reduction of poverty. Achievements At the launch of the IK Program, the World Bank pub- lished a \"Framework for Action\". 3 The latter was embed- ded in a strategy aimed at improving the quality ofdevelopment programs and empowering local communi- ties through activities in three key areas: (a) raising awareness of the importance of IK; (b) enhancing localcapacity to document and exchange IK; and (c) applying IK in development programs. The following is a brief summary of the intermediate outcomes, which the IKprogram has helped to promote to date. 4 Raising awareness There has been a growing recognition of the importance of IK in the development process as evidenced by the fol-lowing: 5 the volume of IK publications related to develop- ment has risen substantially;6 the concomitant number of actors, NGOs, and even research institutions engagedin IK-related matters is growing rapidly; development practitioners and decision makers increasingly recognize IK as an important and underutilized knowledge re-source 7; IK is finding a more prominent place in the glo- bal dialogue on development;8 IK has become less controversial and its promoters today represent a mix ofdevelopment practitioners, researchers, and experts from the humanities and natural sciences; 9 and the develop- ment community is beginning to address the intellectualproperty rights related to IK. 10 This evolution is also clearly observable in the World Bank. \"Indigenous\" or \"local\" knowledge has increas-ingly entered the Bank's publications and dialogue withits clients, whereas in the past the focus was mostly on \"global\" knowledge. 11 Similarly, to underscore the impor- tance of indigenous knowledge systems, at the 2001 An-nual Meetings the Bank's management disseminated to its governing body a booklet entitled \"Learning from Lo- cal Communities: Challenges and Opportunities\" whereseveral successful cases of IK were brought to the atten- tion of the audience. Finally, client demand for IK-related material in the Bank has been growing steadily: the IKwebsite is the second most visited site on the Bank's Af- rica Region external portal; 12 and the Swahili and Wolof versions of the IK website receive about twice as manyvisitors as the French version, suggesting a strong client response to IK content in local languages. Enhancing local capacity There has been a noticeable improvement in the capacity of local communities and IK centers to exchange indig- enous practices and learn from each other as demon- strated by the following: accessing documented andpublished information has become much easier, including in African countries, enabled in part by the increasing reach of the Internet; networks of IK practitioners areproliferating at the country as well as regional level (e.g., associations of traditional healers in Uganda, Tanzania, and other countries; regional association of traditionalhunters in West Africa, etc.); community-based documen- tation and dissemination centers are being established (e.g., in Uganda); cross regional IK learning exchangeshave provided a platform for replicating successful indig- enous practices; 13 and a growing number of community- to-community knowledge and learning exchanges (C2C)within and across countries have enhanced local capacity to learn from peer experiences in other communities. The C2Cs represent one of the most effective ap- proaches to sharing indigenous practices that have a strong tacit knowledge content. For example, one such C2C in South Africa produced a measurable outcome inimproving the well-being of the participating community. The latter learned through the C2C how to improve its marketing strategy and succeeded in securing a sizeableexport contract for a local cash crop. 14 The revenues from the exports are manifold the cost of organizing the ex- change. Lessons of experience with several such C2Cs,including pointers on successful approaches to prepara- tion, management, and evaluation of C2C, have been pre- pared to help practitioners in organizing suchexchanges. 1547 Applying IK in development There is a growing movement toward integrating IK into poverty reduction programs to help achieve better results as evidenced by the following developments: severalcountries have begun the process of preparing national IK strategies through national workshops and other events (e.g., Uganda has completed a national IK strat-egy; and Burkina Faso, Malawi, Mali, Kenya, Sri Lanka and Tanzania have held workshops to help launch the process); a few countries have already incorporated IKinto their poverty reduction programs (e.g., Uganda's Poverty Eradication Action Program (PEAP) has incor- porated IK as a component of science and technology; theState of Kerala in India is incorporating IK into theState's 10 th Five Year Plan, etc.); and guidelines for the integration of IK into project planning and preparation have been prepared in partnership with CIDA, ILO, and the IK Program.16 Some regional organizations are also incorporating IK into their strategies, e.g., SADC has in- cluded IK as a component under science and technology in its Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan).17 Progress in integrating IK into development efforts has also been observed in the projects supported by the World Bank. Whereas five years ago, very few projects containedspecific components related to IK, today more than two dozen projects under implementation or preparation con- tain such elements. Table 1 highlights some of theseprojects in Africa.Table 1.

This approach involves learning about the bio-physical environment, the social fabric, the localeconomy, culture and history, as well as the knowledge embedded in a community. Such a holistic approach can help to: better understand the local situation in its en-tirety; design more effective and sustainable programs; learn from communities and help them learn to adapt global practices appropriately. This could in turn help toenrich the development process, and to promote a more balanced perspective between \"exogenous\" and \"endog- enous\" concepts of development. 19 Given the holistic nature of IK, learning from exchange of IK can also provide value that goes beyond a specific practice. For example, the community-to-community ex-changes (C2C) mentioned earlier have demonstrated that participants not only learn specific skills or practices; but more importantly, they observe different approaches tosolving problems and are prompted to reflect upon their own problem-solving strategies in the context of a spe- cific practice. Hence, the C2Cs have the potential to em-power the local communities and help enhance their capacity for effecting change, beyond the immediate learning of a specific technology. Since development is es-sentially about a process of desired change, the above ap- proach would contribute effectively to achieving the fundamental goals of a community. IK is highly context specific and hence may not be easily replicable, unless it is adapted or lever- aged with other knowledge systems. By definition, IK is context specific. 20 Hence it sets its own limitations to transferability and scaling-up: what works successfully in one location or for one community may not for an-other. 21 Nevertheless, some indigenous practices can be adapted to other institutional or socio-cultural contexts or leveraged with other knowledge systems with impres-sive results. The box below shows how in the Iganga Dis- trict of Uganda, a community driven initiative succeeded in reportedly reducing maternal mortality rates by about50 percent in three years, using simple technology to le- verage indigenous knowledge and modern knowledge sys- tems. Such cases have the potential to be replicated andscaled up in other communities (in Uganda as well as in other countries) with similar social-cultural characteris- tics (e.g., the prevalence of traditional healers and birthattendants in the rural areas).Validation of IK is necessary to confirm the im- pact and the potential value of replication, but it requires protocols that fit the specific nature of IK and that empower its practitioners . Scientists who challenge the validity of the experiences of indigenous practitioners tend to say that \"the plural of anecdote is not evidence.\" There are two ways to respond to thischallenge. The first (more popular) approach calls for subjecting IK practices to research and methodological scrutiny. For example, some countries have invested innational pharmaceutical laboratories that analyze me- dicinal plants to find active ingredients; others have in- vested in farming systems research, aiming tounderstand the indigenous cropping systems. 23 However, the outcome of these investments has been limited. There are very few concrete recommendations resulting fromsuch research that help traditional practitioners. For ex- ample, the majority of agricultural extension workers continue to concentrate on messages related to the \"ma-jor\" crops under relatively simple input-output regimes. Yet, there remains a need to document and confirm the claims of impact of IK, especially in areas such as tradi-Traditional birth attendants and health workers partner to save lives in rural Uganda In the Iganga District of Uganda, a UNFPA-sup- ported project (RESCUER) seeking to reduce mater- nal mortality equipped Traditional BirthAttendants (TBA) with modern communication technology. This involved the installation of a solar- powered VHF radio communication system that in-cluded fixed base stations at the Primary Health Center, mobile \"walkie-talkies\" for the TBAs, and ambulance vehicles and a reliable supply of blood re-serves. Improved communication and transporta- tion links between the TBAs and the health posts resulted in increased and timelier patient referralsas well as the improved delivery of health care to a larger number of pregnant women. Connecting the Traditional Birth Attendants and the health centershelped leverage the indigenous and modern knowl- edge systems. A notable impact of the project was that maternal mortality reportedly declined by morethan 50 percent over the period of three years i.e.,about three-quarters of the applicable Millennium Development Goal for 2015! 2249 tional medicine where lives are at stake\u2014how does one know that the claim of healing is true and that the plants in question are safe? Appropriate protocols need to be de-veloped that fit the specificities of IK. Some progress has recently been made in this area. For example, the IK Pro- gram has brokered an initial partnership between theTanga AIDS Working Group, Tanzania, and the US Na- tional Institutes of Health (NIH) to cooperate on the vali- dation of the efficacy of the herbal treatments used bytraditional healers in Pangani District to treat the oppor- tunistic diseases of thousands of HIV/AIDS patients. An- other example involves development of guidelines by theWHO for appropriate approaches to determining the safety, efficacy, and quality of medicinal plants. 24 The second option is to develop national, possibly fol- lowed by international, standards and professional ethics for IK practitioners. The latter approach could be poten- tially more effective in empowering indigenous practitio-ners. For example, the success of modern medicine builds on strong institutionalized professional bodies with ap- propriate regulation by the industry and governmentagencies. These professional bodies and communities of practice have designed own standards and ethics that, by and large successfully, help to control misuse, fraud, andmal-practice. In the case of indigenous practitioners, however, such representation is typically the exception rather than thenorm (e.g., in some countries there are associations of traditional healers). Nevertheless, progress is underway. A global network of IK resource centers is graduallyemerging. Its members are academic institutions, NGOs, CBOs, and individuals engaged in the study, documenta- tion, dissemination, and advocacy of IK. Regional net-works are also slowly emerging, such as PELUM (Participatory Ecological Land Use Management), which has been formed in some countries in East and SouthernAfrica to share and combine experiences, skills, and knowledge in smallholder agriculture. Active and member-driven networks can be effective disseminators and advocates of IK. However, the commu- nities of indigenous practitioners are still fragmented, with individuals generally operating in isolation, oftencompeting with each other, or \"protecting\" their knowl- edge through secrecy arrangements or sharing on an in- tra-familial basis only. As a result, IK practitioners tendto play a marginal role in the knowledge debate and have yet to develop effective mechanisms to learn from each other so as to further develop their knowledge. Thistends to prevent good indigenous practitioners from be- ing duly recognized (and rewarded) beyond the local con-text and lowers the \"culling\" rate of poor performers or harmful traditional practices, which, in turn tends to dis- credit the entire profession. The two approaches mentioned above are not mutually exclusive, and research is needed as much as is advocacy. However, without the latter, the former might notachieve what good indigenous practitioners need most: general recognition as empowered, credible professionals. These empowered practitioners could then engage the re-search community, promote their own agendas to seek protection for their intellectual property, and act at par with policy makers and representatives of the conven-tional sciences. The development partners can play an important role in enabling this process. Developing innovative approaches to protect in- tellectual property associated with IK is a key challenge facing the global development commu- nity. Innovative approaches are needed because existing arrangements may not be applicable to the specific na- ture of IK. For example, IK is typically preserved through oral tradition and demonstration rather than documen-tation. More often than not, it emerges gradually. Only in rare cases is an industrial process involved. And, an indi- vidual inventor is unlikely to be identified. These are allessential criteria for patenting a process or technology under the prevailing rules governing the intellectual property rights (IPR). WIPO, a partner of the IK Pro-gram, has taken the lead in promoting a global dialogue and partnerships around the challenge of how to find in- novative approaches to IPR as they apply to indigenousknowledge. There are several action areas to help address this is- sue. In the area of documentation, local communitiescould be encouraged to publicize and register traditional practices. Practical, cost-effective and indigenous ex- amples of documentation also exist. 25 Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) is another interesting approach to protecting IK. These agreements involve the provision of material (samples or information) in exchange for mon-etary or non-monetary benefits. Examples of fair and eq- uitable benefit sharing between users and custodians of IK can be found in several countries today. For example,in Cameroon, the US National Cancer Institute has re- portedly signed a contract with the government, follow- ing the discovery of a forest plant species with a potentialanti-AIDS chemical. Cameroon provides plant samples in return for payments, which are used for community de- velopment projects. 26 Regional agreements could also lead to cost effective forms of protection for local communities. For example,50Local Pathways to Global Development the 1996 Andean Pact adopted by Bolivia, Colombia, Ec- uador, Peru and Venezuela, empowers the national au- thority and indigenous communities in each country, asthe holders of traditional knowledge and resources, to grant prior informed consent in exchange for equitable returns. The need to address the issue of IPR of IK should not prevent the development and implementation of IK ini- tiatives that are beneficial for communities and the de-velopment process as a whole. However, some community-based organizations and NGOs remain cau- tious about the perceived ultimate motives of the devel-opment partners' interest in IK. They may be concerned, for example, that communities could be deprived of their knowledge (and the associated products, processes, rightsor benefits). While the relevance and importance of the IPR issue is not in doubt, the development partners as well as governments should not lose sight of the fact thatIK is an endangered resource\u2014if not recorded and docu- mented, studied and challenged, disseminated and adapted, it is very likely to disappear. 27The challenge for the development community is therefore to develop a bal- anced approach that assures the preservation of IK sys- tems while at the same time protecting its bearers. The way forward The material in this publication demonstrates that over the past few years there has been good progress in put-ting IK on the agenda of development: awareness of the value of IK in the development process is growing; al- though sharing of IK across borders and communities isstill dominated by academic circles rather than by practi- tioners. This is changing gradually and the integration of IK into development projects is also beginning to takeplace. Nevertheless, much more needs to be done to build on the progress to date and to extend its breadth and depth. Some of the areas that need most attentionemerge from the earlier section on lessons and chal- lenges. Clearly, the main actors are the communities and the practitioners. Nevertheless, governments and theirdevelopment partners can play an important role in help- ing to enable the communities by supporting appropriate policies, programs, research, and targeted interventions. Is it realistic to envision that in the next five years learning from IK and incorporating successful practices into development programs becomes the standard ratherthan the exception that it is at present? The following suggests a six-point agenda for action by governments and partners to help realize this vision. The World Bank'sIK Program is committed to supporting this agenda in partnership with all the other actors involved. The spe- cific modalities for cooperation will have to be based onthe principles of comparative advantage and appropriate burden sharing. 1.Scale up successful IK practices to help achieve the MDGs There is ample evidence to suggest that one of the best ways to empower local communities is to enable them to apply their indigenous practices in development activities that affect them directly. While there is a growing inter-est by local institutions and governments in incorporat- ing IK into programs and projects, the degree of that interest varies. In part, this is because some governmentsare still uncertain about the commitment of external partners in supporting such activities, who may have doubts about the efficacy of such an approach. Table 2highlights the potential contribution of IK to helping achieve the MDGs. These cases demonstrate that with appropriate adaptation and leveraging with other knowl-edge resources, IK can make a significant contribution in saving lives, educating children, increasing agricultural production, enhancing governance, etc. It would, there-fore, make good development sense for the partners to increase their support for community-driven activities that rely on IK. 2. Enhance the capacity of local communities to develop, share, and apply their IK One of the most effective ways to empower local commu- nities is to help enhance their capacity to exchange and apply indigenous practices (either directly or in combina-tion with other practices). In particular, experience sug- gests that brokering knowledge and bringing together knowledge seekers and providers is especially useful inincreasing the participative problem-solving capacity of local communities. Specific action in this area could in- clude support for:\u007f Development of national IK strategies and their incor- poration into poverty reduction programs \u007f Brokering of South-South knowledge and learning exchanges \u007f Facilitation of community-to-community exchanges \u007f Building of IK professional associations, standards and ethics \u007f Supporting communities to develop businesses related to IK.51 The governments could take the lead in creating the appropriate policy environment for these activities toevolve. Partners could support the process by providing resources for brokering and facilitation functions as well as the dissemination of lessons of experience (e.g., in theform of tool kits and guidelines, some prototypes of which have already been prepared). Projects, intermediaries and government agencies could be supported in providingopportunities for exposing traditional practitioners to the scientific research community and other professional as- sociations. At the same time, the private sector could beencouraged through appropriate policies to invest in the development of products emanating from indigenous practices, or develop appropriate community - privatesector partnerships. 283. Develop innovative protocols for the validation and protection of IK As indicated in the earlier section of this article, existing international protocols governing intellectual property rights (IPR) are based essentially on the concept of pat-ents. Similarly, protocols for validation of traditional medicine are essentially based on researching the effect of single substances on a specific disease or illness. Thismakes their application in the case of traditional medi- cine problematic, given the multiple ingredients in a herbal treatment. Accordingly, more appropriate ap-proaches need to be developed to address the issues of IPR and scientific validation in the case of IK. While there has been a start in this direction, as indicated ear-lier, more concerted action is called for. The governments can help by designing appropriate policies and legal cov- enants. The partners, led by WIPO in the case of IPR is-sues and by WHO in the case of traditional medicine,MDG IK example Source Eradicate poverty and hunger In the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, farmers used their local knowledge and expertise to increase agricultural productivity and incomes by 60 percent in about five years. IK Notes 45 Achieve universal primary education In West Africa , the use of local language as a medium of instruction has helped increase literacy rates among rural populations and provided gainful employment for teachers and young girls. IK Notes 5 Promote gender equality and empower women Women are playing an active role as agents of social change throughout Africa. In Senegal, the women of Malicounda empowered themselves to put an end to the local practice of female genital mutilation. IK Notes 3 Reduce child mortality Throughout Africa, local communities use traditional child rearing practices to supplement the diet of infants. In Ethiopia , traditional medicine is used to treat common infant diseases. IK Notes 35 Improve maternal health In Uganda, traditional birth attendants have collaborated with district health centers, using modern ICTs, to help reduce maternal mortality reportedly by over 50 percent in three years. IK Notes 40 Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases In Tanzania, traditional healers have successfully treated opportunistic infections of over 4,000 AIDS patients, prolonging their lives. IK Notes 51 Ensure environmental sustainability Rural communities in Mozambique manage control of forest exploitation along the country's shoreline through myths and traditional rites, maintaining these resources for the next generations. IK Notes 46 Build a global partnership for development A team of IK experts from East Africa visits counterparts in South Asia to develop a partnership for South-South cooperation on IK-related activities. IK Notes 55 Table 2. Potential contribution of IK towards achieving the MDGs52Local Pathways to Global Development could contribute by promoting the use of appropriate inter- national protocols and disseminate them through an infor- mation campaign that reaches the local practitioners andthe communities, associations researchers, etc. 4. Develop a results framework for monitoring IK and measuring its impact With an increasing of number of projects and activities incorporating IK, a body of evidence is building up thatwill be useful in expanding IK applications across coun- tries. It is, therefore, important to identify effective ap- proaches to monitoring and evaluation of results inprojects that incorporate IK, and to establish a better un- derstanding and a larger database of quantifiable results of IK-driven activities. Sector-specific sets of indicatorswould need to be developed that demonstrate how the in- corporation of useful IK (or addressing harmful prac- tices) in development has made a difference. Thisframework would also help to distill successful ap- proaches to replication and scale up. The framework should be referenced against the MDGs, indicating howIK can contribute to achieve them. This would also help to address the issues related to validation and IPR associ- ated with IK. Governments could ensure that national IKstrategies contain appropriate arrangements for measur- ing results. The partners could help by developing com- mon methodologies based on successful country practicesand disseminating these to the communities of practice. 5. Establish an innovation fund to promote successful IK practices While IK is typically passed on from generation to genera- tion, it is not static in that each generation can adapt andimprove on earlier practices. Local communities have the potential for creativity and innovation. There is evidence to suggest that, when enabled, communities and traditionalpractitioners are capable of developing new problem solv- ing approaches that build on their IK systems. There is also evidence to suggest that an innovation fund to supportsuch activities could go a long way in stimulating further creative thinking among the communities. For example, the GTZ has evaluated a series of small scale innovationprojects funded by Germany and found them to be particu- larly useful in promoting community-based initiatives, micro-enterprise development and local innovations. Simi-larly, the World Bank's Development Marketplace has spurred several very creative community-based solutions,some of which have involved IK. 29 An innovation fund dedi- cated to IK could be modeled on the latter and provide a platform for partners to contribute resources as \"venturecapital\" for IK-related innovation. 6. Organize a global IK conference to promote the above agenda Despite recent progress, awareness of the role that IK can play in development is generally limited. Yet, there isa growing body of evidence to suggest that successful in- digenous practices can contribute effectively to the devel- opment agenda. In this context, it would be timely toorganize a global conference that would bring together policy makers, representatives of IK communities of practice and other community-based organizations, andthe development partners, etc., to help generate a stron- ger commitment to implement the above agenda. The year 2005 would be a realistic target for such a confer-ence and it would provide a springboard for IK's role in helping achieve the MDGs in the remaining decade be- fore the target date in 2015. The IK Program of the WorldBank is ready to collaborate with other partners, country authorities as well as community-based organizations in preparation and organization of such a conference. Aninternational conference would underline the commit- ment of development partners to promote the use of IK in the development process. Conclusion The present publication has attempted to bring together evidence to support the important role that IK can playin the development process. It commemorates five years of the Indigenous Knowledge Program, which is among several initiatives that the World Bank has undertakenover the last few years. These initiatives have sought to bring about some fundamental changes in the way the World Bank approaches the development challenge. TheIK Program and the other initiatives are hopefully mak- ing the Bank more responsive to clients' needs, more fo- cused on empowering local communities, and determinedto learn from others to enrich its own development knowledge, which is increasingly becoming the Bank's second \"currency.\" As His Excellency, the President of Tanzania, con- cluded in his introduction to this publication: only those who learn, will prevail. We have learned that IK is a criti-cal factor for sustainable development and empowerment53 of local communities. The integration of IK into the devel- opment process will help to enrich it and make it more eq- uitable. Like any other knowledge, IK needs to beconstantly used, challenged, and further adapted to the evolving contexts. Supporting local and regional net- works of IK practitioners and facilitating community-to-community knowledge and learning exchanges will help to enable the communities to participate more actively in the development process as protagonists of their own de-velopment. While innovative mechanisms for the valida- tion and protection of IK need to be developed, many indigenous practices can at the same time be adapted andscaled up within local, national, and regional develop- ment efforts. To move ahead on these fronts requires a stronger commitment from governments, partners, com-munity-based organizations, and other interested players to work together in a partnership to harness IK for devel- opment in a process of learning from communities andhelping communities to learn. 1 Prior to the launch of the IK Program, the Bank had initiated some work in the 1980s related to indigenous knowledge in the agricul- ture sector in an effort to improve the design of development projects (Warren, D. M. 1991). 2 For example, WIPO would concentrate on IPR issues, IFAD on agricultural topics, NGOs would provide the link to communities, etc. The initial partners that helped launch the IK Program wereECA, CISDA, IDRC, ITU, UNESCO, UNDP, and WHO in the context of PICTA (Partnership for ICT in Africa). Subsequently, the IK Program has cooperated also with others, including CIDA,CIRAN at NUFFIC (Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education), FAO, GM/CCD (Global Mecha- nism of the Convention to Combat Desertification), GTZ, IFAD,ILO, Development Cooperation, NORAD, Swiss UNCTAD, WIPO, and numer- ous NGOs, CBOs and centers of excellence, mainly in Africa andSouth Asia. 3 See \"Indigenous Knowledge for Development: a Framework for Action,\" November, 1998, http://www.worldbank.org/afr/ik/ikrept.pdf. For an early discussion of the program's rationale see also IK Notes 1 and for intermediate progress, I K Notes 21 . 4 See tabular overview at the end of this article for activities and achievements of the IK Program. 5 The IK Program does not claim that the increase in awareness is due solely to its own activities. Other actors have played animportant role. 6 Web searches for \"indigenous knowledge\" yielded some 10,000 hits in 1998; they exceed 120,000 by late 2003. 7 For example, participants at recent conferences organized by various UN agencies (FAO, UNCTAD, WHO, WIPO, WTO) have begun to share information and experiences related to the promo-tion, application and protection of IK in the development process. 8 For example, the Development Gateway has a website dedicated to IK, which is one of its most frequently visited pages. See: http://www.developmentgateway.org/node/130646/9 This denotes a substantial qualitative change for the better, compared to the mid to late 1990s when (i) social anthropologists dominated the substantive discussion of IK, with some notableexceptions like the late agriculturalist, Michael Warren; and (ii) the supportive public opinion largely shared a romantic view of IK, whereas the opposing view considered IK akin to witchcraft(\"voodoo\") or \"old wives tales.\" 10 WIPO, which has created a unit to address IK issues, provides a forum for a global dialogue on intellectual property (IP) and IK,and is developing a range of tools aimed at enhancing the IP interests of the bearers of IK. 11 For example, search results for \"indigenous knowledge\" in Bank documents show a significant rise from 13 in 1998 to 237 in 2003. 12 Most recent annual averages show: ~120,000 visits, ~500,000 hits to access IK objects, and the equivalent of about 25,000 books ofinformation accessed. Moreover, the IK Notes sub-site has a very high user intensity rate (i.e., each visitor consulting on average about 20 IK Notes ). 13 A group of about 20 policy makers, traditional healers and project officials from Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda and their World Bank counterparts visited Sri Lanka and India in September 2002 tolearn from successful integration of IK in traditional medicine and early childhood projects. This exchange led to further South-South exchanges between South Asia and East Africa (e.g., Ethiopianwomen's groups adopted guidelines from SEWA (Self Employment Women's Association in India) helping them to better market their handicrafts). 14 For more detail, see the website of the Heiveld cooperative: http:// www.indigo-dc.org/history.html 15 The IFAD-housed Global Mechanism (GM/CCD)and the IK Program jointly conceived the C2C initiative, which the Govern- ments of the Netherlands and Switzerland have supported generously. A toolkit for the preparation, implementation andevaluation of community-to-community knowledge and learning exchanges has been prepared and is available on line: http:// www.worldbank.org/afr/ik/commun_toolkit/starthere.htm. 16 These guidelines are available afr/ik/guidelines/ 17 See URL: (URL http://www.sadc.int/ index.php?lang=english&path=about/risdp&page=risdp4) 18 The use of the term \"interdisciplinary\" in this context is deliber- ate: it refers to the interplay of various disciplines (e.g., economics,sociology, medicine, pedagogy etc.), in contrast to \"multi-sectoral\", which refers to the interplay between various sector practices (e.g., in education, health, transportation, etc.). 19 A recent doctoral thesis on development at the University of Toulouse, France, elaborates on the tension between the \"external\" and \"endogenous\" notions of development. In analyzing the IKProgram, the author supports the interdisciplinary nature of the IK approach to development. See Virginie Escudie, \"Du 'd\u00e9veloppement' et la 'technologie' : impasses des repr\u00e9sentationsexog\u00e8nes et \u00e9mergence de programmes alternatifs\", January 2004. 20 For \"operational\" purposes, the IK Program of the World Bank uses the following definition: IK is unique to every culture or society, is embedded in community practices, institutions, relation- ships and rituals, is the basis for local-level decision making; IK provides problem solving strategies for communities, using locallyavailable resources. The IK Program distinguishes IK from \"local\" and \"traditional\" knowledge in that IK is (i) commonly not taught in the formal education system (though it can be developed throughintegration with that system), (ii) still in use, and (iii), being continuously developed. \"Traditional knowledge\", even though it may still be in use, is commonly not developed exclusively anyfurther. Local knowledge (and expertise) would be all knowledge available in a specific country or location, including indigenous,54Local Pathways to Global Development traditional and modern. See http://www.worldbank.org/afr/ik/ what.htm. 21 In the early years of development cooperation, technologies were transferred directly from industrial countries in the hope that they would help developing economies to \"leap-frog.\" The promoters of \"appropriate technologies\" repeated the same approach on areduced scale, when they assumed that what had worked well, for example, in India, would also work in Tanzania. Some of these early technology transfer efforts even developed into \"movements\"\u2014especially appropriate technology\u2014confusing ends and means, something that IK proponents should avoid. 22 IK Notes 40 . 23 Investments in this type of research are, however, limited by budget constraints and certainly dwarfed by the public and private sector budgets available to \"mainstream\" research. Nevertheless,as the awareness of the importance of IK increases, so hopefully will the level of resources devoted for its research. The fact, that, in Uganda, IK has recently been integrated into the national povertyreduction program through the science and technology sector, implies that IK is recognized as a legitimate focus area for scientific research. 24 See WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2002-2005, WHO, 2002. 25 For example, the IIRR (International Institute for Rural Recon- struction) has produced a manual: \"Recording and Using Indig-enous Knowledge.\" It provides rural development workers with information and tools needed to integrate IK and describes more than 30 methods of recording and documenting IK. See http://www.panasia.org.sg/iirr/ikmanual/.26 Posey, D. and Dutfield G.: (1996) Beyond intellectual property: Toward traditional resource rights for indigenous peoples and local communities. IDRC, Ottawa. 27 Another consequence of the IPR dominated public debate on IK is that national and local organizations dedicated to the promotion of IK develop a guardian's approach to the issue, creating an exclusiverather than cooperative atmosphere. Some organizations for example compete for (scarce) funding or for the recognition of being an exclusive representative of the \"true\" IK. Hence, investments inthe development of IK strategies or action plans may face substan- tial transaction costs needed to bring the various players together and develop cooperation among them. 28 There are good examples: in South Africa, tea-growing farmers of Suid Bokkeveld have used indigenous practices (adopted from farmers in Wupperthal in West Cape Province) to improve theirpost-harvest processing and set up a cooperative which has succeeded in securing export orders to Europe. In Uganda, the authorities are supporting the marketing of a toothpaste based onindigenous plants. 29 In fact, the Bank's IK Program was launched with a grant from the Innovation Marketplace, which preceded the DevelopmentMarketplace concept, then limited to proposals from Bank teams. The Development Marketplace expanded the concept to include proposals from civil society groups in participating countries. Ateach marketplace, which usually takes place every other year (three such events have been organized to date), the Bank provides innovation grants ($100,000 on average) to several innovationprojects selected from thousands of proposals. The last marketplace held in December 2003, awarded about $6 million to 47 proposals from 27 countries.55 * Direct attribution of program activities and the development partners' IK engagement is not possible. However, a survey of web sites of various donors reveals that, compared with 1998, the overall efforts in this area have increased substantially.Indigenous Knowledge Program Overview 1998-2003 Objectives Activities Achievements Developing a database of IK practices, lessons learned, sources, partners, etc. Database with over 260 entries http://www.worldbank.org/afr/ik/datab.htm ; established contact with over 20 IK Centers worldwide; database linked to WIPO's portal on IK databases to assist patent offices with prior art searches. Identifying and testing instruments for capture and dissemination of IK. Established reporting format without disclosing practice details for entry into database; tested de-briefing technology, video recording and audio interviews; Multi Media CD ROMS (knowledge packs on using IK to help achieve the MDGs). Publishing selected cases in print and electronic format. 60+ IK Notes published on a monthly basis http://www.worldbank.org/afr/ik/iknotes.htm Raising awareness of the importance of IK Raising awareness of the importance of IK among development partners. Most of the development partners now have initiatives to incorporate or build on IK in their development programs.* Helping enhance local capacity to share IK, especially among the local IK centers. Supported the formation of regional networks; assisted five centers to establish connectivity; supported village museum for traditional Maasai culture. Identifying appropriate methods to collect, disseminate IK among communities. Supported Uganda National Council for Science and Technology to develop village-based documentation and dissemination centers. Enhancing local capacity to document and exchange IK Facilitating knowledge and learning exchanges among communities. Supported more than a dozen local, regional and cross regional IK exchanges for communities and produced toolkits for community knowledge and learning exchanges. Helping countries to prepare national strategies to help integrate IK into poverty reduction programs. Supported Uganda to formulate a national IK strategy; assisted Kerala to incorporate IK into the State's 10th Five Year Plan; assisted Malawi, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Mali and Sri Lanka with national orientation workshops on IK, leading to follow-up activities towards proposing elements for national strategies. Applying IK in the development process. Integrating indigenous practices into programs/projects supported by the World Bank and other partners. More than two dozen projects supported by World Bank, some in cooperation with other development partners, have IK elements or dedicated components. These include projects in early childhood development, health, HIV/AIDS, agriculture, medicinal plants, and natural resource management. 56Local Pathways to Global Development References Indigenous Capacity Enhancement: Developing Community Knowledge for Empowerment Allen, Tim & Thomas, Alan (2000).

Contact: rwoytek@worldbank.orgPart Two IK NotesIK Notes Summaries 1 Indigenous Knowledge Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Overview; October 1998 Donnelly- Roark, P. The first, introductory IK Note links economic and social development with participatory approaches. Capacity enhancement and institution building efforts are significant and relevant in combining indigenous and modern interventions. The key elements of the IK approach in development are: community participation for defining development process and results; development of indigenous approaches to project management; and focusing on project outcomes that reflect community demands. 2, 10 2 Sustainable Indigenous Knowledge Systems in Agriculture in Zimbabwe's Rural Areas of Matabele Land North and South Provinces ; November 1998 Larson, J.; Sibana, H. This case study explores socio-political, environmental, economic and religious implications of IK in farming; identifies and analyses natural resource management approaches and assesses the value and limitations of IK systems. The study argues that indigenous technologies should be recognized and integrated in development efforts. A key strategy should include community capacity enhancement for documentation, exchange and dissemination of IK. 6 3 Senegalese Women Remake their Culture ; December 1998 Easton, P. After attending adult literacy training, the women of Malicounda community address female genital mutilation. By co-opting traditional and religious leaders, they manage to abolish the practice in their own community and numerous others countrywide. 2, 3, 4 4 From \"Sacrilege\" to Sustainability: Reforestation and Organic Farming in Forikrom, Ghana; January 1999 Easton, P. Young people in Ghana bring various community groups together to address deforestation and other local problems. A newly formed young people's association succeeds in afforestation, agro-forestry, organic farming, adult education and training by working with local leaders and linking with the institute of adult education, forestry department and international development agencies. 3, 6, 7 5 Burkina Faso: \"Literacy for the Little Ones\" in Nomgana; February 1999 Easton, P. The Manegbzange association in Burkina Faso initiated an alternative approach to primary schooling and adult education by teaching in the written local Moore language; they developed a curriculum around agriculture and research into local cultural dimensions, involved parents in school management and 'local resource people' in classroom learning. The outcomes suggest higher student success rates compared with schools that use French as the only language of instruction. 3 6 Village Bankers: The Experience of Fand\u00e8ne, Senegal; March 1999 Easton, P. The Fand\u00e8ne Young People's Association (AJF) in Senegal supports community efforts to address youth migration to urban areas, cyclical recurrence of food shortages, lack of access to institutional networks and lack of local participation in development initiatives. The development of a locally designed and managed savings and loans network expands rapidly to other communities in the region and promotes economic development, women's empowerment, farming and technical skills training programs. 3, 6 7 Literacy and Local Governance in a Rural Community: The Experience of Nwodua, Ghana; April 1999 Easton, P. et al. The Nwodu Development Committee initiative in Ghana establishes new and improved forms of local governance. The association works through sector committees, one each for adult literacy, primary health care, food processing, agro-forestry, vocational instruction, agriculture training, and road construction management. 2, 3 8 Nurturing the Environment on Senegal's West Coast; May 1999 Easton, P. et al. Drought, over-stocking, forest fires and intensive cropping have endangered the flora and fauna surrounding the natural reserve of Ker Cupaam, situated in the \"Petite C\u00f4te\" region of Senegal. The local women's initiative launched during 1988 is an indigenous effort to preserve the environment and expand the tourist industry. The key activities relate to a cooperative distribution network for firewood and fodder, alternate energy sources, tree nurseries and self-sufficiency in cooking fuel. 3, 4, 6 9 The Development of an Agricultural Union in Mali: Increasing Levels of Local Empowerment; June 1999 Easton, P. et al. A cooperative union in Mali emerges from village level associations with 'traditional' institutional structure and 'modern' functions. The Union of Cotton and Food Crops Producers operates bilingually in Bambara and French, enhances local capacity and increases participation of village organizations. It coordinates food production and marketing related financial, managerial and training activities for its members. 2, 3, 6 No IK Notes title Author(s) Summary Referenced in lead articles66Local Pathways to Global Development 10 Indigenous Healing of War-Affected Children in Africa; July 1999 Green, E.C.; Honwana, A. Indigenous healers and community leaders assist war-affected children to recover from trauma through healing rituals. Successful community-based healing approaches for children in Angola and Mozambique demonstrate the need for building on indigenous healing practices when helping to reintegrate children into society and suggest partnerships between indigenous healing approaches and donor assisted, foreign psychological interventions. Because efforts to address emotional, mental and social needs of children affected by war or ethnic conflict are still in the preliminary stage, study of indigenous healing practices can help develop culturally appropriate approaches to support victims. 9 11 Education and Koranic Literacy in West Africa; August 1999 Easton, P. et al. Koranic schooling is a long-standing parallel system of non-formal education Africa. Koranic schooling includes 'practical literacy', 'Islamic science', multi-tiered informal learning systems, some formal school components and links with higher education institutions in Africa as well as strong links to Islamic social and economic networks across the continent. 3 12 Cultural Resources and Maternal Health in Mali; September 1999 Clemmons, L.; Coulibaly, Y. The Africare's Child Survival Project in the District of Dioro in the Segou Region of Southern Mali conducted action-oriented research to investigate knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding maternal health, pregnancy and childbirth, highlighting the need for open dialogues within the community about maternal health, use of culturally relevant methods to educate about pregnancy and recognition of the role of appropriate media (stories, folk songs etc.). 4 13 Sahelian Languages, Indigenous Knowledge and Self-Management ; October 1999 Easton, P. Literacy programs in Burkina Faso increasingly recognize multi- lingual, indigenous knowledge-based primary education and the role of community managed literacy networks. The use of local language-oriented literacy programs has led to higher achievement levels among students, economic initiatives by the women, local and regional language publications and increased adult literacy. 3 14 Grassroots Dissemination of Research in Africa: Collecting and Connecting; November 1999 Easton, P. The Achieving Basic Education and Literacy Project and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa describe their experience in designing, disseminating and decentralizing development research with the aim of building local capacity. The specific project initiatives address questions such as: how often is African researchers' work shared with the audience that can actually benefit and learn from the research? What are the channels of communication and what are the necessary means required to maximize research impact and effectiveness? 2, 3, 6 15 Health: Indigenous Knowledge, Equitable Benefits ; December 1999 Moran, K. Shaman Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has established a benefit sharing relationship with Nigerian scientific institutions, village communities and traditional healers. The company focuses on more efficient drug discovery and development processes while ensuring benefits (IPR related and commercial) to collaborating countries, cultures and communities. The case demonstrates how benefits can be derived by linking indigenous medicinal systems with modern medical institutions. 5, 6, 8 16 Senegal: Grassroots Democracy in Action; January 2000 Easton, P. The Senegalese NGO TOSTAN provides local democracy and human rights education, involving women, men, children and elders within the local community. Training modules developed jointly by NGO and communities focus on rural women's non- formal education, income generation and health education. Because of this initiative, women have taken leadership in conflict- resolution, local communities have developed new criteria for evaluating political candidates; women closely monitor national legislation on women's rights; communities have started garden projects and fruit cooperatives. 3 67 17 Regional Planning, Local Visions: Participatory Futuring in West Africa; February 2000 Easton, P. Farmers, women and other local community members participated in developing a 'System's Perspective' for regional planning, identifying long-term trends likely to affect local communities. A series of forecasting exercises conducted across a number of West African countries identified the following issues: ecological and economic changes; urban-rural linkages; need to rely on local resources and ingenuity; strengthening of family structures; translation of government documentations and manuals into local languages; development of village cooperatives, inter-village federations for political participation. 3 18 Participatory Management and Local Culture: Proverbs and Paradigms; March 2000 Easton, P. Local proverbs that encapsulate local attitudes and insights with regard to themes like accountability, performance and social responsibility can provide useful guidance to understand local perceptions, preferences and experience with respect to these themes and in evaluating the related performance of public programs and projects. 3 19 Indigenous Knowledge and Intellectual Property Rights; April 2000 Prakash, S. This IK Notes highlights some of the ongoing debates about the benefits and limitations of IPR regimes. The recommendations include integration of indigenous customary laws with intellectual property rights through sui generis systems, documentation of indigenous knowledge within the public domain, and development of institutional benefit sharing frameworks. 6, 8 20 Reinventing Apprenticeship and Rites of Passage: An Entry into the Urban Economy in Sub-Saharan Africa ; May 2000 Easton, P. The initiation of young people into adult life and its routines and skills is common practice in most rural communities in Africa. Similar traditional support systems are absent in the life of urban street children. Three initiatives attempt to adapt traditional institutions to the needs of the urban youth: the network of \"informal schools\" in urban slum communities in and around Nairobi; the efforts of the Street Kids International organization that build on the knowledge and strengths of the street children in Sudan; and innovative initiatives to support informal sector artisans in Senegal. 3 21 Indigenous Knowledge for Development : Two Years Down the Road; June 2000 Prakash, S. This IK Notes reviews activities, achievements and challenges of the 'Indigenous Knowledge for Development Program' after two years. The next steps identified are: intensification of ongoing efforts to mainstream IK in development; establishment of communities of practice; and strengthening local alliances to learn from each other. 10 22 IK Goes to School. Potentials and Perils of Community Education in the Western Sahel; July 2000 Easton, P.; Capacci, C.; Kane, L. The incorporation of IK into formal education systems and linking literacy initiatives to community needs in Africa are progressing slowly. Some national governments have begun testing non-formal community approaches to education with content in local languages. Some of these initiatives encourage community participation in areas of financial, administrative and curricular planning of primary and secondary education. 3 23 Seeds of Life: Women and Agricultural Biodiversity in Africa; August 2000 Easton, P.; Ronald, M. Bean farming women in Kenya play a critical role in preserving genetic variety and agro-biodiversity. Mono-cropping compares to traditional Kenyan agriculture practices by reducing diversity of seed stocks and food security. Recognizing and understanding women's knowledge in this area could help to reverse such trends. 3, 4, 6, 7 24 Strengthening Traditional Technical Knowledge: The Sugar Cane Wine Example; September 2000 Ngula, L.; Khonde, B. Charles, P.; Bazabana, J.-J. Communities in the D.R. Congo transfer knowledge of the sugar cane winemaking process through selective, informal apprenticeship and knowledge sharing. Only community elders and women were allowed to participate in the final processing. The analysis suggests to strengthen IK by linking it with modern knowledge to improve efficient and timely supply of quality raw material, product development and marketing. 6 68Local Pathways to Global Development 25 Mali: Indigenous Knowledge - Blending the New and the Old; October 2000 Easton, P.; Belloncle, G. A research team in Mali evaluating an ongoing literacy program suggests involving traditional leaders and community elders in promoting literacy. The Ministry of Education supports the use of village-based literacy-training modules emphasizing technical content, needs assessment, and awareness of IK based problem- solving approaches. 3, 8 26 Traditional Medicine and AIDS ; November 2000 Bodekar, G.; Kabatesi D.; King, R.; Homsey, J. In proposing an 'African Solution' for combating AIDS in Africa, this article outlines the need for integrating traditional medicine into broader efforts for HIV/AIDS prevention and discusses ways to improve stakeholder networking in Southern Africa. 5, 6 27 Uganda: Information Technology and Rural Development; December 2000 Prakash, S. The multi-purpose community telecenter in Nakaseke has introduced new information and communication technologies to stimulate rural development by facilitating access to information, learning resources, computer applications training, and communication technologies, document local farming practices and improve health services. 3, 6 28 Indigenous Knowledge and Local Power: Negotiating Change in West Africa; January 2001 Easton, P. An evaluation study of ongoing literacy initiatives in Mali suggests that literacy projects were often not successful because of the following factors: the rural participants had few opportunities to apply knowledge of written Bambara in the rural environment; local government and agricultural services did not always use local language; schools relied on French as the medium of instruction; and there was a lack of credit or investment opportunities to match the creation of locally run enterprise a viable alternative. 6 29 West Africa Languages: Medium and Message; February 2001 Easton, P. An analysis of the structure and lexicon of the Hausa language suggests that understanding a local language can be helpful for the development process, as they reflect specific cultural experiences. 3 30 Indigenous Knowledge and HIV/AIDS: Ghana and Zambia; March 2001 Naur. M. A comparison of Ghana and Zambia identifies the responsibility of national governments in developing local language-based training approaches for traditional healers and community specific communication and education strategies to respond to the HIV/AIDS crisis. 3, 6 31 Malicounda-Bambara: The Sequel, The Journey of a Local Revolution; March 2001 Easton, P. After linking with elders and other community members, Bambara women successfully abolished the harmful indigenous practice of FGM in their community. Through regional networking and education initiatives, the women succeeded in other communities and even other countries as well. 3, 4 32 African Traditional Healers: The Economics of Healing; May 2001 Leonard, K. L. Despite the expansion of modern medicine, traditional healers are still popular in Africa and receive fees compatible or in some cases higher compared with modern medicine practitioners. The 'pay- only-if-cured' and outcome contingent contract followed by the traditional healers provides credibility and appropriate incentives to attract a range of patients. 6 33 Mozambique: Repairing the Ravages of War: Initiation Societies and Community Schooling; June 2001 Easton, P. Mahade, A.; Ahmed,. Z. The Mozambican NGO entitled, \"Children, Family and Development\" demonstrates that community based efforts to blend school content with the traditional initiation model, carried out under local directions for young people uprooted by armed conflict, has led to higher school enrollment and participation of community members in curriculum reform. 3 34 Tanzania: Communicating Local Farming Knowledge; July 2001 Mgumia, A.H. The Uluguru Mountains Agricultural Development Project works with farmers to document and disseminate their knowledge to other farmers in the region. The multi-disciplinary research relies on development of appropriate education and communication material and farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing. 6 69 35 Ethiopia: Traditional Medicine and the Bridge to Better Health; August 2001 Lambert, J. Deforestation, cultivation, over-grazing, burning, erosion etc., threaten medicinal and food plants and other natural resources that have long sustained populations in Sub-Saharan Africa. The growing scarcity of medicinal plant species requires urgent recognition of their vital contribution to human and livestock health in Africa. The key recommendations are to blend modern sciences and IK and strengthen institutional capacity to preserve medicinal plant cultivation practices. 4, 5, 6 36 Eritrea: The Process of Capturing Indigenous Knowledge; September 2001 Pidatala, K. This IK Notes describes systematic efforts to document and validate indigenous knowledge across regions in Eritrea, recommending individual and group training to document and analyze IK and involving local academic institutions in Eritrea. 6 37 HIV/AIDS: Traditional Healers, Community Self-assessment, and Empowerment; October 2001 Naur. M. Traditional healers and indigenous knowledge can empower communities to deal with social consequences of HIV/AIDS, and contribute to allocating government resources to the most effective use. As an example, South African social mobilization efforts highlight the significance of community-based human rights approaches based on Paulo Freire's education principles. 6 38 Senegal: Indigenous Language and Literature as a Non-profit Business - The ARED Story; November 2001 Easton, P.; Fagerberg- Diallo, S. The lack of local literature is a major constraint to successful literacy training. The Pullar literacy and cultural awareness movement demonstrates an increasing demand for texts in Pullar. Local language material produced, includes literacy and numeracy manuals; novels and other literature; treatises on IK and religious practices and texts for management training. 3 39 Burkina Faso: Integrating Indigenous and Scientific Rainfall Forecasting; December 2001 Roncoli, C.; Ingram, K.; Jost, C. This IK note compares traditional and scientific rainfall forecast methods, showing that farmers rely on both, indigenous and modern forecasting approaches. 6, 8 40 Maternal Health Care in Rural Uganda: Leveraging Traditional and Modern Knowledge Systems ; January 2002 Musoke, M. G. N. The UNFPA-supported Rural Extended Services and Care for Ultimate Emergency Relief Project improved the referral service for pregnant women by training Traditional Birth Attendants, equipping them with walkie-talkies, transport and regular blood supply. Mortality rates have dropped by 50 percent in three years. 3, 4, 10 41 Eritrea: Eliminating a Harmful Traditional Practice; February 2002 Wolff, P. H. The practice of female genital mutilation is common in many African communities and historically, affected women have often approved of it for various reasons. The experience of the Eritrea liberation forces suggests that imposing sanctions against the practice is ineffective as this alienates the communities and drives the practice underground. Working with Traditional Birth Attendants, educating them about inherent health risks have proven to be more appropriate and effective. 6 42 Developing Indigenous Knowledge in Francophone Africa - A Four-Nation Overview; March 2002 Easton, P.; Nikiema, E.; Essama, S. Ethnic diversity, national policies and their implementation, and the role of NGOs determine the integration of IK into development. Local institutions, (e.g., schools) should play a bigger role to engage in IK-related activities in the context of participation and decentralization efforts of governments to foster IK integration for better development results. 4 43 Rural Seed Fairs Southern Tanzania - Why Southern Zone Rural Seed Fairs?; April 2002 Mponda, O.K.K.; Kafiriti, E.M. Rural Seed Fairs in Tanzania help build a network of researchers, extension agents, small farmers, breeders and national seed producers. The short, medium and long-term benefits are an increase in the availability of crop varieties, enhanced regional cooperation, increased agricultural productivity and food security, higher income and indigenous knowledge exchange. 2, 6 70Local Pathways to Global Development 44 Uganda: The Contribution of Indigenous Vegetables to Household Food Security; May 2002 Rubaihayo, E. B. Traditional vegetables grown mostly by women in kitchen or home gardens or collected are part of the staple diet in rural households in many African countries. Policies on household food security, however, do not emphasize their cultivation. Urban and rural consumers would benefit from understanding their impact on health, the local economy and environment. 4, 6 45 Using Indigenous Knowledge to Raise Agricultural Productivity: An example from India; June 2002 Prakash, S. Farmers collaborated to raise agricultural productivity in the farmer driven Sodic Lands Reclamation project in Uttar Pradesh. By building on their own experiences, they reclaimed sodic land for re-cultivation. As a result, cropping intensity increased multi-fold, economic activities expanded, wage rates doubled, out-migration declined and land value increased. 4, 6, 7 46 Managing Natural Resources along the Mozambican Shoreline: The Role of Myths and Rites; July 2002 Easton, P.; Dava, F.; Ahmed, Z. Mozambique has rich natural resources but urbanization, falling crop prices, economic decline and severe climate changes affect sustainability of natural resources. Local institutions, informal regulations, myths and rituals and a collective management system have been critical in managing natural resources. A successful case is the management of the dense mussel colonies through a combination of family supervision and community council monitoring, pointing to significant differences between indigenous and 'modern' approaches to NRM. 3, 7 47 Using the Indigenous Knowledge of Jatropha: The use of Jatropha curcas oil as raw material and fuel; August 2002 Henning, R. K. The 'Jatropha Curcas' plant initiative promotes economic, ecological and energy development. The initiative proposes to preserve the local knowledge and practice of the multiple uses of Jatropha in erosion control and soil improvement, poverty reduction and fostering of renewable energy by promoting women as knowledge bearers. 6 48 Ethiopia: Potential of Traditional Social Insurance for Supporting Health Care; September 2002 Haile, D. 'Eder' is an established community-based indigenous institution that serves as a 'social financing mechanism' in Ethiopia. In many rural areas, Eder provides medical assistance to local families. These non-profit institutions build on principles of solidarity, friendship and mutual assistance, provide incentives to participate and enforce certain community norms. 6, 7 49 Farmer Experimenters: Self-developed Technology; October 2002 Bunch, R; Canas, M. The Association of Advisors for a Sustainable, Ecological and People-Centered agriculture documents the large and significant number of farmer innovations in technology. The IK Notes discusses, what kind of technologies farmers experiment with; what technologies are successful; and what kind of farmer's network and market support is required. 6, 8 50 Eritrea: Collective Responsibility for War Orphans; November 2002 Wolff, P. H. The indigenous community networks that took responsibility for orphans and destitute children were destroyed during the conflict years in Eritrea. The IK Notes discusses the significance of 'grassroots safety nets' for children and the nation-wide initiative of the Social Service Agency. The initiative emphasizes reunifications of war orphans with their extended families. For those children whose families cannot be located, the plan supports the creation of group homes. 9 51 Traditional Medicine in Tanga Today - The Ancient and Modern Worlds Meet; December 2002 Scheinman, D. Traditional healers, modern physicians, and health workers have created the Tanga AIDS working group. The NGO builds on indigenous and modern medicinal knowledge to address HIV/AIDS. The local herbalists have developed affordable and effective treatments for opportunistic diseases of HIV/AIDS. TAWG is seeking international collaboration for the scientific validation of the medicinal plants. 4, 5, 6, 8 71 52 Ethiopia: A Qualitative Understanding of Local Traditional Knowledge and Medicinal Plant Use; January 2003 Fassil, H. A study conducted in Ethiopia aimed to gain insight into the local distribution of knowledge related to traditional health and the uses of various medicinal plants among men and women in rural communities. IK is not only residing with the professional traditional healers but also with women who provide the first line of health care to their families. The study calls for a community- oriented, multidisciplinary research approach to this subject 6 53 The Economics of African Indigenous Knowledge; February 2003 Nwokeabia, H. Lack of incentives for individual healers and traditions have led to lack of knowledge sharing within local communities and resultant slow innovation processes. Opportunity cost, disclosure of secrets, monopoly rent, innovation and discovery are determinants for the decision making of traditional healers when considering to share their knowledge. 2 54 Traditional Medicine Practice in Contemporary Uganda; March 2003 Weisheit, A.; Moses, M The authors propose a higher integration of traditional medicine into the public primary health care system and support to its development. The key strategies outlined are: conservation of rare medical plants and information exchange; development of legal and institutional frameworks for the integration of traditional practices into the mainstream health practices; product standardization, processing and packaging; and training of traditional healers as community educators. 5, 6 55 Indigenous Knowledge: the East Africa-South Asia Learning Exchange - An example of South- South Cooperation; April 2003 Prakash, S. An Asia - Africa partnership promoted by the Africa Region of The World Bank is an effort to document and disseminate local knowledge across communities and regions. Lessons learned are integrated into the projects of the participants. 6 56 Ghana: Kanye Ndu Bowi - An Indigenous Philosophical Context for Conflict Management; May 2003 Fred- Mensah, B. K. The 'Buem' community sustains harmony within the social system despite ongoing conflicts and implements through a conflict resolution system that imposes intrinsic rewards and sanctions. The main recommendation is to synthesize relevant aspects of modern and indigenous in conflict management interventions. 9 57 Cultural Rights for Zimbabwe's Sui Generis Legislation; June 2003 Frommer, C. The study of plant genetic resources and traditional medicinal knowledge highlights the role of indigenous knowledge and how it is accessed, preserved, used, shared and valued in both customary and non-customary ways in Africa. 6 58 Grassroots' Women's Approach to Capacity Building; July 2003 Shroff- Mehta P. A woman farmer and livestock keeper contributes to transforming the economic activities and livelihood strategies of her village and surrounding areas in Gujarat, India. The example of her thriving local livestock enterprise management demonstrates her understanding of community context, needs and constraints and her ability to find unique and sustainable solutions; and the building of community capacity by linking local and external knowledge. 2, 4, 6 59 Adzina: An Indigenous System of Trial by Jury on the Ghana-Togo Border; August 2003 Fred- Mensah, B. K. Bate Kate and Adzina are institutional mechanisms developed by local communities in the Buem traditional area in Ghana. They represent an indigenous system of trial-by-jury on the Ghana-Togo border with its own procedural, institutional and community dimensions of dispute settlement and conflict resolution. The presence and interventions of community elders with 'supernatural wisdom' and opinions of community members is critical in arbitration and resolution of civil and criminal disputes. 9 60 Institutional Constraints in Promoting IK: Community Access to Social Networks and Formal Institutions; September 2003 Shroff- Mehta P. The analysis of sixteen case studies of community innovators shows how community innovators overcome family/community, seasonal and institutional constraints and outlines their primary strategy: collaboration with social networks representing NGOs, government agencies, academic institutions and other communities in the region. 2 72IK Notes 1 October 1998Rural people in Africa have always maintained a certain formidable power that guards their indigenous institu-tions and knowledge systems, thereby maintaining some level of self-reliance. This measurable power is based uponthe capacity to resist what they do not have a voice in. Recent reports from do- nor agencies documenting the failure ofprojects over the past twenty years to initiate sustainable action and make a positive difference in poverty levels inAfrica tend to substantiate this thesis. These decades of failed visions did not happen because donor agency staffwere uncommitted, nor because Afri- can communities were uninterested. They happened because local people'svoices\u2014their involvement and control were thought to be part of the goal of development, rather than the processof development. The power of the rural people to re- sist the development projects that re-gard them in this manner, and include them as only \"beneficiaries,\" but not as \"actors,\" is admittedly a power that hasnot expanded their resource base; and there is now, of course, an increasing fragility of this resource base in termsof environmental and economic dete- rioration. Despite these almost paralyz- ing problems, many people and groupsthroughout Africa strongly believe thatpositive new development can happen, but only if the people themselves stay in control of their resources, econo- mies, and culture. This capacity for local control only happens, however, when people are al-lowed to internally work from, expand, and change their own institutions and knowledge systems. Thus, the opportu-nities surrounding initiatives to bring together indigenous knowledge sys- tems and natural resource conserva-tion are immense\u2014however, so are the dangers. The opportunity is the possi- bility of working from within, conse-quently establishing expandable natu- ral resource initiatives which are con- gruent, and therefore sustainable, withexisting institutions and systems. The danger is that indigenous knowledge items or outputs\u2014identification ofplans, or methods of planting, for in- stance\u2014may be identified with no re- gard for their other components ofrules and roles\u2014which are no less im- portant because they often seem invis- ible to the outsider. When this particu-lar incorporation happens, the owner- ship factors that are critical to both sustainability and self-reliance begin tofade away; and local people find them- selves even more bereft of their self-re- liant heritage.Indigenous Knowledge Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Overview This article was written by Paula Donnelly-Roark, who was Senior Social Scientist in the World Bank's Africa Region.73 It is the intent of this article then to briefly define some of the dangers so that they may be avoided, and define some of the opportunities so that they may be more thoroughly andsolidly developed. To accomplish this objective, some issues are briefly outlined below which seem to contain strong ele- ments of both danger and opportunity. Defining how far we have come Over the past 40 years, the international development com- munity has primarily operated on the premise that input-output development models which offer fast, efficient trans- fer of goods and structural entities, were the key elements in a country's economic and social development. However,failure of these programs and institutions to achieve sus- tainability and effectiveness, assumed to be dependable by- products of the input-output model, has finally brought intoserious question the efficacy of this approach. Expanding perception of this new reality has initiated a paradigm change away from mechanistic top-down models primarilyconcerned with economic development, toward dynamic participatory approaches concerned with all facets of hu- man development. The power of this paradigm shift is thatit not only provides new solutions; it also provides new in- sights as to what are the problems. The key to understanding how far we have come in em- bracing these new perceptions is to focus on how much has changed in terms of defining what the problems are. Here the \"necessity for sustainability\" has accomplished what\"equity\" and \"basic human needs\" concepts, despite their efforts over several decades, have been unable to do \u2014 make the case that people-oriented, participatory development isnot only preferable from a social justice perspective, but is also necessary from an effectiveness standpoint. However, this emerging consensus on what are the nature of the prob-lems, does not necessarily indicate similar agreement on how to solve these problems, and indeed there is no such agreement. The danger here is of two kinds. First, those who have been advocating these changes for so many decades may continue to assume that there has been no success becauseit has not been total; not realizing that while enduring poli- cies of the input-output era may not have yet changed, \"voice\" has indeed been achieved for an alternative view-point. The alternative danger is to assume that because there is emerging consensus on what the problems are, there will be a similar consensus on how to solve these prob-lems. Thus, it seems the opportunity and the way forward depends upon keeping in mind two things: on the one handbecause \"voice\" has been achieved and therefore people are listening and willing to collaborate, increased efforts need to be placed on the how-to; on the other hand, pilot \"how-to\"modalities cannot assume that people who now agree on what needs to change, have similar perspectives on how things need to be changed. Therefore, these pilot initiativesfeaturing indigenous knowledge systems and institutions will need to spell out very clearly both the conceptual frame- works and power/control implications so that differences inperceptions and approach can be recognized and mutually attended to, rather than buried in a barrage of rhetoric. Assumptions make a difference The critical difference in defining how to go about change is dependent upon whether one assumes tha economic and so- cial development can be internally initiated or whether onebelieves that it must be externally induced. The interna- tional development community and African governments, with their long-standing preferences for input-output mod-els have obviously ascribed to externally induced modes and models. As the notion of sustainability began to emphasize the importance of participant ownership and the resultingresponsibility, participation initiatives have become increas- ingly popular. Here, however, donor organizations have of- ten assumed that participation processes were to be used toinduct marginalized groups of people into the presently dominant Western-type economic and cultural systems\u2014 but with more sensitivity and within their own time-frames.This essentially leaves the assumptions surrounding the ne- cessity for externally induced change untouched and unreflected upon. The possibility that existing indigenous African institu- tions\u2014often distinguished as \"customary\" or \"informal\"\u2014 could be a base for internally initiated development hasbeen only rarely explored. However, the recent development focus on capacity and institution building has begun to ini- tiate re-evaluation of the efficacy of these institutions. Forinstance, Mamadou Dia, in a 1991 paper on \"why culture matters\" proposed that recognition and utilization of Africa's own institutions are essential to the continent's fu-ture progress. A subsequent regional study entitled African Management for the 90s (AM90s )\" was designed to investi- gate the efficacy of utilizing indigenous institutions, in par-ticular the management and organization practices. The study's results shed definitive light on how culture and in- digenous institutions matter in terms of effecting more posi-tive governance emphasizing participatory processes, creat- ing efficient but culturally congruent productivity, and74IK Notes Number implementing equitable growth strategies. At the same time, the results begin to point to expanding levels of dis- connect at all formal institutional levels and African civilsociety. The danger that is faced here is that of unwittingly com- pounding the existing level of disconnect. This is a strongpossibility if attempts are made to utilize indigenous natu- ral resource systems, without explicitly eschewing external change models at both the micro and macro levels. On theother hand, while opportunities abound for necessary re- connect activities and expansion of indigenous knowledge systems, for this to be successful, conceptual frameworksmust change, and the actual work will be, to a great extent, complex and uncharted. Distinguishing among participation strategies Approaches used to achieve grassroots participation are nu- merous and diverse in their objectives, operational strate- gies, and results. Assessing levels of control, and resultingsustainability, provides participation standards that sepa- rate action from rhetoric. This categorization, in turn, pro- vides a measurement typology that allows facilitating agen-cies to be honest about participation initiatives and results. This capacity is particularly crucial when groups decide to set aside externally-induced models of development and be-gin working from internal initiatives and institutions. To create basic standards, participation strategies are di- vided into four major categories. They are then further clas-sified according to the amount of control which rests with the actor/participants. This classification, based upon mea- surement of power/control transfer, explains how differentparticipatory strategies work and what they can be expected to accomplish from the perspective of both the \"actor/par- ticipant\" and the \"external agent.\" The basic strategies andcontrol focus are as follows. Mobilization strategy The project of development action is chosen and designed by outsiders, usually by specialists within the initiating donor or government institutions, before people's involvement be-gins. The program leadership then \"mobilizes\" the \"tar- geted beneficiaries\" to endorse, collaborate with, and adopt the decisions taken. This strategy leaves full control in thehands of the external agent.Community/institutions development strategy Social surveys are carried out or meetings held to achieve abetter understanding of community/institutional percep- tions about a specific problem which has been identified as a constraint to development. Local groups may then be in-volved, using participatory techniques, in planning and car- rying out solutions to a problem. Actor/participants share specified amounts of control with the external agent, but de-cisions as to the actual amount often rests externally. Organizing strategy Marginalized groups organize themselves, or are organized, to increase their strength and influence in areas of decision- making that affect them. Cooperatives, rural unions, andsome community-based NGOs are examples of this strategy. Actor/participants share specified amounts of control with external agents or with elected office holders. Empowerm ent strategy Community-based groups, often assisted by an outside fa-cilitator, initiate a learning/empowerment process that en- ables them to define their own goals and objectives; assess the implications of options open to them; decide and assumeresponsibility for actions to achieve their agreed to objec- tives. The empowerment strategy places control in the hands of the actor/participants, who claim both their rightsand responsibilities. For sustainable results, the critical question is: Where does the control rest ? The strategy of \"mobilization\" keeps the control solely in the hands of project managers and is therefore easy to initiate and manage. But, because local control is so minimal, this approach seldom engenders asustainable base. \"Community development\" and \"organiz- ing strategies\" share some levels of control with partici- pants and are therefore capable of generating adequate lev-els of sustainability, but only if (a) project management pro- cesses adequately match indigenous styles; and (b) the project output meets a strong community need, such as im-proved water supply. \"Empowerment\" strategies enable the participants to create and design their own initiatives as well as implement them, thereby placing maximum controland responsibility in participant hands, with consequent high levels of local sustainability. But maximum control can also increase marginalization. Each of these participation strategies, in addition to their control quotient, has what we may call an \"action intent.\" In selecting a strategy it is essential to clarify this basic ac-tion intent. And critical to the success of a project is an un-175 derstanding of how the action intent is preserved or dis- torted during implementation. Mobilization strategies use only specified portions of the participatory process to con- sult; both the community and organizing strategies use it to negotiate ; and empowerment strategies use it to create au- tonomy . Understanding the action intent of the various par- ticipation strategies, and often subtle but critical differences between them, can help us to decide where the locus of con- trol needs to rest for the maximum sustainability, and howwe can keep it there. The danger here is that to work effectively with indig- enous knowledge systems, both negotiation and empower-ment strategies must be used and sustained for long periods of time, not only at the grassroots level, but also at the policy levels. Sustaining one or the other of these two modeswithout slipping back to consultation levels is most difficult. On the other hand, the opportunity is that the necessity of this objective will engender extensive new \"how-to\" knowl-edge that will make future efforts in this area much easier to accomplish.Conclusion In summary, participatory approaches necessary for effec- tively working with rather than against indigenous knowl-edge systems do not make for easy analysis or simple solu- tions. However, these participatory processes do capture the complexity and inter-dependency of the issues themselves.And they effectively outline the required complex problem- solving processes for sustainable solutions. More impor- tantly, it is a first step in returning African development ini-tiatives to internal rather than external forces.76IK Notes 2 November 1998Sustainable Indigenous KnowledgeSystems in AgricultureZimbabwe Case Study This study researched Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) in agricul- ture in Zimbabwe's rural areas, focus-ing on crop farming in the Tonga of Binga District in Matebeleland's North Province, and livestock in the Kalangatribe of the Plumtree District in Matebeleland's South Province. The study aimed to uncover some of theknowledge that indigenous people used to survive under the harsh climatic and physical conditions of the region. Specific goals in both the Binga and Plumtree Districts were: (i) to uncover the socio-political, religious, economicand environmental implications of IKS in farming; (ii) to identify and analyze the methods of natural resources man-agement; and (iii) to assess the value and limitations of IKS in agriculture. Methodology Information was collected through lit- erature review, personal interviews with farmers, site visits, group discus-sions, and the use of Village-Based Re- searchers (VBR). The VBRs prepared the community for the field study andfacilitated discussions. The field study in Binga District at Kamaziyo visited about 40 homes; in Plumtree, about100 homes were covered.Resource utilization In the Binga District, the men control the family resources and they must seethat these resources are distributed and used well. These resources include land, water, vegetation, livestock, andfamily labor. Land is distributed to new families by the chief of the area who, in consultation with other elders, distrib-utes the land for settlement and farm- ing. The management of the land re- sources in the Binga district is done bythe Village Development Committees set up by the government in the 1980s. People in the Plumtree District are mainly engaged in subsistence farming and animal husbandry. While timber is abundant, the residents feel that theseresources are not being used effectively to generate employment and provide a source of income. It is used primarilyfor firewood and the construction of houses and fences. IKS practices IKS exist in both areas and are still sus- taining local people in crop farming\u2014 including land preparation, grain selec-tion, planting, harvesting, as well as grain storage and livestock manage- ment.

Family heads converged at the chief's place every spring to discuss grazing arrangements for thatseason. The beginning and ending dates of grazing in speci- fied pastures were also established. Headmen and kraal- heads then monitored villager compliance with these rules. Both the Binga and Plumtree communities placed three values on IKS. First, knowledge is power. People who have stayed in Plumtree for a number of years knew the rainfallpatterns and when to plant crops to produce better yields. The second value of IKS was that of a knowledge base that determines the supply and distribution of food, as well asthe division of labor. The third importance of IKS was at- tributable to the continuous supply of resources for sustain- able life. Conclusions During his field research, the author discovered the value that indigenous communities place on IKS. Both the Tongasand Kalangas value IKS as a knowledge base and for deter- mining food production and labor division between gender and age groups, and as part of community survival. He rec-ommends that IKS should complement, rather than com- pete with Western kowledge systems in the implementation of projects. The lesson for development agencies should beto investigate first what indigenous people know and have, then develop and improve upon indigenous technologies. In the Plumtree District, the people indicated that the re- current droughts\u2014and lack of grass in grazing lands\u2014have made it difficult to rotate grazing as is the traditional prac- tice. Westernization was also threatening IKS. The BingaDistrict pointed out that indigenous farming methods have been substituted with Western methods of farming; crops they traditionally grew have been replaced by cash crops.One of the major limiting factors of IKS is its lack of docu- mentation. African knowledge of indigenous plants and their African names is declining rapidly. IKS is also limitedby its lack of proven scientific procedural explanations. One only hears that it is taboo to do certain things. IKS is also in a precarious position because it depends on those who havethe knowledge sharing it with others. It is also viewed by many young people as obsolete and out of date compared with Western cultural knowledge and practices. The study recommends the following: \u007f Build strong awareness programs to appreciate IKS and its role in resources utilization management. \u007f Research, document, and disseminate detailed informa- tion on IKS. \u007f Promote and transfer IKS to areas with similar character- istics. Exchange visits between groups working on similar projects are one way of achieving this, as are workshops on important IKS issues. \u007f Publish literature on IKS, particularly in the local lan- guage of the targeted communities. \u007f Train development agency staff, especially those that work directly with the indigenous communities. \u007f Capacity building and empowerment of local people to recognize the value of IKS andpromote these systemsthrough: traditional community gatherings; training in research, documentation and the dissemination of IKS; and support from the formal sector, for the indigenouscommunities to develop IKS themselves.78Senegalese Women Remake Their Culture IK Notes 3 December 1998Although for decades the capital of French West Africa, Senegal, like other countries of the Sahel, remains pre-dominantly rural. And while 62 percent of the people reside in rural areas, more than 85 percent of the wealth is in ur-ban centers. As in many countries, dis- advantage accumulates at the level of women and girls. In 1995, female lit-eracy countrywide was just over half the rate for men (23 percent compared to 44 percent), and the discrepancy wasstill greater in rural areas. TOSTAN , literally means \"breaking out of the egg\" in Wolof, the languagespoken by the majority of Senegal's 7.9 million people and is among a number of innovative rural development andwomen's education initiatives that are addressing the problem at its source. It offers an 18-month learning programthat combines basic education in na- tional languages with practical develop- ment issues, and provides rural peoplewith the resources to improve their standard of living while fostering in- creased confidence in their way of life.More than literacy, this breakthrough program offers participants the tools to tackle such community issues ashealth, hygiene and the environment. The program uses six modules that link literacy to life skills in a highly partici-patory process of problem solving. TOSTAN successfully sustains the link between basic education and rural de-velopment, giving adult learners not only literacy and numeracy skills in their national languages but the meansto understand and solve local problems. Several years ago, the TOSTAN NGO responded to the solicitations of village authorities in Malicounda who had seen the impact of its training pro- grams on women in neighboring com-munities and helped this Bambara community of west central Senegal to create its own center. The programplaced special emphasis on the identifi- cation and resolution of common prob- lems, and one of the last training mod-ules in the series addressed issues of women's health and sexuality. Its popu- larity among rural women participantsbroke all records. Shortly after com- pleting their training, the newly liter- ate women of Malicounda decided thatthe problem they wished to address was the custom of female circumci- sion\u2014a longstanding pattern in theBambara/Mandigue and Pulaar com- munities. By informing themselves on practices elsewhere and on the effectsof circumcision on girls' health and sexual life, they developed an arsenal of arguments that eventually convincedThis article is based on research conducted by Senegalese researchers with the support and technical supervision of Peter Easton, Associate Professor, Graduate Studies in Adult Education, Florida State University, and with the ac-tive collaboration of the concerned African communities. The research was carried out under the joint aegis of theClub du Sahel/OECD, the CILSS and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA).79 the village council to abolish the practice officially. In the months May to July 1997\u2014the traditional period for genital cutting on young girls\u2014no such operations were performedin Malicounda for the first time in the community's history. TOSTAN and UNICEF supported the women by organizing a visit from twenty Senegalese journalists to interview themabout their stand. The women performed a play for the visi- tors to illustrate the reasons why they had made this deci- sion and the arguments they had used with other villagers.The visit brought publicity to the issue, but also attracted some threatening comments and criticism from surround- ing communities of the same ethnic group. Saddened butbasically undaunted, the group from Malicounda decided to organize a delegation to two neighboring villages to con- vince women there of the importance of a local decision toabolish genital mutilation. In one of these\u2014the community of Ngerin Bambara\u2014 women who had just completed the Tostan program decidedto endorse the \"oath of Malicounda.\" The President of their Women's Association, herself the daughter of a traditional circumciser, said that her own daughter had hemorrhagedseriously during the operation and that it was time to change. Inhabitants of the second community, Ker Simbara, de- cided that they could not put a stop to the practice without consulting kin in a whole network of neighboring villages. So for a period of eight weeks, two men who had taken partin the TOSTAN program\u2014one a TOSTAN facilitator and the other a 66 year-old Imam (a senior Muslim priest)\u2014trav- eled from village to village to discuss the negative effects offemale circumcision with local people. The men originally had feared that they would be chased out of many of the communities. Instead they discovered that the news ofMalicounda opened doors and hearts, and they heard shock- ing stories from women, speaking out for the first time about what they had experienced. The men returned convinced of the importance of what they had heard and what they were doing. They assisted the women of Malicounda, Ngerin and Ker Simbara in organiz-ing a intervillage conference in Diabougou for all those in- terested. In February 1998, three representatives\u2014the vil- lage chief and two women representatives\u2014from thirteendifferent villages met for two days to discuss the problem and formulated the \"Diabougou Declaration,\" an engage- ment on the part of 8,000 villagers to cease henceforth geni-tal circumcision of girls. Word of this initiative next traveled to the Casamance re- gion of southern Senegal, where another group of villages\u2014these all of Pulaar lineage, an ethnic group practicing geni- tal circumcision on 88 percent of girls\u2014banded together fora similar conference and declaration. Their conference was attended by representatives from 18 communities, by health workers and by the highly respected Imam of MedinaCherif, who assured the women that the Muslim religion does not require girls' circumcision and guarantees women's rights to health and human dignity. Many womenspoke of the harm wrought by this practice. One lamented the death of her two girls following the operation; and a tra- ditional \"cutter\" admitted that a girl had died in her villagethe year before. Other women spoke of problems at child- birth and of painful sexual relationships. The group con- cluded their meeting by issuing their own declaration re-nouncing the practice. The initiative has continued to spread. Early in the pro- cess, President Abdou Diouf of Senegal himself proposedthe \"Oath of Malicounda\" as a model for national adoption. On the heels of the meetings in the Casamance, women in the St. Louis region of Senegal are now preparing for an in-ter-village convocation of their own, to be held in February 1999. The sort of \"active learning\" promoted among women by the TOSTAN program in Senegal seems to have resulted in far-reaching cultural change. Elements that contribute to TOSTAN 's successful impact in education and sustainable development are further examined below. Issues Cultural roots. Combined with the use of national lan- guages, a deep valuing of African culture is the foundation of TOSTAN 's educational program, showing the practical and profound relationship between culture and education. National languages. Although French is Senegal's official language, the government has increasingly encouraged the use of national languages in literacy programs, recognizingthat learning is easier and more effective in the affective do- main of one's own tongue and is likely to facilitate the tran- sition to international languages. Learning in the mothertongue inspires pride, empowering women to speak up in their homes and communities; and pride of place, encourag- ing men to invest in their community rather than migrateto the cities. As well, it eliminates the dissonance that chil- dren educated solely in French often feel within the village household, thereby facilitating intergenerational communi-cation and solidarity. Problem solving is the program's backbone and provides a strong motivator for literacy acquisition. Skills taught inthis five-step process include (i) identifying and analyzing the problem; (ii) studying adapted solutions based on avail-80IK Notes Number able financial, material and human resources, as well as the time factor; (iii) planning the solution: what needs to be ac- complished? when do the steps have to be completed? who isresponsible? what human, material and financial resources are necessary? what are the possible obstacles? (iv) imple- menting the solution; and (v) evaluating the results: Did wesolve the problem? Participation. TOSTAN was developed with villagers in a highly participative ten- year process. Curricular moduleswere based on the stories, proverbs, songs, and cultural tra- ditions of each place gathered by traveling from village to village, listening and recording the oral tradition. The in-structional method maintains a participatory approach and learners often involve their family and the community in the process of problem- solving. Women. With a female illiteracy rate in 1990 of 74.9 per- cent, women are the least educated group in Senegal. Women particularly have been benefiting from TOSTAN 's whole language approach that begins with concrete, rel- evant experiences from their daily lives rather than abstrac- tions. TOSTAN has become a training ground for leadership as women gain confidence, begin to identify problems such as the retrieval of water, and start to make changes in their communities. Yet men are not excluded: nearly one-third ofthe participants are male, and\u2014as the story of Ker Simbara illustrates\u2014they may take many of the initiatives critical to alleviating the burdens that women bear. Process of developing approaches Besides the participatory processes mentioned, learners were also involved in the development of the contents of theprogram through a method of testing, dialogue and feed- back. This was costly at the start but ultimately proved cost-effective due to the success rate of adaptation by otherNGOs. Basic education, a UNESCO brochure on TOSTAN points out, \"strikes a deeper chord in peoples lives than astraightforward literacy project. Understanding how eachmodule will contribute to changing their lives and environ- ment is a powerful motivating factor for learners\". The problem-solving process is basic to the TOSTAN approach and easily adapted to varied environments.Problems encountered In 1987 there were no basic education programs in national languages in Senegal, and two government ministriesshared responsibility for literacy programs which often floundered. Existing programs were little connected to prac- tical life and functioned in a non-literate environment,where skills learned and not practiced were soon lost. The TOSTAN basic education program addressed another basic problem, boredom, by relating literacy to community andpersonal life and developing attractive materials from local concerns. Finding qualified facilitators was not easy at the outset, and there was resistance from participants to theidea of paying the facilitators from local resources. They preferred to use that money for materials or classroom con- struction. TOSTAN graduates are now themselves trained to be facilitators and provide the bulk of staffing. Conclusions The problem-solving skills presented in the first module are used throughout the following modules, which deal succes- sively with hygiene activities, uses of oral rehydrationtherapy and vaccinations, financial and material manage-ment skills, management of human resources, and feasibil- ity studies and income-generating projects. Using these skills, women participants have started a number of smallbusinesses. The TOSTAN methodology has also been used to reach out-of-school children with a curriculum that covers reading, writing, math, problem solving, health and hy-giene, nutrition, family management, children's rights, his- tory, geography, education for peace, leadership skills and group dynamics. Using the participatory approach, adoles-cents learn to produce their own texts. The UNESCO flyer on TOSTAN draws an apt conclusion: \"The availability of a comprehensive program that offersparticipants problem-solving tools and deals with the cru- cial problems of health, hygiene, and the environment is an asset for many regions of Africa faced with high illiteracyrates, especially among women. More focus needs to be put on implementing these well-studied and tested programs rather than developing new ones. TOSTAN has shown that individuals without any formal education, from villages with minimal resources, can improve their lives and envi- ronment through a solid program leading to greater au-tonomy and self-sufficiency.\"381IK Notes 4 January 1999From\" Sacrilege \" to Sustainability\u2014 Reforestation and Organic FarmingGhana Forikrom, a community of 6,000 people in the Techiman District (Brong Ahafo region) of Ghana, is located in an areaof open grassland that its inhabitants claim was once thick forest. Farming, the main occupation, concentrates onmaize, yam, plantain, and cassava for own-consumption and sale at the Techiman market, and for cash cropson tobacco, palm nut and, more re- cently, cashew. The area once produced cocoa, but this practice ended in 1983after fires destroyed most of the cocoa plantations. Further deforestation re- sulted from inappropriate farmingmethods\u2014especially highly mecha- nized cultivation practiced during the 1960s but now abandoned\u2014which un-dermined soil fertility and dried up riv- ers and streams. Forikrom has now turned the corner to reforestation of its environment, but the initiative did not succeed without significant cultural conflict and couldnot have reached the level it has with- out the impetus for new solutions that the conflict produced. A religious dispute over water The problem began with disputes about access to \"Asukantia,\" thestream that had always supplied thetown with water, but was beginning to dry up. It was designated a sacred area by long tradition, and local taboo for-bade visiting the stream on Tuesdays. The restriction was religiously ob- served until 1989, a particularly dryyear in that region of Ghana. During the summer, a new religious sect in the community declared the practiceanachronistic and advised its members to disobey the rule. This \"sacrilege\" im- mediately led to conflict between thenew sect community's tradi- tional authorities, who were respon- sible for enforcing regulations en-shrined in local tradition. The authori- ties charged the sect with offending the gods and provoking the drying-up ofthe water source; the latter in turn de- nounced the heathen practices of the village hierarchy. Matters had reached a flashpoint when a group of young men came for- ward. They wanted to restore peace;and they were also more knowledge- able than their elders about environ- mental relationships, like those be-tween deforestation, drought, and de- clining soil fertility. Led by the organizing secretary (OS) of the local \"Mobisquad\"\u2014a young people's association formed under the National Mobilization Program in 1983to help communities carry out local im-This article was written on the basis of research conducted by Ghanaian, Canadian, and American investigators with the support and technical supervision of Peter Easton, Associate Professor, Gradu-ate Studies in Adult Education, Florida State University, and with the collaboration of the concernedcommunities.

However, this idea did not find favor with the chief and elders, who continued to feel slighted by the sect and re- solved to seek redress in the courts. Still convinced that the solution lay in planting trees at the source, the group decided to try to follow up on its own idea. Fortunately, they enjoyed the advantage of some dy-namic leadership. The OS's mix of schooling and practical experience gave him a critical and innovative perspective on local problems. He had been through primary, middle andvocational training and had served in positions as varied as teacher, government paymaster around Ghana, and sales- man in Nigeria. In addition, he himself had evangelical \"cre-dentials\" as a literature specialist for a missionary society. It soon became apparent, however, that neither he nor the other group members had enough knowledge about the spe-cific challenges of tree farming to succeed in their effort. Their inexperience also made it difficult to win over the tra- ditional authorities. Gaining the knowledge to make a new start Conscious of this handicap, the OS persuaded his colleagues to seek out the knowledge and skills that they lacked. Theyturned first to a senior staff member at the Institute of Adult Education's regional office at Sunyani responsible for extension work in the Brong Ahafo region. He visited thevillage and subsequently helped the group to make several visits to the Forestry School and the Department of Forestry at Sunyani, about 100 km from Forikrom. Each time theyreturned home, they discussed what they had learned with the community, especially with the chief and elders. By the end of 1989 the group had convinced the traditional au-thorities that litigation was not a solution to the community's difficulties. It had also secured support from the Forestry School and the Department of Forestry to startan afforestation project. The project was formally launched in 1990, at a commu- nity forum organized by the group in collaboration with theSunyani office of the Institute of Adult Education. At this meeting, experts from the Forestry School at Sunyani and from Department of Forestry offices at Sunyani andKumasi, with whom the group had been working, took turns explaining the importance of afforestation. They em- phasized its utility as a means to create a shelter beltaround water sources, protect against the vagaries of cli- mate, serve as wind breaks and fire belts around the com-munity, help protect the fertility of the soil, and provide fuelwood resources. Convinced by this presentation, the community's adults endorsed the idea of launching an afforestation project, and thereafter took part in initial lessons on nursery practices given by two forestry officers from Sunyani who served asresource persons. During a series of regular, six-hour field training visits that the officers provided over a period of six months, groups of 30 individuals were taken through the es-sentials of how to prepare land and raise beds, nurse seed- lings, and transplant and tend young plants. A total of about 2,000 people, the bulk of Forikrom's adult population,participated in this training. With technical support from the resource people and a modicum of outside funding from organizations like theUnited Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Adventist Development and Relief Agency, the group next created a nursery to grow new trees, initially for reforesta-tion purposes but increasingly for commercial farming as well. Cashew, palm, and teak were offered for community members to plant on their own farms. By October 1993, theproject had distributed 15,000 seedlings free of charge to many groups that came from other areas to visit the farm. In the process, the OS and ten others acquired sufficientknowledge to become valued resource persons in their own right. The project progressively became a major center of forestry extension for the immediate region. In late 1995, having successfully created a market for teak, palm, and cashew trees, species with very good sales prospects, the project decided to make production and dis-tribution of seedlings a commercial activity; and in early 1996 it saw its first sales of palm trees. Demand for teak seemed likely to expand as farmers in the area continued toplant stands to serve as firebreaks and, looking ahead, as general demand for telegraph and electricity poles ex- panded. As for cashew, its cultivation has generated veryconsiderable interest in and around Forikrom. Within the community, farmers have in recent years planted more than 100 acres, with cashew sales beginning to pick up as thetrees reach maturity. Broadening the impact: environmental protection and organic farming The initiative that sprang from conflict over water sources has had other positive consequences as well. The ForikromEnvironmental Protection Association (EPA), an off-shoot of the afforestation project, gained a measure of celebrity when the Environmental Protection Agency of Ghana used83 the Forikrom branch as a base from which to extend its message of sound environmental practices to communities lying between Techiman and Nkoranza. Starting in 1994,the Forikrom branch of the EPA was invited to a series of workshops on nursery practices and tree maintenance orga- nized by the agency in Kumasi. They then reproduced thesefor local clientele, and Forikrom gradually became the site for a whole series of natural resource management and for- estry training events sponsored by varied donors. A second offshoot of the conflict over water rights has been creation of the Abrono Organic Farming Project (ABOFAP). Conceived in 1992 by the OS and his colleagues,the project was designed to deal with the concerns about declining fertility that underlay the \"Asukantia\" conflict. Its specific objectives were to train young farmers in organiccrop production, to promote the use of composite manure to improve soil quality (and discourage use of chemicals), dry- season methods of vegetable gardening, and mushroom pro-duction. During the latter part of 1990, the OS, accompanied by an unemployed woman from Forikrom (a middle schoolleaver), attended a five-day training session in Kumasi orga- nized by the Africa 2000 Program. Combining twelve hours of classroom study with eighteen hours of practical workand observation on demonstration fields, their learning cov- ered nursery practices, agroforestry, and composite manure making. This experience was followed by participation in anumber of other workshops and site visits that added to their advance knowledge of organic farming methods. The OS concurrently started demonstration farms on his land at Forikrom in order to stimulate interest in organic farming among young people. He began with twenty train- ees\u2014ten male and ten female\u2014all unemployed schoolleavers between the ages of 17 and 25. He divided them into groups of four and set each group working plots near the Asukantia stream By 1996 ABOFAP had trained 130 young people (75 men and 55 women), for the most part unemployed middle school leavers living with their parents, in organic and dry-season vegetable gardening. The three months of training that these individuals received opened an important door to self-employment for them. During the first three-monthcycle, for example, the initial cohort of twenty trainees pro- duced a gross income of \u00a2200,000, or $355, from the sale of vegetables, sharing equally a net income of \u00a2160,000, or$308 (the exchange rate in December 1992 was \u00a2519=$1.00).Except for about 10 percent of the trainees who found farming too difficult and gave up, all participants are now on their own and are doing well. The initial trainees havebranched into cashew farming and are very hopeful about the future. Nearly 200 of them have organized themselves into cooperatives of 6-10 persons each to engage in blockfarming of 1-2 acre plots along the stream. Interestingly, the OS has not assumed a leading position in any of the organizations that he formed and nurtured.Rather, he has encouraged others to participate in their leadership. For example, an elderly non-literate farmer is president of the 2000-member Forikrom AfforestationProject, while the OS serves as secretary and, with three others, as a member of the Executive Committee. Likewise, a 60-year-old farmer who holds a Middle School LeavingCertificate is president of the 90-member Forikrom Envi- ronmental Protection Association. And a 23 year-old sec- ondary school graduate serves as secretary of the 20-mem-ber ABOFAP. Making peace with the community and the environment Major progress has been made in Forikrom in less than a de- cade. New sources of wealth have been developed. But themost important consequences of the Forikrom initiative have in fact been qualitative in nature. The first of these is social comity. Community divisions sown by the dispute be-tween the sect and traditional authorities subsided after the whole community joined hands to develop a shelter belt around the Asukantia stream. The excitement generated inthe community over tree growing, new cash crops, improved implements, and the recognition of their hard work by out- side institutions has helped everyone to forget about the ini-tial divisive episode that started it all. No less important has been the emergence of an environ- mentally-conscious community that serves as a model forother towns in the region. During the past six years an effec- tive shelter belt, with four acres of teak and three acres of leucenea, has developed around the Asukantia source andstream. There is now abundant water in the stream, so much so that in recent years people have felt confident enough to use it for dry season gardening as well. In addi-tion, local authorities report that people no longer burn the bush carelessly and, as a result, there have been no bush fires since 1990.84Literacy for the \"Little Ones\" in NomganaBurkina Faso Nomgana is the hub community of a very active inter-village federation in the district of Loumbila, located 30 ki-lometers east of Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso. A local associa- tion dubbed Manegbzanga (\"Develop-ment for All\" in the Moor\u00e9 language) was created in the region over a decade ago by the joint efforts of emigrants re-turning from neighboring C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and a local person who had gone to work for the Swiss NGO, OrganismeSuisse d'Entraide Ouvri\u00e8re (OSEO). In recent years, the association has launched an experimental program us-ing Moor\u00e9 language literacy as the ba- sis for learning French. This has evolved over the past several years andtransformed itself into an alternative strategy of primary schooling. From adult literacy to alternative schooling The effort began, however, with adults. The Manegbzanga Association was confronted early on with the problem of equipping its members\u2014many ofwhom had had limited or no school- ing\u2014 to manage their own growing af- fairs and deal with suppliers of agricul-tural inputs and clients for their prod-This article was written on the basis of research conducted by Burkinabe, Congolese and American investigators with the support and technical supervision of Peter Easton, Associate Professor, GraduateStudies in Adult Education, Florida State University, and with the collaboration of the concerned com-munities.

A person from the community who had become a civil servant and subse-quently become field director for a Swiss NGO, began working with the villagers in 1988 to create an instruc-tional system that would enable adults trained in literacy centers to advance from written Moor\u00e9 to learning spokenand written French. The program achieved a good deal of success and was soon faced with in-creasing demand for enrollment from young people\u2014children and adoles- cents\u2014who had missed primaryschooling or had been forced to drop out. The village literacy committee de- cided at last to accept the challenge ofcreating a program of \"literacy for the little ones\" ( alphab\u00e9tisation des tout petits ). The instructional strategy was developed with the assistance of lin- guists from the University of Ouagadougou. It proceeds from the ac-quisition of reading, writing and arith- metic skills in Moor\u00e9 to learning French and study of the entire primaryschool curriculum. Participating chil- dren complete the equivalent of the pri- mary school program in four years, in-stead of the six prescribed (and often exceeded, due to grade repetition). In addition, they acquire mastery of thewritten form of their own language.IK Notes 5 February 199985 Surprising results Tests administered in December 1996 both in the Moor\u00e9 language school and in the neighboring primary schooldemonstrated that pupils at the center were ahead of those at the area's formal primary school in French and math- ematics, and had in addition, of course, a good mastery ofthe written form of their mother tongue. Interestingly, the level of achievement of the girls in the group (who com- prised a slight majority) was well above that of the boys inthe formal primary school, though below that of boys in the experimental center. These results were further confirmed the following year when the first cohort from the Moor\u00e9 lan-guage school sat for the primary school certificate. The suc- cess rates among the 53 students who took the exam was 53 percent (62 percent for the boys and 44 percent for the girls)compared to a national average of 42 percent for all formal primary schools in Burkina Faso (47 percent in the Oubritenga province) and a higher level of gender inequity. While both the organizers and the community leaders are satisfied with the results of the program to date, they point out several handicaps created by their effort to conform tothe formal primary school regime and ensure full equiva- lence with its diplomas. The rigidity of pre-established schedules and time alloca- tions to different subject matters required for accreditation in the formal system worked against some of the most im- portant things that the Nomgana center was experiment-ing\u2014such as the inclusion of local materials and resource people in the curriculum, and direct involvement in farm work.\u007f Some of the content of French-language textbooks turned out to be quite inappropriate for use once translated into Moor\u00e9. \u007f To match the rhythm and requirements of the official cur- riculum\u2014and to complete it in the reduced time allot- ted\u2014the teaching staff had to largely abandon instructiondirectly in Moor\u00e9 after the second year, despite the fact that some of the most encouraging learning results were appearing in classes taught in the mother tongue. In fact,in many cases, those students who did least well in the French-language portion of the curriculum and the subse- quent certification tests turned out to be those who hadnot had sufficient \"grounding\" in Moor\u00e9 literacy before enrolling.\"Our working hypothesis,\" explains the professor of lin- guistics at the University of Ouagadougou, who helped de- velop the program, \"is that knowledge of an African lan-guage and use of literacy in that language significantly fa- cilitate acquisition of the skills that schooling is design\u2014a shortening of the time required to complete the primaryprogram, and an improvement in pass rates on the primary school certificate exams. But the program of the Nomgana centers was also developed with an eye to several other as-pects of school quality. A systematic attempt was made to include both agricultural production activities and research into local culture in the curriculum, parents were given anespecially active role in school management, and local \"re- source people\"\u2014artisans and griots (traditional historians and story tellers) in particular\u2014were invited to teachclasses. Catering to the leftover children Teaching duties were assumed by previously unemployed young people of the locality who had at least partial second- ary education, though no previous teaching experience. They were trained in the method by the supervisory stafffrom the University of Ouagadougou. Students were drawn essentially from the children of Nomgana and the neighbor- ing village Gou\u00e9 who had never enrolled in the local primaryschool, generally because their families had chosen another sibling to attend. They were therefore well beyond the theo- retical limit age for admission to primary schooling (7), av-eraging over 10 years of age at their entry into the program and, sociologically speaking, had been labeled \"less likely to succeed.\" The organizers made sure that an almost exactlyequal number of girls and boys were admitted to the pro- gram. Overall, 55 children took part in the first cohort, di- vided into two classes, with a student-teacher ratio of 28:1.All were required as preparation to complete an accelerated (6 month) literacy course in the Moor\u00e9 language. The first two years of instruction were carried on in Moor\u00e9, though the French language was taught as a subject. By the third year, students were using the same French texts as their peers in formal primary education. In addi-tion, they ran an animal farm which realized\u2014in the 1997- 1998 school year\u2014net profits of 233,000 CFA francs (ap- proximately $425) and grew both peanuts and ni\u00e9b\u00e9 (cow-peas) as part of their curriculum. There were no dropouts from the program, whereas the average rate of attrition be- tween the first and last years of formal primary education inBurkina Faso is over 40 percent.86IK Notes Number Local endorsement On the other hand, stakeholders were virtually unanimous that the effort had been successful where, for the time be-ing, it counted most: in enabling \"leftover\" local children to gain formal certification while strengthening their capaci- ties in their own language and culture; and in demonstrat-ing the viability and instructional worth of African-lan- guage approaches to learning French and to mastering pri- mary school contents. The relatively favored circumstancesof the experimental school must of course be kept in mind when comparing results from the two types of classes\u2014par- ticularly the adequate supply of instructional materials andthe fact that none of the children attending came, as a pro- portion of those in rural primary schools generally do, from other communities or were forced to make a long daily com-mute on foot. But the difference in the two series of data, which in fact take no account of the locally focused curricula in which the alternative school excelled, at least stronglysuggest that such methods can produce results at least on a par with current formal schooling.The linguistics professor referred to earlier puts the mat- ter succinctly: \"We hope that this experiment will contrib- ute to overcoming obstacles to the use of African languagesin our education system, both as a means of shortening the duration and broadening access to primary schooling, and as a new bridge between formal and nonformal education.\" \"At the same time,\" he adds, \"the experience can help us rethink ways of handling our multilingualism, one of the unavoidable realities of an African environment. Shorten-ing the primary cycle leaves time for mastering and using a written national language in the school curriculum.... Our languages have been quite simply the victim of prejudicesingrained by the colonial experience, (for) the opposition which some insist on drawing between African languages and French is finally pointless.\"587IK Notes 6 March 1999Village Bankers: The Experience of Fand\u00e8neSenegal This article is based on research conducted by Senegalese researchers with the support and technical supervisionof Peter Easton, Associate Professor, Graduate Studies in Adult Education, Florida State University, and with theactive collaboration of the concerned African communities. The research was carried out under the joint aegis ofthe Club du Sahel/OECD, the CILSS and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA). Fand\u00e8ne, a Serere and Wolof village Thi\u00e8s, Senegal in the country's peanut-grow-ing region, is the seat of a locally-cre- ated credit and savings institution with a remarkable career. It now covers 34villages throughout the region, has amassed over thirty million francs CFA of capital (around $60,000) and grantedmore than 1500 loans to people in those communities. Yet the structure grew essentially from local responses to theproblems of drought and diminishing farm fertility experienced throughout central Senegal. Fand\u00e8ne itself is the product of his- torical interaction between Serrere and Wolof ethnic groups. The village islargely Christian and was for years the site of a Catholic mission and commu- nity center (\"Maison FamilialeRurale\"), but it shares the dwindling resources of the neighboring valley and seasonal river beds with Islamic andanimist communities of several differ- ent ethnic groups. Recent local develop- ment initiatives stem in part from thereaction of emigrants from Fand\u00e8ne to the trauma of the great Sahelian drought of the early 1970s. In an effortto help their home community find so- lutions to the crisis and to avoid a com- plete depletion of the population,young people who had left for school or work took part in creating, in 1972, the\"Association des Jeunes de Fand\u00e8ne\" (AJF)\u2014The Fand\u00e8ne Young People's Association. From culture to agriculture For the first fifteen years of its exist- ence, the AJF concentrated on sponsor-ing cultural events that would interest young people in sticking with, or re- turning to, their home community andwould provide, at the same time, a way of reasserting cultural identity. Little was done with development projects,but AJF activities did lead to several well-educated young adults taking up residence again in the village and be-ginning to constitute themselves as a sort of \"modern\" (and critical) peas- antry. This group grew gradually dis-satisfied with an AJF program limited to cultural events and with leadership principally exercised by outsiders. In 1987, therefore, the Association started on a new tack. Concerned by the cyclical recurrence of food short-ages in the area, members of the Asso- ciation began a series of \"action-re- search\" inquiries with other populationgroups in the vicinity in order to better understand the nature of the problem and of possible remedies. Three find-ings of this locally-conducted study stood out:88IK Notes Number 6 \u007f The group noted that there were already in fact a host of small initiatives afoot, undertaken by peasant groups themselves\u2014initiatives which had great promise for di-versifying the local economy and improving the natural resource base, but that had all been hampered by inad- equate access to credit and resources for developing theirpotential. \u007f Lack of credit stemmed in good part from lack of collateral and of an institutional structure that would give the localpeople credibility and clout. \u007f At the same time, the AJC members studied the nature and results of recent NGO-sponsored projects in the sameregion, concluding that most failed because they were de- signed elsewhere and were not based on the existing ef- forts of the local population. Resolving the bottleneck of credit The decision was to address these problems by establishing some sort of nonformal local savings and loan institution.The beginnings were modest, to say the least: association members each contributed 250 FCFA (about $1 at the time) to a common fund and started making small loans to villag-ers with worthwhile projects, charging the equivalent of 15 percent interest per annum., while seeking other ways to develop their capital endowment. One of these was to ex-pand membership to new communities in the immediate re- gion. Not much marketing was required. The initiative met such a sorely-felt need that inhabitants of other villagessoon got wind of what was going on and began themselves inquiring about taking part. In this manner, the savings and loan network gradually spread to all 34 communities of the Fand\u00e8ne region and be- came increasingly well structured. Each branch of the insti- tution\u201419 in all\u2014was outfitted with a women's section anda men's section, and leaders of each were trained in simple accounting, credit worthiness assessment and loan manage- ment. Inhabitants of the communities involved were en-couraged to make written applications for credit through their local section officials, and leadership of the institution gradually trained itself in carrying out formal feasibility as-sessment of proposed loans and providing would-be borrow- ers with technical assistance in ensuring the credit worthi- ness of their ventures. Eventually an assessment team wascreated to help local savings and loan committees learn the ropes of evaluating loan applications and of identifying and brokering responses to the technical needs of small entre-preneurs.Supporting local economic innovation The enlarged savings and loan association placed particular emphasis on supporting farmers and small businesses withinnovative approaches to the revitalization of agriculture and the marketing of local products. The following are ex- amples of ventures underwritten in the first five years ofoperations: \u007f Women's producer groups were assisted in developing marketing schemes for bypassing middlemen and sellingbissap fruit harvested from nearby forests and baskets made from local plants directly on the Dakar market as well as to other village associations of the region. By 1995a thousand baskets a week were being produced in this manner. \u007f The Association granted loans to farmers interested in re- introducing the cultivation and sale of manioc to the area and expanding planting and use of cowpeas. \u007f Credit was extended to women's groups for establishing a soap-manufacturing cooperative and selling its products. \u007f The savings and loans institutions made numerous loans for boring of wells, development of irrigated gardeningand sale of the produce. As activities developed and capital endowment grew, the size and volume of loans also increased. Over the first five years of operation, average yearly outlays fell into the fol- lowing categories: Livestock development farming\u2014500,000 FCFA Well drilling\u2014500,000 FCFA. Yearly profits from loan administration likewise rose from less than 100,000 FCFA in 1991 to over 700,000 in 1994 and by 1998 the capital endowment of the intervillage savingsand loan association had risen to more than 30 million FCFA, or nearly $60,000. Weaving a new social and economic fabric Most impressive, though, were the institution-building re- sults of these activities and the new horizontal linkages among Senegalese communities and varied populationgroups that they nurtured. The thirty-four villages of the Fand\u00e8ne area are Christian, Islamic and animist in religious orientation and of varied ethnic composition (Serere, Wolof,89 Bambara, Fulani). Yet they have worked together very suc- cessfully in the creation of new savings and loans institu- tions and shared governance of their activities and re-sources. Women and men's branches of the association have exercised equal weight throughout. In addition, the association has developed marketing ar- rangements with peasant federations in other regions of Senegal whereby many of their products are sold and many of their inputs are acquired by this sort of lateral exchange.Perhaps most interestingly, the Fand\u00e8ne association has created technical teams to provide support to nascent groups in poor neighborhoods of the nearby city of Thi\u00e8sand the national capital, Dakar that wish to begin their own savings and loan programs\u2014reverse technical assistance from rural to urban areas!90This article was written on the basis of research conducted by Ghanaian, Canadian and American investigators with the support and technical supervision of Peter Easton,Associate Professor, Graduate Studies in Adult Education, Florida State University.Funding was supplied by the Club du Sahel/OECD, the CILSS and the Association forthe Development of Adult Education in Africa (ADEA). IK Notes 7 April 1999Literacy and Local Governancein a Rural CommunityNwodua, Ghana Nwodua is a small town of 640 resi- dents located 20 km from the city of Tamale in northern Ghana, and 3 kmby what was previously a dirt path from the Tamale-Kumbungu highway. Until the early 1980s, Nwodua re-mained largely cut off from regional commerce and had few community fa- cilities and no schools. The route link-ing Nwodua to the highway is now paved, and the town has a pipe-borne water system. The community also fea-tures a tree nursery, two grinding mills that produce weaning food for infants, a primary school, an adult vocationaltraining center, much-increased agri- cultural production and an innovative mode of community governance. Thislast accomplishment may be a, if not the, key to all the others. In 1979, an illiterate farmer from Nwodua decided that it was time to bring instruction in the ways of mod- ern Ghana to his community. Hestarted by convincing a middle school leaver from a nearby village to come de- velop literacy in Nwodua. Instructionwas given in the mother tongue, which did not satisfy most of the young people recruited. They wanted English anddropped out. But the farmer respon- sible for getting the program going and a close friend persisted, remuneratingthe teacher by working on his fields when they could offer him no salary.Making literacy work The first teacher soon left to attend Teacher Training School and get a bet-ter job. His two students simply re- cruited another in his place and man- aged at the same time to bring some ofthe dropouts back into the fold. They used this moderate success as leverage to convince the Bishopric of the Catho-lic Church to establish a primary school in Nwodua in 1984. Two years later, both were able to pass the national lit-eracy test and qualify to open their own literacy centers in the vicinity. Their success in the effort led to fur- ther responsibility and opportunity. The two were chosen as field supervi- sors by the new Dagbani FunctionalLiteracy Project just then getting un- der way and soon had seventy-six classes going in communities through-out the region. By virtue of its role as literacy headquarters for the region, Nwodua was able to open in 1989 a full-scale Adult Primary School where more than fifty residents of the com- munity succeeded during the followingyears in getting their primary leaving certificate, some continuing on to sec- ondary education . At the same time,the literacy effort increasingly became the fulcrum for a whole series of local development activities.91 First among these was the establishment of a Primary Health Care Committee, which sent a team of residents for training with the National Health Service in Tamale andthereafter sponsored campaigns to eliminate malnutrition and childhood convulsions. These efforts attracted atten- tion from Unicef, which assisted the Committee in estab-lishing a grinding mill to prepare weaning mixture for in- fants. The Committee made sure at the same time that pro- ceeds from rental of the mill and sale of its products paid fora second unit,thus launching the community towards a self- sustaining food processing industry. Restoring the environment The next initiative was in the area of agro-forestry and like- wise stemmed from lessons learned and topics explored in the literacy and Adult Primary Education centers. Five par-ticipants attended a UNDP-sponsored seminar in Tamale on the problems of desertification in northern Ghana and what local communities could do in the way of reforestation.On their return to Nwodua, they convinced a critical mass of their co-residents to undertake the establishment of a nursery for tree seedlings. Though all the groundwork wasaccomplished in 1991 and 1992, it soon became evident that the initiative would fail from water scarcity if a way were not found to bring more water to the community. The Nwodua Young Farmers' Club enlisted the leadership of the Dagbani Literacy Program in approaching UNDP with a proposal for extending the water pipelines supplyingTamale to Nwodua itself, a distance of about 5 km. UNDP agreed to underwrite the effort and the villagers dug 5 km of trenches to prepare the way. The hookup was successful andthe Nwodua Water Committee manages to pay monthly fees from the Sewerage Commission by levying fees on each household in the village using water. At the same time, wa-ter availability removed the main bottleneck to the develop- ment of the Nwodua nursery and reforestation effort. The nursery began distributing seedlings of a variety of commer-cial and shade trees to Nwodua residents free of charge and selling them to outsiders. In 1995, for example, more than 2000 grafted mango and 4000 cashew seedlings were placedwith groups and individuals throughout the immediate re- gion, including institutions like the Kumbungu Sub-district Assembly. The nursery now has a growing capital fund forthe initiation of new projects. This increased commerce with the exterior made it im- perative to upgrade the track leading from Nwodua to theTamale road. A Road Committee was formed in 1991 and by the following year World Bank officials had been ap-proached and convinced to support construction of a motorable road over the 3 km link, provided that the village would furnish manual labor and board for the specializedworkers and technicians sent in to work on the job. The road was successfully completed the following year and the Road Committee made responsible for its maintenance andfor planning new improvements to access routes. Starting with adults The ease in exporting products from Nwodua meant also ease in accessing it, and the community began, in a series of ways to play a role as hub of extension activities in its imme- diate region. An additional one was the constitution in 1999of an impressive vocational-technical center funded by Dan- ish foreign aid. With its advent, the village boasted quite a cluster of educational facilities - three for adults (the lit-eracy center, the Adult Primary School and the Vocational- Technical Center) flanking a more modest public elemen- tary school for children. The Nwodua Development Committees are frequently asked why their educational program thus far seems to have given more importance to adults than to children. Their re-sponse is simple: It's the best way to go in previously poor rural communities like ours. If more adults start encounter- ing new opportunity and learning how to benefit from it,more will be eager to send their children to primary school. Renewed governance at the core As remarkable as these diverse efforts are, the heart of inno- vation at Nwodua lies at their core\u2014in the renewed form of community governance gradually elaborated by village au- thorities and the young participants in the new initiatives toprovide a basis for managing and extending their activities. The initial leaders of the literacy movement sought concur- rence from the traditional chief of Nwodua and his councilto set up a General Development Committee (GDC) with overall responsibility for ensuring orderly implementation of the projects and preservation of community interest. Thisgroup in turn has established the working committees that take care of each of the sectors of local development and re- port back to it. The GDC is chaired by a sixty-five year-oldilliterate farmer well respected in the community, but of the other eight members only one is over forty-five and seven are graduates of literacy or adult primary school classes. The GDC works through eight sectoral committees, one each for adult literacy, primary health care, food processing, agro-forestry, vocational instruction, agricultural training92IK Notes Number and road construction/maintenance. In the process of devel- oping this networked structure of oversight, two things have happened. First, the sustainability of initiatives hasbeen virtually ensured by this monitoring and sponsorship mechanism. Second, by incremental steps, the GDC has be- come the operational village government in Nwodua\u2014though not the ceremonial one \u2014and has succeeded in cre- ating an environment that both facilitates local entrepre- neurial initiative and is supportive of improved public ser-vice delivery.But the success of the GDC must in turn be traced back to two other factors\u2014on the one hand, the rich stimulus for change created by the succession of adult training and non-formal education sessions held in and around the village; and, on the other, the driving force furnished by the two pre- viously illiterate residents who started the whole process al-most twenty years ago and refused to be defeated by ob- stacles. Individual initiative plus the continuing availability of new training and opportunities to apply it provided thefuel for successes in local development that seemed impos- sible twenty years ago. But the invention of new forms of local governance furnished a framework without whichnone of this might have come to pass.793IK Notes 8 May 1999Nurturing the Environmenton Senegal's West Coast This article is based on research conducted by Senegalese researchers with the support andtechnical supervision of Peter Easton, Associate Professor, Graduate Studies in Adult Education,Florida State University, with the active collaboration of the concerned African communities. Theresearch was carried out under the joint aegis of the Club du Sahel/OECD, the CILSS and theAssociation for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA). The Natural Reserve of K\u00ebr Cupaam is situated in the \"Petite C\u00f4te\" region of Senegal, 45 kilometers south of Dakaralong the Atlantic coast. This fragment of a former national forest covering roughly 100 hectares was set aside bygovernment decree in the early 1980s in order to protect the wintering site of the blue grackle and the rock grackle,two endangered species, and to shelter the migratory route of birds that follow the Atlantic coast of West Africa. Thecliffs that border the seashore in this region provide prized nesting and feed- ing grounds for many species. Both the flora and the fauna of this area had been severely damaged over preceding years by the effects ofdrought, increased grazing, and fire- wood harvest. The coast near Popenguine nonetheless is a favoritetourist destination for people from Dakar as well as a renowned center of religious pilgrimage for Catholics. Butthis activity has not greatly benefited local people, and a growing population has put heavier pressure on a deterio-rating resource base. Taking up the challenge Though constitution of the nature re- serve in the early 1980s helped to stopfurther degradation of the environ- ment, the vegetation of the region had already been so severely damaged thatmore intensive efforts were clearly re- quired to restore its ecology and attract the sort of tourist activity that wouldbenefit the local population. That, in any case, was the conclusion reached by a group of women from the village ofPopenguine, who decided in 1988 to create the Association of Women of Popenguine for the Protection of theEnvironment ( Regroupement des Femmes de Popenguine pour la Protec- tion de la Nature or \u00abRFPPN\u00bb). The group was composed initially of 119 women and one man, who just hap- pened to be present at the inauguralmeeting. They selected as their matron deity Mame Cumba Cupaam , \u00abthe guiding spirit of coastal fisherman.\u00bb During the following eight years, the RFPPN used first its own resources and then additional ones provided bydonor organizations interested in this novel form of natural resource manage- ment to restore the vegetation of thereserve and the surrounding territory. Measures implemented by the associa- tion included constitution of green fire-breaks around the entire perimeter, re- planting of native species furnished by a nursery that the women establishedat the same time, and organization of94IK Notes Number workshops where young volunteers from neighboring rural and urban areas were brought in to learn nature conserva- tion and perform much of the physical labor required. Going to the root of the matter In addition, RFPPN members rapidly put their finger on the leading threat to restoration and preservation of the en-vironment: deforestation due to collection of firewood by the population of villages throughout the area. The women resolved on a series of measures to provide alternate sourcesof energy and make their communities self-sufficient in cooking fuel. \u007f First, they established a cooperative distribution network for wood, charcoal and gas to regulate consumption and help their members provide for household needs. \u007f Second, they established a village tree nursery and a com- munity forest to begin enhancing the supply of local com- bustibles. \u007f Finally, they organized the collection of household wastes and trash for composting both in order to stem public health threats arising from inadequate disposal facilities and to produce compost for the nursery. \u007f In this manner, the women not only succeeded in progres- sively reconstituting local bio-diversity and restoring the natural vegetation of the area, but their efforts also ap-parently contributed materially to the reappearance of animal species not seen in those parts for years: numer- ous types of birds plus porcupines, mongoose, the patasmonkey, jackals, civet cats, and even antelope. Building a network Their efforts soon reached a level where restoration of the regional environment could not be guaranteed without broader participation from surrounding villages. The pro- gram and the example of RFPPN had, in fact, awakened anincreasing amount of interest among people in neighboring communities. Rather than simply expand the RFPPN, members of the Popenguine association decided to encour-age women in nearby villages to start their own organiza- tions and establish their own nurseries, work details and fuel distribution networks. Eight communities eventuallyaffiliated with Popenguine under the guidance of a com- monly-elected coordinating committee, and the overall membership grew from the 119 members initially involvedto over 1500. Tens of thousands of new tree seedlings are now produced each year by this network of associations. At the same time, the women's groups added new dimen- sions of activity to their program. Three complementary di- rections have developed, thanks in part to substantial sup- port from the European Economic Community (EEC). Credit and banking: To help alleviate the pervasive pov- erty that led to repeated degradation of the environment, the associations began creating cereal banks, credit mutualsand small irrigated vegetable farming enterprises in each village. The last provided an additional incentive to keep up the waste collection and composting effort. Tourist and training infrastructure: Given the growing interest in the Popenguine experiment throughout Senegal and even abroad, the women decided to build a simple infra-structure for hosting delegations and visitors, followed by the development of a \u00abCenter for Training in Ecological Management.\u00bb They have now had groups of visitors fromseveral foreign countries intrigued by this example of suc- cessful \u00abecodevelopment.\u00bb Youth employment: To help stem the out-migration of school leavers and remedy the lack of opportunity for pro- ductive employment of young people throughout the region, the associations put a premium on inducting youth into thevarious functions and economic activities created around the new reserve. Volunteers from surrounding villages and nearby urban areas have been recruited to help with resto-ration of the reserve and learn principles of good ecomanagement, in many cases leading to new lasting em- ployment. Much of the recruitment is handled bySenegalese young people's clubs affiliated with the Nicolas Hulot Foundation, a French NGO dedicated to environmen- tal preservation. A model to emulate The reserve and the surrounding protected areas now cover over 50 square miles and provide more economic opportuni-ties for all the bordering communities. This coexistence be- tween an African national preserve and its human neigh- bors is at the same time emblematic of a new and hopefulstyle of environmental conservation. The RFFPN has of- fered Senegal and interested groups in other African coun-895IK Notes 9 June 1999The Development of an Agricultural Union:Increasing Levels of Local EmpowermentMali In the early 1990s, the members of the village associations ( associations villageoises , or AV) in the Koutiala re- gion of southern Mali had an issue to sort out with the Malian Textile Com- pany (Compagnie Malienne des Tex- tiles, CMDT). A rumor was circulating that the CMDT planned to increase the pay of its field staff (i.e. their share ofthe profit from cotton), without raising the price paid to producers. Represen- tatives of the different regional associa-tions had already joined forces in 1989 to demand annulment of a policy adopted by the CMDT regarding the fi-nancial responsibility of producers' as- sociations, a case that the producers eventually won. Encouraged by this success, they united efforts again to address the pric- ing problem and created the Coordina-tion Committee for the Village Associa- tions and T\u00f2ns of Koutiala, composed of representatives of the various localassociations. Members of the coordi- nating committee included farmers trained in literacy courses and experi-enced in the movement for local take- over of markets under way in southern Mali since the 1970s, plus a few repre-sentatives of a new stratum of the population that had appeared over the preceding decade: graduates of second-ary or post-secondary education whohad returned to their home communi- ties to start their own farms. Changing the institutional landscape of rural areas A series of meetings and local hearings led the group to draw up an official list of claims and grievances. At the same time, the political events shaking Malitriggered upheaval in the village asso- ciations, diminishing already-narrow profit margins on the sale of the cropand impelling the committee to action. In 1991, the group decided to delegate the most highly educated of its mem-bers, a graduate of a post-secondary ag- ricultural institute who had returned to farming, to speak to members of thevillage associations, calm their fears and present their claims and questions to the CMDT. The initiative directed atthe AVs was very successful: the asso- ciation representatives gave their full support to the coordinating committee.But CMDT management, worried by the unstable political conditions, re- fused any negotiation with the peasantmovement. As a consequence, the com- mittee called for a strike by cotton pro- ducers, and its members canvassed thezone to rally the AVs to its cause. For two months, the associations refused toThis article is based on data gathered by Peter Easton, Guy Belloncle, Cheibane Coulibaly, Simon Fass, Laouali Malam Moussa and five national research teams during conduct of the PADLOS-Education Study, an inquiry into\"Decentralization and Local Capacity Building in West Africa\" funded by the Club du Sahel/OECD and the CILSS.For copies of the full study, contact Peter Easton, Center for Policy Studies in Education, 312 STB, College of Educa-tion, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL 32306, phone (850) 644-5042; fax (850) 644-1595; e-mail:easton@coe.fsu.edu96IK Notes Number 9 deliver their cotton to the CMDT, until the Minister of Ru- ral Development came to Koutiala in person to mediate the conflict. The outcome of the negotiations was that theCMDT accepted the principle of collective bargaining by a non-governmental organization representing cotton pro- ducers and agreed as well to its participation on the Na-tional Agricultural Pricing Board. In this manner, SYCOV ( Syndicat des Producteurs du Coton et du Vivrier or Union of Cotton and Food Crops Pro- ducers) was born, though it was not legally established for another year, due to the administrative formalities re- quired. Its leaders immediately took care to open the doorsof the new agricultural union to all of the village associa- tions of southern Mali, and even decided, to withdraw, with his consent, the candidacy of the principal leader of the 1991movement for presidency of the new organization in favor of a representative from one of the regions that had not previ- ously been involved. The Union, which operates bilingually(Bambara-French), has continued to grow, notwithstanding some resistance by the CMDT and internal difficulties caused by the uncertain evolution of the AVs themselves,some questionable decisions of the leadership and rifts be- tween local and central levels. It is now a part of the institu- tional and political landscape of Mali, incarnating at a na-tional level the legally-established right of peasants to par- ticipate in all decisions that concern them. SYCOV is also organizing training courses in oral and written French forBambara-literate representatives of the AVs and has re- quired bilingualism in all documents it uses and all sessions in which it takes part. Roots of change: the transfer of economic power into local hands In fact, with all its strengths and shortcomings, the SYCOV experiment already represents a second stage in local em- powerment in rural areas of southern Mali and illustratessome of the benefits possible through the actual transfer of economic authority into the hands of farmers' associations. While cotton has been cultivated and marketed in these ar-eas for over thirty years, the situation has evolved, in the space of the last fifteen, from one where staff of large cotton firms like the CMDT and its affiliates controlled the pur-chase of farm output at the local level and its transport to processing centers, to a system where these functions have been almost entirely assumed by village organizations. Rep-resentatives of these local associations or their federations are now fully responsible for weighing the crop, paying pro- ducers, stocking the products, transporting them to pro-cessing centers, and reselling them to the processors, as well as for the necessary organizational and accounting tasks and the establishment of related policy. The feat was accom-plished thanks in large measure to literacy and nonformal education programs implemented with the support of the cotton companies themselves (or sometimes inherited fromearlier government and NGO efforts), which enabled a core of adolescents and adults having little previous schooling to acquire reading, writing and accounting skills in their ownlanguages and to master vernacular or bilingual manage- ment systems. It is no exaggeration to say that such efforts have saved cotton companies billions of CFA francs (approximately 500 CFA = $1 US). A sizeable portion of the proceeds has re- turned to the community organizations and been appor-tioned by them between individual rebates to farmers and collective investment funds. The latter, in turn, have stimu- lated a whole series of other investments such as the estab-lishment of credit and savings unions, purchase of more so- phisticated agricultural equipment, drilling of new wells, construction of community clinics and schools, etc. Thisphenomenon of local takeover is not unrelated to the major increase in cotton production in Sub-Saharan Africa over the course of the last decade, a development that has movedthe region into fourth position on the world market and re- plenished national budgets severely strained by the de- mands of structural adjustment programs. Cotton can scarcely be considered the ideal driving force for sustainable development, given the devastating effects it has had on soil fertility, at least under the very deficient re-gime of crop rotation and soil conservation applied in West Africa. Nevertheless, the cotton experience served to dem- onstrate, on a large scale, the ability of local-level producersto organize commercial and management operations them- selves\u2014provided appropriate training was made available at the same time. And it has given birth to a set of reinforcedrural institutions that are providing \"templates\" for local development in a number of other domains. A favorable context: the interaction of economic challenge and social capital The village associations in fact arose from the confluence of two factors, one \"traditional\" and the other modern; and the interweaving of the two currents accounts for much of the impressive results. Southern Malian communities aregenerally organized into \"t\u00f2n\" (the Bambara-Malink\u00e9 term) or equivalent structures among neighboring ethnic groups. These age-stratified initiation groups are often very97 strongly knit together and internally regulated to a high de- gree. The \"t\u00f2n\" were the associations that became directly or indirectly responsible for the assumption of marketingand reinvestment responsibilities when the CMDT under- took its experiment; and their new functions prompted them to evolve in new directions, developing in the processsystems of accountability and training far in advance of those that characterized the traditional initiation groups. In a sense, the failures, successes and pioneering efforts of SYCOV represent simply a \"second tier\" in the campaign for local capacity development and increased empowerment of village organizations that began with the reorganizationof the cotton marketing system several years ago, and driven by the mobilization of existing social structures. And at the same time they have helped fuel other initiatives. Carrying local development to the second tier Another telling example: to improve their management per- formance, the village associations of southern Mali, with thesupport of the CMDT and foreign aid, created in 1993 an in- stitution charged with auditing their accounts and provid- ing technical assistance to local leaders in financial matters.The unit was named the \"Koutiala Management Center\"; several additional branches have been established since thattime. The center is staffed by personnel recruited from the village associations, who are responsible for providing third- party audit of AV accounts. Local staff are trained and sup-ported in turn by external technical assistance, which is de- signed to play a diminishing role. Policy oversight of the Center is carried out by an Administrative Council, which islinked in turn to the Federation of Village Associations of southern Mali. Theoretically, the center is supposed to oper- ate entirely on a budget funded by the revenues generatedfrom sale of its services to the village associations. It is thus half-way between being a \"wholly owned subsidiary\" of the Federation and a private auditing firm. In reality, the Center was created, and is still partially de- pendent, on external funding. But it does seem to have sur- vived a first phase of establishment, operation and prelimi-nary institutionalization and is in fact providing needed ser- vices and generating revenues. The Management Center thus demonstrates the ability of local associations to moveup a substantial notch in the sequence of activities required to become financially independent. It also reveals an impor- tant niche and opportunity for second-tier organizationsthat are able to provide critical technical support to the new enterprises of civil society. The seeds sown by the actual transfer of resources and marketing responsibility to villagestructures has thus begun to yield multiple fruits.98Indigenous Healing of War-Affected Children in Africa IK Notes 10 July 1999This article was written by Edward C. Green, Ph.D, and Alcinda Honwana, Ph.D. The authors would liketo thank the Christian Childrens Fund, Save the Children (USA), the Children and War Project and theDisplaced Children and Orphans Fund, USAID, for use of information from their programs. We wouldalso like to thank Mike Wessells for useful comments and suggestions. Edward C. Green can be contacted at: egreendc@aol.com. Alcinda Honwana can be contacted at honwana@beattie.uct.ac.za Children in war-torn countries of Af- rica and elsewhere are often direct or indirect victims of violence, and/or wit-nesses to various horrors associated with war. Children as young as seven or eight are forcibly conscripted and in-doctrinated as child soldiers or porters in several African countries. Girls as well as boys often suffer, some beingforced into sexual or other service at early ages. In conflicts where terroriz- ing civilians has become a routinemeans to political and military ends, women and children are deliberately targeted for torture and death. Glo-bally, there are at least one million chil- dren separated from their parents be- cause of war, and there are many thou-sands who have been traumatized even more directly by war. Child victims of this sort often exhibit symptoms ofpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to use the Western psychiatric label. Symptoms of PTSD and related stressreactions common in children include: avoidance/numbing, as in cutting off of feelings and avoidance of situationsthat provide reminders of traumatic events; insomnia, \"intrusive re-experiencing,\" suchas nightmares and flashbacks; lethargy, confusion, fear, aggressive behavior, so- cial isolation, and hopelessness in rela-tion to the future, and hyper-arousal as evidenced in hyper-vigilance and exag- gerated startle responses. In recent years, UNICEF, USAID, and various private, voluntary organi- zations such as Save the Children andthe Christian Children's have de- veloped various types of so-called psy- chosocial programs to assistwar-affected children. Yet therapeutic techniques for war-affected children re- main at a very preliminary stage of de-velopment. It is not known to what ex- tent western psychotherapeutic tech- niques for PTSD\u2014which were origi-nally developed to treat American vet- erans of the Vietnam war\u2014would be appropriate and effective for childrenin Africa and other less-developed ar- eas. One of the concerns with the PTSD is the very notion of post-trau- matic stress disorder. In these contexts, it is problematic to talk about trauma as the past ( post), if one understands the notion of violence to be broader than direct exposure to war situations (military attacks, landmines, etc.), andto encompass spheres like poverty, hun- ger, displacement and the like. Another concern with the PTSD lies in its thera-peutic techniques which are centered on the individual patient. Such focus ignores local beliefs in the role that an-99 cestral and malevolent spiritual forces play in the causation and healing of the affliction. It also undermines family and community involvement and active participation in thehealing process. During early psychosocial programs for war-affected chil- dren in Mozambique and Angola, community leaders, tradi-tional healers and families showed tremendous knowledge of how to heal the 'social wounds of war in war-affected children and adults. Such disorders are in fact quite treat-able by traditional healers, based on indigenous under- standings of how war affects the minds and behavior of indi- viduals, and on shared beliefs of how spiritual forces inter-vene in such processes. During the implementation of these programs, people expressed no need for help in addressing children's' specific mental or behavioral manifestations.What they needed, they said, was help in finding missing family members and in establishing schools, pre-schools, creating jobs opportunities for the youth, and promoting astable social environment in which to function. There is evidence from throughout Africa that mental or psychiatric disorders are among the conditions for whichmodern or western medical help is least likely to be sought. African people generally turn to indigenous forms of therapy in case of mental health. Empirical studies of therelative effectiveness of different forms of western psycho- therapy in fact show that virtually all psychotherapies do the patient some good and all are potentially effective whenembedded within social and cultural specificities. This may suggest that as psychotherapists, indigenous African heal- ers may be at least as effective as modern medical special-ists, especially among those who share a common African culture. Anthropological research done in Mozambique and Angola shows that war related psychological trauma is di- rectly linked to the power and anger of the spirits of the dead. The impossibility of performing proper burials intimes of war does not allow for these spirits to be placed in their proper positions in the world of the ancestors, so they are considered to be bitter and potentially harmful to theirkillers and passers-by. Social pollution may arise for being in contact with death and bloodshed. Individuals who have been in a war, who killed or were around killings are be-lieved to be potential contaminators of the social body. Thus, cleansing and purification rituals are essential for their reintegration in the communities. In 1994, during the first project in Angola specifically to help war-traumatized children, it was found that children were already being helped by indigenous psychotherapy,provided by indigenous healers in the form of ritual purifi- cation ceremonies. This was provided for bothex-combatants and children who had either participated in or witnessed bloodshed. The earlier Children and War project in Mozambique found similar treatments for chil-dren. In both countries, these therapies appeared to be ef- fective, at least in the short-term. Traditional healing for war-affected children in Angola and Mozambique seems toconsist principally of purification or cleansing rituals, at- tended by family members and the broader community, dur- ing which a child is purged and purified of the \"contamina-tion\" of war and death, as well as of sin, guilt, and avenging spirits of those killed by a child soldier. These ceremonies are replete with ritual and symbolism whose details are dis-tinctive to the particular ethnolinguistic group, but whose general themes are common to all groups. In the day of his arrival his relatives took him to the ndumba (the house of the spirits). There he was presented to the ancestral spirits of the family. The boy's grandfather addressed the spirits informing them that his grandchildhad returned and thanked the spirits for their protection as his grandson was able to return alive (...) A few days later a spirit medium was invited by the family to help them per-form the cleansing rituals for the boy. The practitioner took the boy to the bush, and there a small hut covered with dry grass was build. The boy, dressed with the dirty clothes hebrought from the RENAMO camp, entered the hut and un- dressed himself. Then fire was set to the hut, and an adult relative helped out the boy. The hut, the clothes and every-thing else that the boy brought from the camp had to be burned. A chicken was sacrificed for the spirits of the dead and the blood spread around the ritual place After that theboy had to inhale the smoke of some herbal remedies, and bath himself with water treated with medicine (Fieldnotes, Mozambique). This healing ritual brings together a series of symbolic meanings aimed at cutting the child's link with the past (the war). While modern psychotherapeutic practices emphasizeverbal exteriorization of the affliction, here through sym- bolic meanings the past is locked away. This is seen in the burning of the hut and the clothes and the cleansing of thebody. To talk and recall the past is not necessarily seen as a prelude to healing or diminishing pain. Indeed, it is often believed to open the space for the malevolent forces to inter-vene. This is also apparent in the following case from Uige (Angola). When the child or young man returns home, he is made to wait on the outskirts of the village. The oldest woman from the village throws maize flour at the boy and anoints his en- tire body with a chicken. He is only able to enter the villageafter this ritual is complete. After the ritual, he is allowed to greet his family in the village. Once the greeting is over, he100IK Notes Number must kill a chicken, which is subsequently cooked and served to the family. For the first eight days after the home- coming, he is not allowed to sleep in his own bed, only on arush mat on the floor. During this time, he is taken to the river and water is poured on his head and he is given manioc to eat. As he leaves the site of the ritual, he must not lookbehind him. This case emphasizes the non-interaction with family and friends before ritual cleansing. The child is kept out of thevillage until the ritual is performed, and cannot greet people and sleep in his bed until the ritual proceedings are over. As mentioned above, although children may be asked aboutwar experiences as part of treatment, this is not a funda- mental condition for healing. The ceremony aims at sym- bolically cleansing the polluted child and putting the warexperience behind him, to \"forget\" (note the symbolism of being forbidden to look back, in the example from Uige). Food taboos and other kinds of ritual restrictions are ap-plied. In the Uige, for example, fish and fowl must be avoided by the cleansed person for 1-2 months, after which the person must be reintroduced to the food by the tradi-tional healer who officiated at the ceremony. The Okupiolissa ritual from Huila in Angola clearly shows the active participation of the community in theserituals, and stresses the idea of cleansing from 'impurities. The community and family members are usually excited and pleased at the homecoming. Women prepare them-selves for a greeting ceremony (...) Some of the flour used to paint the women's foreheads is thrown at the child and a respected older woman of the village throws a gourd filledwith ashes at the child's feet. At the same time, clean water is thrown over him as a means of purification (...) the women of the village dance around the child, gesturing withhands and arms to ward away undesirable spirits or influ- ences. (...) they each touch him with both hands from head to foot to cleanse him of impurities. The dance is known as:Ululando-w-w-w. When the ritual is complete, the child is taken to his village and the villagers celebrate his return. A party is held in his home where only traditional beverages(...) The child must be formally presented to the chiefs by his parents (...) the child sits beside the chiefs, drinking and talking to them, and this act marks his change of status inthe village. These cleansing and purification rituals involving child soldiers have the appearance of what anthropologists callrites of transition. That is, the child undergoes a symbolic change of status from someone who has existed in a realm of sanctioned norm-violation or norm-suspension (i.e., killing,war) to someone who must now live in a realm of peaceful behavioral and social norms, and conform to these. In thecase presented above from Huila, the purified child acquires a new status which allows him to sit besides the chiefs and interact with them. Until the transition is complete(through ritual performance), the child is considered to be in a dangerous state, a marginal, \"betwixt and between,\" liminal, ambiguous state. For this reason, a child cannot re-turn to his family or hut, or sleep in his bed, or perhaps even enter his village, until the rituals have been completed. Manifest symptoms associated with PTSD and related stress disorders reportedly disappear shortly after these cer- emonies, after which the family, indigenous healers and lo- cal chiefs direct attention toward helping to establish an en-during, trusting relationship between the traumatized child and family members, and with adults of good character. These ritual interventions are also intended to re-establishspiritual harmony, notably that between the child and its ancestor spirits. The re-establishment of normal relation- ships and activities with other children may not be part\u2014ora major part\u2014of these indigenous healing rituals. But, heal- ers, village elders, teachers and other child caregivers readily understand this when presented with the idea dur-ing project-supported training seminars, in both Angola and Mozambique. Play therapy, drawing, drama, dance and story-telling are some of the techniques introduced in theseseminars. There is no doubt that these rituals are instrumental in building family cohesion and solidarity, and in dealing withthe psychosocial and emotional side of these children s prob- lems. The fact is, however, that they return to an impover- ished countryside struggling with basic survival needs, andmany with no schools, hospitals, no vocational training or job opportunities which would allow them to envisage the prospects of a better future. Thus, while these rituals areimportant they need to be complemented by community de- velopment programs to sustain the gains achieved in the psychosocial and emotional sphere, and which cannot bedissociated from the rest. Therefore, the approach of donor organizations, NGO and other organizations involved in humanitarian aid for war-affected children should take into account local understand- ings of war trauma and indigenous strategies for dealing with it. They should work towards promoting stable, secure,culturally-familiar environments in which children can gain a sense of competence and security in a more predictable world by encouraging self-reliance through reliable commu-nity development projects. their families, or with appropri- ate foster families if necessary. The project of the Christian Children's Fund in Angola tries to build upon existing indigenous healing practices and strengths, and complementing these with its psychosocial10101 interventions such as those just described. Evaluations of this project and the earlier \"Children and War\" project in Mozambique have shown that such an informal partnershipbetween indigenous healers, with their ritualistic therapies, and donor-assisted programs, with emphasis on the family and social adjustment of the child, may provide a model ofhow indigenous and Western-scientific approaches can be pursued together to provide maximum benefit to children in need. Furthermore, such a model of cooperation and shar-ing of responsibility serves to validate indigenous healing and beliefs, which tends to energize and mobilize local people who, ultimately, need to develop sustainable, cultur-ally acceptable solutions to help themselves.102IK Notes 11 August 1999Education and Koranic Literacyin West Africa This article is based on research conducted by local researchers with the support and techni-cal supervision of Peter Easton, Associate Professor, Graduate Studies in Adult Education,Florida State University, with the active collaboration of the concerned African communities.The research was carried out under the joint aegis of the Club du Sahel/OECD, the CILSSand the Association for the Development of education in Africa (ADEA). What are the .practical. and literate skills that students acquire at different levels of West African Koranic school-ing? What are the various daily uses to which suchknowledge is put and the networks through which it is developedand applied? Koranic schooling in its many forms constitutes a long-stand- ing parallel system of educationthroughout much of the African conti- nent one that has operated for centu- ries, yet remains relatively unknown todevelopment planners and is therefore seldom taken into explicit account in their policies and strategies. Islam has an extended history in West Africa and Islamic educational systems have in fact operated there formuch longer than have Western ones. The Islamic faith first spread across North Africa in the 7th century. By the10th century, communities of Muslim merchants and scholars had been es- tablished in several commercial centersof the Western Sahara and the Sahel. By the 11th or 12th century, the rulers of kingdoms such as Takrur, AncientGhana and Gao had converted to Islam and had appointed Muslims who were literate in Arabic as advisors. Trans-Saharan trade flourished in pre-colonial times and carried most ofthe considerable merchandise ex-changed between Africa and Europe from the 11th to the 16th centuries . until, that is, the arrival of Euro-peanvessels on the West African coast and the institution of the trans.Atlantic slave trade and the triangular com-merce among Africa, Europe and the New World that it fueled. The back- bone of trans.Saharan commerce ini-tially consisted of networks of towns es- tablished along trade routes by itiner- ant merchants from North Africa,gradually sedentarized and/or replaced by local groups. The proceeds of this trade furnished much of the revenueneeded for state-building. The structure of a submerged system The system of Islamic learning across West Africa is several-tiered thoughless rigidly structured than its Western counterpart. In addition, it now in- cludes a traditional track (the Koranicsequence per se), a formal school or .modern. equivalent (Franco-Arab schools, sometimes called m\u00e9dersa),and intermediate or ihybrid forms often referred to as improved Koranic school- ing. At the base of the traditional net-work are the maktabor Koranic schools,103 the primary level of the system, where children begin, start- ing somewhere between the ages of 3 and 10, to learn the Koran and the basic duties of Islamic life. Next come themadris or secondary schools where those who have essen- tially memorized and transcribedlarge portions (at least) of the Koran progress to a study of what is referred to as Islamicscience. (ilm), including the written traditions of the religion and a variable amount of other didactic material. A few select students proceed beyond this level to advanced study eitherwith famed imamsand marabouts of the region or at Islamic universities in North Africa and other Muslim countries. At least in its elementary forms\u2014represented by local Koranic schools\u2014Islamic learning is widespread through- out West Africa. An estimate of the number of such schools in Niger alone in 1990 put them at 40,000. This form of edu-cation constitutes in reality an alternate and (to official and Western ideas) largely hidden knowledge culture rivaling, and frequently intersecting or hybridizing with the officialone, even though in most African countries the basic insti- tutions of the system\u2014the maktab\u2014have not been consid- ered as schools at all. Yet Koranic students, teachers andbelievers in general throughout the region are highly aware of the long history of the faith in West Africa and of many of its greatest scholars and teachers, some of whom exercisemajor political and economic power, particularly in Sahelian regions. Those involved for years in the cash crop trade in Niger, Mali and Senegal, for example, have developed well-capitalized commercial networks with ramifications in ur- ban real estate and industry, and increasingly abroad. All this considerably strengthens the attraction of differentforms of Koranic education as gateways to an alternate and sometimes thriving economic and political system. In short, there is a strong trans-national culture at work. Variable quality, extensive coverage Despite these tendencies toward uniformity in underlying religious culture and basic orientation, the nature and qual-ity of instruction in Koranic schools and the Islamic system as a whole vary noticeably from one region to another. In areas of Islamic allegiance, the vast majority of children at-tend Koranic school. They learn principally through memo- rization of the sacred text. Boys predominate in the student body, but frequently in ratios of no more than 3/2 or 2/1 inthe early grades. In a few regions, like Guinean Futa Jalon, enrollment rates are virtually the same by gender. The depth of Islamic instruction in these regions is quite variable, but in general a significant proportion of male stu- dents who remain beyond the initial Koranic lessons do con-tinue to some level of higher study. Since understanding of either modern or classical Arabic over and beyond the Koranic texts themselves is quite rare, (except among thosehaving pursued studies in Arabic-speaking countries), the highest levels of practical literacy\u2014that is, ability to read and write correspondence, keep records and generally com-municate in writing\u2014are most frequently found in those areas like upland Guinea, the Sine Saloum of Senegal, and the Hausa-speaking regions of Niger, where there is a devel-oped system for transcribing African language with Arabic characters (called ajami in the Hausa and Fulani cases). In Guinea, 93 percent of a sample of 77 male Koranic .alumni.interviewed claimed reading and writing capacity in ajami. In Senegal, between 25 and 75 percent of male adults in vil- lages contacted, and between 10 and 25 percent of womenclaimed the same level of learning. In all cases, the propor- tions were well, if not multiples, above the literacy rate in French for the same predominantly rural communities. On the other hand, only 26 percent of the Guinean sample of former Koranic students considered themselves numer- ate, as compared to 93 percent who considered themselvesable to write texts in ajami. A majority of marabouts and imams seem nonetheless to have acquired numerical skills in one way or another, which helps in understanding the fre-quency with which they are found to be handling account- ing responsibilities in community affairs. While vocational initiation is not an explicit curricular component of Koranic schooling, most students who con- tinue beyond the most elementary level do end up working in some apprenticed position either to the marabout or to anaffiliated craftsman or merchant, if only to help pay for his or her upkeep and tuition. Koranic schooling tends to in- clude a practical element integrated into the community,though only systematized as real vocational instruction in exceptional cases; and Koranic students are imbued with the notion that they will need to fend for themselves or findappropriate sponsorship beyond a certain age. This prompts one Senegalese researcher to remark, \"L'\u00e9cole train employment-creators, the formal system trains em- ployment-seekers.) Applications of Koranic training The most frequent secular application of Koranic learning at the individual level is writing and correspondence, andthe most prominent career destination of accomplished Koranic students is to become themselves marabouts or104IK Notes Number imams because there is considerable demand for teachers and dispensers of religious and incantatory services, given the rapid expansion of West African Islam in recent years.Over a quarter of the Guinean respondents, however, citedthe exercise of local public functions as a practical out- come of their training, and similar trends are evident acrossthe region. However, collective and communal applications are no less frequent. Islamic morality, jurisprudence and authorityhave been used as the backbone of traditional governance for centuries throughout the Sahel. In fact, most of the vo- cabulary in major Sahelian languages having to do not justwith religion, but with laws, local administration, diplo- macy and higher learning as well is derived or directly bor- rowed from Arabic. Conclusion: Alternate avenues to knowledge The consequence of these factors is that basic Islamic in- struction\u2014of the kind dispensed in local Koranic schools\u2014has three essential dimensions of practical application and impact in West Africa today:\u007f It constitutes an introduction to the technology of writingm and to a lesser extent that of numeracy, for a sizable propor- tion of the population, both men and women, many ofwhom would otherwise have little or no schooling. Those who proceed far enough to gain fluency in reading, writing, and calculating for daily practical purposes (generally insome African language, as functional knowledge ofArabic itself is even more restricted) constitute overall a minority, though a sizable one in some areas. Moreover, literacy inArabic script has become a point of reference in many rural and small town settings thought of as largely illiterate in Western terms. \u007f It is a training as well for local leadership, since solid Is- lamic instruction is generally accepted to be an indicator of morality, honesty and discipline and therefore a pri-mary qualification for assuming positions of responsibil- ity. In addition, it has always been\u2014and, given recent dis- affection with formal schooling, has increasingly be-come\u2014an avenue for social and economic advancement because of the close relationship between Islamic net- works and traditional commercial ones throughout theregion. Koranic school graduates are more likely to find employment or apprenticeship with traditional mer- chants and in informal sector marketing operations.11105IK Notes 12 September 1999Cultural Resources and Maternal HealthMali This article was written by Lydia Clemmons and Yaya Coulibaly. In a culture where pregnancy has tradi- tionally been a taboo subject and was rarely discussed at the household level,the Africare's Child Survival Project in the district of Dioro in the Segou Re- gion of Southern Mali (1989-998) suc-cessfully increased communication and health-seeking behavior during preg- nancy. The overall goal of the projectwas to reduce morbidity and mortality rates among children and women of re- productive age The project's strategy,which used indigenous knowledge and cultural resources , is being widely used throughout the district of Dioro, hasspread to other parts of the country, and has been recognized internation- ally. Of special note was the pendelu , a traditional undergarment for women in Mali which, when colored green, took on new symbolic meaning and was usedto signal pregnancy. Specific interven- tions included: maternal health, nutri- tion and growth monitoring; diarrheadisease control, immunization services, family planning services, and education about AIDS and sexually transmitteddiseases. In 1992, Africare, a US-based Private Voluntary Organization working incommunity development, constructed a new maternity ward in the Dioro dis- trict in the sector of Koila, 17 kilome-ters from Dioro. The communities of Koila had expressed the need for the maternity ward and governmenthealth professionals saw it as a key ser- vice delivery point. Prior to its con- struction, only three health facilitiesserved the entire district of Dioro, a population of nearly 90,000. Neverthe- less, the maternity ward's utilizationrates were only 20-30 percent of what they should have been. Let's not discuss it To improve their understanding of the reasons for the under-utilization of the maternity ward, the Dioro project staffdesigned an action-oriented qualitative research project to investigate knowl- edge, attitudes and practices regardingmaternal health (Clemmons and Coulibaly, 1994). The research sought to illuminate the overall context ofpregnancy and childbirth in the project area, and to identify both resources and obstacles related to improved maternalhealth and care seeking. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews revealed somel key findings:\u007f Women and men were not only aware of the dangers associated with pregnancy and childbirth, they werealso worried about the outcome:106IK Notes Number - \"As soon as a woman becomes pregnant, she worries about her health throughout the pregnancy and about the conditions in which she will give birth\" [Female fo- cus group participant]. - \"Every time my wife is pregnant, I've been afraid of what could happen during the delivery\" [Male focusgroup participant] . \u007fThe local culture placed a strong value on husbands play- ing a supportive role during their wives' pregnancy. Bothwomen and men said that the husband of a pregnant woman should act as her principal advisor and protector. - Although men lacked basic information about caring for pregnant women, they demonstrated a great deal of in- terest in the development of the pregnancy and said that they feel responsible for a safe outcome. \u007fOne of the most important cultural obstacles to women's maternal health care-seeking behaviors was the absence of discussion about pregnancy at the household level, par-ticularly between husbands and wives. Both men and women participants cited shame and embarrassment as the primary reason for the lack of verbal communicationon this topic: - A woman is generally ashamed, from the very beginning, of people around her finding out that she is pregnant. - A woman is embarrassed to inform her husband that she is pregnant, particularly if it is her first pregnancy. - During the entire pregnancy, a woman will only discuss her pregnancy with her husband as a last resort: when she has a problem that she is unable to resolve herself, whether that be material, financial or health-related. - A man would rather discuss [pregnancy] and other prob- lems related to sexual relations with a friend or some- one other than his wife. Husbands and wives were not only embarrassed to dis- cuss pregnancy between themselves, but also women withother women, including their mothers-in-law, co-wives and friends. The lack of discussion at the household level about pregnancy can thus block information sharing betweenfamily members about high-risk pregnancies and warning signs. It can also inhibit the decision-making process neces- sary for the allocation of family resources and the adoptionof behaviors beneficial to maternal health. Although women in the Koila sector desired maternal health services, one of the reasons they could not take advantage of them was thatthey could not initiate discussions and solicit the consent and financial support of their husbands, who are considered the heads of the household and the principal decision-mak-ers about family matters in Malian culture. How then could a project hope to communicate with communities and pro-mote the adoption of behaviors that are beneficial to mater- nal health if pregnancy itself was a topic that evoked feel- ings of silent shame and embarrassment among bothwomen and men? Let's start discussing pregnancy: tapping into cultural resources Health educators typically attempt to get people to change their behaviors by appealing to reason through argumentsbased on logic or practical issues. As evidenced by the low impact of many health IEC (Information, Education and Communication) strategies, however, this approach has notbeen effective. Traditional communication channels, includ- ing stories, songs, proverbs, praise-poetry and epics, provide an important alternative for health IEC strategies. Thesecultural resources offer the most direct path to sensitive topics and personal issues through people's values, atti- tudes and motivations (Hale and Stoller, 1985; Mutasa,1994) and can successfully promote behavior change, at both individual and social levels, by appealing to people's emotions, by informing and educating them. For these rea-sons, and within the socio-cultural context described above, the project staff designed a maternal health campaign that utilized three traditional communication channels: (i) a tra-ditional article of women's clothing; (ii) a griot and (iii) a song. The Green Pendelu The little pagne (pendelu in Bambara) is a short cloth un- dergarment resembling a half-slip and worn underneath the clothing. According to social dictates, only married womencan wear the pendelu , for in addition to serving as their inti- mate apparel, it is also used by a couple to wipe away body fluids following sexual intercourse. Although considerederotic clothing (much as a black negligee would be perceived in the United States), the pendelu , traditionally made of white cotton, has a far deeper cultural significance. It isboth perceived as a symbol of marital roles, duties and privi- leges and interpreted as a non-verbal signal or cue for gen- der-specific attitudes and behaviors between husbands andwives. When a wife wraps the pendelu around her waist, the emotions associated with the act of wearing this traditional attire range from simply feeling womanly and attractive tofeeling confident and in control of a situation that she is cre- ating . A woman will wear the pendelu in front of her hus- band in the privacy of the bedroom, discreetly yet sugges-tively, because she wears it to attract his attention, to arouse12107 his desire, and to initiate an interaction that goes beyond the realm of sex. For when a husband notices his wife wear- ing a pendelu , he is reminded not only of his role as a sexual partner, but also as his wife's advisor, protector, and pro- vider. The sight of his wife wearing a pendelu makes a man feel virile, wise, strong, concerned and responsible. Womensay that it is there, in the intimacy of the bedroom, with the pendelu wrapped provocatively around their waists or lying close at hand, that wives are most able to express their con-cerns and special requests, and husbands are most inclined to listen. The pendelu , a subtle yet powerful symbol, is con- sequently an effective traditional non-verbal communica-tion channel used by married couples. It initiates both physical and emotional intimacy and signals in women and men culture-specific and gender-specific roles and responsi-bilities. Chiwome(1994), has demonstrated elsewhere that often, in Africa, the deliberate use of gestures and other non- verbal communication channels are an effective substitutefor words, particularly in a setting where words would be inappropriate. The project staff placed a special order with local tailors to produce three hundred pendelu to distribute during a pilot maternal health campaign. An important modification of the pendelu was to color-code this intimate apparel and dye the traditional white cotton fabric a brilliant green, to sym- bolize pregnancy and to signal the husband's cultural role as protector, advisor and supporter. As Comaroff (1985) hasnoted, \"blue and green, hues of rain, water, freshness and growth... are linked to activating power... (and) connote fe- cundity... Green specifically signifies origins or points ofgrowth.\" The Griot Griots are bards whose traditional role in Malian culture is a combination of oral historian, praise-singer and social me- diator. Bakary Koita is a griot who has lived in Dioro-ville all of his life and is well known throughout the Dioro district.He is a member of one of the major griot families in Mali and learned his profession from his father. Accompanying him- self on a traditional guitar, he is equally at ease with praisesinging, storytelling, and singing new songs that he com- poses himself. The decision to enlist Bakary Koita's services for the ma- ternal health campaign was arrived at through a good un- derstanding of the griot's role in Malian society. Griots have been recognized as social psychologists, mediators/concilia-tors, historians, artists, diplomats, possessors of supernatu- ral, powerful forces, preservers of culture, and educators aswell as entertainers. Throughout history, griots have consis- tently demonstrated their effectiveness as social catalysts, using the power of words to dramatically influence people'sbehavior through their emotions (Conrad and Frank; Johnson; Okpewho; Peek; Sienaert and Cowper-Lewis). Knowing the names, family history, personalities and even the mundane affairs of nearly everyone in the commu- nity, griots enjoy the socially-sanctioned privilege of being able to say directly to anyone what no one else in the com- munity would dare to say, regardless of an individual's age, gender, ethnicity or social standing. Griots use personal cha- risma and the power of words to mediate social relations- between members of the same family, between neighbors, and even between communities. In Mali, only a griot could effectively promote discussion of the sensitive topics of preg- nancy and the pendelu in both the public and private spheres without being considered obscene or inappropriateby rural communities. The song Over a period of two weeks, Mr. Koita worked with the project staff to compose a song that educated people about maternal health care and also promoted the intended use of the green pendelu , following a technical outline developed by the project staff, which contained key maternal health care messages. The technical outline also called for the pro- motion of the green pendelu as a symbol of pregnancy and couple communication and identified husbands, wives and wives' mothers-in-law as target audiences for the song. To counteract the shame, fear and helplessness described byboth men and women in the focus group discussions, the project staff also requested Mr. Koita to associate the ap- pearance of the green pendelu with feelings of happiness, pride, responsibility and confidence. The primary objectives of the song were to(i) inform married men, married women, and women's mothers-in-law about high-risk pregnancies,warning signs during pregnancy, and risk-reduction behav- iors; (ii) increase communication about pregnancy and ma- ternal health care at the household level, particularly be-tween husbands and wives; and (iii) increase pregnant women's utilization of the maternal health care services and facilities offered by qualified providers. The Maternal Health IEC Campaign Africare conducted a pilot maternal health IEC campaign in seven villages in the Koila sector of the Dioro district to test108IK Notes Number the effectiveness of the traditional media. A total of 600 adults (three hundred men and three hundred women) par- ticipated in the campaign. The campaign format consistedof men's and women's assemblies during which maternal health information was communicated by staff, and facili- tated by \"modern\" media, such as videos, flipcharts andbadges, as well as by the three identified cultural resources. During the women's assemblies, the project staff distrib- uted a total of three hundred green pendelu to all married women of reproductive age in each of the seven villages. Impact The project staff conducted an evaluation three months af- ter the campaign to measure the impact of the green pendelu and other communication channels used during the -behavior change communication campaign, includingthe song written by the griot, the video, and a badge pro- moting the project community-based activities. The project's final evaluation Knowledge-Practice-CoverageSurvey further measured the impact of the IEC campaign. The impact evaluation consisted of a survey of 320 people, including 205 individuals who had participated directly inthe various activities of the campaign and 115 who had not participated. The sample included 130 married women of reproductive age (referred to as wives), 127 married men(referred to as husbands) and 63 older women with married sons (referred to as mothers-in law). The average age of re- spondents was 36.5 years. According to the survey results, the campaign dramati- cally increased the level of communication between hus- bands and wives concerning maternal health; overall, 65.5percent of all survey participants said they discussed preg- nancy and maternal health issues after the campaign. Prior to the campaign, approximately 3 percent of the populationhad discussed maternal health with their spouses. Among all of the means of communication used during the campaign, the green pendelu was the element that the participants found the most interesting (83.9 percent). A to- tal of 94.4 percent of survey respondents had heard of it. Remarkably, 85 percent of those interviewed who had not participated in the campaign had heard of the green pendelu , indicating a rapid and effective spread of this inno- vative concept. Indeed, the impact evaluation indicates thatalthough only 600 people (10 percent of the population over the age of 15 years) had participated in the IEC campaign, nearly 5000 people (89 percent of the population) had seenor heard about the green pendelu three months later.Nearly all of those interviewed knew that the green pendelu represented pregnancy: 89.9 percent of husbands, 79 percent of wives and 76.9 percent of mothers-in-law. The IEC campaign led to more positive attitudes and be- haviors related to pregnancy at the household level, includ- ing husbands supporting their wives by reducing theirworkloads, improving their nutrition, and urging them to seek medical attention and maternal health services. The evaluation survey results indicates that the innova- tive use of traditional communication channels was not only effective in promoting non-verbal and verbal communica- tion between husbands, wives and mothers-in-law, but alsofacilitated social change. Pregnancy is no longer a taboo topic in the Koila sector, and indeed, discussion about preg- nancy and maternal health care is now a common occur-rence at both the household and community levels. In the year during and after the awareness-raising campaign, the project surpassed its objective of assuring that 60 percent ofbirths were assisted by a trained birth attendant or health care professional, up from less than 20 percent at the begin- ning of the project. Approximately 77 percent of births wereassisted and more than half of pregnant women sought pre- natal consultations. Conclusion The green pendelu was an ideal innovation within an indig- enous knowledge system because its cultural meaning and use were already well understood in the project area. Allthat was necessary to explain was the meaning of the color green (pregnancy) and to associate it with specific actions beneficial to maternal health. Although the meaning of thegreen pendelu was new, the setting (bedroom), circum- stances (physical and emotional intimacy), users (wives) and intended audience (husbands) remained the same asthose for the traditional pendelu . Women in the Koila sector easily adapted to wearing the green pendelu during preg- nancy because they used a familiar \"body technique.\" In addition, the role of the griot was crucial: ...it is pre- cisely because the bard... conveys a tradition which goes back many centuries that he may be able to contribute in a ratherunique way to the kinds of social changes most needed for the survival of many African peoples today. (Hale and Stoller, 1985) Of the various media and methods used to inform, edu- cate and communicate about pregnancy and maternal health, the DCSP impact evaluation survey showed that thethree traditional media were by far the most remembered12109 by the communities. Nearly all respondents remembered the green pendelu, the griot , and the song. Hence, although pendelu , griots and songs are traditional channels of com- munication in Mali, their utilization can be effectively inno- vated to adapt them to modern needs. Mutasa (1994) draws similar conclusions in his discussion of the modern use ofold proverbs in South Africa: Changing times and situations require solutions which the traditional forms can no longer supply. However, it isoften sufficient to adapt an antiquated item to a modern context or constructions. This process of innovation be- comes a living proof of continuity of the traditional forms.Many development projects tend to ignore or undervalue cultural resources, turning instead to new technology and \"modern\" resources. Africare's maternal health IEC cam-paign in Dioro, Mali, illustrates the potential that indig- enous knowledge and other cultural resources have for con- tributing to the health and welfare of rural communities inAfrica.110IK Notes 13 October 1999Sahelian Languages, Indigenous Knowledgeand Self-Management This article is based on research conducted by local researchers with the support and technical supervision of PeterEaston, Associate Professor, Graduate Studies in Adult Education, Florida State University, with the collaboration ofthe concerned African communities. The research was carried out under the joint aegis of the Club du Sahel/OECD,the Interstate Committee for Combating Drought in the Sahel/Comite Inter-etat de Lutte Contre la Secheresse(CILSS) and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa ( ADEA). Africa is a continent of many languages \u2014over 2,000, in fact, by recent count\u2014 though many are related and a numberare inter-comprehensible to a greater or lesser degree. It is also a continent of multilinguism, where a relatively highproportion of the population speaks or understands more than one language. In addition, the distribution of lan-guages is far from uniform. West Africa is a case in point. Coastal areas are for the most part characterized by a largenumber of native languages, many not widely distributed. Interior regions, and the Sahel in particular, on theother hand, are characterized by a smaller number of languages of broad diffusion. The reasons are both topographical and political. Dense forests, numerous rivers and the ever-present tsetse flymade lateral communications and horse-born transport very difficult in coastal regions and gave rise to a multi-tude of ethnic groups and small lan- guage communities. However, in the in- land areas of savanna and desert-edgeplains, travel was easier over long dis- tances. Empires arose to regulate and tax the flourishing trans-Sahara tradeand at the same time spread vehicular African languages like Bambara, Wolof and Moor\u00e9 over wide spaces. It is there-fore said that one can go from Dakar to Lake Chad overland using only three African languages\u2014Wolof, Bambaraand Hausa\u2014whereas a trip of equal dis- tance down the coast to Nigeria would require more than 300. In the Gulmu region of Burkina Faso, located in little-developed areas of the extreme east bordering Benin, TinTua, a local NGO established in 1985 by community members to resuscitate a generally unsuccessful state-sup-ported literacy campaign, has created a network of literacy centers devoted to instruction in the Gulmanc\u00e9ma lan-guage, a minority language in Burkina Faso, but one spoken nonetheless by over 500,000 people. The centers cover31 villages of the region, all of which (with the exception of the district capi- tal) lacked primary schools at the in-ception of the program. It now serves about 15,000 adolescent and adult learners annually, of whom 41 percentare women. Tin Tua has also launched a monthly Gulmanc\u00e9ma newspaper, \"Labaali,\" which has 3,000 subscribersand employs journalists equipped with motor bikes and tape recorders in all of the villages covered. On the strength of the results of these literacy programs, the association began, several years ago, creating com-111 munity primary schools where the initial grades of instruc- tion are given in Gulmanc\u00e9ma and French is gradually in- troduced. Two years ago, the first cohort of students trainedin these community schools reached the watershed of the primary education completion exams, which must be taken in French and govern admission to secondary schooling.The children who had started education in their mother tongue performed, on average, significantly better than the graduates of standard primary schools. The curriculum de-signer from Tin Tua tries to explain their success: \"When you consider the environment in which all this is happening and the fact that there is only one instructor per school whospeaks French, what is surprising is the speed of learning. Is it because the mother tongue serves as a springboard for performance in French, or is it the motivation of these stu-dents, the active instructional method used or the devotion of the instructor?\" African languages as an accounting tool Now move west several hundred kilometers into southern Mali, a cotton-growing region where rates of schooling are still little over 20 percent.. In the last two decades, a stringof village associations centered around Koutiala and Bougouni has progressively taken over full responsibility for the marketing of agricultural crops, the management offarm credit, and the reinvestment of proceeds from these operations. And they have done it in large part by mastering accounting and administrative systems developed directlyin the Bambara language. The story is much the same fur- ther north in the inland Niger delta, where rice is the com- mercial crop. In the village of Niono Coloni, local leaders or-ganize examinations to ensure that candidates to the demo- cratically-elected positions of responsibility in the farm co- operative all have the requisite basic level in writtenBambara, though the accounting forms used are in fact bi- lingual and include French labeling as well. Koranic stu- dents and primary school dropouts interested in applyingfor the positions generally enroll in the local adult literacy center to develop proficiency in the phonetic transcription of Bambara. These are not isolated examples. Throughout much of Sahelian West Africa (countries bordering the southern edge of the Sahara Desert), the written form of African lan-guage is being used to an increasing extent as a vehicle of local, if not nation-wide, communication and a means of ex- pressing indigenous culture. The change is most pronounced in the Francophone coun- tries , where relatively little recognition was given to Afri-can languages, considered \"dialects\" and potentially disrup- tive of national unity and international communication. Slow but sure change Several factors have contributed to this change, including the advent of more representative governments and ones more tolerant of civil society, the spread of African lan-guages brought about by internal migration and interethnic contact, and a gradual shift towards recognizing the value of indigenous knowledge and of African culture. At the sametime, experience and research have increasingly demon- strated that children starting school instruction in their mother tongue or a language already well known to themstand a better chance of success \u00be including success at mas- tering a second language of written communication like French or English \u00be than those who are forced to assimilatea totally foreign language from the outset. Adults, too, seem to acquire second language facility most easily through a written knowledge of their own language. Change has been slow in coming, particularly at the cen- tral level, where more has been said than done. The intro- duction of African languages into primary school education,for example, has remained for years at the \"experimental\" level in countries like Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and Senegal and there has been little commerce between agencies ofnon-formal education, which used national languages, and those of formal education, which did not. Over the 1990s, however, momentum has been building at the local level. It has been fueled in large part by the devel- opment of new income-generating enterprises\u2014the coop- eratives, businesses, non-governmental associations and lo-cal community governments that have taken root in an era of demographic pressure and relative economic liberaliza- tion. To manage these enterprises themselves, local peopleneed at least a core of literate staff ; to ensure some degree of democratic accountability in the effort, they need a means to ensure larger numbers of members at least a mo-dicum of literacy and numeracy. African languages\u2014most of which are now written in Romanized or Arabic script\u2014pro- vide a much more accessible means of attaining this goalthan instruction in English, French, Arabic or Portuguese. Literacy gains in Burkina Faso Examples are numerous in Burkina Faso, a country whose name itself is an amalgam of two prominent African lan- guages. of honest112IK Notes Number people. In Bouloulou, a small village in the northern tier of the country not far from Ouahigouya, women are flocking to a literacy center opened for them at the demand of theirown economic development association. In the capital itself, Ouagadougou, a group of newly literate women of the Goughin district have banded together to create \"SongTaaba,\" a cooperative devoted to the manufacture and sale of soap and peanut butter. After an initial failed attempt at entrusting management responsibility in the few memberswith the rudiments of primary schooling, they ended up de- veloping accounting and management systems in the Moor\u00e9 language and have since created a nationwide network oflocal women's businesses. In fact, across the country, the numbers completing lit- eracy courses have begun to rival those completing primaryschooling, a form of education still restricted by lack of French-language trained teachers and outside funding. By 1996, there were, in round figures, 4,000 literacy centerscompared to 3,000 primary schools. In that same year, 46,000 out of 72,000 literacy students tested were declared \"literate\" in one of the national languages of the country,whereas only 11,000 of the 86,000 entrants in sixth grade moved on to middle school. Interestingly, 52 percent of the successful literacy students were women, whereas only 40percent of the sixth grade enrollees, and only 8.5 percent of the middle school matriculants, were girls. Nine out of ten of the newly literate women, according to the National In-stitute of Literacy, were active members of local women's as- sociations and cooperatives. Articulating indigenous knowledge Twenty-five years ago, when the first wave of national lit- eracy campaigns was dying out in Sahelian countries and the first hints of locally-supported literacy were appearing,a wide-ranging evaluation was conducted of literacy's conse- quences in western Mali. Research was carried out by case study, and the team of Malian evaluators happened to spendseveral days in a village named Sirakoro, south of Kita. Though government support of the program had been ir- regular, they found there some remarkable results. The first group of young people made literate in the vil- lage, who then occupied positions monitoring transactions in the local peanut market, themselves trained a second co-hort. Shortly thereafter, the majority of adults in the village had learned to read and write in Bambara/Malink\u00e9, and the village authorities decided that attention should be given tochildren's education. They resolved that no child should henceforth reach the age of twenty without knowing how toread and write in his or her own language. Because there was no formal primary school within walking distance, the village created its own independently and proceeded to build cur-ricula for its program. Among other things, the literate young people took it upon themselves to write down the his- tory of the village and its region and teach it to their pupils. This pattern has been increasingly repeated over the inter- vening years in different parts of the Sahel. African lan- guages are acquiring written form and being used as ameans both of managing local enterprise and recording in- digenous knowledge. After two or three decades of highly variable success when directed top-down in \"national cam-paigns,\" literacy classes began in the 1980s to aquire mo- mentum even as they were taken over by local associations and non-governmental associations for their own uses. Andthey have led in a variety of ways to the better articulation of local culture. Functional trilingualism One difference between the first wave of literacy action and this more recent history is local ownership. Another impor- tant one derives from the fact that African language literacyis now not generally presented as an alternative to compe- tence in international languages like English and French, as a form of \"rural education\" or \"Bantu schooling\" for thosenot entitled thing\"\u2014but rather as both a cul- tural and political asset by itself and a springboard into sec- ond language learning. In addition, a new complementarity among different lan- guages is gradually emerging, one sometimes called \"func- tional trilinguism.\" This three-tiered scheme targets every-one becoming literate in their own mother tongue, then mastering an African language of wider communication (like Moor\u00e9, Wolof or Bambara), and finally acquiring a lan-guage of international communication like English, French or Arabic. The approach seems counter-intuitive for mono- lingual speakers of northern countries but is not difficult toconceive, or witness, on a continent where over 50 percent of the population already speaks at least two languages. Giving voice to minority culture Burkina Faso again provides a case in point. Situated on the boundary between the Sahelian and coastal regions, the country counts no fewer than 71 languages, though fully 75percent of the population speaks one or another of the three most widely-spread (Moor\u00e9, Jula and Fulani) as a second language of communication if not mother tongue. All but a13113 few of the \"Burkinab\u00e8\" languages (adjectival form of the country's name) are now transcribed and used in written form. Increasingly, therefore, a speaker of Gourmanc\u00e9ma islikely to learn Moor\u00e9 or Fulani plus French in the course of his or her education, whether that training follows formal schooling or non-formal education in literacy classes. For this reason, the locally-rising tide of Sahelian lan- guage use has also been a rallying point for minority cul- tures in West Africa that wish to affirm their own identity aspart and parcel of the nation and preserve traditions while opening bridges to wider society. The Tin Tua association il- lustrates the point. So, too, does a remarkable experience inthe Podor region of northwestern Senegal. Since 1986 the organization \"ARED\" (Association for Re- search on Education) has dedicated itself to the publicationof reading materials in the Pulaar language for learners in the departments of Senegal bordering the sea between Dakar and St. Louis. Pulaar is a regionally-specific versionof Peulh or Fulfulde language, found through- out Sahelian countries but nowhere a majority culture out- side of sections of northern Cameroon and the Futa Djalonmountains of Guinea. ARED's program is actually only one of a series of efforts, including another coordinated by APESS(Association Peulh pour l'Education et la Science) in Burkina Faso, that have been devoted in recent years to promoting the use of different regional variants of Fulfuld\u00e9. The activities of ARED have been energetically supported by associations of Pulaar speakers who have emigrated to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the Maghreb and Europe. This sup-port has enabled ARED to produce a whole series of books and newspapers in Pulaar and to give a new impetus to lit- eracy courses for adults. ARED has at the same time pub-lished manuals on a variety of local development, agricul- tural and action research topics in Pulaar. Achieving lit- eracy in Pulaar has become a symbol of honor in village soci-ety in this part of Senegal, and literacy campaigns launched on this basis have greatly contributed to a cultural renewal throughout the region. This is precisely the sort of \"indigenous\" effort at knowl- edge construction that is now cropping up more frequently across the region. What form it will take in the future is un-clear. But it does seem more likely to survive than the cul- tural and literacy campaigns of the early decades of inde- pendence, precisely because it is \"owned\" by local actorsand founded on local economic and social necessity.114IK Notes 14 November 1999Grassroots Dissemination of Research in Africa:Collecting and Connecting This article is based on research conducted by local researchers with the support and technical supervision of PeterEaston, Associate professor, Graduate Studies in Adult Education, Florida State University, with the collaboration ofthe concerned African communities. The research was carried out under the joint aegis of the Club du Sahel/OECD,the Interstate Committee for Combating Drought in the Sahel/Comite Inter-etat Contre la Secheresse (CILSS) andthe Association for the development of Education in Africa. How often does the still-limited quan- tity of research done by African re- searchers actually reach an African au-dience that is ready to use its results? By what channels does this communi- cation pass and by what means can ithave the most positive effect? Methods for grassroots dissemina- tion of the results of African researchare being worked out at local levels through a USAID-funded endeavor, the ABEL Project (Achieving Basic Educa-tion and Literacy), The project involves disseminating studies carried out by African research-ers around the theme \"decentralization and local capacity-building,\" but doing so in a manner that includes both thedisseminators and the target audience in critiquing the studies, documenting and analyzing their own related experi-ence, and drawing practical policy con- clusions from the results. Carrying out research worth disseminating The original studies for this experi- ment were conducted between 1996 and 1998, through previous ABEL funding, by teams of African research-ers in several countries. This approachwas innovative in a number of respects, notably by the highly developed form of subcontracting. Rather than engagethe researchers as \"hired guns\" to carry out studies directed by a north- ern institution, the entity with theABEL contract (the Florida State Uni- versity) contracted with research teams on a fixed-price basis to proposeand carry out studies on a series of top- ics. The topics were drawn from a list of priority research targets established bythe Working Group on Nonformal Edu- cation (WG/NFE) of the Association for the Development of Education in Africa(ADEA). ADEA is a consortium of all African Ministers of Education and representa-tives of all principal donor agencies. It functions primarily through working groups of different sub-sectors of edu-cation directed by consortia of African educators and donor representatives. The Working Group on NonformalEducation and Training\u2014established after the ADEA biennial meeting of 1995 and sponsored jointly by theSwiss Agency of International Coopera- tion and the Ministers of Education of Ghana, Mali and Senegal\u2014met for itsfirst plenary in spring 1996 in Dakar and adopted a list of priority topics for research.115 The policy adopted was to invite African research teams to submit proposals on one or more of the topics selected, and to enter into agreements with those able to do researchthrough a performance contract mechanism. This approach required the researchers to produce work of agreed-upon quality within definite time limits and gave them a great deal of flexibility \u2014 so necessary under the uncertain condi- tions for research that exist in Africa \u2014 in order to decide how best to allocate the sums to achieve those ends. Strictaccountability for expenditures was required ex post , but teams did not have to adhere to the originally proposed bud- getary breakdown. A number of very interesting studies were conducted, sev- eral of them spanning more than one country and including portions carried out by separate research teams, who thenhad an opportunity to compare results. Subjects investi- gated included (a) the acquisition of skills in the informal sector of the urban economy, (b) the practical uses ofKoranic literacy, (c) means for building competencies in women's cooperatives, (d) new formulas for NGO-govern- ment cooperation in providing nonformal education, and (e)experiments in informal primary schooling. Getting the word out The question now was how to disseminate this research to those at the local level who would use it. With ABEL fund- ing, a series of studies on skill acquisition in women's coop- eratives and the problems encountered in meeting theirmanagement challenges had been done in rural Ghana and Mali in 1996-1997. The results were compiled, written up, reported in conferences, and made available both in hardcopy in the two countries and via the Internet. But these modes of distribution did little for women in similar situa- tions across West Africa who might benefit from the Ghana-ian and Malian experience, but who evidently neither at- tended professional conferences, nor perhaps had access to the Internet. Project staff therefore decided to think \"outside the box\" in developing the dissemination phase of the activity. The idea was to involve researchers in other potentially inter-ested African countries in \u007f culling through the studies \u007f identifying studies most relevant to local problems in each country \u007f proposing target audiences who might benefit from the research results \u007f developing a methodology for making these people aware of the results and helping them to compare and draw con- clusions from the Ghanaian and Malian experiences.The intermediate institutional structure to accomplish this task was the newly formed National Working Group on Nonformal Education \u2014 a consortium of public and privateagencies (NGOs) involved with nonformal education and af- filiated with the Association for the Development of Educa- tion in Africa (ADEA). Results in Benin In Benin, the embryonic Working Group on Nonformal Education went through the entire collection of studiesdone by African researchers under Phase I of the ABEL Project and selected three of interest to local educators: (a) skill creation in women's cooperatives, (b) the practical usesof Koranic literacy (described in IK Notes 11, August 1999), and (c) knowledge acquisition in the informal sector of the urban economy. It then invited its own constituent groupsand other teams of researchers within Benin to propose methods for disseminating these studies in the field. The Benin NGO \"RAMPE\" proposed taking the Malian andGhanaian studies on women's cooperatives to officers and members of similar institutions in the Toviklin region of northern Benin who, despite initial successes, were havingdifficulty developing their own movement. Researchers took a summary of the nature and results of the study to leaders of the different cooperatives, and madea first discovery. Out of more than 100 entities listed as members of the network, only 21 actually were women-di- rected enterprises. Out of these, the research team identi-fied ten that would be interested in the exercise and avail- able to carry it out. They proceeded to develop a methodol- ogy for presenting the essential nature and results of theMalian and Ghanaian studies to members of each of the ten cooperatives. They then gathered their leaders to discuss how the experience of these two other countries comparedwith that of Toviklin and what practical conclusions might be drawn from the exercise. The activity provoked a genuine effort of self-evaluation and situational analysis by the Beninois groups, which were so fascinated by news of progress made by their \"sisters\" in these two neighboring countries that they moved to identifyseveral areas of blockage in their own situation that had prevented them from achieving autonomy. Principal among these was a deficiency in training and a consequent inabilityto handle the fiscal management of their new enterprises. They resolved to seek early integration\u2014on their own terms \u2014into a centrally sponsored literacy campaign then under-way in northern Benin, and to decide on securing training for their elected officials. A number of details regarding the organization of women's cooperatives in Mali and Ghana \u2014116IK Notes Number and the roles played in them by men\u2014were also discussed and compared with conditions in Benin. Social marketing as a two-edged sword This approach has evolved into both a means for social mar- keting and action research and a strategy for disseminating innovation. Its strength lies in the active involvement of tar-get groups and their appropriation and ownership of the subject material\u2014as well as in the potential cascading ef- fects and learning consequences. But experience in bothphases of the ABEL studies demonstrates that it has an im- pact at two levels: within the communities involved, and among the cadre of researchers responsible for facilitatingthe exercise. This research is different than that usually taught and practiced. It is research as a conversation about indigenousknowledge, its refinement, and its practical applications. Those responsible for the work must struggle to make exist- ing studies understandable in practical terms and help their\"clients\" recognize the fruit of their own experience as re- search worth comparing with work done elsewhere. In addi- tion, a difficult and innovative aspect of the undertakingwas the degree of management responsibility, including budgetary oversight and accountability, devolving to the re- searchers involved. Deploying staff to accomplish objectivesas complex and integrated with local reality as the ones as- signed to this dissemination scheme was an adventure in its own right, since few of the participating researchers had ex-perience managing such an intervention. However, the re- sponsibility was motivating, and the challenge instructive.The style of dissemination in Benin has not been the only one developed. In Botswana, the National Working Group performed similar activities\u2014selecting once again a set ofstudies by African researchers that spoke to issues of local interest\u2014but resorting instead to a strategy of bringing leaders of NGOs together around each topic to pool nationalexperience and compare it with the data and conclusions of the studies. Though a step more removed from the field, this approach had the virtue of creating a setting favorableto policy decisions and new forms of collaboration among the actors involved. Where next? Next efforts are under way in September/October 1999 in The Gambia and Chad, and focused on studies conducted in five other West African countries around the theme of de-centralization and local capacity building\u2014that is, how local communities, enterprises and associations have acquired the competence to assume new development functions in anera of government decentralization. Gambian and Chadian researchers\u2014drawn this time both from the countries' nonformal education working groups and from the ranks of their Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Development\u2014 started by doing an inventory of the many sites where local groups had begun identifying those that might participatein dissemination and comparison. Results will be available by the end of the year.14117This article is a slightly modified version of the article entitled \"Moving On: Less Description, More Prescription for Human Health\" by Katy Moran, in Ecoforum , Journal of the Environment Liaison Center International, Vol. 21, No. 4, January 1998.

Biodiversity- rich countries, indigenous cultureswith their knowledge of the use of bioresources as medicines and compa- nies that seek to discover new thera-peutics through medicinal plants and traditional knowledge now share com- mon interests. The value of plants formedicines is more widely recognized and the \"intellectual property rights\" (IPR) connected with their use havebeen debated worldwide. Indeed, IPR have become a metaphor to describe in- digenous ownership of traditionalknowledge also, generating options for contractual mechanisms to ensure ben- efits return to source cultures andcountries (Mays, et al., 1997). But, as time passes, the extinction rate of spe- cies and cultures continues to acceler-ate and human health further deterio- rates from diseases for which no cures yet exist. How can we apply CBD les-sons and more quickly move on to methods to implement it? Can coun- tries facilitate access and encourage re-search and investment by companies, which, in turn, provide countries and cultures with a fair bargain from prod-ucts that are commercialized? Haveany case studies emerged that demon- strate this, and what questions still need answers? Plants as medicines The IPR debate illuminates the vitality of biodiversity for human health. Fromancient to modern times, plants have been the cornerstone of pharmacy. Spe- cies from tropical countries are valu-able for the richness of their biological and chemical diversity, due, in part, to climatic conditions. In temperate cli-mates, winter kills many plant preda- tors, and temperate plants flourish in the spring before predator populationsincrease. But since tropical species have minimal seasonal respite from predators, many have evolved chemicalprotection from countless predators. The plant chemicals that have evolved to increase plant resistance againstbacteria and other infectious organ- isms of tropical plants may also provide protection and be therapeutically use-ful for human health. Today, one- fourth of our drugs are based on, or de- rived from, plants. In lesser developedcountries, eighty percent of the popula- tion depend on plants for their primary health care.118IK Notes Number 15 Countries Most biodiversity-rich countries are located in the tropics of the South, but technology-rich countries, with resources tosustainably develop biodiversity, are primarily in the tem- perate North. Before the CBD codified the sovereignty of nations over their biodiversity, it was considered \"the com-mon heritage of mankind.\" Free access to biotic resources was available to all, with minimal legalized procedures to return benefits from commercialized products to sourcecountries. The CBD now attempts to balance how all inter- est groups involved can gain from the sustainable use of biodiversity and its components. Northern countries can ac-cess the biodiversity of Southern countries by sharing tech- nology and benefits that arise from its commercial use. It is the responsibility of each CBD Contracting Party, 169 na-tions to date, to devise a national biodiversity policy to docu- ment how this will work in their country, including a legal framework to implement it. India's state-funded Council ofScientific and Industrial Research, for example, has re- cently embarked on a patent program to protect its accumu- lated knowledge of herbal medicines. Companies Since the CBD was introduced, a pharmaceutical product from tropical countries using traditional knowledge has yetto be commercialized. Economic profits have yet to be real- ized. Drug development generally requires expensive and time consuming studies to secure government regulatoryapproval before any drug may be marketed. In the US, a product typically takes from 10-15 years to materialize, af- ter an investment of over $300 million by the company andinvestors who take the financial risk to develop, test and market a new drug. For a new company, infrastructure such as buildings, equipment and research scientists' sala-ries must be paid before any product generates any rev- enues. To raise this huge amount of money to fund drug re- search and development (R & D), companies depend on ven-ture capital, stock offerings, partnerships and the like\u2014in- vestments by outsiders into a company's high-risk, but high-gain ventures. Investors range from individuals to or-ganizations and their investments are secured by patents. Patents provide intellectual property protection for the in- vention of the company, enabling investors to regain thefunds they risked for R & D, if and when a product is com- mercialized. It is unlikely that any company or any investor will risk capital to discover or develop a drug unless theirinvestment is protected from competing companies by a patent.Cultures Seventy-four percent of the main 121 plant derived drugs have the same, or similar, use by native cultures. Ratherthan randomly collecting and screening plants, it is a more efficient strategy for some companies to use indigenous knowledge as a lead to pinpoint promising plants for newmedicines. But few strategies directly address how indig- enous knowledge can be accessed and equitable benefits can be distributed in a culturally sensitive manner that sustainsthe social systems that nurtured it. The difference between a market economy, based on individual ownership, and a communal economy, which typically shares its biologicaland cultural resources internally, means the culture group as a whole must benefit. Even fewer indigenous groups have been included in national discussions on these issues, or oninterpretation and implementation of the CBD in their countries. A case study: Nigeria In practice, a case study of how countries, companies and cultures can cooperate is that of Shaman Pharmaceuticals,Inc. in Nigeria. According to physician, Tom Carlson, SeniorDirector of Ethnobiomedical Field Research at Shaman, \"In this West African country, rich in both biological and cul- tural diversity, indigenous medicinal systems thrive alongwith Western medical facilities. In 1995, the Nigerian gov- ernment officially integrated traditional healers into the state-run national health service as health care providersand today, two-thirds of the health care practitioners are traditional healers of one sort or another\" (Carlson et al., 1997). Professor Maurice Iwu\u2014a scientist and Director of the Bioresources Development and Conservation Programme (BDCP), a Nigerian NGO\u2014explains, \"the BDCP was orga-nized in 1991 as a focal point for collaborative research rela- tionships that build technical skills in Nigeria so bioresources are a viable vehicle for sustainable develop-ment. Improved skills generate pharmaceutical leads that target therapeutic categories for tropical diseases suffered in Nigeria such as malaria, leishmaniasis, and trypanoso-miasis\" (Iwu, 1996). Shaman Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Shaman Pharmaceuticals, Inc. entered this setting in 1990 and, through the BDCP established a research relationship with Nigerian scientific institutions, village communities,and traditional healers and their organizations. The small California-based company began operations focusing on the119 discovery and development of novel pharmaceuticals from plants with a history of native use. Lisa Conte, President and founder of the company describes it, \"As implied by itsname, Shaman uses the science of ethnobotany, as well as isolation and natural products chemistry, medicine and pharmacology to create a more efficient drug discovery pro-cess. At the time of its incorporation as a for-profit corpora- tion, Shaman also founded the Healing Forest Conservancy, a non-profit foundation established specifically to developand implement a process to return benefits to Shaman's col- laborating countries and cultures after a product is com- mercialized.\" Although the young company has not yetmarketed a product, the use of ethnobotanical leads brought potential products to clinical trials within a record time frame (King, et al., 1996). Immediate and medium-term benefits distributed in NigeriaIwu and another Nigerian scientist, Cosmos Obialor, pro- posed initial discussions with healers and traditional lead- ers to talk about a collaborative relationship with Shamanwell before the CBD was introduced in Rio in 1992. \"We vis- ited communities where we had worked for several years al- ready,\" said Iwu, \"including the villages where Obialor and Iwere born. Typically, each community, or village state, is au- tonomous with its own chief and government. Their com- munity decision-making process includes the village chief,his advisors, traditional healers and the elders,\" Iwu added. After lengthy discussions, the groups felt that Shaman shared a common purpose with them consistent with theircultural values concerning human health. Out of these and other early discussions, the prior informed consent and compensation policies of the company were formulated.Prior informed consent discussions covered topics such as the intentions and goals of the project; how and where the plants would be analyzed; their potential for commercializa-tion and benefit-sharing. \"Since then, four ethnobotanical field expeditions have been conducted,\" said Steven King, Senior Vice-presidentfor Ethnobotany and Conservation at Shaman. \"By choice of Nigerian collaborators, benefits have taken the form of workshops and training programs on public health, botany,conservation and ethnobotany; support for a medicinal plant reserve; supplies for village schools; botanical collec- tion supplies for a herbarium; laboratory equipment for sci-entific research on plants that treat parasitic diseases prevalent in West Africa and support for Nigerian scientists to apply modern analytical techniques. Fulfilling companypolicy, immediate and medium term benefits, such as those above, totaling over US$200,000 (two hundred thousand dollars) have been distributed through programs to thevarious stakeholders in the collaboration as the expeditions occur.\" Iwu added, \"The company reports laboratory results back to participating communities regularly. General literature is published on medicinal plants from Nigeria, supplying pub- lic recognition of the benefits of traditional knowledge fromNigeria to society and human health. \" Long-term benefits After a product is commercialized, Shaman will donate a percentage of profits back to Nigeria and all other company collaborators through the Healing Forest Conservancy (theConservancy) for as long as Shaman has a profit. The Con- servancy will distribute these benefits, equally, to all the countries and cultures that are Shaman collaborators, re-gardless of where the plant sample or traditional knowledge that was commercialized originated. In a financially unpre- dictable industry such as this, spreading the benefits andrisks among all Shaman collaborators increases opportuni- ties for compensation (Moran, 1997). Shaman and the Conservancy follow the CBD principle that when local custodians of biodiversity benefit from the sustainable use of their medicinal plants by others, conser- vation opportunities are increased. To resist pressure fromother economic interests that may have adverse impacts on biodiversity, benefits to conserve it must be available at the local level. However, the absence of applicable models leavesthis precept largely untested. To test the feasibility of using trust agreements as a vehicle for benefit sharing, the Con- servancy donated $40,000 (forty thousand dollars) to a trustfund in Nigeria for a pilot project. The Fund for Integrated Rural Development and Tradi- tional Medicine (FIRD-TM), an independent trust fund,was established by the BDCP as the financial mechanism for sustainable development of rural areas and to distribute benefits among Nigerian stakeholders. The board is bal-anced to reflect these interest groups, composed of leaders of traditional healers' associations, senior government offi- cials, representatives of village councils from various ethnicgroups and technical experts from scientific institutions. Chairman of the Board of Management of the Fund, His Royal Highness Eze E. Njemanze of Owerri, is a highly re-spected traditional ruler. The predominance of traditional solidarity systems, such as tribal associations and profes- sional guilds of healers supplies a social structure to ensurecommunity participation. Diverse culture groups in Nigeria will receive funds through traditional healers' organizations and villages consistent with their governing customs. Townassociations, village heads and professional guilds of healers are empowered to make decisions regarding projects in their localities. Those funded will follow the criteria of promoting120IK Notes Number conservation of biodiversity and drug development, as well as the socioeconomic well-being of rural cultures. At the local level, technical skills gained from benefit-sharing help stan-dardize and promote phytomedicines, disseminating and sharing information that benefits traditional healers and the health of the communities they serve. Inauguration of the FIRD-TM was announced in Abuja, Nigeria, on September 30, 1997, during an international workshop on medicinal plants attended by five Nigerianministers and several heads of Nigerian government agen- cies, including the Director General of the Federal Environ- mental Protection Agency. The Honorable Minister of theFederal Capital Territory of Abuja stated, \"...the skills of the traditional medical practitioners who are also the custodi- ans of our native medical culture are now being accordedthe right place in society.\" The trust fund concept offers the added value of attract- ing and managing sources of financing from other NGOs,foundations or companies interested in contributing to a stable fund. When the Conservancy donation was an- nounced, the Association of Indigenous PharmaceuticalManufacturers and the Orange Drug Company of Nigeria pledged additional monies to complement the donation. Next year, the project will be evaluated and used to guidethe Conservancy in developing a template trust fund pro- cess for use by all Shaman collaborators, other companies and foundations. Remaining issues The case study of Shaman in Nigeria offers an example ofhow countries, culture groups and companies can cooperate for the benefit of all stakeholders to sustainably develop biodiversity for human health. It is but one of the ways toaccomplish the goals of the CBD and each participant should continue to seek, identify and prescribe new tech- niques and paradigms that are best suited for conditions ineach situation. The countries, cultures and companies in- volved are so diverse that actions can be effective only by addressing them in their unique cultural, economic and en-vironmental contexts. The following issues have yet to be resolved. \u007f Nigeria offered a strategic alliance for Shaman, with in- tact institutional capacities, particularly at the village level. These autonomous systems, with their own chiefs and functioning governments, chose to use their tradi-tional knowledge in the outside world to reach goals that they, as a group, decided were important to them. Differ- ent indigenous groups hold different beliefs about entre-preneurship and have different visions of what is a mar- ket. These differences should never be an excuse to ex-clude indigenous groups from the sustainable use of biodiversity, for this is their, and only their, decision to make, and not non-indigenous NGOs, as it is often thecase, who claim to represent indigenous views in deciding these matters. \u007f Article 8 (j) is the CBD section that addresses mainte- nance and respect for indigenous knowledge. But it offers only weak protection for culture groups and subordinates CBD obligations to national legislation. Legally, it is theContracting Parties of the CBD, not companies' policies, that hold sovereign authority to decide if and how the sus- tainable development of biodiversity will be accomplishedwithin their borders. The political climate of States under which indigenous groups live is critical to its success. Since indigenous groups are huge stakeholders in the is-sues put forth under the CBD, they must be included in their national discussions on interpreting and implement- ing the CBD. To ensure continuation of their cultural sys-tems, they must fully participate and advocate for them- selves and their own interests. If States are to be effective at conserving the worlds' species, their strategies must bebuilt up through participation by the custodians of biodiversity, not imposed from the capital down. \u007f The affiliation of indigenous peoples with traditional ter- ritories sanctions and governs their ecological practices. Legal recognition of territorial rights by governments provides authority for indigenous groups to deny or per-mit outsiders access to them \u2014 the first step in biodiversity conservation through traditional land and re- source management. But this priority issue was givenonly minimal attention at a recent CBD workshop in Madrid attended by both governments and indigenous groups. A lost opportunity, many stated. Others saw themeeting as a first step where progressive prescriptions for biodiversity conservation through territorial rights, such as Act No. 8371, a recent federal statute in the Philip-pines, could be announced. It remains to be seen in the next forum whether biodiversity conservation through territorial rights will again be subsumed by competingagendas (Burgiel, et al., 1997). \u007f Accurate information is essential. It is incumbent upon all CBD stakeholders to develop a clear understanding of ex-actly what IPR are and what they are not. They are not a surrogate legal right for land and human rights and frus- trations arise from attempting to use IPR in ways notoriginally intended. What will succeed is for countries, cultures and companies to share their experiences coop- eratively, since no single paradigm will work for all. Theconservation and sustainable development of biodiversity require a diversity of approaches.15121IK Notes 16 January 2000Grassroots Democracy in ActionSenegal This article is based on research conducted by local researchers with the support and technicalsupervision of Peter Easton, Associate professor, Graduate Studies in Adult Education., FloridaState University, with the active collaboration of the concerned African communities. Theresearch was carried out under the joint aegis of the Club du Sahel/OECD, the InterstateCommittee for Combating Drought in the Sahel/Comit\u00e9 Inter-\u00e9tat Contre la S\u00e9cheresse (CILSS)and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa. In villages of the Wolof-speaking groundnut basin and the Fulani-speak- ing Fouta Toro racy\" ex-pression. The Senegalese NGO \"Tostan\" (a Wolof name that means \"breaking out of the egg\"), a ruralwomen's non-formal education pro- gram has been developing for over two years a brand of local training in demo-cratic principles and behaviors. The initiative got under way on the heels of a training and empowerment programthat the NGO had been promoting throughout central Senegal for the last decade. The effort was open to all, butit specifically targeted women and in- cluded lessons in problem-solving, in- come generation, African-language lit-eracy and child health. In order to meet emerging felt needs, and as the pro- gram grew, new modules were devel-oped with the beneficiaries One of the last of these was a module on women's health, including some sharing and dis-cussion of a long-taboo subject\u2014 women's sexuality\u2014which broke all records for participation throughoutthose rural areas. Tostan staff discov- ered that one strong and unsuspected source of interest in this module wasthe emphasis put on human rights, particularly the rights of women andchildren to be free from discrimination and the threat of violence. People wanted to know more. Democracy from the family to the state Before developing any new modules, however, staff decided to undertake some participatory research into justwhat most concerned people in this realm and what they most needed to learn. The results were surprising. Re-spondents very much wanted to expand on the issue of human rights and to ex- amine the conditions, even the kind ofsociety, in which these could be more durably ensured. The term \"democ- racy\" surfaced on a number of occa-sions, overheard from national political discourse, but no one was too sure ex- actly what it meant. Staff resolvedtherefore to try out a training sequence that would use \"democracy\" as a cover term for the kind of social arrange-ments under which human rights could be effectively guaranteed and people of all groups and ages could play an activerole in determining their own destiny. The module that resulted from these months of effort included information,discussion, role-playing and applied ac- tivities all focusing on what human122IK Notes Number 16 rights society must protect, how individual and group values are balanced, by what means those who have been deprived of rights can assert them, how conflict is healed, and the sort ofgovernance strategies such goals require. Organizers found it worthwhile to go back to the root meaning of \"democracy\" in Greek\u2014 government by the people \u2014and to facilitate wide- spread discussion of just what this implied and how it related to the assertion of human rights and the resolution of conflict. Democracy was interpreted and discussed as an arrange-ment affecting family life, local associations and village orga- nization every bit as much as it did politics at the regional or national level. The debate and exchange that these topicsprompted in participating communities was extremely lively and soon reached well beyond the confines of the non-formal education course. A remarkable amount of dialogue betweenmen and women, between young people and their elders, and even among ethnic groups ensued in most areas involved. Keeping the faith Organizers were careful to associate village authorities and religious leaders in the process. In fact, perhaps the greatest impetus to the effort was given by its interaction with reli-gious values, mostly Islamic in the areas concerned. The widespread reaction among the faithful was that the rights and democratic principles in question were a better reflec-tion of true Islamic values than much of contemporary soci- ety or customary practice. Palpable results were soon evident on a number of fronts. Much of the momentum seems to have come from a dy- namic much like Gandhian nonviolence\u2014that is, from de- liberate efforts to bring contradictions between values andbehavior into the light of collective awareness. Violence against women and children in the family provides a case in point. Participants in the Tostan democracy education pro-gram were quick to denounce the practice of allowing the beating of wives and children within the family. Cases were brought out and discussed in community after community.As a male head of household in the village of Ngaparou put it, \"We all knew it was not right to beat women. We just got away with it. But you have to change now, because thewhole matter has gone public.\" Going public \u2014 though usu- ally in a non-aggressive way\u2014has to all appearances been a key arm of the movement. Children's rights constitute another principal focus. Groups in the town of Thies who went through the study then identified the lack of birth certificates for a major pro-portion of children born in their community as one of the most serious abuses of human rights to be remedied. It ef- fectively excluded these children from schooling and a seriesof life opportunities. Program participants went on to lobby for new procedures and to obtain certification for a large number of young people. In a number of locations across theregion, the problem of early marriage without the consent of girls was posed in no uncertain terms and widely debated. The increased focus on girls' rights added new impetus tothe grassroots movement to ban female circumcision high- lighted in IK Notes 3 on the Oath of Malicounda. Habits of accountability The democracy debate appears also to be having major ef- fects on practice within local associations and communities. Notions of accountability, transparency, leadership qualifi-cations, interest representation and effective governance were much discussed in the curriculum, as were means for resolving the conflicts that increased claims on social recog-nition and equity inevitably produce. Staff now find former participants maintaining that there has been a major change in procedures and even in personnel within commu-nity associations as a result of the training. \"We now know better what a leader should be,\" they say; and there is a no- ticeable increase in women's access to leadership functions.Women also speak of no longer tolerating customary situa- tions where the leader\u2014of either gender\u2014makes decisions for the membership. And, in several areas, conflict resolu-tion clinics have been established by women who finished the democracy module. Further political ramifications cannot be excluded. Par- ticipants suggest that a much larger proportion of women is interested in voting than ever before - and few are willing to accept the frequent pattern where the male head of thehousehold dictates how all family members shall vote. (In fact, in a number of villages it was the chief who decided how all residents would vote.) The discussion of leaderqualifications has led in several places to new criteria for evaluating political candidacies, a sort of local \"checklist\" of desirable characteristics and an indigenous litmus test fordemocratic intentions. Women in the Fouta Toro region re- solved to monitor more closely national legislation on women's rights. A growth industry Demand for the democracy module has been increasing and prompting a sort of local campaign spirit, particularly at theintersection between this populism and the issues of women's rights. Participants from the islands of Sine Saloum canoed this summer from community to community123 in order to organize women in a region-wide front against fe- male circumcision. Over eighty villages, covering nearly the entire arrondissement of Dabo, have joined the movement of their own volition. And in the Toucouleur areas of the Fouta Toro, participants in the training program have organized their own \"road show\" to take from village to village through-out adjoining rural areas. Results are showing up in some farther-flung areas as well. Participants from the region of Ngirin Bamba started agarden project by asking plots from the men of the village on the principle of \"land to the tiller,\"and then posted a sign reading \"the right to land\" at the gate to their vegetable andfruit cooperative.Notions of \"democracy\"\u2014adapted to local Senegalese condi- tions\u2014are thus woven in and among these various assertions of human rights. The word itself has been assimilated di-rectly into the Wolof and Fulani/Pulaar languages and crops up now in arguments, proclamations and jokes throughout the villages involved. As a women in Ker Simbara explainedto training staff on a follow-up visit, \"We had to change the way we ran our cooperative meetings, because it wasn't con- sistent with 'democracy!\" At a time when the fate of nationalrepresentative government still hangs very much in the bal- ance across the sub-region, a locally-grown variety seems unexpectedly to be laying some of the groundwork for futurechange.124IK Notes 17 February 2000Regional Planning, Local Visions:Participatory Futuring in West Africa This article is based on research conducted by local researchers with the support and technical supervision of PeterEaston, Associate professor, Graduate Studies in Adult Education., Florida State University, with the active collabo-ration of the concerned African communities. The research was carried out under the joint aegis of the Club du Sahel/OECD, the Interstate Committee for Combating Drought in the Sahel/Comit\u00e9 Inter-\u00e9tat Contre la S\u00e9cheresse(CILSS) and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa. Starting in 1990, the Club du Sahel\u2014a branch of the Organization for Eco- nomic Cooperation and Developmentresponsible for coordinating northern donor agencies in support of food secu- rity and natural resource managementin the desert-edge portions of West Af- rica\u2014undertook to update existing long-term planning for the region. Itcooperated in this effort with the Inter- state Committee for Struggle Against Drought in the Sahel (\"CILSS\" by itsfrancophone acronym), an organization affiliating Ministries of Agriculture and other government agencies of sevenSahelian countries in pursuit of similar goals, headquartered in Ouagadougou. The work was chiefly carried out by economists and political scientists en- gaged by the Club du Sahel, who used existing studies and available data onregional trends to project alternate sce- narios for the next thirty years of West African development. The resultingdocument, popularly known as the \"West African Long-Term Perspectives Study\" or \"WALTPS,\" stirred a gooddeal of controversy. There were dis- agreements between Europeans who favored urban-oriented scenarios andNorth Americans who were more in- clined toward rural-oriented ones, and between Northerners who did most ofthe analysis and African researchers who felt a little shortchanged. The en- tire project seemed for a while to bemired in disagreements that obscured the usefulness of the data gathered. Taking it to the field The impasse was overcome in part by turning to West African farmers for ar- bitration. The Club and the CILSShappened to be collaborating at the same time on a participatory study of decentralization and local capacity-building in five countries of the region: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Senegal. It involved case studies of localcommunities and associations which had assumed major new development and management responsibilities ontheir own. Organizers of the five-coun- try research effort suggested that one way to get beyond the stalemate overthe WALTPS Study would be to take its basic questions, observations and con- clusions to the field and ask membersof these same communities what they thought about the matter, since they arguably represented the most impor-tant stakeholders of such long-range planning. The specialists expressed some skepticism at such a \"populist\"125 approach: did local people have the necessary breadth of vi- sion and distance from daily concerns required to contrib- ute to such futuring? Proponents countered that nearly ev-ery village had people who had either traveled extensively in the region or were currently away working in coastal cities, if not overseas, and that the combination of this experiencewith first-hand knowledge of local conditions made them es- sential counterparts. In the end, it was decided to undertake a local consulta- tion on long-range planning across the five countries. The African and international researchers involved developed a trial methodology for inviting debate and analysis of the fu-ture of the immediate community and the larger region in each of the areas visited. It entailed enlisting representa- tives from a variety of local social groups in the data collec-tion, discussion and forecasting process. Protocols for local debate The work covered five sequential steps: 1. Examine the most important changes that have oc- curred in the immediate community, the surrounding coun- try and the West African region as a whole over the lastthirty years, concentrating on five related dimensions of daily life: \u007f Environment\u007f Demography \u007f Economy \u007f Society and culture\u007f Politics. The researchers prepared a digest of the essential find- ings of the WALTPS Study, but also took care to solicit local viewpoints. The essential question was simply, \"How have things changed in your community and its surroundingsfrom these five points of view since the time when today's young adults were themselves babies?\" 2. Consider the underlying factors that seem to account for or explain these changes, their relations to each other, and the longer-term trends that they reveal. 3. Imagine the situation that might obtain in another thirty years\u2014in all five areas just named\u2014if the same trends and factors continued to operate in much the same manner. 4. Discuss future scenarios and conditions that the group might prefer to this forecast\u2014that is, the type of future that they would like to deed to their children. 5. Consider what might need to be done at local, national and international levels to move the situation toward these preferred futures.The methodology used to launch the process and guide de- bate varied significantly from one country to another: \u007f In Ghana, for example, the research team took care to en- large the sample of local associations and businesses vis- ited in order to include a few secondary schools and higher training institutes where they might get the per-spective of the next generation of West African leaders. (The methods used in Ghana are presented more fully in a section at the end of this appendix.) \u007f In Niger and in Mali, the research teams put together Af- rican language versions of the facilitator's manual and discussion guide. \u007f In Burkina Faso, researchers decided to ask each commu- nity to name a \"panel\" of participants, sampled by age and gender, and worked exclusively with this focus group. \u007f In Senegal, national researchers gave each local research team a set of simple facilitator's aids, including a map of Africa, a map of Senegal and a flip chart with butcher pa-per and felt-tip markers. The participatory dimension of the exercise was also given the greatest prominence in Senegal, where the national research team invited inter-ested local associations to organize the debates them- selves, trained the staff that they selected and established contracts with these local institutions for direction of thework. Local visions The exercise stirred a great deal of interest in all communi- ties that took part\u2014fifty-six of them in total across the five countries. Substantive results of the experiment can be summarized as follows: 1.The leaders and members of the local associations in- volved\u2014both women and men\u2014turned out to be very inter- ested in the idea of forecasting and discussing the future oftheir community, country and region\u2014and quite capable of playing an active role in the exercise. They were particularly gratified by:\u007f the feeling of having for the first time the opportunity to play a part in political deliberations about development strategy and the future of their environment; \u007f the chance to get a \"systems view\" of the evolution of their environment and to question local practices that seemed incompatible with sustainable development; \u007f this pilot-testing of a procedure that might enable local associations to do more systematic long-term planning and to visualize their relationships with their larger socialenvironment.126IK Notes Number 17 2. Their analyses of the changes that have occurred at the local level, of the trends underlying them, and of likely and possible futures coincide often, but not entirely, with thoseof the authors of the different reference studies. The follow- ing themes stood out in the debates: \u007f The biggest changes and the most disturbing trends iden- tified were those in the ecological and economic domains, concerning agriculture in particular. Widespread and very pronounced awareness of the deterioration of the envi-ronment and of the role that human activity (population increase, farming methods, natural resource use) plays in it were everywhere evident. \u007f Though it is recognized that population is on the increase nearly everywhere and that interaction among social and ethnic groups has intensified at the same time, neitherfact is universally interpreted as a problem or a source of conflict. Opinions regarding family planning differ mark- edly, particularly between mature and older men, on theone hand, and young people and women on the other. The second group generally supports family planning; the first tends to reject it. One peasant woman in Senegal insiststhat \"we are not machines for manufacturing children.\" Yet a pater familias in a neighboring community bases his arguments on the far greater population density in areasof Europe: given adequate resources, there should be no problem in handling population growth. \u007f Local participants give particular emphasis to the rela- tions between urban and rural areas but speak of complementarity, two-way flow, even reverse migration more often than do the authors of the reference studies.Some speakers in towns and cities stress the need for in- creased investment in rural areas, where most of them continue to have close ties. \u007f There is general recognition, most pronounced in land- locked countries like Mali and Niger, that it will be neces- sary henceforth to rely to a greater extent on local re-sources and ingenuity and that, given growing xenopho- bia in host countries, out-migration is no longer a good solution. \u007f Exception is widely taken to the reference studies for not having paid greater attention to the deterioration of social values and to the ethnical and moral side of currenttrends. The breakup of traditional family structure and an increase in individualism are mentioned in both urban and rural areas. 3. There is a tendency to paint the past (represented for the purposes of this exercise by the 1960s) in somewhat ide-alized colors: the soil was then fertile, wildlife was abun- dant, people were content, etc. On the other hand, currentcircumstances are seen as extremely critical and everyone speaks of seeking remedies. 4. In the political realm, participants gave good marks to the beginnings of democratic processes experienced in re- cent years but reproached the political parties with creating dissension. Their prescriptions for the future included giv-ing much greater prominence to local governance. Particu- lar importance was attached by nearly all to the phenomena of locally managed associations, cooperative businesses, andintervillage federations. The problem of linking these grassroots movements with the official decentralization and democratization programs now under way was also fre-quently mentioned. 5. The researchers who coordinated the exercise drew at- tention to some major resistance to decentralization at thelocal level among groups that benefit from the present situ- ation and call for clearer policies regarding the procedures to be followed. Better coupling of the top-down forms of de-centralization with the bottom-up movements now develop- ing in the field offers perhaps the simplest way of both cir- cumventing local resistance and creating a solid base for de-centralization efforts, they felt. 6. Better regional integration and cooperation among the Sahelian countries was mentioned frequently by all partici-pants, but one important qualification to this conclusion stands out. It was recognized that, to a certain degree, the name \"Sahel\" itself and the membership of the CILSS des-ignate a critical dimension of the problem, not the solution. Economic development in West Africa depends in good mea- sure upon better coordination between landlocked andcoastal areas along the north-south axes of precolonial com- merce that fueled the development of the regions' great em- pires but were later broken by colonial patterns. Long-termsolutions to economic stagnation seem therefore to require new alignments between Sahelian countries and coastal ar- eas like Nigeria, Benin, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Guinea andLiberia\u2014and across Francophone/Anglophone divides\u2014 that CILSS can help facilitate but cannot realize within strictly within its own framework. Methodological lessons At the same time, the \"local long-range planning study\" was a methodological experiment as much as a substantive in-quiry into citizens' perceptions of the West African future. Participants in the concluding workshop felt that the long-term payoff to the methodology tried out in the courseof the exercise lies with its transformation into a strategy and a set of tools for self-assessment and strategic planning127 of the different types of local associations and businesses that took part. This kind of instrumentation seems sorely lacking in many associations, which rarely have a methodfor self-evaluation, information storage and retrieval or planning. The results show one other thing of major importance as well, and this is the pressing need for better tools and prac- tices of \"horizon scanning,\" strategic planning and informa- tion use within these organizations. Paradoxically, at a time when project planning methodologies are either falling into disuse or becoming the target of justifiable criticism in aid agencies themselves, some of the most rudimentary andmuch-used of these tools may turn out to be \"just the ticket\" in local associations, communities and enterprises.One of the research teams was asked to propose a simple project planning methodology to a local association involved in the futuring exercise and, somewhat sheepishly, couldcome up with nothing other on the spot than the ancient \"logframe matrix.\" To the surprise of the researchers, this was an instant hit, because it at least offered a \"template\"for organizing local reflection about possible futures and worthwhile investments. Perhaps its shortcomings were as much a consequence of being used at the wrong level (verycentrally rather than more locally) as they were a function of its inherent invalidity. How much of donor organization and government agency practice now criticized might provecatalytic if transposed into the hands of local actors?128IK Notes 18 March 2000Participatory Management and Local Culture:Proverbs and Paradigms This article is based on research conducted by local researchers with the support and technical supervision of Peter Easton,Associate professor, Graduate Studies in Adult Education., Florida State University, with the active collaboration of the con-cerned African communities. The research was carried out under the joint aegis of the Club du Sahel/OECD, the InterstateCommittee for Combating Drought in the Sahel/Comit\u00e9 Inter-\u00e9tat Contre la S\u00e9cheresse (CILSS) and the Association for theDevelopment of Education in Africa. Evaluation is often considered an activ- ity required by donors but fundamen- tally foreign to local culture \u2014 an expe-rience and a way of thinking that are largely alien, if not downright threaten- ing, to program beneficiaries and staffalike. Much has been done in recent years to develop participatory and empower-ing modes of program evaluation that give local staff and stakeholders an ac- tive role and a definite say in howevaluation is carried out and in how its results are interpreted. Creative ways have been found to reconcile this popu-lar participation with reasonable rigor in results and even to increase the reli- ability, validity and the representativenature of findings through more sub- stantial stakeholder input. In addition, there has been increased recognitionthat high caliber evaluations of pro- gram impact are necessarily built on careful day-by-day monitoring and de-scription of actual processes by those involved, and that the meaning of quantitative results is equivocal at bestuntil they are interpreted\u2014sometimes contradictorily\u2014by the different stake- holder groups concerned.Evaluation: Outside mandate or local reflex? All these trends give enhanced impor- tance to local participation in and \"ownership\" of evaluation efforts. Yetthey may leave the heart of the matter largely untouched. Are notions of ac- countability, performance assessmentand data-based decision making out- side impositions or they bear analo- gies to \"indigenous\" concerns? And, ifso, what are the relationships and how are they best tapped to make evalua- tion a local tool, an appropriate tech-nology? The question is of no small sig- nificance in an era of increasing \"de- centralization\" in administration andeducation, where successful ap- proaches to genuine self-management are at a premium. In fact, one of the unanticipated re- sults of participatory evaluation prac- tice in West Africa has been to bring tolight local attitudes and approaches to evaluation, thus creating a basis for the development of appropriate evaluationmethodology. And one of the means for that discovery has been the use of prov- erbs that encapsulate local attitudesand insight with regard to evaluation- related issues like accountability, per- formance and social responsibility.129 Proverbs: Tradition in motion Throughout the region, proverbs provide a highly con- densed, often poetic window on human experience and onlocal understandings of the world. The word for \"proverb\" itself is illustrative of the point in many cultural traditions. In the Hausa language, for example, the term is \"karinmagana,\" which literally means \"folded speech.\" African proverbs are in fact a finely-wrought form of expression where meanings are tightly interleaved, creating associa-tions between apparently disparate realms of experience that throw new light on events and order perception. No wonder these expressions so often require, for the uniniti-ated, what modern criticism would call careful \"unpack- ing.\" They can be spare and evocative as a poem, and as cen- tral to establishing shared understandings of collective phe-nomena as any political assembly. African proverbs are both new and old. They scarcely con- stitute a fixed canon of wisdom. New ones are being in-vented all the time and old ones are falling into disuse, a constant process of what linguists would call \"lexical cre- ativity.\" At the same time, they are not oracles: for everyproverb, it is said, there is another asserting the opposite point of view. Proverbs are more like a language of thought. But they afford a capital means for linking current concernswith the historical experience of the group and helping to ensure continuity and coherence in the value systems and motivations that underlie new initiatives. As an Ewe sayingfrom eastern Ghana makes clear, Ka xoxoa nu wogbia yeyea \u00f0o\u2014\"A new rope is plaited at the end of the old.\" Evaluation and performance To imagine that there was no accountability for resources at the local level prior to the intervention of official develop- ment programs is like presuming that no one learned any-thing before formal schools were established or that agricul- ture was non-existent prior to the arrival of the extension agent. As a Nig\u00e9rien proverb reminds us: Kunkuru ya san makamar matarshi : \"The tortoise knows how to embrace his wife.\" In short, certain things may seem incomprehensible to the outside observer, but insofar as they concern people's essential health and welfare, you can be sure that those in- volved worked out solutions to their at least interim satis-faction long ago. Flash back to an evaluation of functional literacy in the Republic of Mali over two decades ago. In frustration overthe difficulties of tracking a program where advertised re-sults sometimes seemed leagues away from field-level reality, one of the members of the team dredged up a proverb from neighboring Niger that seemed to sum up the situation withtrenchant good humor: Da an ce da gani a kas!: \"When the dog was told that there was food for everyone at the wedding feast, he replied, 'We'll check that out at the ground level!'\" In truth, there can be all kinds of nourishment on the table at a feast, but unless and until it gets down to the ground the dog has no part in it. So it is with many a devel- opment program: the inflated rhetoric does not much matchthe benefits for local participants, and it is just this reality and disparity that evaluation should help examine. The interesting point here is not just the pertinence of the proverb when applied to evaluation concerns, but equally the fact that its relevance and poignancy were so immedi- ately understood and appreciated by people of a neighboringethnic group. The expression became a sort of motto for the evaluation. Accountability and efficiency Accountability may appear to be another imported notion. But a Hausa expression of long vintage sums up perspec- tives familiar in most West African cultures: In ba k'ira, me ya ci gawai? : \"If nothing has been forged, then what happened to the charcoal?\" Blacksmithing is still carried on in many areas of West Africa over charcoal fires. But if that valuable resource is consumed and nothing is produced, there is real cause for concern. Effectiveness is likewise a frequent focus. The Beti of Cameroun put doesn't want to cut brush, it had best sneak back to the sheath.\" \"Efficiency\" itself is scarcely a foreign notion. Numerous local expressions highlight the problem of social processesthat give poor or no results, the downside of operations where the ratio of inputs to outputs is \u00absuboptimal,\u00bb to use the dialect of planners. One of the most colorful comes fromthe Wolof language of Senegal. \"Ten digging, ten filling\u2014lots of dust, no hole.\" A commentary is scarcely needed! Collective decision-making Arguably, evaluation is at its best a form of collective deci- sion-making about the use of resources and appropriate goals for community life. Participatory evaluation makes130IK Notes Number 18 this goal a leitmotif. And West African culture is extremely rich in wisdom and insight regarding both the necessity of cooperation in decision-making and the ways to obtain it.The Hausa language puts the case in few words: Shawara d'awkar d'aki. \" Making a decision is [like] put- ting the roof on a hut.\" In short, everyone must bend downand lift together! An Ewe expression puts another critical spin on the issue, and one particularly relevant to evaluation : \u00abNunya avemexevie ame \u00f0eka me len o. \" Knowledge is like the bird of the forest: one person alone can never catch it.\" At the same time, proverbs frequently make it clear that differing points of view are an essential component of deci- sion-making and that nothing is subject to one single Sira kelen sira t\u00e8, the no way at all.\" And the Hausa language has two marvelous ways to illus- trate the diplomacy and gentleness with which consensus-building must be approached: Girma da arziki kan sa jan sa da abawa: \"It's respect and kindness that allow one to lead a bull with a tiny piece of thread.\" Makiyayen kwad'i ya yi hankali da sandarshi! \"The shepherd of a herd of toads must be very patient with his rod!\" Toads do not move very quickly or all in the same di-rection, but they also are soft-skinned and vulnerable crea- tures\u2014and if the one responsible for herding them gets an- gry and starts laying about with his staff, he is sure to crusha few. Empiricism and causal analysis Evidence is scarcely less important in the local cultures of West Africa than it is in the Western scientific tradition, though it may not always be marshaled in the same ways. In fact, as Levi Strauss maintained in his classic La Science du concret , \"traditional\" culture is, if anything, more tied to the \"hard data\" of experience than is the academic one. Lo- cal practices are typically the results of generations of obser-vation, trial and experiment. These reflexes are obviously important in evaluation and are expressed in a variety of proverbs and sayings through-out the region. To test, among other things, policy options and the often extravagant claims made by politicians, the Hausa people comment quite simply, Ba a gardamar noma ga damana:. \"There's no point debating agricultural skills in the rainy [growing] season!\" In short, let each one use his or her own methods to cultivate their field, and we will seesoon enough what the real results are.A popular Ewe saying stresses the importance of compar- ing information across contexts: \"The farmer who has never ventured beyond his field says his own methods are thebest.\" And another Hausa insight emphasizes the contex- tual circumstances that must be understood to explain even the most unanticipated behavior. Abin da ya ka'da kusu wuta, ya hi wuta zahi: \"Whatever caused the mouse to jump into the fire must be hotter than fire itself.\" At the same time, the relativity of all explanations of events, and the importance of triangulating among inter- pretations\u2014including those of the least well represented\u2014 are eloquently evoked in another proverb from the Africancontinent, this one from Zimbabwe: \u00abThe stories of the hunt will be tales of glory until the day when the animals have their own historians!\u00bb Self-governance and self-assessment Self-assessment is arguably a key component skill in genu- ine self-governance, and African proverbs offer numerousrelated insights. A Mor\u00e9 saying from Burkina Faso uses a striking image to remind us that we are never independent without our own tools and resources: \"The one who sleepson a borrowed mat should realize he is sleeping on the cold, cold ground.\" The Wolof put the same idea a little differently, but with no less effect: Ku la abal i t\u00e0nk, nga dem fa ko neex: \" Bor- row a man's legs and you go where he wants you to go.\" But to take charge of one's destiny requires competence: Barawon kakaki ba ya da iko ya busa shi , they say in Hausa: \"The one who steals the chief's trumpet doesn't have the strength to blow it .\" And it requires an ability and willingness to measure and correct one's faults. Sa k\u00f2g\u00f2len be dogo , in the Bambara language: \"The hid- serpent grows large.\" That is, the failings and weak-nesses we don't correct only get worse. And the Hausa language adds Ranar wanka ba a b'oyon cibiya . \"On the day of the bath, there is no point in hiding the belly button!\" A language for mobilizing local insight The use of local proverbs in evaluation has typically served two purposes. First, it can shed new light on the social dy- namics that influence program operations, insofar as these distillates of local culture\u2014many of which are quite similarand recognizable across ethnic groups\u2014illustrate factors that impinge on individual and collective behavior.131 Still more important, however, the proverbs and sayings offer a way of demonstrating that evaluation and account- ability and a host of similar notions of increasing impor-tance in movements for decentralization and local develop- ment are not unfamiliar activities but simply ramifications of concerns as old as the culture itself. And this attitude cre-ates the basis for helping beneficiaries develop a culturally- appropriate technology of democratic self-governance and\u2014 more important still\u2014authoring it themselves.Gyorgy Sz\u00e8ll has pointed out that a common denominator credo in the participatory management movements of mod- ern industry has been the notion that \"the expert in regardto a worker's work is finally the worker him or herself.\" A Hausa proverb puts it a bit differently, but with much the same import: Kome ya ke saninsh:. \"Whatever concerns the habits of little chicks, [you can be quite sure that] the hawk started learn- ing it long ago.\"132IK Notes 19 April 2000Indigenous Knowledge and IntellectualProperty Rights This article was written by Siddhartha Prakash of the Africa Region, World Bank. It is reproduced in an abridgedversion with the permission of the original publisher: \"Towards a synergy between biodiversity and intellectualproperty rights\" by S. Prakash, September 1999, Journal of World Intellectual Property, Vol. 2, No. 5. International trade in genetic re- sources, often referred to as bio-trade involves high economic stakes today.The sale of drugs based on traditional medicines alone amounts to over US$ 32 billion (1 billion equals 1,000 mil-lion) a year. It has been estimated that by consulting indigenous peoples, bio- prospectors can increase the success ra-tio in trials from one in 10,000 samples to one in two. In the experience of an- other expert, traditional knowledge in-creases the efficiency of screening plants for medicinal properties by more than 400 percent. Without the input ofindigenous knowledge, many valuable medical products used extensively to- day, would not exist. Prior to 1992, traditional knowledge and resources were seen as the com- mon heritage of mankind. There wereno international (and in most countries national) laws regulating access to ge- netic resources As a result, there wasan increase in the commercial use of the knowledge and biological resources of indigenous peoples. The rapid deple-tion of environmental resources and the need to reward both users and pro- viders, gave rise to the Convention onBiological Diversity (CBD), which for the first time acknowledged the valueof indigenous knowledge and re- sources. It established a framework for providing access to genetic resourcesand a means for fair and equitable ben- efit sharing. Intellectual property is a means of ac- quiring ownership over a particular re- source that is intangible in nature. It usually involves the protection of someform of invention created by the hu- man mind. This includes a wide variety of creations, ranging from new music,novels, drugs, to computer software and products obtained from the use of indigenous knowledge. The CBD introduced the notion of in- tellectual property rights as a strategy for conserving biodiversity by grantingcountries sovereign rights over their resources. This was complemented by the Agreement on Trade-Related Intel-lectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The inclusion of TRIPS into the main- stream of the WTO system establishednew disciplines for many countries in patents, copyrights, geographical indi- cations, trademarks and industrial de-signs. The main objective of the agree- ment is to create an international stan- dard for minimum intellectual prop-erty rights (IPR) protection.133 Intellectual property rights: conflict or synergy? Does the protection of indigenous knowledge and resources through the establishment of IPRs promote or hinder thechanneling of equitable economic benefits to the custodi- ans? Critics argue that IPRs are a threat to biodiversity by limiting access to resources and the products derived fromthem. They encourage companies to patent inventions de- rived from indigenous knowledge and resources, without equitably sharing the commercial rewards with these com-munities. The advocates of TRIPS claim that it encourages technology transfer, which could be one strategy for equi- table benefit sharing. There are several other issues thatarise in this debate which will be dealt with and reconciled by examining strategies for working within existing IPR re- gimes and widening their scope where necessary, to con-serve indigenous knowledge and biodiversity. Problems of applicability The individualistic nature of IPRs creates several complica- tions, when applied to local communities. They fail to take into account the fact that these communities have a holisticapproach to their environment. Such communities find itdifficult to separate the resources from which their liveli- hood stems into distinct economic and social assets. As far as IPR is concerned, this leads to another critical problem. How does one define an innovation and a benefi- ciary in local communities, given the need to prove novelty and non-obviousness. In most traditional communities,knowledge is acquired over time and passed on from one generation to the next. Through this process it keeps evolv- ing and changing in character. Therefore, it is difficult to es-tablish when such knowledge was actually discovered and when it entered the public domain. The second aspect of the dilemma involves the commu- nity aspect of indigenous knowledge. It is developed by be- ing shared amongst the members of the community such as the elders who have the wisdom of years of experiencewhich adds further value to knowledge. In this sense it has always been in the public domain of the community and therefore fails to meet the non-obviousness criteria of apatent. And when an entire community is involved in the evolution of traditional knowledge, how does one identify the inventor? The problem is further complicated in caseswhere the same indigenous knowledge is used by different communities across the world. For instance, if a particular herb is used by the Maasai in Kenya, as well as by the Ama-zonian Indians, how does one identify the rightful inventor?Towards a synergy These issues may be reconciled by working within the framework of TRIPS through the use of different forms ofintellectual property rights. These include geographical in- dications which are more applicable to community based in- ventions. Another possibility is to widen the scope of IPRsto include the notion of community based rights. This may include sui generis (of its own kind; constituting a class alone) forms of protection which are more innovative thanthe use of patents. Some suggest that patent laws be modified to ensure that all patent applications disclose the country of origin of bio-logical materials and traditional knowledge used to develop the invention. A related issue involving the patenting of in- digenous practices is the need to document them. The prob-lem with most indigenous practices is that they are passed on from one generation to the next through oral traditions and not written records. In order to prevent traditionalknowledge that is already in the public domain from being patented as a new invention in another country, it is vital to provide written documentation of such practices. This way,indigenous communities can challenge patents being granted to others for practices that are traditionally their own. The World Bank's Indigenous Knowledge databaseand a similar initiative by WIPO to register traditional prac- tices are initiatives in this direction. In addition, the creation of national, regional and interna- tional registries of traditional knowledge could support ben- efit sharing among industry and local communities. They could support IPR- related measures such as strengtheningtraditional knowledge's status as prior art, enabling 'defen- sive publications'. Aside from patents, there are other possible mechanisms for establishing intellectual property rights over indigenous knowledge and resources. These include the use of geo- graphical indications (place names or words associated witha place to identify the origin, type and quality of a product\u2014 for example \"Darjeeling tea\"). These are unique in their ability to reward collective traditions while allowing for evo-lution. They emphasize the relationships between human cultures and their local environment and can be maintained as long as the collective tradition survives. It is immaterialwhether the inventor is an individual, family or large corpo- ration. Indigenous communities claim their knowledge is not to be freely bought or sold. Similarly, a geographical in-dication lacks the typical private property characteristic of being freely transferable. Other forms of protection include copyrights and trade se- crets. Copyrights are often used to protect traditional folk- lore from unauthorized duplication. WIPO has protected134IK Notes Number folklore from different parts of the world as copyrights. Trade secrets are a means to protect confidential informa- tion that can give others such as a business firm a competi-tive advantage. They could be an effective way of protecting indigenous knowledge. Local communities could restrict ac- cess to their territories and information to outsidersthrough agreements that secure confidentiality and eco- nomic benefits. Such practices have been initiated in coun- tries such as Ecuador with the support of the Inter-Ameri-can Development Bank. Sui generis: access and equitable benefit sharing Some of the biggest controversies surrounding IPRs con- cern the protection of local plant species. The TRIPS agree- ment states that members may exclude from patentabil- ity... \"Plants and animals other than micro-organisms and essentially biological processes for the production of plants and animals other than non-biological and microbiologi-cal processes. However, Members shall provide for the pro- tection of plant varieties either by patents or by an effective sui generis system or by any combination thereof.\" \u2014(Ar- ticle 27.3b) Sui generis refers to methods of protection other than the use of a patent. The most common form of sui generis pro- tection for new varieties of plants involves some kind of \"plant breeders rights\". At the international level, a num-ber of countries have joined together in the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV), and negotiated an International Convention forthe Protection of New Varieties of Plants. The Convention lays down minimum standards of protection that national systems should accord. It enables breeders to enjoy the so-called \"breeder's privilege\" which gives them the freedom to use protected plant varieties in their breeding programs to generate other (derived) varieties. Such forms of protection have generated some concerns amongst developing countries, most of which seem to be un- founded. The fear, for example, that farmers will no longerbe allowed to carry on with their traditional farming prac- tices as a result of a patent or sui generis form of protection being issued for a product that has been used by them over along period of time, is misplaced. A product or process that has been used publicly is not new and therefore cannot be patented. Only new plant varieties will be eligible for pro-tection and even then, the onus is on the breeder to seek protection. It is not compulsory. Thus, farmers will be able to retain seed from their harvest for sowing on their land(this has come to be known as the \"farmers' privilege\").Sui generis offers the possibility to move beyond tradi- tional forms of IPR and examine other mechanisms for regulating access to resources and equitable benefit shar-ing. These could include contracts between the users and custodians of these resources, such as Material Transfer Agreements. In Cameroon, for instance, the US NationalCancer Institute signed a contract with the government fol- lowing the discovery of a forest plant species with a poten- tial anti-AIDS chemical. Cameroon provides plant samplesin return for payments which are used for indigenous com- munity development projects to conserve the forests. Others argue that sui generis systems that allow for con- siderable innovation in the form of protection offered need to be expanded even further to include community-based rights and traditional resources rights. NGOs such as theThird World Network advocate an alternative rights regime that reflects the culture and value system of local communi- ties. They argue that, to take into account the dynamic na-ture of traditional knowledge, the concept of 'innovation' needs to be redefined beyond what typifies industrial inno- vations. This could be embodied in community-based rights. Academics have advanced a more holistic approach that integrates property rights with customary laws and prac- tices. They claim that indigenous knowledge cannot beseparated from other indigenous rights such as human rights, rights to land and self government. One possible so- lution could be an integrated rights approach through theestablishment of traditional resource rights which could provide a framework of principles upholding the rights of traditional communities. These can serve as guidelines forother rights such as sui generis property rights. Conclusion Intellectual property rights can provide an effective means of protecting indigenous knowledge systems and plant vari- eties. This note emphasizes the critical importance of docu- menting indigenous knowledge in writing, which can thenbe used to challenge a patent claim on knowledge that is al- ready in the public domain. Second, it highlights the useful- ness of other forms of intellectual property rights than pat-ents such as geographical indications. These may be of more use to indigenous communities seeking to regulate access over their resources, as they can be applied to knowledgethat evolves over time and with the input of the local com- munity at large. This offers the possibility of widening the TRIPS agreement to ensure that patents disclose the originof genetic resources and use of indigenous knowledge and consider sui generis forms of intellectual property such as community based rights to secure equitable benefit sharing.19135IK Notes 20 May 2000Reinventing Apprenticeship and Rites of PassageAn Entry into the Urban Economy in Sub-Saharan Africa This article is based on research conducted by local researchers with the support and technical supervision of Peter Easton,Associate Professor, Graduate Studies in Adult Education, Florida State University, with the active collaboration of theconcerned African communities. The research was carried out under the joint aegis of the Club du Sahel/OECD, theInterstate Committee for Combating Drought in the Sahel/Comite Inter-etat Contre la Secheresse (CILSS) and the Associa-tion for the Development of Education in Africa. Most traditional societies in sub-Sa- haran Africa have developed well-built systems for initiation of young peopleinto the routines, skills and under- standings of adult life. These include age-group organizations, initiatoryrites of passage, and trade apprentice- ship patterns. Traditional arrangements for ap- prenticeship and initiation remain strongest in rural communities and are much less in evidence on the urban pe-riphery among those whom hunger, un- employment, or simply the lure of a better life have motivated to movetownward. Many ties between the two areas remain, and associations for out- migrants from specific villages and re-gions are well known in the cities. A generation left to its own devices On the whole, however, rural out-mi- gration has contributed materially to breaking down the relevance and strength of initiatory and apprentice-ship customs over the years since \"flag independence.\" The most extreme ex- ample of the dissolution of social guar-antees for rites of passage probably lies in the situation of street children, those young people without schooling, occu-pation and often fixed residence who haunt the highways and byways of ur- ban Africa. United Nations agencies and many NGOs concerned with the issue con- sider street children as one sub-cat-egory of working children\u2014that is, young people below the age of legal or social maturity in their host cultureswho are working in conditions detri- mental to their growth and develop- ment. Most children in developing soci-eties, it is true, do and will work . The challenge is much less one of prohibit- ing all forms of labor by those underage than it is ensuring that children are not forced into inappropriate and harmful work by the pressures of sur-vival, and that they have opportunities for a positive transition to adult life. But the plight of street children does throw into relief an important aspect of the situation in the urban periphery that is more than just economic, even ifit is solidly rooted in resource depriva- tion: the lack of socially-sponsored av- enues for displaced young people to de-velop an adult identity. Carbon copies of traditional associations are unlikely to work. As a Hausa proverb puts thematter, \" In rawa ta sake, ki'di ita ma sai ta sake.\" When the beat of the drum changes, the dance step must change as136IK Notes Number 20 well. What are the new beats that make sense in terms of existing social capital and cultural rhythms, as well as the changed conditions that challenge them? Three examplesfrom Africa and one from the Caribbean offer some ideas. Stemming the tide of street children: the Undugu Society in Kenya The Undugu Society was established through the efforts of a Dutch priest who moved to Nairobi in 1972 after 17 yearsof experience in rural Tanzania and who there began a min- istry for urban youth. Few young people turned up for his church-based programs, but he observed that the streets ofNairobi were overflowing with unemployed youth, most vis- ibly the city's \"parking boys\" who sought gratuities from motorists for guarding or washing their cars in Nairobi'scrowded central district. In 1973, the priest began spending most of his time on the streets developing rapport with the boys, talking to themabout their daily lives and about their aspirations. He found many of them to be primary school dropouts whose aban- donment of school and home had often been because theirfamilies could not pay school fees or buy the necessary uni- forms and materials. Most, as an Undugu \"housefather\" points out, responded to queries about their needs with\"Nataka kusoma \"\u2014Kiswahili for \"I want education.\" 1 For these reasons, the priest initially decided that efforts in support of the street children should concentrate on get-ting them back into school, and he set out to find the funds to pay fees and material costs for as many of them as pos- sible. He soon discovered, however, that school directors forthe most part could not take the children or did not want them back. They feared by and large that the same factors that had forced these young people out of school the firsttime would do so again or that the street had worked char- acter changes which would make it impossible for them to conform to standard classroom routine. A learning process This first reversal was followed by a series of new depar-tures, failed initiatives and learning experiences that led the Undugu Society to gradually develop an innovative and pro- gressively more successful approach to the situation of de-prived youth in Nairobi. That model had four clear steps. The first was a network of \"informal schools\" located in slum communities in and around Nairobi. They targetedboys and girls aged 10-16 who had not entered or been able to stay in primary school and were thus at risk of becomingstreet and working children, if they had not already done so. The program was designed to last three years, give basic lit- eracy and survival skills plus a heightened sense of theirown self-worth, and allow those who wished, to return to formal education or move into vocational training. This initiation to formal education or appropriate voca- tional skills constituted phase two of the process and occu- pied an additional year. Those who remained in the pro- gram\u2014or returned to it after a period in formal schooling\u2014had an opportunity to experiment with trades that were prominent in Nairobi's informal economy and for which Undugu possessed adequate workshop facilitites: princi-pally carpentry, tailoring, auto mechanics and metal- working. Finding a place in society The third phase involved transition to employment and adult economic roles. Young people who had developed a trade preference were assisted in identifying an informal-sector artisan with whom they might apprentice for a year in order to gain further training and experience. Undugu was partner to this negotiation and developed certain crite-ria for the selection of \"host\" artisans as well as a procedure for periodic inspection of their facilities to help ensure that the apprentices were being trained and that working condi-tions were not exploitative. During this year of appren- ticeship, the young people involved come in weekly to the workshops at Undugu headquarters for \"skill upgrading.\"This consisted of targeted training with equipment and on technical skills that most local artisans could not offer, training designed at the same time to prepare them to takethe first government trade test in their vocational area at the end of the year. Placement of Undugu trade graduates in jobs or, more fre- quently, in situations of profitable self-employment in the informal sector was the final and fourth phase. Undugu's Business Advisory Unit provides business training andloans to the program's graduates in order to help them set themselves up in their trade. The Society has also estab- lished an Industrial Design department to work on improv-ing the design and marketing of goods and services pro- duced by the informal sector, and specifically in the trades that Undugu supports and by the artisans with whomapprentices have been placed. Staff of the industrial design unit hold workshops for the informal sector artisans who are collaborating with Undugu on the design and marketingof their products, in effect using Undugu apprentices as a vector or vehicle for progressive technical upgrading of in- formal sector production.137 A variety of other approaches The SKI Courier Service in Khartoum . A different but re- lated approach has been taken by the non-governmental or-ganization (NGO) Street Kids International in its work in Khartoum, Sudan. The problem of how to secure for these young people an insertion into urban society and the urbaneconomy led the organization's staff and the young people themselves to reflect on the \"comparative advantage\" that street children might have on the urban market. One oftheir skills is that they do in fact know the streets\u2014i.e., the highways and byways of a conurbation like Khartoum\u2014and are able to handle themselves effectively in what othersmight find to be an intimidating environment. Staff and street children put this fact up against what economists call current \"rigidities\" in the urban economy, and in particularthe difficulty of getting important packages and materials from one side to another of Khartoum's sprawling traffic jams. And they came up with the idea of a Street ChildrenCourier Service. As developed, this initiative involved \u007f Procuring bicycles for the cadre of couriers, which each child could then reimburse from their work proceeds \u007f Training the children in the delivery scheme and appro- priate safety measures \u007f Helping to establish the central organization and ac- counting measures that would make the activity feasible. It was, in fact, a considerable success; and the model was replicated with good effect by SKI in Banglore, India a few years later. Artisans' Associations in Senegal (ENDA/GRAF). Initia- tives supported by ENDA (Environment and Development) Third World in the urban area of Dakar, Senegal, started ina sense at the other end of the stick. ENDA staff were in- volved in helping informal sector artisans\u2014in carpentry, leather working and beverage manufacturing\u2014to formtheir own associations in the interests of upgrading their technology and resolving common problems of supply and marketing. Each activity began, however, with a thorough\"reconnaissance\" of the local environment. It is ENDA's practice, and particularly the habit of its action research unit ( Groupe recherche-actio n-formation or \"GRAF\"), to base all local development work in urban slums upon action research carried out with the beneficiaries. One of the prime issues identified in this exercise by the artisans themselveswas the situation of the numerous out-of-school youth on foot in their neighborhoods. As a consequence, the associations resolved to create their own apprenticeship system to provide avenues for socializa-tion into the workplace and adult life for these young people. The Carpenters' Cooperative was the most active in this regard and has developed a system for rotating the out-of-school youth whom it adopts as apprentices among a se- ries of master craftsmen to learn different aspects of their trade and then\u2014with ENDA/GRAF's help\u2014initiating themas well into accounting and management for small business. SERVOL in Trinidad . A final example of note is taken from a location well off the African continent, but linked toit in numerous historical and cultural ways: the island of Trinidad in the West Indies. Problems of youth-adult transi- tion in urban environments are every bit as pronouncedthere as in the three cases just examined\u2014and in a sense, the origins of one of the best known programs that has sought to deal with them, SERVOL (\"Service Volunteeredfor All\"), were similar as well. Like the Undugu Society, SERVOL was founded by a Catholic priest concerned with deteriorating conditions for youth in the city. Like Undugu,it has grown into an organization that offers not just em- ployment but alternate paths of socialization into adult life for its charges. Prime among these are the SERVOL \"LifeCentres.\" As the name implies, the Life Centres are much more than vocational training facilities. To begin with, they arebuilt by their adolescent members to house workshops, classrooms and community facilities. Each serves as a pre- school center as well, and all participants must take someresponsibility for the infants. Then, too, a major emphasis is on peer counseling and opportunities for young people to talk through the varied social and emotional challengesthey face, in a context imbued with values from the island's three religious traditions: Christian, Muslim and Hindu. The young people participate in development of their own\"SPICES\" curriculum: Spiritual, Physical, Intellectual, Cultural and Emotional savvy. From there, participants may move into vocational training and employment orqualify for modest loan funds to start as entrepreneurs on their own. The program drop-out rate is only 5 percent, the post-training employment or successful self-employmentrate over 75 percent. Essential ingredients: employment, meaning and self-direction All these examples represent efforts to fill the void in ap- prenticeship of adult roles for impoverished young peoplethrown out of a traditional framework and into the vortex of African cities. And they seem to succeed best where they manage to \"recreate tradition\", infusing the customary cat-138IK Notes Number egories of apprentice and age-group association with new economic direction and increased self-direction and defini- tion by the participants. A few other lessons emerge from this rapid overview of ef- forts to assist Africa's impoverished youth in building new identities:\u007f An \"adult education\" approach works best, insofar as it involves building on the experience and skills that young people already have and giving them a determining role inguiding the program. \u007f Gainful and meaningful employment is a cornerstone of new identities, but not the cement. That is provided by avision of the future\u2014whether religious, cultural or politi- cal\u2014and the opportunity to apply it to one's own life. Peer counseling is a frequent element of successful programs.\u007f Traditional forms of apprenticeship and youth association should be used as repertoire and resource, but also be cri- tiqued. Such programs are typically a crucible for manyneighboring cultures. \u007f Discovery of one's environment\u2014and advocacy for change\u2014are critical complements to any effort.20139IK Notes 21 June 2000Indigenous Knowledge for Development Program Two Years Down the Road This IK Note was written by Siddhartha Prakash of the Africa Region, World Bank. Knowledge as a vehicle for develop- ment is under-used. In the past, most African nations adopted economic poli-cies with a view to modernizing society and transforming the productive sec- tors. Indigenous knowledge that couldhave supported this process, or in some cases, offered an alternative perspec- tive, was often relegated to the backwa-ters. However, the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, through the notion of sustain- able development, catapulted thesepractices to the forefront of the devel- opment discourse. Policymakers world- wide, through conferences and work-shops, have begun to highlight the critical role of indigenous knowledge in the development process. The first ofthese was the Global Knowledge Con- ference held in Toronto in June 1997. Under the auspices of the Partner- ship for Information and Communica- tion Technology for Africa (PICTA), the World Bank was encouraged to lead theIndigenous Knowledge (IK) for Devel- opment Initiative in collaboration with other organizations such as UNESCO,ITU and WIPO. The Initiative aims to facilitate a multilateral dialogue be- tween indigenous communities, NGOs,governments, civil society and the pri- vate sector. The objective is to main- stream indigenous knowledge into de-velopment activities and optimize thebenefits of development assistance, es- pecially to the poor. The Bank adopted a framework for action, which is beingimplemented in conjunction with its partner organizations. Two years down the road, its time to review the Bank's progress in achiev- ing these goals. Has the IK Develop- ment Initiative been effective in dis-seminating information; facilitating in- formation exchange among developing communities; applying IndigenousKnowledge in the development process; establishing partnerships? Disseminating information Since its inception, the initiative has developed a database of indigenous knowledge and practices with over 100case studies on the web. Each one draws upon the lessons learned from the experiences of a particular commu-nity in dealing with an aspect of devel- opment. The case studies are not meant to be a repository of knowledge,but a referral database on IK. They cover a wide range of activities\u2014in- cluding indigenous financial practicesamong farming communities in Nige- ria, AIDs prevention through involving traditional healers in awareness cam-paigns, reintroducing local architecture140IK Notes Number 21 NIGERIA Domain: Rural Finance Technology: Savings and Loans Application: Indigenous financial practices among farming communitiesSummary: Farming communities in Nigeria have developed various systems of saving and lending.Normally farmers would form savings associationswith an emphasis on savings and access to theresources on a rotational basis. Some of the asso-ciations would formulate regulations and by-lawswhile the majority has strong but undocumentedformal rules and regulations. Once a member, savingis compulsory and expected on a regular basis,usually related to market days. The loans are usedfor non-consumables, but also for payment of schoolfees or farm labor. Repayment is ensured throughsocial control. Usually members do not receiveinterest on deposits, loans are granted on favorableterms. No mention is made of dealing with defaulters;it is assumed that social control is sufficient toensure a sustainable S/L association. However, thesavings base is too small for accumulation or forcredits to finance major investments. So far there hasbeen little recognition by the formal credit institutionsof the existing indigenous financial practices.Lesson: Existing indigenous rural savings and loan associations are yet to be recognized by the formalcredit sector. Collaboration on an equitable basiswould increase the impact of formal institutions andincrease the investment potential in rural areas.Source: Nweze, N.J. IK Monitor 2(2) August 1994 External Link: IK Monitorin Egypt, common water resource management in Burkina Faso, and indigenous healing of war-affected children else- where in Africa. The range and complexity of subjects that can be effec- tively dealt with through the application of indigenous knowledge and practices are being documented in a series ofIK Notes. These are published electronically and in print in three languages, reaching over 20,000 readers. Each of the 19 IK Notes to date explores in some detail sensitive issues,such as female circumcision, and describes locally driven so- lutions. These range from the efforts of indigenous women's NGOs that have successfully campaigned against such prac-tices to lobbying the government to introduce new laws. Each case reinforces the success of a bottom-up approach to development. In cases, where international agencies such asUnicef have assisted, they have merely provided backup support via financial assistance and international recogni- tion. In each case, the initiative is always \"home grown\" andlocally owned. This has in turn strengthened local institu- tions and led to some cutting edge work in areas such as education and Koranic literacy in West Africa. The IK Notes have shown that \"individuals without any formal education, from villages with minimal resources, can improve their lives and environment through a solid pro-gram leading to greater autonomy and self sufficiency\". These success stories endorse the universality of indigenous knowledge, which can play a key role in the process of em-powering local communities, at the regional, national and global level. Facilitating exchange The World Bank has supported eight IK Resource Centers in Africa, by improving their capacity to share information. This has taken many forms. In Cameroon, Tanzania, Ethio-pia and Zimbabwe, the project facilitated the capturing of IK through stimulating research into IK practices by local centers. In Burkina Faso and Uganda, the project improvedthe connectivity and networking capacity of local telecom- munications. As a result, rural community Telecenters are now being used to obtain information from local communi-ties and disseminate the knowledge generated to other re- gions. Applying Indigenous Knowledge One of the greatest achievements of the IK Initiative has been its initial success in mainstreaming the use of IK in de- velopment programs and projects. It supported Uganda informulating a national policy on IK, Ghana in the use of IK to improve agricultural practices, Burkina Faso in highlighting the role of traditional hunters in natural resource manage-ment. In July 1999, the Bank initiated a study in collaboration with UNCST to explore the diversity of IK in Uganda in re-lation to agriculture, health sciences and technology. This formed the basis of a national strategy that would include all the stakeholders, from indigenous healers to civil society,as well as policy makers. Six months later, a national workshop involving these key players was held to draft a national strategy and frameworkfor action. This was the genesis of the Kampala Declaration on IK for sustainable development. The Declaration urges the government to support the development of IK and plan-ners to include IK in the national planning process. This is being implemented in several ways, such as including IK into Uganda's Comprehensive Development Framework(CDF), led by the Ministry of Planning. This is a joint part- nership between donors and governments aimed at accelerat-141 ing the pace of growth in Africa. In Uganda, one of the goals is raising agricultural productivity. The IK Initiative has played a facilitating role by establishing a Steering Commit-tee to monitor the implementation process and a Secretariat to coordinate activities specifically related to IK. The IK Initiative is moving beyond policy making into project management. It has begun advising the Ugandan National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) on the use of IK in Bank supported Agriculture, Research andTraining Projects (ARTP). The second phase of the ongoing ARTP (II) project is aimed at supporting long term technol- ogy development and dissemination. The IK Initiative's roleis to provide the methodological input to transfer relevant technologies and IK and improved cultural practices to farmers' fields and promote their adoption. Examples ofsuch practices include the improved cultural management of Matoke to reduce the harmful effects of the Sigatoka dis- ease and small farm implements designed for the smallercattle of Uganda such as the improved Ugandan plow. Al- though, the project is still in its infancy, it is hoped that its success can be used to mainstream and replicate the use ofIK in the development of new projects. Establishing partnerships The project has expanded its support base by establishing close partnerships with several development organizations, NGOs and IK Centers. More than 75 percent of the best prac- tices disseminated on the web were provided by these part-ners. The initiative is growing beyond PICTA members. It has for instance, begun to work with WIPO to address the in- tellectual property rights aspect of IK. At the grass roots, theInitiative has begun to engage local communities and learn from their experiences. By supporting NGOs and institu- tions such as UNCST, the Bank has played an enabling rolein bringing together traditional healers, academics, minis- ters, civil society and the church. As a result, indigenous or- ganizations such as Traditional Herbalists Associations areable to pursue a two-way dialogue, with government institu- tions on a level playing field. By creating channels for local communities to voice their concerns at the regional and in-ternational level, the project has made significant progress towards mainstreaming IK into the development process in Africa. Next steps The challenges ahead include: \u007f Intensified efforts to mainstream IK into the development process \u007f Greater donor involvement and active participation \u007f Facilitating interactive exchanges through establishing communities of practice (through various fora\u2014e.g., Development Marketplace) \u007f Forming local alliances around topics such as IPRs to facilitate enablement and empowerment.142IK Notes 22 July 2000Indigenous Knowledge Goes to School Potential and Perils of Community Education in the Western Sahel This article was co-authored by by Peter Easton (Florida State University), Chris Capacci (CommunitySchools/Kolondi\u00e9ba, Mali) and Lamine Kane (ANAFA/Senegal). The research was carried out under the jointaegis of the Club du Sahel/OECD, the Interstate Committee for Combating Drought in the Sahel/Comit\u00e9Inter-\u00e9tat Contre la S\u00e9cheresse ( CILSS ) and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa. For indigenous knowledge to have sig- nificant bearing on the future of West African societies, it must gain somecurrency in schools, the social institu- tion officially chartered to organize learning, certify knowledge and trainthe next generation of citizens. And yet across the region education has been the sector least likely to embrace localknowledge or to regard indigenous sci- ence as a legitimate source of inspira- tion. Exceptions to the rule havemostly occurred in nonformal educa- tion and literacy programs, which are more frequently conducted in Africanlanguages and focused on local commu- nity needs. New ways of schooling Changes that have taken place throughout West Africa in the situation of formal primary education over thelast twenty years, however, have begun to breach the wall that separated schooling and local society. They are atthe same time creating a space for new curricula. Prime examples: \u007f Universal primary education re- mains an elusive goal. By reducing resources available for education and restricting public sector employment,the structural adjustment policies ap- plied to West African countries begin- ning in the 1980s put a dent both inpopular motivation for schooling and the capacity of the State to provide it. Gross enrollment ratios at the pri-mary level, which averaged under 30 percent for Sahelian countries in 1980, progressed very little over theensuing decade\u2014negative growth in Mali, (-3 percent), barely 4 percent in Niger, and between 1 and 2 percent ayear in Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Senegal. Coverage shrank in most rural areas. \u007f Governments have begun turning to alternate formulas and supply mechanisms to reverse enrollmenttrends, achieve coverage and/or in- crease relevance. These include com- munity schools, increased support fornonformal education, and a variety of experimental programs. \u007f Traditional formal schooling has been subject to increased cultural competition and critique from other models: some centered on \"appropri-ate development,\" others on religious instruction, adult education ap- proaches or African-language cur-ricula. Reform of primary and sec- ondary schooling is nearly every- where on the agenda.143 \u007f Civil society is playing an enhanced role in educational sup- ply. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private foundations and local associations are increasingly autho-rized and encouraged to create their own schools. Govern- ment is less and less concerned with exercising monopoly rights in the area of education, though it conserves keyregulatory functions. \u007f The formal educational system itself is being decentral- ized to an unaccustomed degree, with greater discretion-ary powers being placed in the hands of regional inspec- tors and local educational councils. It is this diversification in provision and search for cul- tural identity that has opened the door, however hesitantly, to new curricula and new sources of inspiration and has cre-ated new opportunities for the recognition of indigenous knowledge. A history of experimentation In one sense, of course, the search for alternate forms of schooling is not new to West Africa. In fact, the very notion of \"indigenous curricula\" is heavily tainted with remem-brances from colonial times, when terms like these were code words for distinguishing the kind of education judged appropriate for rural or \"native\" populations from the kindreserved for an urban elite. Excess demand for formal schooling, however, or its perceived shortcomings led to a variety of alternative educational delivery models in post-independence Africa. The Harambee movement in Kenya is a prime example of the former: schools created by communi- ties in the absence of State provision, though subsequentlytaken over by the government in many cases. The Serowe Brigades in Botswana and \" Enseignement moyen pratique Senegal exemplify the latter: attempts to make schoolcurricula relevant to local development by infusions of ap- propriate technology training, practical business experience and local cultural reference. There are, though, some important quantitative and qualitative differences between the varied experiments in alternative schooling or community sponsorship launchedover the early decades of West African independence and the situation obtaining today. In quantitative terms, alternative and community-based schooling has become, for the firsttime, a significant slice of the overall national system in a number of countries like Mali, Senegal and Burkina Faso. Such efforts were traditionally \"pilot projects,\" destined\u2014itseemed\u2014never to expand beyond their select locations. They have broken out of this enclosure to an increasing de-gree, accounting presently for nearly a quarter of all elemen- tary schools in rural Mali and are projected to total 20 percent of those in Senegal in the next few years. Qualitatively, alter-native education is no longer necessarily second class, though issues of equivalency with traditional diplomas and promo- tion schemes (discussed below) remain acute. The increasinglegitimacy of instruction in African languages, gradual shifts in power toward local actors under slowly decentralizing re- gimes and changes in the employment prospects of schoolleavers have all eroded the hegemony of the single standard Western curriculum and opened space for different and complementary approaches. The search for alternatives has taken a variety of forms\u2014 State-sponsored community schools; NGO-sponsored com- munity schools; State-sponsored pilot or reform schools(generally traditional elementary schools selected to adopt one or more of the innovative methods of community schooling and to apply it within a formal educational frame-work); increased interest in Koranic schooling or hybrid Is- lamic-Western forms; and private or \"wildcat\" schools started by individuals or entrepreneurs, particularly in ur-ban areas. The community involvement model In the Sahel as elsewhere around the African continent, community schools are premised on the notion of greater parental and community involvement in the governance and delivery of education. Local \"ownership\" of schooling isdeveloped and expressed in several ways: \u007f Financial participation: Contributions to the construc- tion and equipment of classes, to school operating ex-penses and to teacher stipends. \u007f Administrative participation: Involvement in decision- making concerning school administration and regula-tions. \u007f Curricular participation: An increased role for parents and community members in choosing and specifying cur-ricula, in teaching classes and assessing student learning. Curricular participation is evidently the variety of com- munity input of greatest relevance to the inclusion of indig- enous knowledge in schooling, though financial and admin- istrative participation may be necessary to make it effective.Among the measures proposed for achieving it in the case of outside-sponsored community schools are use of the local languages for instruction; adoption of local artisans as re-sources for instruction, either through their actual teaching of courses or visits by children to their places of work; record-144IK Notes Number ing and teaching of local history along with other subject matters; and inclusion of locally-inspired religious or moral education. In addition, some of the NGOs and civil society institu- tions involved in sponsoring community schools are ani- mated by an explicit desire to create new curricula more ap-propriate to the challenges of local development in 21 st cen- tury Africa. The Institut d'Education Populaire in Kati, Mali, for example, has labored long and hard on the elabora-tion of an elementary school \"Ciwara\" program (the Bambara word for the antelope-head totem symbolic of Malian identity) focusing on the acquisition of \"leadership\"skills\u2014in short, young people's ability to play a decisive role in the development of their own communities. In both Senegal and Mali, moreover, the civil society part- ners involved in support for community schools tend to be associations with parallel involvements in other sectors of local development, like natural resource management,health and agriculture. CEWIGAP in northern Mali (\"Com- munity Education, Water and Income Generating Activi- ties\") and organizations like Tostan and ANAFA in theDjourbel region of Senegal, for example, combine their school sponsorship with a variety of other projects. This cross-breeding creates increased opportunities for introduc-ing local development topics into the curriculum of elemen- tary and secondary schooling, along with local sources of re- lated knowledge. Difficulties of implementation Unfortunately, a great deal is still more said than done in this realm. The indigenous knowledge elements in the com-munity school model tend to be those least frequently implemented, for they require the most imagination and energy, not to say willingness to break with existing norms.In fact, there is a general tendency for schools of this sort to become simply low-cost if not low-quality replicas of exist- ing primary schooling, due principally to the resource con-straints that they face. Human resource constraints . Teachers generally have minimal training and may have limited education. In somemodels, literate villagers or parents are selected by the com- munity itself to undergo a few days of training; in another, volunteers paid by donated funds are recruited from amongunemployed school leavers and assigned to villages. Financial constraints . Community education models are designed to be inexpensive, a solution to the prohibitivecosts of generalizing the existing school infrastructure. They count, to the extent possible, on local materials andfunds, and these are often scarce. Areas where communities are expected to pay teachers often experience particular problems. Technical constraints . Building an alternative curriculum takes experience and insight that are often in short supply. The biggest challenge is reconciling local content with a pro-gram of studies that enables some, at least, to continue to further formal education should they desire to do so. This synthesis, called \"p\u00e9dagogie convergente\" in Mali, dependsto a great extent on finding a way to teach the international language used in secondary and higher education from a ba- sis of literacy in the local or national language, and doing sowith the assistance of teaching personnel who themselves often do not have a mastery of the former. The effort typi- cally takes such energy that little is left for developing theindigenous knowledge inputs into the curriculum. Political constraints. The success of community schools is partly contingent on the possibility of building institutionalbridges to subsequent formal schooling, what are called \"passerelles\" in the Franchophone countries. This terrain tends to be heavily guarded by the proponents (and prod-ucts) of traditional primary and secondary education. Ironi- cally, as provision of alternate education is expanded and delegated to local associations and NGOs, there is often in-creased stasis on this political front, because local associa- tions feel less \"empowered\" to challenge the existing educa- tional constabulary on this terrain than might ministerialrepresentatives or large international organizations. Concerns for quality \"Quality\" and \"equity\" are keywords in the debate about the future of community schools in Sahelian West Africa. The former invokes the criticism most often leveled at the movement: education is made available to new communitiesand students, but what education? Can poorly supervised teachers who are unable to handle the lingua franca of the formal system and schools without textbooks or amenitiesoffer children anything worth having? And doesn't this sort of provision pose as much of an equity problem as it re- solves\u2014by creating a two-tiered system, where the ruraland urban poor get only the caricature of a \"real educa- tion\"? These days proponents of community schools are very aware of the issue, and internal evaluations within organi- zations sponsoring schools tend to focus increasingly on quality concerns. At the same time, proponents typicallyhave two rejoinders that at least serve to broaden the de- bate. First, what exactly is meant by \"quality\"? Do commu-22145 nity involvement, literacy in the local language, incorpora- tion of cultural contents and direct relationship to develop- ment concerns in other sectors figure in the definition, orare standardized test scores and passage rates to secondary school the only criteria? Second, in respect to equity, what are the tradeoffs between local gender equity and increasedparity between city and countryside? Community schools do at least have on average a distinctly better record of female participation than their formal sector counterparts. Education by all? Both the community school movement and the attempt to give indigenous knowledge a place in local schooling there-fore face formidable obstacles. Community schools nonethe- less constitute one of the most massive opportunities for greater recognition of indigenous knowledge to have arisenso far in Sahelian West Africa and already have several ma- jor accomplishments to their credit. As evaluation surveys in both Senegal and Mali reveal, they are generally well ap-preciated by consumers\u2014that is, parents and local authori- ties\u2014principally because of their use of African languages and their potential congruence with local culture.The recent move toward NGO and local association spon- sorship has also meant a closer link with other realms of lo- cal development where indigenous knowledge is bothneeded and used. And the movement constitutes a sizeable wedge for reform of schooling in general\u2014as witness the number of times that its example has been invoked in the\"Estates General\" (or national assemblies on education) convoked by Sahelian countries in recent years to address issues of educational reform. Community education in factembodies one potential form of \"Education BY All,\" a strat- egy\" critically needed to complement increasing emphasis on \"Education FOR All\"\u2014and it represents a venue withinwhich indigenous knowledge might come into its own. At the same time, the perils and potentials of the commu- nity school movement illustrate the kinds of policy changesthat will be required to achieve the systematic promotion of indigenous knowledge in contemporary West Africa.146IK Notes 23 August 2000Seeds of Life: Women and AgriculturalBiodiversity in Africa This article was written by co-authored by Peter Easton and Margaret Ronald, Florida State University.The research was caried out under the joint aegis of the Club du Sahel/OECD, the Interstate Committeefor Combating Drought in the Sahel/Comit\u00e9 Inter-\u00e9tat Contre la S\u00e9cheresse (CILSS) and the Associationfor the Development of Education in Africa. Agricultural development worldwide has caused, as one of its downsides, the replacement of native plant species bymarketable crops and a parallel reduc- tion in the diversity of the seed stock. The disappearance of plants with po-tential medicinal uses, particularly in areas of high biodiversity like tropical rain forests, has been headlined in re-cent years; but crowding out of the natural diversity of edible species by standard, and sometimes genetically al-tered, cash crops\u2014and the replacement of \"landraces\" (indigenous plant types) by commercial farming\u2014constitute anequally serious problem. Efforts are now being made to consti- tute reserves and pools of threatenedvarieties of food crops. Indigenous knowledge of edible plants is one key \"pool\" of biodiversity in Africa\u2014andone in which women play a vital role. Bean farming in Kenya Bean farming among the Kikuyu in Kenya provides a case in point. Avail- able evidence indicates that in precolonial times a large variety of dif-ferent bean species was cultivated in the Kenyan uplands. Beans moreover constituted a critical element of thediet of rural people, furnishing a rich source of protein to complement maize consumption and other available food-stuffs. In particular, the varieties of in- digenous black beans termed \"njahe\" in Kikuyu (largely Lablab niger and Dolichos lablab by their scientific names, and \"lablab beans\" in English), which were cultivated by women, con-stituted a good proportion of the har- vest. Njahe had, moreover, special meaning for women, as the bean wasconsidered to increase fertility and to have curative virtues for post-partum mothers. It was at the same time aquasi-sacred food. It grew on the Ol Donyo Sabuk mountain, the second most important dwelling place of theCreator in Kikuyu religion, and it was widely used in divination ceremonies. Beans in Kenya are predominantly a small landholder crop, largely farmed by women to feed their families. Tradi- tionally, women tended to grow mul-tiple varieties on the same field\u2014and to conserve multiple seed stocks\u2014as a hedge against disease and unpredict-able climate. Local dishes, like \"githeri\" and \"irio,\" also were based on multiple types of beans. These patterns began to change in colonial times. The British administra- tion was principally interested in in-147 creasing maize production, which provided the least expen- sive supply of food to feed railroad construction workers, and in introducing other cash crops like cotton and sisal toensure tax payments. The strategy developed for advancing this agenda included providing financial incentives and fa- vorable pricing for maize cultivation, on the one hand; and,on the other, introducing new varieties of white and red beans with export potential (to Europe in particular) in or- der to replace the njahe and other \"native\" species. Though a considerable variety of bean species was experimented with over the years by the colonial agricultural extension service, few proved adapted to Kenyan conditions or accept-able in local diets. Those that did\u2014Canadian kidney, rose coco and Phaseolus vulgaris , in particular\u2014gradually took over the market and began pushing njahe out of production.The colonial agricultural extension service also carried out purification campaigns to eliminate multicropping of mixed beans and to ensure a practice of \"one variety per loca-tion\"\u2014generally an exportable variety. Pure or sorted beans were priced at two or three times above mixed crops. The costs of monocropping The phenomenon had real consequences for nutrition, for agricultural biodiversity in the Kenyan highlands, for soil fertility, and for women farmers themselves. Replacementof beans by maize in local diets began a downward spiral in the food intake of the rural population which, while scarcely attributable only to this factor, has continued unabated. Atthe same time, elimination of many of the multiple varieties of beans cultivated in precolonial times had, for parallel ef- fect, impoverishment of the agricultural genetic stock, de-veloped over thousands of years of human agriculture in East Africa. Intensive \"maize mining\" and neglect of the ni- trogen-fixing properties of legumes like njahe resulted inthe progressive impoverishment of soils. Bean monocropping led in turn to higher susceptibility of these crop stands to disease. Finally, since bean cultivation consti-tuted an important element in the economic activity of women and their capacity to nourish their families, the pressure to produce income and abandon beans inevitablycontributed to the increasing out-migration of women to urban areas. Colonial policies were in effect extended into the period of Kenyan independence, by default if not by design. Contin- ued preoccupation with cash crop and export production, monopoly of these activities by men, and economic pres-sures from taxes and the need to pay school fees all kept at- tention away from women's roles in bean production andthe conservation of seed diversity. Not until the 1970s did the prejudice against traditional bean species begin to relax, as Kenyan agricultural policy underwent gradual re-Africanization. Examples across Africa The situation described in Kenya is scarcely an isolated phe- nomenon. Across Africa, similar stories could be evoked\u2014 stories of the gradual impoverishment of seed stocks under the pressure of cash cropping and of the parallel negligenceof women's roles in agriculture and their key function as guardians of biodiversity. In fact, Africa is one of the world's regions with the lowest quotient of original to imported seedstock\u2014a characteristic typical elsewhere of zones of settler implantation, like North America and Australia. Seed stocks and germ plasm constitute a kind of botanical reposi-tory of indigenous knowledge. Because of their responsibil- ity for family subsistence, women have for millenia been central to the breeding of food crop species, the preservationof seeds and the domestication and use of wild edible plants. Concerns with susceptibility to disease and insurance against crop failure under climatic stress andunpredictability have led them to diversify these stocks and cultivation patterns. \u007f In Burkina Faso and throughout the West African Sahel, for example, rural women carefully collect the fruit, leaves and roots of native plants like the baobab tree ( for use in the diet of their families, supplementing the agricultural grains (millet, sorghum)that provide only one part of the nutritional spectrum and may fail in any given year. More than 800 species of edible wild plants have been catalogued across the Sahel. \u007f In southern Sudan, women are directly responsible for the selection of all sorghum seeds saved for planting each year. They cull seeds and preserve a spread of varieties thatwill ensure resistance to the variety of conditions that may arise in any given growing season. The role of women farmers worldwide Equivalent stories can be recounted about gender and agri- cultural biodiversity in other regions of the world as well. In agricultural societies around the globe, women have tendedto be the custodians of biodiversity.148IK Notes Number \u007f Researchers from the Wageningen Agricultural Univer- sity of the Netherlands have found that women in the Kalasin region of northern Thailand play a critical role inmanaging the interface between wild and domesticated spe- cies of edible plants. They have both brought new species of wild plants under cultivation in recent years and spurredtheir communities to carefully regulate collection rights in the face of increasing commercialization. \u007f Women in the Dalwangan and Mammbong communi- ties, Bukidnon province, Mindanao (the Philippines) have played an active role in constituing a \"memory bank\" of in- digenous germplasm with agricultural researchers, becausethey share the concern for diversity. \"I cultivate different kinds [of sweet potatoes], as many as I can get cuttings of,\" one farmer commented, \" because each has its use and noneis proof to all disasters.\" \u007f In northern India, an elderly woman farmer puts the matter succinctly as she selects seeds for storage: \"It takes asharp eye, a sensitive hand and a lot of patience to tell the difference between these seeds. But these are not the things that are honored any more.\" \u007f In the United States, genetic modification of tomatoes by agro industry has led to species that have a long \"shelf life\"\u2014i.e., ability to ripen in transit or in grocery stores af-ter being harvested green\u2014and even a square form that fa- cilitates packing in crates. These characteristics make to- mato-farming a more profitable activity and one easier tocarry out on a large scale, but have had for parallel conse- quence poorer taste and loss of genetic diversity. A minor market has sprung up in \"heirloom tomatoes\"\u2014species pre-served in many cases by women gardeners and now con- served and reproduced for the organic customer.Turning the tide Is there still time in countries such as Kenya ? Yes, but not to waste. The diminishing diversity of seed stocks puts foodsecurity at risk, because of the greater vulnerability of a narrow band of species to climate change and other environ- mental events. And it seems unlikely that the situation canbe turned around without paying much closer attention to the means by which traditional farmers have nurtured seed stocks and indigenous species, and the key role that womenhave played in this enterprise. The njahe bean itself has nonetheless recouped a part of the terrain lost over the last century. With the abandon-ment of export ambitions for white beans, African tastes for red and black varieties have begun to reassert themselves. But dried beans\u2014and the female labor that traditionallyensured their volume and diversity\u2014remain subsidiary in the Kenyan economy. Increased sensitivity to issues of biodiversity\u2014triggered by the rain forest and the example of disappearing species with medical significance\u2014has sown new seeds of hope in this realm, however, both for Africa and for other develop-ing regions. The International Center for Tropical Agricul- ture (CIAT) in Cali, Colombia is coordinating a multiyear participatory research program on gender roles in agricul-ture and participatory plant breeding (Participatory Re- search and Gender Analysis: \"PRGA\" , on the web at http:// www.prgaprogram.org). One branch office has been estab-lished in Uganda for the African Highlands Initiative, an explotation of participatory gender research in East Africa. At the same time, the West African Rice Development Asso-ciation (WARDA), headquartered in Bouak\u00e9, Ivory Coast, has given increasing attention to the preservation of biodiversity among rice farmers of the Sahel and has spon-sored research into related practices in southwestern Mali. (See http://www.cgiar.org/warda/)23149IK Notes 24 September 2000Strengthening Traditional Technical Knowledge:The Sugar Cane Wine Example This article has been excerpted from the original in French by LUZIETOSO savoir-faire locaux pour le D\u00e9veloppement en Afrique. African countries are endowed with considerable potential for processing a large variety of plants (fruits, leaves,roots, tubers, stems, flowers), to make food and drinks (fruit juices, wines, etc.). In the context of globalization, lo-cal products already in high demand in their region of origin could also be suc- cessfully marketed nationally and in-ternationally. Although a few of these traditional products are found in some local markets, most of them remainlittle known. Sugar cane wine is one of them. In Angola, Congo, and the Demo- cratic Republic of Congo (DRC), sugar cane has three main uses. First, it is consumed as a \" canne de bouche \" (lit- erally, cane for the mouth), to quench one's thirst, and/or to assuage one's hunger. Consumers peel the cane witha knife, chew on the tender part, suck on it, swallow the juice and get rid of the bagasse (the fibrous portion of thesugar cane remaining after the juice has been extracted). Second, it is used as a raw material to produce sugar.Third, it is used in the preparation of sugar cane wine, called \" lungwila .\" This article examines the knowledge process used to make sugar cane wine, a traditional product in the three coun- tries mentioned. There are several rea-sons for this choice: (i) the wine-mak- ing traditional process is an ancestral practice, transmitted from one genera-tion to the next; (ii) sugar cane wine consumption is growing substantially in rural as well as urban areas. Indeed,the product is known and well-appreci- ated in the capital cities of the three countries mentioned, with approxi-mately 9 millions inhabitants (2 million in Luanda, 600,000 in Brazzaville, and 6 million in Kinshasa), as well as inother less populated cities and towns; and (iii) the market for sugar cane wine is therefore potentially important, andsugar cane (traditional) processing con- tributes to job creation and constitutes a source of income for small food pro-cessing enterprises, established mainly in the rural areas and suburban zones. The knowledge used is specific to thelocal populations of Northern Angola, Southern Congo and the Western Democratic Republic of Congo, allow-ing entrepreneurs from these regions to enjoy a comparative advantage. In addition, the growing demand for sugarcane wine has a stimulus effect on sugar cane production, and is increas- ing the need for the equipment andpackaging.150IK Notes Number Building on traditional knowledge Sugar cane technology The expansion of the sugar cane wine market has helped toimprove production plant and work organization. In Kimbongo, an area of intense activity, wine processors have formed associations in order to reduce the difficulty of thework. They use bagasse as a fermentation substrate. To re- place the one-lever press, they invented a manual two-lever press, and then a mechanical press. In 1997, Mexican tech-nology was imported and introduced in the various regions where the wine is produced. It was adopted because it short- ens the transformation process, reduces the difficulties inthe work process, and improves the rate of juice extraction. However, its use remains limited because of its high cost, and local artisans are developing a local version. Knowledge transmission The sugar cane winemaking process comes from the ancientkingdom of Congo. Descendants of various communities who use to live there are now found in some regions of Angola, Congo, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. This knowledge is held by men only\u2014usually elders\u2014 and raw material is usually self-supplied. Women are active in the final stage, i.e., in the marketing of the finished product.Historically, the knowledge is transmitted within clans and families, from one generation to the next. With urbaniza- tion and the introduction of sugar cane wine in some mar-kets, other forms of transmission have emerged, particu- larly within producer groups and associations as well as in peri-urban environments. Small business owners transmit it to their employees, who, usually, are their relatives. Within wine-making asso- ciations, the learning system that prevails is relatively differ-ent, with two coexisting modes of apprenticeship: elder to younger transmission, and knowledge sharing. The first method of apprenticeship (elder to younger) is the one found in family-owned businesses, where the main ben- eficiaries are the younger, or those untrained persons who wish to start their own business. The second method is based on knowledge sharing. It is a system where members of associations exchange their know-how. A member who masters a specific operation (fer-mentation for example) will share it with his peers, and will receive in exchange some other knowledge. These ex- changes contribute to improving the skills of the producersgroup as a whole. Unlike other formal learning systems, beneficiaries from traditional training do not have to pay to acquire it. This is asolidarity system inherited from ancient traditions. For en- trepreneurs, this system has numerous advantages:It reduces starting costs. Indeed, the entrepreneur who wishes to produce sugar cane wine can easily acquire the re- lated knowledge. In Kimbongo for example, hundreds ofprocessors start their businesses without having to go through the usual administrative steps, and without infor- mation and training costs. In addition, every entrepreneur who becomes part of a producers association in urban as well as rural areas, can improve his knowledge through the custom of experience-sharing between members. This can be considered as a form of continuing vocational training developed by local commu- nities as well as collective innovation management withoutthe support of the usual formal appropriate institutions. Prospects Indigenous technical knowledge is often under-estimated by development researchers, decision-makers, and practitio- ners. This situation has had a negative impact on the designand implementation of policies. The example of sugar wine making in the DRC highlights some important lessons regarding indigenous technicalknowledge and its importance for African economic develop- ment. Some issues need to be highlighted. The production process is characterized by low productivity, disrupted activ-ity, shortages in raw materials and supplies (due to the sea- sonal harvesting of sugar cane), storage problems for large quantities of wine, etc. This situation creates regular wineshortages on the supply side. In addition, traditional technical knowledge does not per- mit the exploitation of by-products (bagasse, peelings).Moreover, not to recycle these waste products aggravates pollution in the workshop surroundings. Finally, the tradi- tional production process lacks the packaging and bottlingtechniques adapted needed for remote markets. Regarding these constraints, it is crucial that develop- ment agents (entrepreneurs, researchers, NGOs, public au-thorities, etc.) try to both understand traditional technical knowledge and strengthen it. In this instance, the focus needs to be on developing appropriate packaging, recyclingwaste, and improving production plant facilities, etc. Strengthening indigenous technical knowledge Development practitioners seem to be paying more atten- tion to the objectives and functions of scientific indigenous knowledge. This does not mean that external assistance is not useful or needed - it means that these practitionersshould built on their indigenous knowledge and skills. The combination of traditional and exogenous techniques (non- traditional but also traditional, emanating from other com-24151 munities), may contribute to improving the production pro- cess. This approach is quite different from the one that pro- claims that development agents know \"everything\" andconstitute the best transfer mechanism for science and technology from research and development institutes to lo- cal communities. The producers and users of local knowl-edge are often the real \"experts\". Scientists and technolo- gists, when involved in development, should listen to them and make the most of their knowledge and experience, andfind ways to complement each other's knowledge. In spite of the technical difficulties that they encounter and their relative exclusion from the national productionsystem, users of traditional knowledge are technically ca- pable of responding to changes in production conditions and finding innovative solutions to their problems. It has oftenbeen noticed that the more critical their situation, the more inventive they become. Indeed, local communities often re- sort to a wide range of traditional knowledge to adapt theirproduction techniques in order to ensure a good quality for their final product. Research and development organizations have a critical role to play in the acknowledgment of indigenous technical knowledge, and the promotion of development programs aiming at their valorization. Indigenous technical knowl-edge may be revitalized by decentralized forms of govern- ment emphasizing a policy of local development. In addi- tion, the current trend in favor of so-called \"ethnic prod-ucts\" opens a new way to the development (through export) of products born from traditional activities.Promoting indigenous technical knowledge The current globalization of exchanges requires a reorganiza- tion of African economies. This requirement is becomingmore and more necessary and raises problems that the cen- tralized approaches (of the Keynesian type) are unable to help solve. Decentralization at the regional and local levelsallows the application of economic solutions to problems that are better apprehended by a decentralized entity, closer to those who are supposed to devise these solutions, applythem and benefit from them. The creation of businesses re- lying on indigenous technical knowledge also means jobs creation at a local level. This approach would trigger a newdynamism of economic activity based on local human, physi- cal, and financial resources. Such local initiatives may result in the emergence of a local industrial structure comprisingof small businesses. This would of course need an enabling environment and appropriate assistance. Development agents can promote these activities through focusing on innovation processes in collaboration with pro- ducers organizations. These organizations can also form partnerships within the framework of decentralized coop-eration structures. Government awareness of the social and economic impact of these activities is essential, in order to design and implement an incentive-based policy to promotethe commercial development of local products.152IK Notes 25 October 2000Mali Indigenous Knowledge: Blending the New and the Old How is indigenous knowledge brought out of the traditional closet, into syn- ergy with new technologies and into ap-plication on new development tasks? What are the \"pedagogies\" by which it is elicited, relearned and reworked? Anexperience more than two decades old from the Republic of Mali suggests some valuable lessons. Hidden structure, hidden knowledge In Mali, as in many Sub-Saharan Afri- can countries, there has been a strong bifurcation between the customs andknowledge of traditional rural cultures on the one hand and the systems and technologies of official urban society onthe other. In the late 1970s, a team of Malian researchers assisted by the author con-ducted a thoroughgoing evaluation of functional adult literacy in the Western and peanut-growing regions of thecountry. The region was then under the agricultural guidance of a parastatal corporation, the Op\u00e9ration Arachides et Cultures Vivri\u00e8res (Peanut and Food Crops Operation or \"OACV\"), which was charged with developing produc-tion and upgrading farm technology. Infact, the literacy program itself was ad- ministered under OACV tutelage and concentrated\u2014at least in theory\u2014onthe skills that rural residents needed to improve production and take increased responsibility for credit and market op-erations. In fact, however, OACV had, up to that point, done little to transfer authority and resources for local opera-tions to communities that demon- strated literate competence. The results of the first year of evalua- tion demonstrated that, if the literacy program had attained its full quantita- tive objectives in only a few localities,the vast majority of participating com- munities had nonetheless managed to produce a \"nucleus\" of literatepeople\u2014generally from 5 to 8 young adults. These villagers were then charged by the others with principallyshadowing the marketing teams sent out to buy commercial crops by OACV, in order to protect against fraud, andmonitoring tax bills and remissions. As the evaluation team remarked after closer inspection, the result seemed theconsequence of a very accurate assess- ment by local people of the nature and magnitude of literacy's uses in the ru-ral environment. Market and tax moni- toring were important, but not fre- quent enough from an individual pointThis article was written by Peter Easton (Florida State University) and Guy Belloncle (Universityof Tours). For more information, e-mail Peter Easton at: easton@coe.fsu.edu153 of view to justify each person or family mastering the new skills. Once \"collectivized\" and assigned to a small team of village residents, however, they made for critical and profit-able work. On the strength of its assessment, the evaluation team succeeded in convincing OACV officials to approve thetransfer of marketing functions\u2014and of a portion of the profit margin on commercial crop sales\u2014to villages having a suffi- cient number of new literates to handle the tasks. And theteam was then responsible, during its own trip around rural areas at the outset of the following year's literacy campaign, for explaining the policy change and the modalities of its ap-plication to village leaders. An interesting thing then transpired. During colonial times, villages throughout the Malian countryside hadadopted the habit of naming a fictitious chief and set of counselors to meet with the French administration when- ever it came visiting. Contacts with the colonial administra-tion were considered, for the most part, beneath the dignity of the true traditional authorities and seldom relevant to the village's lasting interests. The same pattern persisted inmany areas after \"flag\" independence in 1960, because rep- resentatives of the modern Malian state were felt to be no less foreign to traditional culture and scarcely more sup-portive of its conservation and well-being. In more than one village, therefore, the evaluation team began presenting the new policy and its implications to a first set of local notables.As soon as the village counterparts realized that a serious transfer of power and resources was under discussion, how- ever, they asked to be excused and then, as if on a revolvingstage, a second set of negotiators took their place: the real traditional authorities. Priming a social process How are traditional culture and its store of knowledge genu- inely \"engaged\" in development projects? A perception of true interest, like the one that intervened in those discus-sions of the transfer of marketing functions, is obviously a key ingredient. But indigenous science may be trickier to flush out of cover and express than the simple perception ofself-interest. As an Ewe proverb puts the matter, \"The bird of knowledge - one person alone can never catch it.\" Knowl- edge that is social in nature and culturally transmitted typi-cally comes forth in social situations, where groups of people form to resolve what they perceive to be important prob- lems or to communicate wisdom across generations.Methods for priming this process were developed in Mali by the same group of researchers in connection with an effort undertaken to create other uses for literacy. With WorldBank support, the Ministry of Education sponsored in the months to follow a study of new directions for nonformal basic education, premised on the notion that newly acquiredliteracy should be considered a starting point for new train- ing relevant to rural development as much as a goal achieved. The research team devised three training se-quences for newly literate young adults - one on agricul- tural fertility, one on accounting systems for village enter- prise, and one on the diagnosis and prevention of prevalentinfectious diseases. Methods for eliciting local knowledge This was training with a difference, however. The research- ers wished to blend outside technical knowledge in each do- main with the insights of local culture and tradition \u2014 and to do so by involving those most aware of the latter: the el-ders in each community. They therefore worked out a proce- dure with several distinct steps: First, the researchers met with village authorities to ask their permission to discuss with the elders current local problems and possible solutions in the area under consider- ation (declining soil fertility, rampant river blindness, or dif-ficulties in starting local enterprise). Since communities were chosen in localities where one or another of these prob- lems was already particularly acute, agreement was rapidlyreached in most cases. During the session subsequently held with the village el- ders, the research team took care to dwell on (a) the natureand importance of the problem, as perceived by the commu- nity itself; (b) the availability of new technical methods that \u2014if adapted and appropriately applied\u2014might offer hope ofeffective solutions; and (c) the presence of young people newly literate in Bambara who potentially had the tools and inquisitiveness to learn new approaches and share themwith others. The researchers then proposed the idea of holding in the village a training workshop to analyze the problem and testnew solutions. They promised, in this case, to bring study materials, information on the new technologies and some material for trying them out. And they requested that theelders sponsor the initiative and delegate the young people to attend and report back to them on the applicability of the new methods. Three villages ended up accepting the chal-lenge and sponsoring the training, one on each of the topics.154IK Notes Number Ingredients in the recipe The key challenge was then organizing the experience so that it was not just an opportunity for the dissemination oftechnical material and advanced training of the young people involved, but an occasion and stimulus for the ex- pression of related local knowledge. To ensure this outcome,the training sessions, which lasted two weeks each, had five closely-related elements: \u007fTechnical content. Researchers served as trainers but made sure that at least one highly skilled technical resource person was associated with each of the sessions. The team developed the initial curriculum, based on the Bambaratranslation of available dissemination materials. \u007fHands-on developmental work. Each training included \"laboratory\" work with some tools and new technologies ofrelevance to the problem. Researchers responsible for the infectious disease program, for example, came armed with simple microscopes with which trainees could examinesamples . \u007fField inquiry or local needs assessment. Each training also entailed survey of the extent and nature of the problemin the locality by the trainees themselves. \u007fComparison with indigenous knowledge. Researchers explicitly and systematically created occasions for express-ing local knowledge about the problems under study and comparing these insights with the dissemination material. \u007fExperimental trial and analysis. Each training was de- signed to identify issues regarding the actual trial of new methods and based on the observation of their results. The critical interaction with indigenous knowledge was handled in two ways. First, during the phase of field inquiry into current practices and needs, the trainees were carefulto survey not just the problems people were encountering but also their understandings of root causes and their meth- ods for addressing the issue. Still more importantly, the evening of each day was devoted to a feedback and discus- sion session with village elders. At this time, the young trainees reported on events that had transpired and lessonslearned during the day and sought reactions and sugges- tions from their elders about what these results meant and where to go next. This collective reflection proved to be theideal venue for bringing out elements of traditional knowl- edge, comparing it to the \"scientific\" notions introduced in the training and bringing both to bear on the resolution ofproblems.Local knowledge of water-borne diseases Though all three training episodes followed this general model, actual details of the sessions differed from one loca-tion to another as a function both of differences in the prob- lem situations and differences in the social context. Each ex- perience, though, shed new light on the methodology itself. Training on infectious diseases was conducted in the vil- lage of Fasa, close to the Baloue River basin, a fertile farm- ing area largely abandoned over the preceding years due tothe high incidence of river blindness (onchocerciasis) and schistosomiasis. People in various stages of river blindness were quite evident in the village itself; and the communitychose to focus on these two water-borne infections. A full census of those affected throughout the community was car- ried out by the trainees, who discovered that almost 25 per-cent of the population carried the onchocerciasis tumor and more than a third of those were already in at least the incipi- ent stages of sight loss. The local knowledge of the hosts regarding the parasites and the stages in their life cycle turned out to be consider- able. The technical assistant to this training\u2014a doctor fromthe University of Marseille\u2014was astounded to find that the village elders knew things about the life cycle of the schisto- some parasite that he believed only to have been discoveredin French laboratories two years previously. Understanding soil fertility The training session focusing on soil fertility was held in the village of Suransan Tumoto, north of the town of Kita in the peanut-growing regions of western Mali. The soils here had been depleted by successive commercial crops and the yieldshad begun to plummet. After an initial study of soil chemis- try, the trainees set about their work by interviewing elders regarding the types of soil found in the village environmentand the plants that had traditionally grown on each. They then carefully surveyed the topography and condition of this flora around the village with the help of an agriculturaltechnician from the national research institute and brought back results for discussion with the entire community. A comparison of agricultural extension themes on soil fer- tility with local knowledge of soil conditions and associated plant led to the decision to create an experimental farm sta- tion to test different methods for improving agriculturalyields. Unfortunately, this initiative was thereafter stopped by a conservative reaction from OACV, which judged it inad- missible to try out with local farmers types of experimenta-tion its own extension agents had not mastered.25155 Indigenous accounting systems The training workshop on accounting and village enter- prises was held in the cotton-growing region of the country,where crop marketing by newly literate personnel from lo- cal communities had opened the way to a certain amount of economic diversification. The movement, though, had en-countered a serious obstacle: lack of Bambara language ac- counting systems that would allow local staff to assume full control of crop markets and to create other enterprises withthe proceeds of this activity. Here, after studying accounting methods, trainees inter- viewed elders concerning traditional means for ensuring ac-countability and carried out a workshop to inventory and create an appropriate Bambara-language terminology for the various steps in the process. The workshop concludedwith the production and testing of an entire series of Bambara-language accounting forms and with a presenta- tion to the assembled community of a locally-conducted au-dit of its financial operations. A pedagogy for expressing indigenous knowledge The common denominator in all the sessions was the sys- tematic attempt to take account of local knowledge and to bring it to bear on the design of new solutions to the devel- opment problems in question. This was accomplished by ajudicious and creative application of long-standing adult education principles: \u007f Focus on felt needs \u007f Start with what people already know \u007f Associate them as teachers in the learning enterprise \u007f Create a context for collective reflection and recall of rel- evant experiential data \u007f Vary modes of instruction \u007f Follow through to application or resolution of problems.But the key factors in mobilizing indigenous knowledge in these experiments\u2014or turning the \"revolving stage\" pic- tured in the opening anecdote\u2014were the middle ones in thelist above. They involved ways of affiliating the \"reposito- ries\" of that knowledge in commissioning training, then in taking part themselves in the search for solutions, all withina social scenario that lent itself to group reflection. The ap- proach borrowed something from two sources\u2014from the traditional African social structure, which assigns delibera-tive roles to the elders, management tasks to the household- ers and technical ones to the young people in a manner meant to be synergistic and complementary; and from par-ticipatory action research, which entails organizing learn- ing around the tasks required to solve a problem. Under these circumstances, the comparison and interac- tion with \"modern science\" became a stimulus rather than an inhibition to the expression of indigenous knowledge. Much of traditional knowledge\u2014as of any scientific sys-tem\u2014is fundamentally taxonomic : accumulated observa- tion and organization of the different types of naturally oc- curring phenomena and their inter-correlations. The reser-voir is rich, but the lack of means to record and compare in- dividual variations or test and analyze planned interven- tions have left the agenda (sympathetic mastery of naturalforces) incomplete. The kind of training organized in Mali and described here creates an opportunity not only to ex- press indigenous knowledge and bring it to bear on develop-ment problems, but also to fulfill its own potential for im- proving the human condition through comparison and col- laboration with a tradition that is more systematicallybased on the analysis of natural and planned variation.156IK Notes 26 November 2000Traditional Medicine and AIDS This article is reproduced in its entirety, with permission, from Lancet, 8th April 2000, Volume 355, page 1284.

A regional task force on traditional medicine and AIDS in east and south- ern Africa will be (sic) inaugurated in Kampala, Uganda, on April 10, 2000. The task force will coordinate activity related to the widespread use of tradi-tional medicine by people with HIV/ AIDS in Africa and the role of tradi- tional healers in AIDS prevention. Thenine-member task force of east and southern African non-governmental or- ganizations (NGOs), international or-ganizations, and west African observer delegations, will share information, generate an inventory of activitiesabout traditional medicine, document and distribute best practices, promote research in traditional medicine, andmobilize resources. The task force will recognize the fact that in Africa, the high cost and scarcity of many essentialdrugs, including antiretroviral drugs, means that most people with HIV/ AIDS use traditional herbal treatmentsfor HIV-related conditions including opportunistic infections. In Uganda, there is one traditional health practitio-ners for every 200-400 people, whereas the availability of trained medical per- sonnel is typically one per 20,000people. The plan to establish the task force arose from a UNAIDS-sponsored con-ference in Kampala, in February, 2000. 100 delegates from 17 African coun- tries met to review the effect of tradi-tional healers on HIV prevention and care. The meeting was hosted by Tradi- tional and Modern Health Practitio-ners Together Against AIDS (THETA), a Ugandan NGO that promotes col- laboration between traditional andmodern health practitioners in the fight against AIDS. Support was pro- vided by UNAIDS and the Associationfor the Promotion of Traditional Medi- cine (PROMETRA), an international NGO based in Senegal. THETA hastaken the lead in east Africa in develop- ing partnerships between biomedical and traditional health sectors. Many of the conference delegates ar- gued at the Kampala meeting that, in view of its widespread use, traditionalmedicine is in a real sense carrying the burden of clinical care for the AIDS epi- demic in Africa, a trend largely over-looked by health ministries, interna- tional agencies, and donors. Delegates focused on collaboration between thetraditional and modern health sectors. They identified projects that meet cri- teria for \"best practice\" responses tothe AIDS epidemic in Africa. Most countries in the region reported some initiatives involving traditional medi-157 cine and practitioners. Dr Sandra Anderson of UNAIDS, South Africa, noted that \"traditional health practitioners occupy a critical role in African societies and are making avaluable contribution to AIDS prevention and care\". THETA director, Dr Donna Kabatesi, cited clinical data on Ugandan herbal treatments effective against herpes zosterand HIV-associated chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Pro- fessor Charles Wambebe, head of Nigeria's National Insti- tute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development, re-ported preliminary clinical data on a Nigerian herbal medi- cine that seems to increase CD4-cell counts and lead to im- provements in HIV-related illness; controlled clinical trialsare now underway. Dr Mberesero Firmina of the Tanga AIDS Working Group presented findings on Tanzanian herbal treatments for HIV-related fungal infections. Although traditional health systems are locally accessible and culturally relevant, they must first be rendered safe. Most importantly, poor documentation, a lack of standard-ization, and the absence of regulatory mechanisms for tradi- tional health-care practice in many countries were seen as challenges to be overcome if traditional medicine is to bemore systematically included as a key player in AIDS pre- vention and care. Mutual misunderstanding between mod- ern and traditional practitioners, weak organization of heal-ers, and sensationalist media reporting all contribute to the marginal status of traditional medicine in African countries. Despite many governments and international agencies call-ing for \"recognition\" of traditional medicine, the lack of se- rious commitment and action on this issue was seen as a key impediment to identifying effective indigenous approachesto AIDS prevention and care and to building strong partner- ships for an integrated strategy against HIV/AIDS. As a re- sult, scores of medicinal plants that are used daily in Africaand may have potential effectiveness against opportunistic infections or HIV remain unknown or uninvestigated, while most Africans with HIV/AIDS cannot afford modern drugswith proven effectiveness.Noting the need for a regional network of organizations currently working in isolation with traditional medicine and HIV/AIDS, the meeting proposed the establishment of thetask force, for which THETA will serve as the Secretariat. Task-force members include the Traditional Health Practi- tioners Association of Zambia, and the Zimbabwean Na-tional Traditional Healers Association. There will be ob- server groups from the west African nations of Ghana, Ni- geria, and Cameroon. International partners are UNAIDS,WHO/AFRO, and the Global Initiative For Traditional Sys- tems (GIFTS) of Health and its partner organization the Commonwealth Working Group on Traditional andComplementary Health Systems. GIFTS has accepted re- sponsibility to lay the groundwork for a network of re- searchers and institutions to build a research program thatwill identify, assess, and develop safe and effective local treatments for HIV-related illnesses. The program will use simplified but controlled clinical protocols to conduct rapidinvestigations of promising treatments. It will build data- bases for information sharing on the successes and failures of local treatments. The program will be based on an intel-lectual property rights framework to protect the rights of local knowledge holders, learning lessons from a few exist- ing programs in Africa. Recognizing the global, unsustain-able pressure on wild stocks of medicinal plants, sustainable horticulture will be promoted for priority species. A solid government research infrastructure, backed by interna-tional agencies, will need to be developed to ensure a rapid research response to positive preliminary findings. This strategy will be designed to guide promising herbal treat-ments through to the stages of development of safe, effec- tive, and affordable medicines. It will emphasize, where ap- plicable, the local production and dissemination of usefulherbs at the national, community, and family level, towards an African solution for combating AIDS in Africa.158IK Notes 27 December 2000Uganda Information Technology and Rural Development: The Nakaseke Multi-Purpose Telecenter This report was written by Siddhartha Prakash of the World Bank, and is based on a field visitto the Nakaseke Multi-Purpose Tele-Center in May 2000. It is often said that modern technology tends to bypass local communities found in remote regions. However,some recent technological advance- ments in communications have begun to blur geographical distances and in-fra-structural bottlenecks. Located 50 kilometers north of Kampala, Uganda in a remote village, the NakasekeMulti-Purpose Community Tele-center has introduced new information and communication technologies to this ru-ral area. In three years, the telecenter has catalyzed a number of development activities in the region. Nakaseke sub-county has a popula- tion of over 38,953 of which 18,617 are women. Nakaseke town itself has apopulation of 3,000 people, most of whom are the Baganda\u2014the biggest tribe in central Uganda. The commu-nity is largely oral and does not have a established reading culture. Till the telecenter started in 1997, newspaperswere only available in the next town 16 kilometers away and connected by a rough road. The Nakaseke Telecenter is part of a chain of five donor (UNESCO/IDRC/ ITU) supported telecenter projects ini-tiated in Benin, Mali, Mozambique and Tanzania. The overall objective of the project is to stimulate rural develop-ment by facilitating access to informa-tion, learning resources and communi- cation technologies by the Nakaseke and Kasangombe communities andsupport improved medical services through telemedicine. Current activities include computer applications training, and Internet, e- mail, telephone, fax, library, and photo- copying services, an Open LearningCenter (for outreach), topical video shows and audio recordings and com- munity listening and newspapers, aswell as leisure and sports activities for young people. While the telecenter aims at serving the entire communities of Nakaseke and Kasangombe, it focuses on the fol- lowing core user groups: women,youth, children, medical, workers, teaching staff, farmers and local lead- ers. The content and programming forthe telecenter is therefore tailored to- wards meeting primarily the needs and aspirations of these groups. Implementation strategy The participation and involvement of the community is central to the imple-mentation of the telecenter's activities. Since it was started, the community has been at the center of the planningand execution of the all activities. A local steering committee was elected from159 and by the community representing each of the core target groups to: \u007f Supervise the telecenter's daily activities\u007f Liaise with the management committee \u007f Mobilize the community to participate in all activities and programs \u007f Steer community ownership programs and involve the community in any activities that promote the sustainability of the telecenter, including organizingfundraising activities. Impact The community has access to a modern library/resource center, telephone connectivity and an information commu- nications technology (ICT) core unit for all ICT-related ac- tivities/services. The multi-purpose telecenter has transformed the lives of the local community. It has provided internet, telephone and fax services that are being utilized to conduct local busi-ness activities. Computer training has provided jobs for the youth, who now have access to a fully-fledged library with major international journals and books. Farmers have be-gun to engage in on-line trading and use the telecenter to capture and disseminate information about local farming techniques and crop prices. The telecenter has begun toimplement an Indigenous Knowledge Program in collabora- tion with local farmers, which could be utilized as an affec- tive focal point to conduct community to community ex-changes. Farmers are now requesting for market rates and general trends regarding the crops they grow. The school community (7,000 school children) as well as community workers and medical officers have benefited from the resource center. The community (42 villages and 3,000 households) is gradually appreciating the importanceof information as evidenced by the growing number of people inquiring about information on a variety of issues. The daily newspapers available at the telecenter have alsohelped to keep the community up to date with what is going on in the rest of the country. Agricultural project utilizes indigenous knowledge While Uganda's population is expected to double over the next 30 years however, a necessary and corresponding in- crease in agricultural growth is a cause for concern. Thepresent low agricultural growth has been attributed, among other things, to poor research-extension-farmer linkages and ineffective technology delivery systems, including poor or in-efficient information and communication packaging and de- livery systems. The agricultural project aims to: \u007f Increase overall agricultural productivity and household incomes in Nakaseke and Kasangombe Sub- counties. \u007f Support agricultural extension workers in providing information and guidance to the farming community. \u007f Directly link research work and farmers' units, thereby enhancing the flow of information from both sides.International, national and local institutions will be linked to the telecenter as the hub for agri-consulting. \u007f Provide a forum for experimentation on the use of ICT to deliver timely agricultural information and dissemina- tion of research results. From the beginning, the project incorporated local com- munity knowledge into its organizational structure and framework. It established a special section in the library togather and disseminate IK-related information, which was used to increase the responsiveness of local farmers to changes in government policy with a view to raising agricul-tural productivity at the regional level. A photographic dis- play shed light on traditional approaches to natural re- source management, savings and informal transfers and lo-cal medicinal approaches and applications. Over the last three years, through a process of trial and error, all actors involved have been trained to demonstrate ahigh degree of adaptability. Several community-based work- shops and study tours were organized to train local farmers to understand and anticipate fast-moving trends so as toadopt the correct response strategies. Field research was conducted to understand and appreci- ate indigenous approaches to farming, which focused on thecomplexity, diversity and risk prone approaches of many farming systems. The study tours effectively showcased the knowledge, professionalism and rationality of small andpoor farmers. A series of formal and informal discussions brought out their experimental mindset behavior and abil- ity to conduct their own analysis. The accessibility, diversity and timely relevance of infor- mation were key elements for enabling all parties to adapt and make a change for the better. Different modes of com-munication such as internet, telephone and fax determined the extent to which the process of dialogue, negotiation and communication, between the different parties involved, wasstrengthened. The telecenter played a key role as a facilita- tor, by connecting Nakaseke to other parts of the country/ world and vice-versa. For the first time, the local commu-nity could engage in an ongoing dialogue with other commu- nities and share their experiences.160IK Notes Number Impact \u007f Extension agents, NGOs and farmers are well-trained in the use of ICT. \u007f Relevant agricultural information are accessed and developed in collaboration with at least three research institutions. Technologies and crops include post har-vest, banana, coffee, horticulture, root crops and cereals. \u007f Training manuals, information brochures, guides leaflets and posters are developed. \u007f At least 65 percent of farmers in Nakaseke and Kasangombe are exposed to this approach and 98 percent of agricultural extension agents and communitydevelopment workers are involved. In addition to agriculture, the Nakaseke Telecenter has developed a series of projects that utilize the knowledge and expertise of local communities particularly in the fields of education, gender and healthcare. This includes an innova-tive Tele-Medicine Program being developed in collabora- tion with the Nakaseke Hospital. Once in operation, the idea is to be able to link local patients with medical practi-tioners in Kampala and other cities and vice-versa. This could prove to be an effective forum to mainstream the use of traditional medicine being practiced widely across Africa.In this way, Tele-centers could serve as a platform for cap- turing and documenting indigenous knowledge and dis- seminating it from one local community to another. Lessons learned Involving the community at an early stage in the planning and implementation of the project helped to mainstreamtelecenter issues into the general activities of the commu- nity. Localizing the ICT applications to a level that is under- standable to all community members helped to sell thetelecenter concept. This was achieved through translating information packages into Luganda \u2014 the dominant local language of the community. Illustration of new conceptsand programs is the key to deep appreciation and under- standing, especially if it concerns an illiterate community. It is vital to recruit local \"sons and daughters of the soil\" tomanage the daily operations. They know the community better than any other expert and communicate in the 'lan- guage' that the people understand.Nakaseke is a successful example of transferring the main- tenance costs from donors to the local communities, thereby moving towards sustainable local ownership. The commu-nity has successfully, out of their own tax collections elected a permanent building for the telecenter and found other sources of funding to support the construction work. It alsolobbied the government for a new telecom tower to facilitate the connection of over 50 new telephone lines in the region. This confirms the extent to which rural communities appre-ciate the value of information in the development process. The challenges ahead In a new nitiative like the telecenter, there is a critical need for documentation. It offers numerous tools that could be ef- fectively used to document the rich diversity of indigenous knowledge in the region. The process has begun by trainingresearchers in ethnographic research methods and develop- ing a methodology for data gathering and recording in a databank. This is being achieved through the use of audio-visuals and by recording views in written documentary. The next step is to develop a framework for information dissemination, sharing and networking. The process has be-gun through forging practical linkages within ICT initia- tives in and out of the country. The telecenter has a plan to share documentation systems and record keeping withother telecenters involved in the pilot within the country. Additional programs are being developed to mainstream the knowledge captured by the Tele-center, including oneon community trade and business practices. The program will empower local traders with the ability and insight to ap- preciate and critically analyze their commercial environ-ment, with a view to cultivate a savings culture and control expenditure. The focus will be on documenting and mainstreaming indigenous entrepreneurial practices andapplications.27161IK Notes 28 January 2001Indigenous Knowledge and Local Power:Negotiating Change in West Africa Alhough the development, articulation and systematization of indigenous knowledge in Africa are most oftenseen as issues of culture and local epis- temology (the study of the nature and grounds of knowledge), they have at thesame time critical power dimensions. The relation between local knowledge bases\u2014and practitioners\u2014on the onehand and central or Westernized ones on the other is manifestly a high-power/ low-power situation, a matter most oftenquite acutely and accurately perceived by local people themselves. Until and unless the \"terms of trade\" betweenthese two spheres are significantly al- tered, or at least cast in a framework that promises some renegotiation, it isentirely understandable that the reposi- tories of indigenous science would choose to keep it \"off the market.\" Telltale patterns of literacy acquisition A story from an evaluation of func- tional literacy in Mali two decades ago illustrates the point and provides a ba-sis for further examining the problem. In the late 1970s an effort was under- taken\u2014with joint Ministry of Educa-tion, Ministry of Rural Development and World Bank funding\u2014to inventory and assess results from several years offunctional literacy classes in the vil- lages of the western portion of the country. The literacy program had beenestablished through the parastatal ag- ricultural operation responsible for the development of cash and food cropfarming in the region, as a means of gaining local farmer confidence and providing people with ways of scruti-nizing commercial transactions. The results were mixed. Two aspects of the \"balance sheet\" of outcomes drawn upby the team responsible for the partici- patory evaluation effort clearly illus- trated the concerns of villagers withpower relations. The first lay in the figures on that balance sheet themselves. In the initialdesign of the Bambara-language lit- eracy program, it was assumed that each community would create a train-ing center, enroll and make literate some twenty adults, then create an- other class and train a second group ofsimilar or larger size. By the end of four years, somewhere between thirty and fifty newly literate participants shouldhave been on the rolls in each commu- nity concerned.This article was written by Peter Easton (Florida State University) and Guy Belloncle (University of Tours, retired). For more information, e-mail Peter Easton at: easton@coe.fsu.edu162IK Notes Number 28 The actual results both fell well short of this objective and turned out, upon closer examination, to be highly significant. Almost nowhere across the entire region did one find a com-munity where more than ten \"new literates\" had been trained. On the other hand, it was equally rare\u2014excepting a few cases of major implementation failure\u2014to find villageswhere no one had learned anything. In case after case, the program seemed to have resulted\u2014after several years of ef- fort, an appropriate amount of rhetoric and a generally weakrecord of material support by government agencies\u2014in the emergence of a nucleus of new literates, generally between four and seven young men. Why this number and so seldomless or more? Interpreting the record The answer seemed to lie in the real uses to which literacy in Bambara could be put under circumstances then apply- ing in western Mali. Though the program was publicized with all the appropriate rhetoric about the importance oflearning and the functional value of the new learning, in point of fact there were few opportunities to apply knowl- edge of written Bambara in the rural environment. Whatformal schools existed were all conducted in French, few if any publications in written African language could be found, and the medium of writing in Bambara was not usedto any practical ends by either the local government or the agricultural operation itself. Moreover, there was an acute lack of credit or investment opportunities that might havemade the creation of locally run enterprises a viable. But to say that there were few outlets for the use of liter- ate and numerate competence did not mean that there werenone. Control of tax transactions with the government and oversight of farm marketing functions were two issues of major interest to local actors, because they saw themselvesas being so regularly exploited in these areas. Viewed from an individual perspective, the monitoring of tax remittances and agricultural marketing was not a frequent enough ac-tivity to justify each adult becoming literate and, perhaps more importantly, \"numerate.\" However, when these func- tions were \"collectivized\" and confided in a handful of (gen-erally young male) villagers, they made for valuable, regular and sometimes remunerated work undertaken in defense of the community as a whole. As a consequence, in village aftervillage, the evaluators found that the training programs had resulted in the creation of a nucleus of four to seven new lit- erates who organized and assumed these functions. The lo-cal people seemed to have accurately assessed the magni- tude of opportunities for use of the new knowledge as wellas the imperative of better collective self-defense and to have thus modulated their response to the programs. Results from the first year's participatory assessment were communicated to officials of the agricultural operation to demonstrate the existence of core groups of literate farmers across the region. This was done in the hope of motivatingthem to offer communities with this sort of nucleus\u2014and the demonstrated capacity to train the number of people that new economic and political opportunity justified\u2014the chance totake over larger portions of agricultural marketing responsi- bility and to receive, in return, a significant slice of the profit margin on the sale of the crop for rebate to individual farmersor collective reinvestment in locally-directed development projects. After some negotiation, agreement was finally reached on this major change of policy and the evaluationteam set out, on the eve of the following agricultural market- ing season, to communicate this news to local authorities along with a summary of the results of the initial round of theparticipatory literacy evaluation. The effort produced the sec- ond major lesson about local knowledge and collective self-de- fense. Distinguishing \"for show\" and \"for go\" First, though, a word of background. During the period of French colonial rule, throughout rural areas of the westernSahel, local communities became accustomed to dealing quite circumspectly with representatives of the central re- gime. Each village named, in effect, its own puppet govern-ment\u2014that is, a set of fictional local authorities who would meet with the French whenever that was required, gather information to be relayed back, if necessary, to the real vil-lage chief and his counselors and generally relieve them of the necessity of dealing directly with colonial agents. This pattern was maintained well into the period of African inde-pendence, because the representatives of the new national regimes were often perceived as no less alien or inimical to local interests than their colonial predecessors. This attitude was clearly if subtly manifested during the first year of evaluation work on more than one occasion. One of the Malian evaluators involved in discussions withlocal authorities noted that the word they themselves used in Bambara for the cooperatives set up by the national gov- ernment to handle farm production and marketing wassomething more than what it seemed to be\u2014a deformation of the French term \"coop\u00e9rative.\" He asked people to repeat what they were saying, listened respectfully and made a fewdiscreet inquiries after the discussion was over. What people were actually saying was \"ko-fara-tinti,\" a Bambara pun on163 the French term that meant, literally, \"skin the back and plunge in a dagger.\" It was, in effect, an eloquent and lapi- dary commentary on how local people then saw the underly-ing objective of State agricultural policy. Given this level of suspicion, it was no surprise that the evaluation team ended up meeting\u2014both in the first yearand during the dissemination efforts at the beginning of the second\u2014with puppet authorities in most communities vis- ited, even if these people were indistinguishable, to an un-practiced eye, from the true local officials. But something of great interest transpired early in the second year when the evaluators came back to relay the news of the government'sdecision about the transfer of marketing responsibility and related resources into local hands. No sooner had these top- ics been broached than their interlocutors asked for a pausein discussions. They quietly disappeared from the scene and, after a short interval, were replaced, as if on a revolving stage, by a new set of counterparts\u2014the true village au-thorities. If there was a chance that real transfer of power and resource was in the offing, then it was time to bring in- digenous culture and authority into the balance. Four decades of experience The lesson is reinforced by experience in other countries of the region\u2014Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Niger and the Cen-tral African Republic\u2014with literacy and agricultural man- agement programs. By far the most success in the rapid ac- quisition of new skills and mobilization of local knowledgein related efforts of institutional development have been re- corded in circumstances of durable transfer of authority and resources into local hands. In fact, programs based onparticipatory design of the knowledge systems and local lan- guage tools required to effectively manage new economic activity and political jurisdiction seem to provide an idealmedium for \"inventorying\" and articulating related indig- enous knowledge\u2014because they create an environment in which it is clear (or at least clearer) that the cultural trea-sures exhumed and deployed will serve local interests and remain under local control. And, under these circum- stances, literacy training itself turns out to be an excellentmedium for mobilizing local knowledge, because it provides an opportunity and tool for \"renaming\" development and for reconfiguring the details of its implementation. This proved true, for example, in a series of experiments with the local management of rural enterprise in which theauthors took part: in central Niger in the late 1960s, again in Burkina Faso in the 1970s, in northern Cameroon in the 1980s and among the livestock herders of the Central AfricanRepublic in the early 1990s. The Cameroonian case involved the creation of an entire accounting system in the Massa lan- guage, whereas the Central African Republic experience wasbased on training Fulani herders already literate in religious Arabic script in the Romanized transcription of their own lan- guage. The literate training itself took as little as three orfour weeks of intensive instruction developed with\u2014and monitored by\u2014the local population; but the follow-up period of assumption of new powers and management responsibili-ties was critical and more prolonged. Who controls the knowledge? Similar conclusions could be drawn from the experience with participatory agricultural experimentation and exten- sion work undertaken in Mali on the heels of the literacy evaluation described above. There the incentive for localparticipants was the chance to take charge of agricultural experimentation themselves, while both learning the new skills required and assessing the store of local knowledgerelevant to the endeavor. No small part of the motivation sprang from the opportunity to \"turn the tables\" on tradi- tional agricultural extension work\u2014where resources, meth-ods and paradigms remained under the strict control of gov- ernment agents and were devoted to producing products and procedures in official experimental stations for top-down dissemination to farmers. Local authorities were very responsive when invited\u2014and enabled\u2014to draw up the ex- perimental designs themselves and name people who wouldundergo related training. However, the undertaking was eventually undermined by the firm opposition of the official agricultural extension services to this kind of contestationand decentralization of their rights and privileges. Articulating and expressing local knowledge, as these ex- amples illustrate, is therefore much more than an \"episte-mological\" and cultural undertaking. It is hedged about by questions of power and the \"terms of trade\" between local and central societies that are simply reconfirmed\u2014in an-other particular sphere\u2014by recent concerns for the copy- right and patent protection of indigenous pharmaceutical or botanical lore. Devising strategies that mediate these con-flicts and weave creative transfer of authority and resource into reconstruction of local knowledge is the true challenge.164IK Notes 29 February 2001West African Languages: Medium and Message This article was written by Peter Easton, Associate Professor, Graduate Studies in Adult and Continuing Education,Florida State University. For more information, please e-mail easton@coe.fsu.edu Indigenous knowledge in Africa, and the world over, is expressed in lan- guage, and usually in an \"indigenous\"language\u2014in short, the mother tongue of inhabitants of the locality, or a lin- gua franca in regular usage by them. Are these languages simply a neutral medium? Are they just instrumental \"vehicles\" for the expression of localknowledge and daily life? Or do the lan- guages themselves play some role, by their very structure and usage, in whatis thought and known? Language is very important in Africa. There are upwards of 2,000 languageson the continent, the number varying as a function of the way in which dis- tinctions are drawn among neighboringor related speech traditions. African cultures have been largely oral ones for centuries though varieties of writing(Western, Arabic and a few codes of Af- rican origin) have become increasingly well known. In many areas, the statusand role of \"praise-singer\" or \"griot\" is institutionalized to the point where an entire caste of people devotes its life tolearning and orally declaiming the his- tory and traditions of the locality and of its leading inhabitants. African cul-tures also typically place great empha- sis on social relations and communica- tion, all of which adds to the criticalrole played by language in the organi- zation of community and of knowledge. The examples in the paragraphs to follow are principally drawn from Hausa, the second most widespread tongue in Africa (after Swahili) and amember of the \"Chadic\" group of lan- guages. It is principally spoken in northern Nigeria and central Niger, butis used as well in several other coun- tries of the region. The patterns are nonetheless roughly representative of ahost of western and central African lan- guage traditions. Language as \"capital\" Hausa speakers give every bit as much importance to spoken expression and language as suggested above. Magana jari ce a traditional saying maintains: \"Language is capital.\" In the Hausa lexicon, the word hausa itself signifies not just the speech of that particular population group, but \"language\" in general and underlying \"meaning.\" Me ne ne Hausarka? people will ask: \"What language you your 'Hausa?'\" Ban gane ba Hausarshi is a common way of saying that \"I don't understand what he means .\" 1 1 Northern Hausa is used throughout all these examples and quoted expressions.165 Verb aspect Example Meaning in Hausa English equivalent Hausa phrase Meaning \"Tense\" Completive completed. (Commitmentis accomplished.) Continative Ya naa tahiya He is in the process of leaving \"He is leaving\" Present tense or going. (The intention is being or \"going\"accomplished.)

Habitual Ya kan tahi He is in the habit of going More or less No equivalent tense \u00abhe usually goes\u00bbAt least three levels of Hausa language may have a bear- ing on how thought is formulated and knowledge expressed: the grammar of the language, its lexicon and the social pat-terns governing its usage. The deep structure of grammar? One of the first things to strike a non-Hausa speaker\u2014and a non-African in particular\u2014in going beyond the fundamen- tals of the language is that the verb system is not really or- ganized into tenses. In other words, the primary informa-tion that the grammatical form of the verb phrase conveys is less when something happened or will happen than it is how that action is viewed by the people involved and what the nature of their intentions is with respect to it. Though the divisions of the verb parallel to some degree the tenses of many non-African languages, they are better described as\"aspects.\" Action is thus linguistically divided into the cat- egories listed below. * Once again, the primary information conveyed by this aspectual organization of the verb concerns the state of hu- man intention and commitment with respect to the action, not the time, even if there are analogies with a tense system.Someone who is leaving a party or house will therefore say to their host Naa\u2014 which, translated as a temporal state- ment, would signify (nonsensically) \"I have left.\" What ismeant, however, is that the person has decided to leave, and therefore the act is as good as done in the intentional realm. A focus on intention In a similar vein, the principal concern of the Hausa speaker is often with the nature of one's resolution or commitment to perform an act and with the process of decision itself,rather than with the exact date and duration of the act's performance. Hausa speakers sometimes express frustra- tion with Westerners' frequent use of the word \"perhaps\"(watakila in Hausa) in their conversation and planning. The habit is seen as a way of avoiding commitment. A popu- lar saying puts the point succinctly: Watakila abin da ya hana ma erally \"prevents\"] the Westerner from lying.\" Such patterns of expression by no means exclude atten- tion to schedules and timing, and temporal planning con- cerns have certainly become a more prominent fact of Sahelian life in the last half-century. At the same time, thisperspective or \"paradigm\" may not be so poorly adapted to circumstances where logistics have long been highly unpre- dictable and lasting commitment has been essential to get-ting things done\u2014and it may have relevance to the future needs of African society as well. * The transcription used for Hausa words and phrases throughout this article is, in general, the one currently prescribed by UNE SCO. The table and para- graph to follow are one exception. Long sounds are represented by doubled vowels, as was formerly the case, because there is no other handy way to bring out differences among the verb aspects. A \"grave\" accent indicates a low tone, and such an accent on the second vowel in a clus ter indicates a falling tone.166IK Notes Number 29 Using words where it counts The notion that language does not just express thought, but also shapes or influences it to some extent, has a long his-tory in western linguistic and cultural thought and remains hotly debated. Benjamin Lee Whorf and Edward Sapir were among the first to articulate it, and the \"Whorfian\" or\"Wharf-Sapir hypothesis\" still stirs controversy. Without steering toward those particular shoals, one can at least en- tertain the idea that the form of a language is part and par-cel of indigenous knowledge and a factor to be studied\u2014and savored\u2014in the attempt to preserve it. Whorf himself paid attention not just to the structure of languages but to their lexical properties as well\u2014i.e., the vo- cabulary, and, more specifically, the differences between the areas of experience that different languages seem to empha-size by the richness of their lexicon. He was fond of remark- ing that Eskimo languages have multiple words for differ- ent varieties of snow, but only one for all types of motorizedconveyance; whereas in English it is nearer the reverse. Critics have aptly pointed out that ski enthusiasts likewise have multiple terms in English for varying snow conditions. But the idea that the relative development of different areas of experience in the lexicon of a language says something about the distinctions that are important to its speakersstill merits consideration. An examination of a Hausa dictionary brings some simi- lar ideas to mind. Once again, there are relatively few tradi-tional words for motorized tool\u2014though a number of intro- duced ones\u2014but the terminology for varieties of relation- ships among people (both consanguineous and covenantal)and for shades of behavior is extremely developed. Three ex- amples: (a) nurkurkusa \u2014which can best be rendered as \"continually putting off paying someone\"; kwakyara for \"blurting out what ought not to have been said\"; and santi (or fanya )\u2014which designates \"saying something ordinary during a group meal that, due to general pleasure with thequality of the food, sends everyone into peals of laughter\"! Lexical creativity Any African language can be used, of course, to say what- ever one wants, and assimilation of new ideas and terms is no less prevalent in these languages than it is in English, French or Chinese\u2014an example of what social scientists call\"lexical creativity.\" Hausa is no exception to the rule. New terms have been created over the years for a host of initially foreign concepts, with sometimes poetic results. The UnitedNations was dubbed majalisar Solex motorbike\u2014a simple con- traption where the motor rode on top of the front wheel,driving it by friction \u2014 was baptized in Hausa kare ya dauko tukunya: \"the dog carrying a cooking pot.\" And its slightly larger cousin, the \"mobylette,\" was christened moreonomatopoetically dan bututu. (The letter \"d \" being what linguists call an \"implosive\" sound.) There is, in fact, a Hausa Language Board in northern Nigeria that rules\u2014much like the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise\u2014on neologisms and ap- propriate ways of expressing new ideas. But what a lan- guage community has traditonally\u2014if implicitly\u2014 chosen to represent by a single specialized term as opposed to a longer explanation says something about the ideas and perspec- tives that re-occur most often in thought patterns and ex-pression. Speech behaviors If language has some influence on thought and expression, it is shaped in turn by patterns of usage \u2014the roles people play in employing it and the ends to which they put it. This is, of course, the domain par excellence of socio-linguists. Deborah Tannen has written some works well known in the United States about variations in the speech behavior of American men and women, including striking differencesby gender in the meaning of interruptions and overlapping: breaking into what someone else is saying or completing it for them. Stated most simply, for men it tends to be an ag-gressive and competitive act, for women it can be a kind of support. An interesting aspect of speech patterns among the Hausa is the frequency\u2014and the role\u2014of similar kinds of \"overlapping.\" The author was once responsible for tran- scribing word for word the proceedings of a village confer-ence on livestock conducted in Hausa. When the discussions had been recorded and transferred to paper, an interesting thing appeared, something we all knew but had never paidmuch attention to. A number of very pertinent suggestions about how to stable cattle in the village and provide for their fodder (something not traditionally done in that region)came out during the sessions. On close examination of the transcript and audition of the tapes, however, it was clear that nearly no one had expressed a complete or well-formedidea on the topic. Rather, one person would utter the begin- nings of a sentence or thought, someone else would add to it, a third would round it out or reformulate it; and the dis-course bounced around the straw enclosure with few, if any, disquisitions or even individually-completed sentences. Yet,167 through this medium, some useful ideas and resolutions took form. From talking the talk to walking the walk There are many parallels to this practice of group or inter- personal complementarity in the social life of the region as well. Another story will illustrate the point. At a similarstage in (personal) prehistory, this author was responsible for setting up the first film projector ever seen in the town of Madaoua, Niger. It required, of course, an electrical genera-tor to boot, as there was no electricity in the town. Unfortu- nately, once delivered over 500 kilometers of washboard lat- erite road, neither piece of machinery showed any sign oflife and both resisted the best ministrations. The only re- course was the garage of the local arrondissement , or county seat, where a crew of barefoot mechanics worked under anadobe mud shelter behind the administrative offices with few tools to repair a small fleet of battered Land Rovers. The mechanics were glad to oblige, but as they started work our qualms grew. The group of them\u2014five or six\u2014pro- ceeded to squat around the equipment and to poke and pullat it from various angles, while keeping up a rapid and sometimes raucous dialogue about what they were doing. One thought at this point that the projector was history. Butwithin fifteen minutes they had both pieces of equipment running perfectly. Somehow they had managed to use the complementary experience and intuition of all group mem-bers\u2014mediated through language\u2014to solve a problem they had never encountered before. In an era when international business headlines the critical\u2014and generally deficient\u2014skills of teamwork and \"organizational learning\" within the workforce, these very habits, partly built into language form and usage, may turn out once again to be quite appli-cable. Food for thought None of these anecdotal examples should be taken too far or given too much weight. The underlying argument and expe- rience, though, seem worthy of the attention of those inter- ested in indigenous knowledge: part of that knowledge liesin, or is at least supported by, the medium of language itself.168IK Notes 30 March 2001Indigenous Knowledge and HIV/AIDS This article has been written by Maja Naur, Ph.D. in sociology, consultant to the World Bank.

For more information, e-mail:MAJANAUR@msn.com It has always been difficult to reach poor people with development aid, par- ticularly in health where most re-sources benefit the middle classes in urban hospitals. For the rural poor, and increasingly also for the urban poor, of-ten the only affordable and accessible form of health care is provided by tradi- tional healers. Zambia with an esti-mated 20-25 percent of the population HIV-positive has only 900 western- educated doctors (600 of whom are for-eign) but has 40,000 registered tradi- tional healers for a population of 10 million. Ghana, with 5 percent of thepopulation being HIV-positive, has 1,200 western educated doctors but an estimated 50,000 traditional healers fora population of 20 million. Thus, the ratio of doctor to traditional healer is 1:44 in Zambia and 1:42 in Ghana.Given the central cultural role of tradi- tional healers in communities, they provide one of the best hopes for treat-ing and stemming the spread of AIDS. But healers rely on medicinal plants and there has been a significant de-crease in the abundance of many im- portant medicinal plant species as their habitat are lost through deforestation,cultivation, overgrazing, burning, droughts, desertification, etc. This problem has been exacerbated by theunmanaged local and international de- mand for medicinal plants. Further- more, traditional healers have identi-fied as an important issue, the loss of indigenous knowledge regarding tradi- tional medicine, which forms part of the cultural heritage of local communi- ties and is usually transmitted orally. This knowledge is often undervaluedby the younger generations, at least in part because traditional medicine sel- dom brings high economic returns tothe practitioner. In recognition of the importance to preserve and protect this ethnomedicalknowledge, and the plant species on which it is based, the governments of Zambia and Ghana, with support fromthe World Bank, are in the process of establishing a bridge between environ- ment and health in fighting HIV/AIDS.In Zambia the executing agency is the Traditional Health Practitioners Asso- ciation of Zambia (THPAZ) throughthe Environmental Support Program (ESP) under the Ministry of Environ- ment and Natural Resources. InGhana, the effort will be part of the Northern Savanna Biodiversity Con- servation Project (NSBCP) under theMinistry of Land, Forestry and Mines. Basically, the two projects have the same approach although they differ inGhana and Zambia169 design: in Zambia the initiative has been retrofitted into an already existing program while in Ghana the activities will be part of on-going project design. What follows is first ashort description of the AIDS component involving tradi- tional healers under the Zambian ESP; second, a compari- son of the sociocultural findings particularly concerninggender differences related to traditional medicine in the two countries; and third, some of the difficulties experienced during the process of establishing this cross-sector initiativeinvolving agriculture, environment, health, and rural devel- opment. Under the Zambian initiative, \"Protection and Sustain- able Use of Biodiversity for Medicinal Value: An Initiative to Combat HIV/AIDS\" there are three main activities. The first activity, \"Conservation of Biodiversity for HIV/AIDSPrevention and Treatment\" includes the establishment of botanic gardens, forest reserves for medicinal plants, and a herbarium with medicinal plants. Some of the seeds, cut-tings and tubers for planting will come from Spiritual For- ests, which have considerable biodiversity and contain rare species of plants and trees, which have been preserved be-cause of the traditional rules, norms, and taboos associated with them. The second activity \"Training and Capacity Building\" is directed towards the traditional healers and in-cludes a long list of topics from behavior modification in re- lation to HIV/AIDS, understanding ecosystems, nutrition, toxicology, basic virology, epidemics, and immunology. In ad-dition to the environmental and medical aspects there will also be legal training so that healers do not infringe the law, such as the Witchcraft Act, and get a better understandingof human rights. The third activity \"Dissemination of Infor- mation/Knowledge on Biodiversity and HIV/AIDS\" will set up a communication strategy to be implemented throughnewsletters, radio programs, TV, drama/plays and leaflets. This activity will also include an electronic database on me- dicinal plants and publication of a handbook for traditionalhealers to be used in their practice. All training materials, programs, and publications will be in the major local lan- guages and a basic literacy program will be added to makethe (often) -illiterate healers capable of registering their pa- tients, and documenting their indigenous knowledge. Whereas gender analysis has been essential for project de- sign in both Zambia and Ghana the role of women are very different in the two countries. Generally the gender division of labor has been stronger in Ghana than in Zambia. Thishas had an effect on the position of female traditional heal- ers as well as their ability to participate in project activities. Some of the sociocultural differences are analyzed here. InZambia, traditional healers have received donor help to be organized on a national basis, and 60 percent of the regis-tered traditional healers are women. The number of women healers is even said to be growing in response to the increas- ing number of AIDS patients. People call HIV/AIDS\"Kalaye noko,\" meaning \"go and say goodbye to your mother,\" because most people die in their villages in their mothers' homes. Although women in Ghana are also theones to care for the ill, the contrast is striking when it comes to practicing healing. In Ghana, there is no functional na- tional traditional healers' association, and the three north-ern regions have less than one-fifth of the estimated heal- ers' registered. Of these (few) registered members, less than 10 percent are women except for one minor sub-regionwhere an active healer has managed to raise the figure to 49 percent. However, the low figure in Ghana is more a reflec- tion of local beliefs than of the actual number of womenhealers. Also, the Bank-assisted initiative might have unin- tentionally cemented already existing gender bias by, for ex- ample, only training the registered healers, who are over-whelmingly male. According to one female healer in Ghana, women, if they openly practice traditional medicine \"are termed witches and every misfortune is blamed on them; inmost cases these women are disowned and sent out of their societies. For this reason it is only the queen of witches who is known to heal, because she is so powerful that it is impos-sible for any member of the society to challenge her.\" In both countries it was extremely rare to find traditional healers who cultivated medicinal plants, and when it didhappen, it was almost exclusively funded by donors. In Zam- bia, women healers often referred to a spirit guiding them to the medicinal plants, which they collected and prepared formedicine themselves. In Ghana, there was substantial gen- der bias related to the collection of plants, preparation of medicine, and even to sexuality, which had a positive influ-ence on males but a negative influence on women. Fewer fe- male healers in Ghana were married than were male heal- ers, which one female healer explained by saying that shewould not be able to heal if her husband was living with her. Neither would healers, who used traditional African reli- gious rituals in the healing process, send their daughtersinto the bush to get the plants, because \"people would think they were witches.\" And husbands would not let their wives help to make the medicine \"because the medicine would notwork\" if prepared by a woman. An obvious rationale for this taboo was patrilineal location and succession which meant that a woman at marriage would move to her husband'shouse, and the family's secret knowledge on plants and its medical use, would thereby be in danger of being uncovered by another family. Healers in Ghana were also reluctant toteach their daughters traditional medicine, but little girls also have eyes and ears, and many women practice medi-170IK Notes Number cine, although not openly. That obviously had a negative in- fluence on women's options for income generation through their practice. Only traditional birth attendants (TBA) werealmost exclusively women, and most TBAs received some remuneration for their services. But most traditional heal- ers earn their main income from farming and remunerationfor healing was in farm products. In Zambia, the declining economy had forced many healers to give up payment in kind, and healers had increasingly turned to (their indi-vidual) standard payments for each disease. The highest price was always a cure for infertility, which had to be paid at the arrival of an infant son. The strong division of laborin Ghana gives a unique opportunity through the project to support women and families in HIV/AIDS prevention and poverty reduction, thereby enhancing the prospects of suc-cess for the project as a whole. The long-term goal of biodiversity conservation could seem abstract to communi- ties suffering from food shortages and hunger; however,short-term income generation through the cultivation and selling of medicinal plants and vegetables leading to im- provements in, particularly, children's health could have acatalytic effect on the success of the project. Traditional healers, both male and female, expressed an eagerness to be trained to improve their practice. In Ghana,the mass communication program on HIV/AIDS had suc- ceeded in disseminating information on transmission of the disease from one person to another via blood, sexual inter-course, infected needles, and so forth. But communities' knowledge on how it is transmitted was not always com- plete or accurate. Some communities referred to the dangerof eating or bathing together with an AIDS-infected person; even shaking hands or using the same clothes was men- tioned as a possible way to be infected. None of the commu-nities admitted that there were any affected individuals in their village, and in both Zambia and Ghana, severe stigma was attached to a person with AIDS. Thus, people were lesslikely to admit infection and treat HIV/AIDS as a common, but serious, disease. Poverty and cultural norms also make Africa the continent with the highest proportion of womento men infected with AIDS. In the fight against AIDS, tradi- tional healers need training as they provide health care for about 70 percent of the population. And TBAs, according tothe World Health Organization, deliver 95 percent of babies in the rural areas, which makes them particularly critical care-givers but also renders them more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. In the long run, the health infrastructure provided by the traditional healers and their organizations could pro- vide the distribution network for AIDS medicines whenthey become available at a reasonable price. Traditional healers have a unique position as educators and potential distributors of AIDS medicine\u2014for example in handling pa-tients' doses. No African government has the resources or health personnel in the numbers needed to fight the AIDS epidemic. Governments in Ghana or Zambia do not support tradi- tional healers financially as they do their (modern) medical associations, and in neither country is traditional medicinepart of the curriculum at medical faculties. In this respect, African countries are far behind countries such as China and India where alternative medicine is an integrated partof modern medicine practiced at hospitals. However, Ghana and Zambia both have staff in their Ministries of Health to coordinate policies to traditional healers, and both govern-ments want healers to be registered. Ghana has shown a positive attitude towards the conservation of medicinal plants and has acknowledged traditional healers by passinga Traditional Medicine Practice Act in 2000. In Zambia, on the other hand, it was when more than one-fifth of the population became infected with AIDS that traditional heal-ers were invited to become part of the Technical Committee on Natural Remedies for HIV and Other Related Diseases, placed directly under the Head of State. The Ministry ofEnvironment and Natural Resources, under which the ESP is located, was initially very reluctant to involve civil society in natural resource management, and particularly THPAZ,which is the country's largest NGO. Traditional healers were considered to be irrelevant to modernity and therefore to be excluded from development. A similar reluctance wasinitially found in the World Bank where traditional healers' practices were often perceived as lacking scientific valida- tion, and hence legitimacy. This view was also widespreadamong western doctors, although traditional health prac- tice predates modern medical practice just as the use of herbs and medicinal plants predates the present pharmaco-logical practice. Gradually, however, this attitude has changed and today it is acknowledged that initiatives like the ones in Zambia and Ghana are benefiting the poor di-rectly and have considerable potential in treating AIDS-re- lated diseases.30171IK Notes 31 April 2001This article was co-authored by Peter Easton, Associate Professor, Graduate Studies in Adult andContinuing Education, EFPS, and Dr. Karen Monkman, Assistant Professor of InternationalEducation, both of Florida State University.Malicounda-Bambara: The Sequel The Journey of a Local Revolution In the space of less than four years, a locally-impelled movement to abandon the practice of female genital cutting(FGC) has spread from a single village in central Senegal to over 200 commu- nities nationwide, and to several otherAfrican countries as well. The path and mode of its dissemination carry a host of lessons and questions, about how in-digenous culture renews itself. The experience of the village of Malicounda-Bambara in the Thies re-gion of central Senegal and its immedi- ate aftermath were recounted in an earlier issue of IK Notes (\"Senegalese Women Remake Their Culture,\" Octo- ber 1998, no. 3). But the \"rest of the story\" has been immensely instructive. A brief reminder of the dimensions of the original initiative, and of the criti- cal events that shaped its aftermath,will help to situate the story. In at the creation Between 1995 and 1997, women and a few men in the village of Malicounda- Bambara took part in a nonformal edu- cation program sponsored by theSenegal-based NGO \"Tostan.\" The program focused on methods of prob- lem-solving, themes of women's healthand human rights, and the beginnings of literacy.The participants in Malicounda- Bambara decided that they had a prior- ity objective apart from the develop-ment of income-generating activities, establishment of well-baby programs, launching village hygiene initiativesand so forth : get their village to aban- don FGC once and for all. Bambara people are among the sizeable minorityof Senegalese ethnic groups that ob- serve the practice. In the course of the training, women had shared with eachother painful personal experiences on this taboo topic and had confronted them with their renewed sense ofwomen's rights. As a consequence, they approached local authorities and other villagers to win their support for a com-mon declaration of intent to abandon the practice. And they were successful. On July 31, 1997 the villagers ofMalicounda-Bambara made a state- ment renouncing the practice in perpe- tuity in front of twenty Senegalesejournalists invited for the occasion. The event made a minor splash, per- haps greater through word-of-mouthdissemination in local culture than in print and audio media. There was some immediate vocal opposition to what thewomen of Malicounda had done, as much in reaction to the \"shame\" of talking this publicly about a taboo topicas to the substance of the declaration.172IK Notes Number 31 Despite the controversy, a second nearby village also under- going the Tostan training program\u2014Nguerigne-Bambara\u2014 decided to imitate Malicounda-Bambara's example, led by awoman who was herself a traditional \"cutter\"; and yet an- other, K\u00ebr Simbara, began actively discussing the idea. Then a critical event occurred. The turning point The Imam of K\u00ebr Simbara\u2014a 66-year old religious leader much respected in the region\u2014became very concerned atthe events, and he came to talk with Tostan representatives and the women of Malicounda-Bambara. He was not op- posed to the abandonment of FGC. In fact, the controversyhad prompted him to talk to his female relatives about their own experience and feelings regarding FGC for the first time, and he ended up a strong supporter. But he felt thatthere were two major problems with the way in which things were being done. First, a single village cannot do this alone, the Imam said. \"We are part of an inter-marrying community, and unless all the villages involved take part, you are asking parents to forfeit the chance of their daughters getting married.\" Sec-ond, there was a real problem of language and approach. These are taboo topics, he pointed out, and they should not be discussed lightly or inconsiderately. The people who cru-saded against FGC in the past used terms that villagers con- sider unmentionable and showed images and pictures that shocked them. They treated the practice as a disease toeradicate and its practitioners as social pariahs. That is no way to change a culture, or to help it change itself, the Imam said. His interlocutors agreed: It was time to think things through a good deal more carefully. Together, they outlined a strategy:\u007f Go to all the villages in the inter-marrying community. Start by reaffirming personal relationships. \u007f Don't tell the villagers what to do. Tell them what Malicounda-Bambara and Nguerigne-Bambara have done, and why. Then let them tell their own stories and make their own decisions. \u007f Avoid using graphic terms or demonstrations for taboo activities. Refer to FGC simply as \"the custom.\" Everyone will know what is meant. In Senegalese Bambara, \"cus-toms\" in the plural refers to a whole set of cultural tradi- tions; \"the custom\" in the singular refers to FGC alone. \u007f Avoid condemning practitioners either implicitly or ex- plicitly. They have been performing in good faith.On the basis of these agreements, the Imam set out on foot, accompanied by the woman cutter from K\u00ebr Simbara and his own nephew, to visit ten other villages in that mar-riage community. It was a ground-shaking experience. Women opened up\u2014they told stories of daughters who had died from hemorrhage, others who had contracted infec-tions or long-term psychic distress from the FGC trauma. Those who performed the practice talked, too\u2014about why, and about changing customs. Men joined in with their re-flections. Before it was over, all ten villages had decided to join the ranks of those declaring against FGC. With representativesof Malicounda-Bambara, Nguerigne-Bambara and K\u00ebr Simbara itself, they met at the village of Diabougou, fifty strong representing 8,000 rural people, and declared \"neveragain\" on February 15, 1998. The news continued to spread. The movement next jumped to the southern region of Senegal below the Gambia, where the Fulani ethnic grouphas traditionally practiced FGC. A first group of fourteen villages studied the Tostan curriculum, listened to news of Malicounda-Bambara, resolved to take action in their ownenvironment, and enlisted four additional communities within their socio-marital network to make a joint declara- tion, promulgated in the village of Medina Cherif on June12, 1998. An indigenous strategy for dissemination It is worth stopping a moment at this point to reflect on ex- actly what had happened because it explains much of the rest of the dissemination story\u2014successes, opposition en- countered, and lessons yet to be learned. Essentially, the strategy that developed from local re- sponse and input had three distinct elements. The first was that it was collective in nature, rather than\u2014or in addition to being\u2014individual. The approach ex- plicitly recognized that families cannot abandon a long- rooted cultural practice if there is not a collective will tochange the incentive structures and at least some of the ob- jective conditions that hold it in place. When thirteen re- lated villages became affiliated, those involved in effectchanged the marriage market and created conditions in which people could comply, and do so out of solidarity with their own community. Second, the approach was grounded in the local context and evoked some of strongest values and practices of ambi- ent culture\u2014parental love, Koranic piety\u2014to challenge oth-ers. It therefore came across more as a movement for inter- nal consistency and liberation than as an outside condem-173 nation. No one talks of the \"eradication\" of FGC, as if it were a plague to be stamped out, but rather of its \"abandon- ment\"\u2014a conscious act by those most concerned. The pres-ence of an Imam who could remind people that Islam never dictated such a practice was highly instrumental. And men were in no way excluded. In fact, their support was criticalto the development of the movement. Finally, the method was empowering\u2014that is, while rooted in personal testimony and the transmission of newinformation, it left resolution and action up to the initiative of each community and its members. It cast the problem of FGC in the larger frame of women's health and humanrights, topics with which men too are vitally concerned. The result was not only that people chose to follow of their own free will, but that they were ready to spread the word. Beating two tracks From that point on, the evolution of the movement has es- sentially followed two axes: one out front in the media andinternational fora, and the other on the ground. For once, though, the out-front publicity has not outstripped the local reality, and the activity has remained largely wedded to itsvillage manifestations. Media attention was quick in coming, both in Senegal and abroad. Notice appeared in short order in the Senegalesepress. In October 1997, a feature article on the \"Oath of Malicounda-Bambara\" came out in Le Monde in Paris. Tostan representatives have since been invited to numerousconferences, assemblies, and events to relate the story of the movement against FGC. In almost every instance, promot- ers have made sure that local women and men spoke forthemselves\u2014through interpreters, where necessary. The lo- cal champions of the movement\u2014the elderly Imam and the women cutters and organizers\u2014have made presentations tothe British Parliament, to the German Ministry of Develop- ment and Cooperation, to the European Union in Brussels, to a Women's Rights Conference in Washington, and tocommittees of the United Nations in New York. More sig- nificantly still, they have traveled to neighboring countries, Burkina Faso and Mali, to talk with other women facingsimilar problems. But outside attention had its downside as well. Endorse- ment of the Oath of Malicounda by the Senegalese Presi-dent Abdou Diouf\u2014significant, even if he was himself from the majority Wolof, who do not practice FGC\u2014was eventu- ally followed by a move in the country's Assembl\u00e9e Nationale (Parliament) to pass a law abolishing the practice and dictating severe penalties for violators. The allies of Tostan were immediately concerned and went to Dakar totestify against the law, not, obviously, because they wanted to maintain FGC, but because they firmly believed official abolition and sanction were not the way to go. The law, theyfelt, should follow and model a change in practice developed in the field, not attempt to dictate it. As the Imam from K\u00ebr Simbara put it in reference to his own ethnic group, \"Try totell Bambara people what they must do about their own cus- toms and you have a fight on your hands.\" The premonitions proved right. The law was passed, de- spite these words of caution from the field, and a general outcry ensued. In protest, one traditional cutter in the re- gion of Tambacounda made a point of performing no fewerthan 120 \"circumcisions\" in the days following. Keeping the local movement alive Developments on the ground pursued quite a different path. The Imam and former cutter from K\u00ebr Simbara and Nguerigne-Bambara launched out into another group of twelve villages in central Senegal. The local women who hadbeen ringleaders in the Kolda region expanded their efforts to neighboring communities, parlaying support from the Imam of Medina Cherif into a religiously endorsed move-ment. At the same time, they undertook to transpose the ef- fort to the Futa Toro region of northwestern Senegal, an area of Toucouleur culture over 250 kilometers away thatspeaks the same Fulani language. In addition, one of the villages that had participated in the Diabougou declaration\u2014Samba Dia\u2014took initiatives of itsown. Samba Dia was in fact of \"SerereNiominka\" lineage, an offshoot of the Serere ethnic group that had historically commingled with Mandinka and Bambara speakers. Thewomen of Samba Dia decided that the word had to be spread among their own people, fisherfolk inhabiting the islands of Sine Saloum on the Senegalese coast southeast of Dakar.Women and men got some support for transport costs from Tostan and started canoeing around from island to island, visiting twenty-six insular communities throughout the ar-chipelago. In the Futa Toro, there was fierce opposition from some traditional religious and cultural authorities. The womenand their allies felt that they could not make a proclamation about FGC under these circumstances, but they found a dy- namic alternative. No less than eighty-seven villages sentrepresentatives to a meeting at Aere Lao in the Podor region (east of St. Louis) where, on November 4, 2000, they signed a solemn declaration foreswearing all practices harmful towomen's health and development. By \"retreating\" to the ground of human rights, they outflanked the opposition.174IK Notes Number Farther south in the Sine Saloum islands, representatives of the twenty-six villages contacted by boat\u2014none of whom had yet undergone the Tostan training program\u2014as-sembled of their own volition on the island of Niodior on April 7, 2000 to draw up their own declaration of abandon- ment of the practice and to make arrangements for startingtheir own classes. And in the region of Kolda, the number of communities making declarations and undertaking training has continued to grow, progressing from the original eigh-teen to thirty that took part in the Tostan program and, by the end of last year, to an additional seventy-five neighbor- ing communities. Tostan representatives report that in Feb-ruary 2001 word came in from yet another group of local women who had completed the training and succeeded in aligning all communities of their entire rural \"county\" (thecommunaut\u00e9 rurale of Mampatim) behind the effort: nearly 100 additional villages, which have scheduled their procla- mation for March 2001. Following the local lead No one can say exactly what subsequent stages in this local groundswell will bring. As the Director of Tostan puts it,\"Much of this caught us by surprise. We are following them.\" But a number of results beyond the simple statistics of villages mobilized and groups renouncing FGC are al-ready evident:\u007f Connections are being made everywhere between the lo- cally motivated abandonment of FGC and concerns of de- mocracy and human rights. In fact, the key issues havebeen cast in these larger terms and have led to a variety of associated efforts: public examination of domestic vio- lence, local assertion of girls' rights to schooling, requestsfor increased accountability in local governance. \u007f Men have become a vital part of the effort, both in classes and out \"on the campaign trail.\" Even in programs focus-ing in good part on women's health and rights, male par- ticipation remains at nearly 30 percent. \u007f The public declaration model has been adopted in a num- ber of other areas of locally driven rural development, from resolutions about domestic violence to others re- nouncing the practice of brush fires as a land-clearingtechnique. \u007f And the effort has begun to go continent-wide. Initiatives modeled on the Senegalese example, but modified for eachcultural context, are now underway in Burkina Faso, Mali and Sudan, and there have been inquiries from as far away as East Africa. The women and men working on theground in Senegal have been the principal ambassadors, while Tostan is itself planning a training center in Thies for those from other countries who would like to visit,share with and learn from the women's rights cohorts in Senegalese villages. As a West African proverb succinctly says, \"Once the sun has risen, the palm of your hand can no longer cover it.\"31175IK Notes 32 May 2001African Traditional Healers:The Economics of Healing This article was written by Kenneth L. Leonard, Department of Economics, ColumbiaUniversity, Mail Code 3308, 420 W 118 th Street, New York, NY 10027; e-mail address: KL206@columbia.edu Traditional healers are a source of health care for which Africans have al- ways paid. Even with the expansion ofmodern medicine, healers are still popular and command fees exceeding the average treatment cost at mostmodern practitioners. Are traditional healers miracle workers or are they charlatans? Clearly either view is tooextreme. Traditional healers are not perfect: although we have all heard sto- ries of miraculous cures, the health sta-tus of the average African peasant can- not be reconciled with omnipotent healers. Nor, however, can they be char-latans: people cannot be continuously ignorant about the capacity of someone who lives among them. This article ad-vances a view of traditional healers that relies on neither supernatural power nor manifest ignorance. It sug-gests that healers remain popular de- spite abundant modern medicine be- cause they have wisely used an impor-tant economic contract to the mutual benefit of their practice and the popula- tion they serve. While the contrasts between tradi- tional medicine and modern medicine are many, the article focuses on the dif-ferences in the way traditional and modern healers are paid. An important element of their practice has been pre-viously ignored: traditional healers re- ceive the bulk of their payment only if the patient is cured. Economic theory When consumers purchase a service where quality matters but cannot be di-rectly observed or evaluated, economic theory raises the possibility of a market failure. Health care is a classic exampleof this type of failure, commonly re- ferred to as agency. Patients choose to visit physicians precisely because phy-sicians know more than patients do. The patient cannot evaluate what the doctor is doing for her sake, nor can sheinfer physician effort from the out- come. Patients are often cured despite poor quality care, or fail to be cured de-spite expert care. If patients cannot tell what doctors are doing, then doctors have fewer reasons to exert extraordi-nary effort on the patient's behalf. Thus, although patients are willing to pay for high-quality care and physi-cians are able to provide it, the market may fail and high-quality health care would not be delivered. The standard economic solution is to force the agent (the person performing the unobservable services) to face the176IK Notes Number 32 loss or gain of his/her actions. Thus, salespersons are paid on commission, and CEOs receive stock options. The health counterpart is the pay-only-if-cured or outcome-contingent(since payments are contingent on outcomes) contract. If patients paid their doctors only if they were cured, or more if they were cured than if they were not, the economic costof agency would be reduced. Despite the fact that health care suffers from a problem widely identified in theory, health economics as a whole hasdismissed the economic solution to the problem as inappli- cable to health care. Non-contractibility is one of the most widely cited reasons for dismissing this solution. Contract-ibility means that agreements about payments are enforce- able. The outcome-contingent contract is considered non- contractible because patients can simply lie about the out-come of treatment and the doctor would be unable to prove his case to a third party. The definitions of cured and not cured are inherently subjective and subject to deliberatemisrepresentation. Economic practices of traditional healers in Africa This \"ideal\" but previously unobserved economic contract is exactly the method by which traditional healers in Africa do business. Patients pay traditional healers more if they are cured than if they are not cured. The results of inter-views with healers in Cameroon, Tanzania, and Ethiopia re- ported in a publication by this author are summarized here. The healers spoken with received an initial payment and, inaddition, negotiated with the patient over a payment to be made in the future. In all cases, if the treatment did not re- sult in improvement of the condition, the patient paid noth-ing beyond the initial payment. When asked about the practice of \"cursing\" patients for non-payment, many healers were adamant that they neverengaged in the practice, though almost all admitted that their ancestors or, specifically, parents had done so. The practice traditionally operated as follows: when a patientrefused to pay, the healer would either invoke a curse on the patient or revoke the cure. This practice invokes near-uni- versal fear in rural populations, and most non-healers be-lieved that if they failed to pay they would be cursed. All healers told stories of patients leaving without paying and then returning, sometimes years later, begging to be allowedto pay. Patients believe cursing is still practiced, allowing healers to wait until after the treatment to collect payment without fear that the patient will refuse to pay. The outcome-contingent contract means that healers have strong incentives to provide quality care even if the patient cannot evaluate or observe this quality. But what ofthe non-contractibility concern? How can traditional heal- ers agree to accept payment when the patient could lie about the outcome and refuse to make any payments? Tworeasons are advanced: first, healers live in the same village as many of their patients and can therefore observe what patients are doing; second, patients believe that healersknow whether they are cured. In contrast, outcome-contingent contracts are not used in the practices of modern medicine anywhere in the world.Instead, patients pay a fixed fee for all services delivered whether they are cured or not. No one expects this type of payment scheme to deliver quality. Instead, the assumptionis that quality care is assured by restrictions on the activity of practitioners that come from other sources (including, but not limited to medical associations, referral networks,hospital networks and direct regulation of the practitioner.) In Africa, physicians at modern facilities such as govern- ment or not-for-profit health systems (primarily church-op-erated) are regulated through hierarchical supervision, where physicians evaluate the quality of other physicians and employment status or bonuses depend on the result ofthe evaluation. Since the payment (or well-being) of the practitioner depends, not on the outcome, but the effort s/he exerts, this is referred to as an effort-contingent contract.Note that in order to regulate another doctor you need to be at least as well trained as s/he is: only doctors can regulate other doctors. Comparing outcome-contingent to effort-contingent contracts The outcome-contingent contract of traditional healers gives them good reason to exert effort in the treatment of patients even if the patient cannot evaluate what the healeris doing. However, if a modern physician practices in an or- ganization that cares about quality, s/he will also have a good reason to produce high-quality care; her/his employerswill insure that s/he does. Thus, while it would appear that the contract of the traditional healer does not offer any ad- ditional benefit over a well-implemented contract at anymodern provider, this is not quite true. The fact that healers contract on outcomes rather than effort has important repercussions on their practices. Take,for example, a patient with asthma who smokes. A modern doctor treating this patient can be evaluated based on what s/he does for this patient by another physician who knowswhat s/he is supposed to do. S/he can be evaluated on tests ordered, treatments prescribed, or advice given but will not be evaluated on whether the patient is cured (or in this case,whether his/her symptoms are alleviated). If the patient re-177 fuses to quit smoking s/he will not be cured, but this does not matter to the modern physician. The traditional healer, on the other hand, has no chance of being paid if the patient does not quit smoking. If he is unable to convince the patient to quit, he could refuse to take the case, or at the very least, refuse to accept the out-come-contingent contract. The difference between the two types of contracts emerges not from the amount of medical effort finally delivered, but from the difference in the rela-tionship between the efforts of practitioners and the efforts of patients. Because outcomes (and not inputs) matter, a traditional healer cares more than the modern doctor aboutthe actions that patients take. Patient perception of the practice of healers Economic theory suggests that the contract used by healers will lead them to provide high-quality effort in health care. Modern practitioners may also provide high-quality effort, but they will not work as well with patients in situationswhere patient effort is important to outcomes. How do patients use traditional healers? If the theory is correct, traditional healers should have an advantage (hold-ing other factors constant) when patients suffer from ill- nesses that require both medical and patient effort. They will not have an advantage in situations in which specialequipment or skills are required. Contrast the example of asthma with malaria and appendicitis. Malaria is compara- tively easy to diagnose and does not require extensive efforton the part of either physicians or patients\u2014instead, it re- quires widely available medication. Patients should visit the least expensive provider who has the appropriate medicinewithout concern for quality. Appendicitis, on the other hand, requires surgery\u2014a service for which hospitals are much better equipped than traditional healers; patientsshould seek skilled treatment. Indeed, across Africa there are consistent patterns in the choice of health care practitioner according to illness condi-tion: certain conditions tend to lead to visits to certain prac- titioners. This author tested these patterns to see if they fit the patterns that would be predicted by theory. In order todo this, each individual illness condition is examined by physicians who evaluated the degree to which the outcome depends on the efforts of the practitioner and the efforts ofthe patient. In the southwest province of Cameroon, patients are more likely to visit a mission facility over a government fa-cility when they suffer from conditions that require sub- stantial amounts of medical effort. Since mission facilitiesare well regulated compared to government facilities, this makes sense; patients seek and are willing to pay for this particular measure of quality only when they deem that itreally matters. In addition, as would be predicted by eco- nomic theory, patients are more likely to visit a traditional healer (even over the high-quality mission facility) whenthey suffer from a condition that requires large amounts of both medical and patient effort. Patient behavior follows the patterns predicted by an economic understanding of thepayment scheme used at traditional healers. Conclusion While traditional healers perform many roles in their societ- ies, this article focuses on one important feature of their practices: they use an economically rational tool in their practices and their behavior and the behavior of patientsreflects the use and benefits of this tool. The pay-only-if- cured or outcome-contingent contract provides traditional healers with the right incentives to provide high-qualitycare, and patients behave as if they are aware of the implica- tions of this contract. Importantly, the magical or mysteri- ous elements of their practices are essential to the properfunctioning of this contract. Without the belief that healers know the outcome of treatments, the outcome-contingent contract would be non-contractible. Thus, although thiscontract appears to be very successful for healers, it cannot be widely adopted. Traditional healers, far from duping a gullible population, behave as if they are rational and serving a rational popula- tion. As long as modern medicine is delivered in a context in which quality is uncertain, traditional healers will continueto attract patients.

Indigenous healing has shown itself to be an effective treatment for the trauma suffered by children in war-torn countries of Africa ( see IK Note No. 10). Recent experience in Mozam- bique demonstrates that other dimen-sions of local culture may be just as im- portant in socially \"grounding\" a gen- eration of young people uprooted byarmed conflict and repairing the rav- ages of war. The years of civil strife in that coun- try left rural children and their com- munities wounded in a number of ways. Children lost their parents. Oth-ers were separated from their families in the rush to escape the fighting and ended up living with adoptive parentsor in military camps for long periods of time. Young people were also wounded or abused. And some were conscriptedinto the rebel army and forced to com- mit acts of violence. At the same time, rural communities were largely devastated and stripped of the little infrastructure they possessed. Schools have typically been few and farbetween in the remoter areas of Mozambique. Under colonial rule, little was done outside urban areas. Duringthe few short years of relative stability after the country's hard-won indepen- dence in 1975, numbers of schools andstudents multiplied rapidly. Supply could not keep up with demand and, as in many areas of Africa, communityschools created locally began appearing in the countryside in the late 1970s. They were for the most part staffed byyoung people with a few years of educa- tion at best who reproduced what they could of the standard curriculum. This nascent infrastructure was dev- astated, however, in the long civil war launched by the rebel movement in1977. Health and education facilities in the countryside were largely wiped out because disruption of social life andparticularly government services to the population was one of the movement's prime objectives. Enrollment statisticsdipped dramatically throughout the following decade and only began to re- cover when peace initiatives began in1990. Putting the pieces back together By the late 1980s, the hostilities had begun to abate and a variety of efforts was undertaken to reunite children separated from their families and topromote healing. The Mozambican Na- tional Directorate of Social Action (DNAS) sponsored an initial round of179 programs jointly with the \"Children and War\" Project (C&W) of the international non-governmental organization Save the Children. The program remained, however, too bu-reaucratic to have much success in penetrating rural areas. C&W therefore set out on its own to collaborate directly with interested communities. By 1992 it had created a net-work of over 14,000 volunteers and succeeded in reuniting some 12,000 children with their families. Much of this result was due to the initiatives of the local communities themselves. By the time they were able to be- gin picking up the pieces, reuniting families and resuming a semblance of normal life, little in the way of social serviceswas left, and a government burdened by debt was unable to offer much consistent help. So the local people went to work. In order to address the needs of unaccompanied andnewly reunited children, some started to rebuild commu- nity schools, developed community-based child socialization programs, and design and implement youth skills traininginitiatives. To ensure longer lasting support to the effort, C&W was transformed into a Mozambican NGO entitled \"Children, Family and Development\" (CFD). A village takes charge The effort bore unexpected fruit in the administrative divi- sion of Itoculo, a remote cluster of communities in thenorthern Nampulo province of Mozambique. The people of Itoculo belong to one of the country's principal ethnic groups, the Macua. Access to Itoculo is difficult and its con-tact with the outside world is infrequent. The most regular visitors to the area are illegal loggers bent on profiting from its rich forest resources, and the cotton buyers, who showup once a year during the crop-marketing season. There was only one elementary school in the central village of Itoculo, serving a fraction of the 30,000 people living closeby and none of the additional 20,000 residing in the more far-flung villages of the zone, the farthest being 22 kilome- ters away by cart track. By the early 1990s, many of the children of Itoculo who were orphaned or deprived of a normal childhood during the long years of conflict had themselves become parents andheads of households. They did not want their own children to be deprived in the same way, and they wanted to rebuild their communities. At that time, the government Depart-ment of Social Action approached leaders of the Itoculo communities to discuss ways of addressing the developmen- tal and educational needs of preschool-aged children. Anagreement was reached to create three escolinhas comunit\u00e1rias, or community preschools . However, theseonly lasted two short years: the standardized curriculum, the rigid model of implementation, and the experience of enforced dependency on state agencies unable to fulfill theirpromises discouraged local participation. The problems of unattended children remained acute and a major preoccupation of the renascent communities. Thefirst break-through came when Itoculo area residents who had worked with C&W during the war thought of borrow- ing the model of traditional initiation societies and graftingit onto the escolinhas idea in order to devise a solution. In Macua culture, as in most others across the African conti- nent, youth go through traditional initiation rites on theirway to adulthood. For these rites, children are informally grouped into small cohorts of friends and relatives as they grow toward adolescence. When a certain number\u2014averag-ing ten to fifteen young boys or girls\u2014is achieved, the chil- dren are taken away from the community to an isolated area by an elder. There they are taught the \"lore\" of adult-hood: male and female roles, the meaning of puberty, com- munity traditions and relevant skills. Boys receive instruc- tion in hunting and fishing, house construction, and relatedmatters. Girls learn about their bodies and the responsibili- ties of being a mother and housewife; and they are in- structed to protect themselves and break contact with boys. Adapting the traditional model The initial idea was simply to revive the failed escolinhas comunit\u00e1rias in another form, under local control. Some of the few schooled young people in the village would take charge of cohorts of older children in a thatched hut \"class- room\" away from town and share with them the rudimentsof literacy. Three escolinhas of this type were created. Al- though the initiative worked, community members did not think it went far enough. The younger children needed careas well, and things other than the three Rs belonged in the \"curriculum.\" So the community requested help from CFD to expand and develop the idea. CFD staff agreed to trainanimadores for the community school and provide some as- sistance with management and organization if Itoculo resi- dents lent material support and took charge. A committeewas formed, and the collaboration was launched. CFD backing triggered an extended process of blending or \"cross-breeding\" between the community school and thetraditional initiation model, carried out under local direc- tion. Though they remained supportive of the idea of chil- dren becoming literate in Portuguese to facilitate communi-cations with the outside world, Itoculo committee members questioned whether this learning would be enough for the180IK Notes Number children to become full members of the community itself. And so they began, step by step, to elaborate the curriculum and revamp the organization of the escolinhas , selecting among the methods of initiation societies ideas and models that made sense and inventing new ones as they advanced. Deliberations about the curriculum and escolinha organi- zation typically involved a cross-section of committee mem- bers, parents, animadores and children. Among the innova- tions adopted over time by Itoculo were the following:\u007f Elders were invited in to tell stories of the traditions of the community and their own life experience. \u007f The committee encouraged all community members to contribute games, toys, songs and poetry that could be shared with the children. Traditional chants used to teach numeracy were \"unearthed,\" adapted and added to thecurriculum. And the schools began sponsoring or joining events to exchange these cultural resources with other escolinhas of the region. \u007f Local artisans were contacted to provide instruction in their crafts. Women who made clay pots for cooking and gardening shared their skills with the children, as didweavers and dancers. \u007f The schedule of classes was reviewed and modified to fit better with the seasons of farming and social activity inItoculo. \u007f After first using the standard government preschool cur- riculum as the point of reference for the \"academic\" por-tions of the escolinha program, the committee decided to adopt\u2014and adapt\u2014major portions of the national adult literacy curriculum as more appropriate to their goals.Spreading the word The first few years of experience of the escolinhas comunit\u00e1rias \u2014from 1995 through 2000\u2014have been suc- cessful ones. The number of these schools in Itoculo has grown to eight, and the initiative has begun to attract much attention throughout the region. Starting in 1998, othercommunities in Nampulo began to ask the Itoculo commit- tee for assistance in starting similar projects, and commit- tee members have grown increasingly proficient as \"con-sultants\" and \"trainers\" in their own right. Six other such schools now function in neighboring areas. In addition, the experience in managing a locally directed initiative like the escolinhas has given committee and com- munity members some valuable and very \"transferable\" skills in collective entrepreneurship\u2014and ones that theyhave begun to apply to a series of other local development challenges, including water supply and health services. In fact, the group has now created two formal public schools tobegin filling out local educational infrastructure and pro- vide a means of further training for at least some of the chil- dren who have gone through the community learning expe-rience . In each case, the formula used for the escolinhas \u2014 outside support with substantial matching resources from the community, clear accountability and direct local con-trol\u2014has proved functional. In the year 2000, the village formally created the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o dos Amigos da Crian\u00e7a de Itoculo (AMICI) or the Association of Friends of the Chil- dren of Itoculo, to coordinate all such initiatives, the first such legally chartered entity in the community's history. AMICI offers a unique opportunity to couple past and fu- ture in the Nampula region and to harness the best of tradi- tional practice in youth initiation to opportunities for viable rural futures in Mozambique. An infusion and selection ofindigenous models has proved to be a vital element in the solution to the problems of a war-torn society.33181IK Notes 34 July 2001Communicating Local Farming KnowledgeTanzania The link between the documentation of local knowledge and the dissemination of useful local technologies to farmersis generally weak in the indigenous technology development process. A considerable amount of local knowl-edge has been documented, but in most cases, such information is not made available to farmers in a form they canmake use of to improve their agricul- tural production. In the cases where in- formation is given back, it is often toogeneral and/or does not relate to the targeted groups' own surroundings and culture. To fill this gap, the Uluguru Moun- tains Agricultural Development Project (UMADEP) has been working with lo-cal farmers to document their local knowledge related to Natural Crop Protection (NCP) and to spread thisknowledge to other farmers in the Uluguru Mountains using interesting and locally relevant educational mate-rials and farmer-led training work- shops. The approach used by UMADEP involves the local commu-nity throughout the process of collec- tion of the knowledge, documentation and dissemination. Mgeta is a division in Morogoro Ru- ral District, Morogoro Region in the eastern part of Tanzania. Situated onthe slopes of the Uluguru Mountains. The climate is subtropical and allows the production of a wide range of horti-cultural crops, i.e., cabbage, cauli- flower, peas, lettuce, parsley, leeks and deciduous fruits (peaches and plums). UMADEP has been in operation in the Mgeta and Mkuyuni Divisions since 1993 with the overall aim of improvingthe agricultural productivity and the general socio-economic conditions of the small-scale farmers in the projectarea. The project works as an inte- grated agricultural development project using multidisciplinary ap-proaches and is implemented with a collaborative effort between govern- ment and donor agencies. The Agricul-tural Officers in charge of crop develop- ment activities have already under- taken several micro-research projectson NCP involving the use of botanical pesticides; trap crops and organic fertilisers on the UMADEP demonstra-tion plots and subsequently replicated in farmer's managed plots. Before the introduction of industrial inputs, the farmers in Mgeta depended solely on NCP, utilising parts of certain indigenous plants prepared in variousforms for crop protection and against animal diseases. After the introduction of agro-chemicals, farmers rapidlyThis article was written by A.H. Mgumia, Assistant Coordinator for the Uluguru Mountains Agricultural Development Project (UMADEP), P.O. Box 3094, Morogoro, Tanzania. For details email: Umadep@mail.Suanet.Ac.Tz182IK Notes Number 34 abandoned the traditional ways of controlling insect pests and diseases and opted for industrial agro-chemicals. Their reasons were many: the government gave subsidies for farminputs including agro-chemicals; chemical pesticides re- quire less time for preparation and application; the chemi- cals proved more effective than botanical pesticides, and thecompanies producing and trading agro-chemicals advertised and marketed them aggressively. However, the government has now stopped subsides on agricultural inputs and the cost of agro-chemicals is very high. Furthermore, due to ongoing campaigns on environ- mental conservation, farmers in Mgeta, like other parts ofTanzania, are becoming more aware of the hazardous ef- fects of industrial agro-chemicals. In collaboration with government extension staff in the area, UMADEP initiated efforts to encourage farmers to go back to NCP. Since indigenous knowledge on NCP has started to disappear from farming communities, the indig-enous plants that provide the raw materials for NCP have lost their value and are also disappearing. The first inter- vention by UMADEP was to campaign for the safe use ofchemical pesticides while encouraging farmers to research for more effective botanical pesticides through farmer-man- aged trials. Most farmers involved in these kinds of research were members of farmers' groups known as Ujuzi asili from Tchenzema Ward, who devoted a portion of their land toproduce organic vegetables. This is because they own enough land and either have knowledge on NCP themselves or have access to local knowledge on the uses of botanicalpesticides through the elders. UMADEP, using demonstration plots located in the vil- lage, also conducted experiments simultaneously with farm-ers. UMADEP staff also helped farmers to organize and monitor the results. Farmers were trained on how to com- pare traditional and new methods of pest management anddata collection. In Mgeta, as in many other parts of Tanzania, extension personnel are trained to encourage farmers to reduce theuse of industrial agro-chemicals due to their adverse effects on human health and the environment. However, it is hard for them to do so since knowledge of NCP is limited to only afew members of the community and also because the com- munities have no alternatives. Moreover, most farmers be- lieve that the botanical pesticides are there to be used by oldpeople and farmers who cannot afford chemicals, not by the young and better-off farmers. This reluctance to use botani- cal pesticides is a key factor in reducing the spread of natu-ral crop protection practices.Steps and approaches In order to effectively communicate the message about NCP to communities, UMADEP developed visual materials(posters, booklets and leaflets) with very simple instruc- tions about the use of botanicals and with illustrations done in a comic book style. The materials were drawn and cre-ated by a local artist whose objective was to make them rel- evant and attractive to local tastes. The following are the steps and approaches which were used for the production ofposters relating to the use of botanical pesticides in Mgeta division. (i) Accessing the know-how of the innovation Because the use of local visual educational materials is not very common in Mgeta, UMADEP organised a workshopwhere farmers who are experts on botanical pesticides met with the artist, project staff and extension officers. The aim of the workshop was to increase the understanding of thetwo distinctively different inputs that are needed for the vi- sual material, i.e., the indigenous knowledge about the bo- tanical pesticide and the artistic creativity that makes theinformation interesting. A two-day residential workshop was organised whereby farmer experts were invited from six villages within MgetaDivision. During the workshop, the farmer experts pre- sented their experiences and research findings regarding the use of botanicals in crop protection. Based on this infor-mation, UMADEP staff decided to focus on disseminating information about the two most familiar plants regarding which the majority of farmers had confidence in their effec-tiveness in controlling insect pests. (ii) Defining communication needs The main issues which were proposed to be documented for community consumption included: plant description and habitats, propagation techniques, preparation and applica-tion, insect pest control and management, and how the plants can be used for soil and water conservation as well as improvement of soil fertility. The propagation techniques were emphasised because, for example, kibembeni (local plant species corresponding to the Buddleia species) can only be found in the forest reserve which is about 5kilometres from the residential areas. Therefore, to increase availability, these plants need to be planted within the field. (iii) Targeting the audience For the purpose of sharing information and popularizing the use of botanical pesticides, workshop participants rec-ommended that the educational materials developed should183 be mainly targeted to young farmers. This is because young farmers are the most reluctant to use NCP and because there is a communication barrier in the use of NCP betweenthe older and young farmers. Furthermore, the participants suggested that the project arrange a field visit for the artist to see and be able to visualise the working places, field toolsand equipment and the habitat of the selected plants in typi- cal local settings. (iv) Visualisation and production of artwork The artist visited a few of the farmers who had participated in the workshop. During the visits, the artist got a good ideaabout the habitat of the plants, the local names of plants and insect pests, and their damage to crops. He also studied how the farmers prepared and applied the botanical pesti-cides and the tools they worked with in order to render this information in the drawings. After the field work, the artist developed a draft of six posters describing and explainingthe use of two selected plants. (v) Field testing Before the final production of the posters, the artist, to- gether with extension and UMADEP staff conducted field- testing for the posters with the representative farmers fromthe community. This was intended to ascertain: \u007f Whether the farmers had understood the posters and the contents. \u007f The farmers ability to identify with the drawings, the situation, the problem and solutions, and the character (age and gender relationship). This helped to determinewhether or not the visual representation of the informa- tion and the problems was realistic. (vi) Farmer-to-farmer dissemination Since the posters carried only abstract information about the use of botanical pesticides, project staff thought that thebest teachers and disseminators of information in the edu- cational campaign would be the farmer experts themselves. Using them in dissemination workshops would give themthe opportunity to explain in detail their experiences with botanical pesticides to their fellow farmers. Allowing farm- ers to share their practical experiences with other farmerswould also help to increase trust and confidence in the use of botanical pesticides by the younger and better-off farm- ers. To achieve this, UMADEP staff organised a planningworkshop to define the roles and responsibilities of the farmers and the extension staff in the education campaign.For the purpose of reaching as many farmers as possible, it was agreed that seminars should be organised at the sub- village level and in primary schools. The posters should beplaced in public areas such as markets, in the village gov- ernment offices and in the beer shops. The farmer experts volunteered to conduct seminars for other farmers withsome help from the project, especially for organising the au- diences and meeting other logistical needs. Farmer partici- pants (volunteers) from each village were allocated a fewsub villages near where they lived, where they would train their fellow farmers using posters already developed as a guide. Lessons learned \u007f Testing of the posters or training materials permits cru- cial and valuable feedback from audiences for improvingthe materials before final production. \u007f Involvement of the target audience from the initial plan- ning of educational materials builds a sense of ownershipof the materials. The end-user then values the educa- tional material more and is therefore more likely to use the information and share it. \u007f Farmers are much more interested in issues that they im- mediately recognise as being part of their local situation. Therefore, the use of local artists is crucial as well as us-ing drawings that fully reflect local people, images, tools, activities, responses and environment. \u007f Dissemination of the local knowledge about indigenous plants using modern methods such as printed posters added value to the knowledge and indigenous plants in- volved. Consequently, it promotes the conservation andmultiplication of indigenous plants. It also stimulates farmers to research and develop other local knowledge re- lated to agricultural production. \u007f The partnership of farmers with UMADEP helped the farmers to obtain quantitative proof of the economic vi- ability of their Natural Crop Protection practices. It alsoimproved their skills in carrying out experiments de- signed to develop a farming system adapted to their condi- tions, needs and objectives. Further, farmers participatingin farmer-to-farmer dissemination workshops are able to develop their communication skills and abilities.184IK Notes 35 August 2001Traditional Medicine and the Bridgeto Better Health For more information, please e-mail John Lambert at: Jlambert@worldbank.org In Sub-Saharan Africa, thousands of kilograms of medicinal plants and/or their parts are collected and used everyday by mothers in the home, traditional healers, 1 livestock owners and pastoralists. For more than 500 millionpeople and hundreds of millions of live- stock they are the only readily available and affordable source of human andlivestock healthcare. However, the loss of 5.5 million hectares of resource lands every year due to deforestation, cultiva-tion, over-grazing, burning, erosion, etc. severely decreases this supply. Medicines, foods and other natural re-source products that have sustained ru- ral people for centuries are now seri- ously threatened and many potentialmedicinal plant species may be lost for- ever. This increasing scarcity of medici- nal plant species represents a trendthat should be immediately addressed. The majority of Ethiopians depend on medicinal plants as their only sourceof health care, especially in rural areas where access to villages is lacking due to the absence of vehicular roads. Mod-ern health care through the construc- tion of new hospitals and upgrading of existing hospitals, health centers andhealth posts, imported drug supplies and training of doctors and nurses is of little value at the present time to themajority of the rural population (in ex- cess of 40 million people). Medicinal plants and knowledge of their use pro-vide a vital contribution to human and livestock health care needs throughout the country. The plants are generallyreadily available, have minimal side-ef- fects and are free and/or affordable. They are an important component ofthe agricultural and environmental sectors and have the potential to make major contributions to both macro andeconomic growth and rural poverty re- duction in the country. Environmental degradation, deforestation, agricul-tural expansion, over-harvesting and population growth are principal threats to medicinal plants in the coun-try. The loss from plant extinctions could result in significant socio-eco- nomic loss to Ethiopia and could be ofglobal significance. At present in Sub-Saharan Africa, there are no country-wide quantitativedata available on the supply of, or con- sumer demand for, medicinal plants and on economic benefits derived bythe use of medicinal plants and their contribution to health care. Similarly, most collectors/producers and end us-ers are unaware of the extent to which the expanding demand in medicinal plants is threatening the survival of anEthiopia185 increasing number of medicinal plant species. The prices paid to collectors tend to be very low, and resources are fre- quently open-access or common property. As a result, com-mercial plant gatherers often \"mine\" the resources rather than managing them. The health and drug policies of the Ethiopian Ministry of Health recognize the important role medicinal plants and traditional health systems play in health care. Unfortu- nately, little has been done in recent decades to enhance anddevelop the beneficial aspects of traditional medicine in- cluding related research and its gradual integration into modern medicine. Despite Ethiopia's commitment to thehealth sector, its ability to provide increased resources for the study and sustainable use of medicinal plants has been limited. In most African countries, and Ethiopia is no exception, there is a cadre of highly-trained professionals whose tal- ents and expertise in the field of plant chemistry, pharma-cognosy, pharmacology, natural resource management, and the industrial utilization of medicinal plant-based products are underutilized. These professionals acknowledge theirindebtedness to traditional healers and birth attendants and the need to work together to establish processes to manage and validate traditional medicines. At present, bothlevels of knowledge capital (traditional and scientifically- based) are underutilized. The increasing demand by the industrial countries for herbal remedies has put increasing pressure on the supply of raw materials available in developing countries. Ethiopia is particularly conscious of the loss of its genetic resources,especially in this case where such resources are the primary, if not only, source of healthcare for the rural and urban poor populations. By developing national Pharmacopoeia, gov-ernments will initiate a process to formalize processes for the extraction, standardization, safety and efficacy, and dos- age and formulation of phytomedicines. The formal integra-tion of traditional and western medicine systems will build upon an ancient and acceptable cultural heritage, give strength to biodiversity conservation and management pro-grams and provide a level of health care to all citizens that will be reflected in future social and economic prosperity. After a somewhat circuitous development passage, the Ethiopian government, with World Bank assistance, will soon start to implement the first conservation and sustain- able use of medicinal plants project in Sub-Saharan Africa.The overall objective of the project is to initiate support for conservation, management and sustainable use of medici- nal plants for human and livestock health care. Theproject's specific objectives are to: (i) strengthen institu- tional capacity; (ii) confirm and document selected com-monly-used medicinal plants for the treatment of three ma- jor human diseases (tapeworm infections, bronchopneumo- nia, hypertension) and three livestock diseases (tapeworminfections, mastitis, dermatophilosis); (iii) initiate studies for the safe utilization of effective medicinal plant remedies for these three major human diseases and three livestockdiseases; (iv) assess the economic benefits derived from me- dicinal plants in human and livestock healthcare on a na- tional level; (v) develop a national medicinal plant database;and (vi) support in situ conservation and management and initiate ex situ cultivation of medicinal plants in the Bale Mountains National Park area. Project funding will be both credit and grant. The credit will support: development of a national database of medici- nal plants; assessment of current levels of usage and eco-nomic benefits derived in the country from the use of me- dicinal plants; training and institutional strengthening; de- velopment of Intellectual Property rights guidelines forsharing traditional medicinal knowledge; determining safety and efficacy of plant remedies used to treat three ma- jor human diseases and three major livestock diseases; initi-ating studies of propagation and cultivation methods for se- lected medicinal plants; and project implementation, moni- toring and evaluation. Grant funds will support biodiversityconservation and sustainable management of in situ medici- nal plant resources in and around the Bale Mountains Na- tional Park as a means of reducing harvesting pressure onwild plants. The grant will also cover the costs of education and mass awareness campaigns, local training, and pilot farmer-based cultivation trials of selected threatened me-dicinal plants in home and community gardens and bound- ary and buffer zones of the national park. The lead agency and collaborating agencies, institutes and communities areidentified in Figure 1. Recommendations for using traditional plant-based rem- edies in primary health care programs will carry weightonly through studies that establish their credibility and il- lustrate their safety. The use of such remedies over a long period of time may provide important information on phar-macological effects in humans and livestock of particular groups of chemical compounds \u2014 information not usually available when testing a new synthetic drug. Testing re-quirements formulated by regulatory authorities to ensure safety of \"new\" drugs are not necessarily applicable to tradi- tional remedies. A more limited range of pre-clinical toxico-logical tests may be adequate. Medicinal plants and knowledge of their use are a thread that links education and knowledge institutions, health andpopulation issues, sustainable development, environmental and cultural issues, gender, and rural, urban and private186IK Notes Number Ethiopia conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants lead agency and contributing institutes, agencies and communities Lead agency Institute of Biodiversity and Conservation Research (IBCR) Conservation Scientific validation Human healthcare School of Pharmacy, AAU Department of Drug Research (DDR), MOH Healers/Birth Attendants Livestock healthcare Faculty of Veterinary Medicine , AAU.

Located in the horn of Africa, Eritrea comprises six regions and over nine dis- culture and traditionalpractices. While indigenous knowledge (IK) is embedded in community practices, in-stitutions, relationships and rituals, it is often difficult to discern due to its tacit nature. With the rapid increase inglobalization, many countries and de- velopment organizations have recently recognized the threat of losing IK andare putting together initiatives aimed at the preservation and revitalization of this valuable resource. In 1982, a group of Eritreans orga- nized themselves and launched a scheme to identify and document theirlocal knowledge. The objective of the twenty-year effort was to identify and understand the IK of the Eritreanpeoples in a socio-economic context. It attempted to examine the socio-cul- tural and economic activities of each ofthe nine different ethnic nationalities in Eritrea beginning with the origins of Eritrean society through colonial timesto the current period. In this process, the purpose was to study the cultures and traditional practices of the ethnicnationalities and capture, categorizeand document these for subsequent preservation and publication. What is notable is that funding for this IK ini-tiative was provided by the Public Ad- ministration Department till 1990 and by the Ministry of Local Governmentfrom 1995 onwards. This initiative was conceived as being carried out in two phases, of which onlythe first has seen significant progress : \u007f Phase I-Collection of IK information \u007f Phase II-Detailed validation and analysis Collection framework The collection of indigenous knowledge revolved around the following steps : 1.Group IK into categories such as\u2014 land use, farming, astrology, culturalrituals, traditional medicine, family, etc. 2.Select a target culture\u2014by region and/or ethnic group; identify IK bearers within 3.Collect IK\u2014use questionnaires, panel discussions etc. 4.Validate\u2014cross-check across panels, field visits 5.Record and store by category on the computer 6.Publish\u2014delineate into public and private information; publish public IK in print (encyclopedia)Eritrea188IK Notes Number 36 The Eritrean IK collection methodology focused on the study of one ethnic nationality at a time. The entire process of IK collection from one ethnic nationality took betweeneighteen months to two years. The entire IK collection pro- cess was conducted in four stages. Stage 1 The first step was to determine the region that this ethnic nationality inhabited. A pilot study of some of the areas inthat region was conducted to gather general knowledge about that area, its peoples and traditions. The next step was to conduct several interviews with the district and localadministrators, surrounding communities and village el- ders to pinpoint where the IK collection process would be focused. On the basis of the preceding discussions, the semi-structured questionnaire was modified or refined. This questionnaire was used as a survey instrument to help iden- tify the important items of IK and the important bearers ofthis knowledge within each ethnic nationality. Stage 2 The second stage is significant because it helped determine the number of people who were most knowledgeable within the ethnic nationality about its culture and traditional prac-tices. The survey results (from the questionnaire) as well as the preceding interviews in Stage 1 identified this core group, which normally numbered between twenty to thirtypeople. Most of this core group are Elders, who have tradi- tionally been the holders of this indigenous knowledge. The next step was to agree upon a time and place to convene allthese persons for an extended period of time (fifty to sixty days) to enable the IK collection process to move forward . Stage 3 Panel discussions comprised the cornerstone of the third stage of the IK collection process. The selected bearers ofknowledge were divided into three or four different groups and panel discussions were conducted within each group for periods that normally lasted around sixty days. These werefocused, intense discussions and the participants were pro- vided boarding and lodging (in addition to a nominal per- diem to compensate for loss of income) during this entireperiod. The objective of this stage was to assess the credibil- ity of data, look for contradictions and finally to cross-check the information gathered from one group with informationfrom other groups. Stage 4 The final stage in the IK collection process was to carry out field visits to substantiate information gathered during thepreceding stages. In this process, the IK collection team met with actual practitioners and the wider population within the ethnic groups in their actual real world settings. Thepurpose of these meetings was to expose each IK collection team member to the indigenous experience to enable data validation and further re-checking. If some questions hadnot been fully answered during the panel discussions stage, efforts were made to replace or add new members to the se- lected groups at this stage with a view to get adequate re-sponses. Constraints In the twenty years of its existence, the IK collection team went through several crises \u00afboth social and political. The war of independence, conflict with Ethiopia, famine, the HIV/AIDS crisis and budgetary pressures have all had somebearing on the pace of collection and analysis of the IK pro- cess. The semi-structured questionnaire (which is the initial information gathering tool) is a living document and haschanged constantly, the last revision being made in 1998. Eritrean society has slowly been changing while the experi- ence of the IK collection team grew during the same period.An astonishing aspect in this entire twenty-year endeavor has been the strong desire by the Elders (bearers of knowl- edge within the different ethnic nationalities) to preserveand revitalize their culture and traditions for transmission to the younger generation. Contrary to normal assump- tions, it was the Elders who never gave up. Their keennessand perseverance was instrumental in keeping the lengthy IK Collection process going. Impact IK collected over the last twenty years is mainly in the form of volumes of a raw data format. However, some sections of Eritrean society have managed to access parts of this collec-tion in an isolated and sporadic manner, resulting in an indi- rect impact. Examples of usage and indirect benefits in- clude:\u007f Asmara University faculty and students have referred to this IK collection in pursuit of their theses \u007f The Ministry of Education has referred to it for tradi- tional education and preparation of cultural messages aimed at ethnic groups \u007f The Ministry of Health has referred to it for traditional post-natal care and exercises, child birth practices, treat- ment for 1-5 year old children189 \u007f The Ministry of Justice has referred to it for rich custom- ary law, use of Elders and the exercise of traditional meth- ods to resolve conflicts within communities \u007f The Ministry of Local Government has used some of this IK to help delineate the regions and organize the con- cerned peoples. Challenges ahead The first phase of the project has been completed. Several challenges remain\u2014both in the consolidated analysis of the vast amounts of data that has been collected and also in the usage of the output that is expected to be derived from theabove. These challenges include the following: \u007f The transfer of IK to the younger generation is slow for a variety of reasons such as the movement of the youngergeneration to urban areas in search of employment, in- creasing the influence on them of western society and val- ues and globalization \u007f IK gatherers are mainly liberation activists with a lot of experience but little formal training in the theory of analysis and presentation of the results \u007f The expected studies have not gone forward as fast as ex- pected due to a variety of reasons such as the lack of fiscal resources, outdated equipment, intervening conflict etc. \u007f The IK data collected have not been adequately coded, in- dexed and are often in a crude form \u007f Some of the data (specially from Tigrigna nationality) are in the vernacular text and have yet to be translated into English.Next steps Of the nine people who started this IK collection initiative nearly two decades ago, only four are still associated withthis effort. Having spent a large part of their working lives on it, they are keen that the output from this extensive IK exercise be professionally analyzed and presented for thebenefit of the Eritrean people. Eritrea has spent around 1.5 million Nakfa (approximately US$190,000 without account- ing for inflation and using an average of 8 Nafka to a USdollar) to date (since independence in 1991) on this initia- tive and over 30,000 pages of data are available that needs to be examined. The immediate needed next steps are:\u007f Funding for and assistance from a multi-disciplinary group (comprising of anthropologists and other special- ists) to validate and analyze the raw data collected to date \u007f Appropriate training for the IK collection team in an ac- credited university abroad (preferably for a year or so) to enable them to speak/understand the multi-disciplinaryteam's language (in terms of concepts and jargon), thus facilitating meaningful and effective interaction \u007f The involvement of Eritrean academia in this IK effort so that specialized knowledge about the IK collection is passed on from the remaining four staff to them. This en- tails the provision of appropriate exposure while buildingcapacity and interest in IK within the country The ultimate beneficiaries of this IK initiative will be the rural populations of the nine ethnic nationalities whose way of life, subsistence activities, and cultural institutions will be more transparent to the organizations that assist themwith services and participate in their development. Indig- enous knowledge and practices gleaned from this initiative will not only provide a context for developmental activitiesbut also help in their preservation and revitalization.190This article was written by Maja Naur, Ph.D. in sociology, and consultant to the World Bank.

This seems to put the Charter to thetest. Although several western phar- maceutical companies have lowered ex- penses for HIV/AIDS retroviral treat-ment, these medicines are still beyond the reach of most Africans. And even if medicine was provided free of charge,countries in Sub-Saharan Africa lack the medical infrastructure to distribute the medicine, and it is doubtful ifhealth systems can be expanded at the speed and quality required. Finally there is a high risk that the resourcesallocated to fight the disease will not be fully accessed by the beneficiaries for whom it was intended. The focus hereis, therefore, on how traditional healers and indigenous knowledge can em- power communities to deal with the so-cial consequences of the pandemic, and, at the same time, be able to ensure that government resources are actually be-ing used to their benefit. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan asked recently for an addition of $7 bil-lion to $10 billion per year as a mini- mum transfer from rich countries to Africa to fight HIV/AIDS. But some ex-perts in the region says that even such sums will have little impact until Afri- can nations build up their health sys-tems to administer the drugs and moni- tor the health of those receiving them. The formal health care system onlyreaches 10 to 20 percent of the people, and those mainly in urban centers at hospitals and clinics. Traditional heal-ers provide primary health care for 80 percent of the population and live in the communities where help is needed;they are the ones who today treat many patients for HIV/AIDS-related dis- eases. Some healers have already beensuccessful in extending the lives of pa- tients with HIV/AIDS using medicines they from locally grown medicinalplants. A good example is the work be- ing done near Tanga in Tanzania. Should Western medicine finally be- come available at affordable rates to poor communities, traditional healers could be the ones to distribute the191 medicine and ensure that patients take the right doses. While traditional healers will need to be educated to do this, it will be less expensive to upgrade their knowledge than toexpand the formal health system. Building on existing sys- tems seems to have a higher chance of sustainability. HIV/AIDS does not respect boundaries of class, culture or race, but lack of knowledge and misconception on how the disease is transmitted from one person to another often re- sult in human rights violations by exclusion or isolation ofindividuals and families with HIV/AIDS. And the social ef- fects affect the poor the most. Many communities have be- come aware that HIV/AIDS is transmitted via blood andsexual intercourse, but there is also a widespread miscon- ception that transmission occurs by shaking hands, eating or bathing together, wearing the same clothes, using thesame tools, or for children sleeping in the same bed. Educa- tion and information on how HIV/AIDS is being transmit- ted has so far been the core initiative in fighting the disease.Little attention has been directed towards lifting the social stigma related to the pandemic in spite of the fact that \"what we cannot speak about we can do nothing about.\" In-dividual and social empowerment is essential for communi- ties to handle the challenge, which is mainly left to them in the HIV/AIDS crisis. Moreover, when resources for theWorld Bank-assisted Multisector Aids Program (MAP) ini- tiatives begin to flow, communities should be empowered to access and monitor resources intended for them. A very use-ful tool of empowerment was applied in the transitional pe- riod from apartheid up to the election in South Africa where NGOs and civil rights organizations managed to mobilizecommunities all over the country. The campaign was the largest ever undertaken anywhere at the time. The method was rooted in the facilitation of communities to create theirown human rights charter based on democracy and respect for individuals of all races (Dorsey 1997). The idea was based on Paulo Freire's democratic proposals of problem-solving education where \"men and women develop their power to perceive critically the way they exist in the world with which and in which they find themselves; they come tosee the world not as a static reality but as a reality in the process of transformation\" (Freire 2000). To apply the successful experience of social mobilization in the fight against HIV/AIDS, a mini epidemiological study has to be undertaken by community members and for the community. Traditional healers (especially women healers) could be key facilitators in this process. What is important in community-managed research is the process its members go through, which differs fundamentally from a social as-sessment in which data collection is the most important.The process of community-managed research could be fa- cilitated, apart from the traditional healers, by a local NGO/ CBO to balance any attempt by local elites to dominate theprocess. Among the issues to be dealt with are the following: \u007f Where does the community think HIV/AIDS comes from? \u007f How does a person get the disease?\u007f Are there particular places where the risk for getting the disease is high? \u007f Are there many community members who often go to these places? \u007f Are there particular groups at high risk? \u007f Who in the community are seriously ill?\u007f What occupation did the ill persons have at the time they became ill? \u007f Has there been change in the person(s)' occupation since they became ill? \u007f How have the symptoms developed over time? \u007f Who did they contact when they first fell ill?\u007f Did they get some medical help and where did they get it? \u007f Has their social conditions changed after they became ill and how has it changed? \u007f What happens to a family (socially and economically) that has a member with HIV/AIDS? \u007f What initiatives have been taken by the community, by the government, or by the municipality/district in relation to the HIV/AIDS pandemic? \u007f Is anybody aware of resources for which the community can apply in order to fight HIV/AIDS? The aim of such community research is: (i) to begin a pro- cess within the community to focus on HIV/AIDS, so as to enable people to talk about the disease; (ii) to increaseawareness that the disease is not an abstract phenomenon talked about on the radio but something concerning mem- bers of their own community; (iii) to get personal storieswhich may help others in the same situation; (iv) to raise awareness among risk groups; (v) to make the disease be- come a concern for the community\u2014e.g., on how the diseasecan be prevented and how the patients and their families in- cluding orphans can be helped; and, finally and very impor- tant, (vi) facilitate the community to formulate their own Bill of Rights . Each Community Bill of Rights will have unique features depending on the particular local condi- tions. But what the communities have agreed upon they willalso be eager to enforce and to install social sanctions against those who violate what is in the best interest of the community as a whole.192IK Notes Number \"Charter Making and Participatory Research\" by Ellen Dorsey in Human Rights Education for the Twenty-First Century edited by George J.

Literacy andnonformal education programs throughout the region are giving a measure of public \"voice\"\u2014at least atthe local level\u2014to community groups and associations that had none before. But they often run into one consider-able obstacle: the lack of literature for new literates in the languages of in- struction. The problem is beginning to be re- solved among Senegalese speakers of the Fulani or Pulaar language in some instructive ways. This article presents briefly the experience of ARED (Associ- ates in Research and Education for De-velopment) and CERFLA ( Centre d'Etudes pour For- mation en Langues Africaines ), two closely linked non-profit organizations operating in Pulaar-speaking regions of the country, which have been workingover the last twelve years to sustain popular literacy in the language.ARED now manages a publishing venture that sells between 30,000 and 50,000 volumes of literature ever year,predominantly in Senegalese lan- guages. The books are principally dis- tributed in Senegal, and their continu-ing publication is 75 percent funded by the proceeds of book sales themselves. ARED is also increasingly active intraining (CERFLA was founded to de- velop the organization's training voca- tion) and in local knowledge cultiva-tion. How has it succeeded and what are the lessons of this experience in \"adding sinew to local knowledge?\" The cultural context The Pulaar culture constitutes the largest minority community in Sene-gal. Nearly a third of the country's 9 million inhabitants speak Pulaar, sec- ond only to those conversant in the ma-jority African language of the country, Wolof. Across West Africa, from Sene- gal to northern Cameroon, speakers ofPulaar and related Fulani languages number over 25 million, nowhere in the national majority but predominant in anumber of subnational regions. The Fulani are an ancient herding and, therefore, largely nomadic people, per-Senegal194IK Notes Number 38 haps of Egyptian origins in prehistoric times, who spread across the savanna regions of central and western Africa and became sedentarized in certain areas through religiousconversion and political conquest. They have also emigrated to a number of other countries of Africa and many cities of Europe, the Middle East and South Asia. Starting in the late 1950s, this experience of strong cul- tural tradition and minority status gave birth to a cultural revitalization. In 1958 a Senegaleese Pulaar speaker whohad been living in Cairo for twenty years published a novel in the Pulaar language\u2014 Ndikkiri Joom Moolo , a Guitarist\"\u2014written as an exer-cise in remembering his homeland. It was the story\u2014at turns nostalgic, irreverent and hilarious\u2014of a Pulaar anti- hero who abandoned hearth and home to take up a succes-sion of careers as performing artist, religious cleric and fi- nally charismatic leader, recurrently pursued by political authorities but triumphing and restored to his culture andfamily in the end. The author chose to write in a Latinized transcription of the language rather than the existing \"ajami\" or Arabic-based transcription, already in restricteduse for many years among the religious elite. Though rife with typographical errors that the Egyptian proofreaders obviously could not catch, the book graduallyacquired a cult readership throughout the Pulaar diaspora. One early reader, who later became an editor of Pulaar-lan- guage materials, recounts the effect the book had on him.He found himself devouring the novel outside his residence at three in the morning so that his roommates could sleep. I would sit on the sidewalk reading from Ndikkiri. With each page, I could barely keep from laughing out loud as I sat alone in the street. ... The next day, I would entertain my friends with stories from Ndikkiri while we drank teatogether. In the end, all of my friends who were literate in Pulaar could hardly wait [to read] the book... The birth of a movement This sort of enthusiasm helped give birth to a movement of Pulaar literacy and cultural renewal among those living in the Near East. From there, the initiative spread to Franceand in 1982 came home to Senegal in the form of the Asso- ciation pour la Renaissance du Poular (ARP) , an organiza- tion uniting overseas Pulaar-speakers with others living inurban areas of Senegal who wished their children to be more familiar with their own culture. In the years following, ARP\u2014spurred in part by the spread of African language literacy programs and in part by the threat of the adoption of Wolof as official lingua franca for the country\u2014turned its energies to promoting local lit-eracy classes in Pulaar in Senegal itself. Hundreds such classes were created over the next five years\u2014classes spon- sored by government agencies or official developmentprojects as well as a mass of others initiated by local commu- nities themselves. Standards were typically low, however; writing systems used were extremely various; and follow-upliterature was very scarce. But the enthusiasm was real and the initiative was passionately homegrown. In an effort to remedy the perceived weaknesses of the campaign, a group of Pulaar authors created in 1989 a Groupe d'Initiative pour la Promotion des Livres en Langue Nationale (\"Group for Initiatives to Promote Books in Na- tional Languages\" or GIPLLN) to draw together existing texts and facilitate their distribution to literacy classes. The instinct was good, but the initiative proved more ambitiousthan a team of authors could manage by themselves. Opera- tions were consequently transferred the following year to a new nonprofit association registered in the United States,ARED. GIPLLN members constituted much of the Board, but technically-skilled Senegalese and an American re- searcher married to a Pulaar speaker were brought in as theassociation's executive personnel. ARED set about repro- ducing the stock of Pulaar-language texts available and de- veloping others, essentially as a service to the new literacycenters. Unexpected success The undertaking succeeded to a much greater extent than its promoters had anticipated. The combination of literacy courses, an increasingly self-aware diaspora community, and the growth of NGOs concerned with developing betteravenues of dissemination and contact with Pulaar-speaking populations offered a growing, if initially modest, \"market\" for such publications. The numbers of volumes sold annu-ally expanded from 6,000 in 1988 to 41,000 in 2000, and titles published from a handful to over 150. Fully 95 percent of sales were to clients in Senegal. Prices were set to coverproduction costs and afford resellers a potential 25 percent margin of profit. \"Resellers\" in fact included none of the major bookstores in the country, which did not\u2014and still do not\u2014deal in Afri- can language literature. ARED counts instead on small merchants and entrepreneurs who see the interest of theirtexts for local readers and buy a few dozen to resell. Their favorite story in this regard concerns a young man who walked from Kayes (in neighboring Mali) to Dakar, the capi-tal of Senegal, behind a large herd of cattle. He sold his live- stock on the urban market and showed up at ARED offices with a good part of his take: over 1,000,000 West African195 francs (about $1,500). The money was already earmarked to buy Pulaar-language publications for resale in the Kayes re- gion, volumes ordered ahead of time by local merchantsthere. The young man carried away a minor library to the train station, confident of a good profit on his return home. A rich palette of publications Through the end of calendar year 2000, ARED and its pre- decessor, GILLPIN, had disseminated 350,000 copies of their publications, representing 168 different titles, 85 ofthem written in Pulaar or translated into it, and the rest in other Senegalese languages, including French. This mass of literature can be broken down in at least two informativeways\u00afby topic area and by source. Materials cover the fol- lowing basic topic areas: \u007fLiteracy and numeracy manuals (seven titles published in calendar year 2000, two of them new) \u007fNovels, stories and other creative literature (one new title last year) \u007fInformation on development and civil society (six titles published in 2000, two of them new) \u007fTreatises on indigenous knowledge and traditional or re- ligious practices (three titles, two new) \u007fInstructional texts for management capacity building (one new publication). Four different sources have been used for the written ma- terial. The first is texts\u2014mostly creative or religious\u2014authored by the founding members of GILLPIN and ARED themselves. Second come materials developed and written by ARED staff, principally its series of basic literacy train-ing manuals, The third category comprises new books devel- oped by staff, or existing publications translated into a Senegalese language by them, at the request of some out-side donor. Publications of this nature include everything from agricultural extension manuals to a Pulaar version of L'Aventure Ambigu\u00eb , the renowned work of Senegalese nov- elist Cheikh Amadou Kane, translated under his personal direction. Interestingly, in both cases cited, ARED staff and resellers have testimonies from readers among the civil ser-vant and University student population who admit they never fully understood the material before seeing the Pulaar version. Last but not least, except numerically, come unsolicited manuscripts submitted by free-lance authors. Such submis- sions have until recently been quite rare, in part becauseARED had not worked out clear contracting and remunera- tion norms for free-lance authors. These problems have nowbeen resolved, however: published authors receive 10 per- cent of proceeds from sales of their books in two install- ments. Moreover, the organization has decided in its mostrecent general assembly to systematically encourage free- lance submissions in order to foster broader local author- ship of publications; and the total number of such workshaving appeared in print has now risen to six. Fiscal policies ARED does not distribute its books free of charge, but rather tries to set prices at a level that covers cost of produc- tion plus a commission for the potential resellers while re- maining relatively affordable in Senegalese terms. Mosttitles currently cost the equivalent of $1.50. Some are subsi- dized by outside donors, like NGOs interested in using lit- eracy manuals or commissioning documents on develop-ment themes, or bilateral agencies wishing to produce ex- tension material for projects they fund. Others are under- written by ARED's own \"investment funds,\" or the savingsthey have realized from their diverse training and publica- tion endeavors over the years. In toto , ARED now covers 75 percent of the cost of its publishing through book sales andanother 25 percent through subsidized support and its own investment funds, making it the nearest things to a self- funding source of African language publications infrancophone West Africa. During the latter years of the last decade, the organization's revenues were greatly strengthened by twoclients. The first was foreign-aid supported government lit- eracy programs that, under Senegal's faire faire or decen- tralized service provision strategy, funded a variety of NGOsto carry out their own local literacy efforts and authorized them to purchase manuals and texts from publishing ven- tures like ARED that had developed certifiably effectivematerials. On the strength of these orders, for example, the number of basic literacy books in Pulaar sold surged from just under 9,000 in 1995 to over 40,000. The second sourcewas major support from Lutheran World Relief (LWR) throughout the early and middle years of the decade, both for training local associations and for the development andpublication of a variety of written materials. Forty-seven of the latter were funded entirely or in part by LWR. Its sup- port was sharply curtailed starting in 1998, however, due toproblems that the organization was experiencing in its own fund raising. ARED was forced to downsize its staff, consoli- date its operations, and concentrate efforts on areas of de-mand likely to produce new business. The effort has appar- ently been a success. In calendar year 2000, ARED produced196IK Notes Number 12 new titles and CERFLA carried out 26 new training ses- sions, while the total numbers of books sold rebounded from a low of 23,000 in the year following reduction in its majorunderwriting to 41,000. Lessons learned What are the lessons of the ARED experience? For one, the story of ARED makes it clear that\u2014at least under the condi- tions in Senegal that the association has faced over the last two decades\u2014it is possible to develop a nonprofit businessand publishing firm devoted to African language literacy and to the dissemination of indigenous knowledge. There are workable formulas that rely essentially on local salesand service receipts (though partly provided through the NGO and aid funding network), without major underwrit- ing from donor agencies. ARED has survived this transitionand managed to continue growing. Several non-financial factors have played a critical role, however, in the association's success:\u007f ARED and CERFLA are as much \"movement\" as non- profit business. The contributions of a certain number of political ringleaders from within the Pulaarophone commu-nity, both in the diaspora and locally in Senegal, have been critical to their maturation and growth.\u007f An ability to read the signs of the times and discern devel- opmental \"niches\" for African-language publications and literacy development has also been essential. Much in thecurrent spirit of decentralization, local empowerment and cultural renewal lends itself to making the formula work, but a bit of entrepreneurial spirit and acumen is required tocapitalize on it. \u007f Good institutional backup for accounting and manage- ment have also been critical. ARED benefits from a systemand a track record for resource management and from its status as a US-, as well as Senegal-, registered association. \u007f Ironically, perhaps, aspects of the information revolutionhave simplified and supported the task of publishing in Afri- can languages. Computers can handle the specialized fonts for language-specific sounds that posed big obstacles in thetypewriter age, desk-top publishing makes local document design and production a relative snap, and e-mail tightens networks among far-flung allies. Recognizing a disappearing resource To these factors should be added both the minority status and the particular resilience of the Pulaar community,which has lent to the endeavor a certain aura of \"sacred cause.\" Nothing frames the value of indigenous knowledge and the will to perpetuate so well, it would seem, as wide-spread awareness that it is in danger of disappearing.38197IK Notes 39 December 2001Integrating Indigenousand Scientific Rainfall Forecasting This article was written by Carla Roncoli, Keith Ingram, Paul Kirshen, and Christine Jost of the Climate Forecast-ing for Agricultural Resources (CFAR) project, an interdisciplinary research initiative jointly implemented by theUniversity of Georgia and Tufts University and funded by the Office of Global Program of the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration.

This case study describes how farmers of Burkina Faso predict seasonal rain- fall and examines how their forecastsrelate to scientific ones. In recent years, meteorological science has made enor- mous progress in predicting climate.The realization that sea surface tem- peratures (SSTs) influence global at- mospheric circulation enables scien-tists to formulate forecasts of seasonal rainfall. These are presented as the probability of total seasonal rainfallquantity being in the above normal, be- low normal, or normal compared with an average resulting from analysis ofthirty- years series. In West Africa, sea- sonal rainfall relates to the three months of July, August, and Septem-ber, during which 90 percent of total annual rainfall occurs. Rather than conceiving local and sci- entific knowledge as absolutely incom- patible, our research shows that farm- ers are used to operating in multiplecognitive frameworks and that they are interested in receiving scientific fore- casts because they perceive local fore-casts as becoming less reliable due to increasing climate variability. But to ef- fectively convey scientific forecasts weneed to understand how people think about rainfall, including how they per- ceive and predict variability. Under-standing local cultural models is essen- tial for communicating research prod- ucts and development technology. Locality and livelihoods Bonam is a village located in the Namentenga Province, one of the poor-est of forty-five provinces in Burkina Faso. Most of Bonam inhabitants are Mossi, the dominant ethnic group inthe country, and draw a livelihood from rain-fed farming of grain and legumi- nous crops, combined with some live-stock production, petty trade, and labor migration to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Some Fulani pastoralists have also settled inthe area. Rain falls during a single season last- ing from May to October, characterizedby extreme inter-annual and non-uni- form distribution within seasons. The long-term mean annual rainfall is 674mm. At the onset of the rainy season, farmers decide what, when, and where to plant. They do so according to theirexpectations for seasonal rainfall, striv- ing to minimize risk by combining the water retention capacity of differentsoil types and field positions with the water requirements of various crops and crop varieties.Burkina Faso198IK Notes Number 39 Farmers' forecasting knowledge encompasses shared and selective repertoires. Experienced (mostly elderly male) farmers formulate hypotheses about seasonal rainfall by ob-serving natural phenomena, while cultural and ritual spe- cialists draw predictions from divination, visions, or dreams. Shared forecasting knowledge Environmental indicators that farmers use to predict sea- sonal rainfall become available for observation at differenttimes of year. Among the earliest and most widely relied upon indicators are the timing, intensity, and duration of cold temperatures during the early part of the dry season(November-January). Farmers believe that intense cold (below 15 degrees C) during this time corresponds to abun- dant rainfall during the rainy season and that if this coldperiod begins early or ends late, the rains will do likewise. Following the cold-dry period is a hot-dry period (February- April): intense heat at this time is also believed to predictgood rainfall. The second most common forecasting indicator is the pro- duction of fruit by certain local trees, which occurs betweenApril and June. According to farmers, good yields from trees such as taanga (Butyrospermum parkii ) and sibga (Anogeissus leiocarpus ) predict a favorable season. On the other hand, farmers link abundant fruit production by nobga (Sclerocarya birrea) and sabtuluga (Lannea acida ) trees to drought. Trees are also used as signs for the approaching of the rains or the presence of water. When sibga begin fruiting and sabtuluga lose their leaves farmers know that they should get ready for planting. Kankanga is a fig-like tree that grows where the water table is near the soil surface. Therefore, it signals herders where to dig wells to watertheir cattle and farmers where they can plant water-de- manding crops, such as cotton. Another indicator that becomes available at the onset of the rains is the water level in streams and ponds. If it re- mains consistently high after the first rains, farmers believe that the season will be favorable since heavy rains at theonset are believed to be a propitious sign. Herders who pas- ture animals in the bush watch the nesting of small quail- like bird (known as koobre in Mor\u00e9) and believe that when nests hang high on trees then the rains will be heavy; when nests hang low, the rains will be scarce. Women also observe insect behavior at water sources and in rubbish heaps outside compound walls. For instance, bugvar\u00e9 are black insects of the Orthoptera sp. that dig con-cave nests in rubbish heaps outside compounds. After the first rains, larvae emerge, filling the nests with dirt. Women said that they expect a good farming season if bugvar\u00e9 fill their nests to the brim with dirt, which symbolizes a full granary. But, while signs are observed throughout the dry season, it is at the onset of the rains that farmers consolidate their expectations for rainy season. An early onset, especially with a regular succession of rains that enable good crop es-tablishment, is the most widely considered indicator of a good season. The number of times farmers must plant is also key in evaluating the nature of a season and predictingcrop performance. For example, when a drought affected the region in 1997, farmers had known a food crisis loomed ahead by the end of planting time (early August), half a yearbefore official famine early-warning systems registered dis- tress signals. Some elders are also able to interpret constellation move- ments and lunar phases. For instance, they consider the vis- ible phases of the moon, especially the full moon, to be more likely to be dry than dark phases because moonlight exerts aforce that prevents rain from falling. Stars also signify suit- able planting periods for different fields and crops. The ap- pearance of Souci (Pleiades) in early May indicates that it is time to prepare valley bottom fields for planting. Shifts in the position of the Budb Kutoega (Ursa Major) identify the start and end of the period for planting sorghum. The ap-pearance of Tatba (Orion) in July coincides with heavy rains (sa nyanga ) that favor maize planting. Specialized forecasting knowledge In contrast to the observation of environmental signs which is available to most farmers, divination and other spiritual practices are the prerogative of select groups or individuals.The most authoritative among them is the Tengsoba, the el- dest descendent of the clan that first settled the land. He performs sacrifices to mediate between the living and theancestral and earth spirits that inhabit fetish sites, some of which influence the rains. Predictions are drawn from the behavior of sacrificed animals, how long it takes to fall, inwhich direction it falls, and where the blood spills. The Tengsoba and other traditional specialists might also re- ceive forecasts from ancestors or deities in the form ofdreams or visions. Marabouts are spiritualists who situate themselves within the Islamic tradition, although Islamic orthodoxyfrowns on their practices. These spiritualists range from Is- lamic clerics ( Limam ) who are versed in the Koran to divin-199 ers who mix Islam with indigenous beliefs and practices. The Zambende ceremony, which marks the beginning of the Muslim year, is the key venue for marabouts to issue their forecasts. Marabouts base their predictions on the day of the week that marks the first day of Zambende . Each day is as- sociated with a different prophet and the year that follows ischaracterized by symbolic events in the life or time of that prophet. Prophecies are written in Arabic texts along with instructions for ritual offerings and other measures to staveoff inauspicious events. Unlike the Tengsoba and the marabouts who can only is- sue predictions and offer intercessory prayers, there areother specialists, known as sa tatta , who claim direct com- mand over the rains. But their powers are feared as rain- making is considered to endanger both practitioners andthe community. Invoked rains are believed to be mostly vio- lent downpours ( saraogo ) accompanied by heavy wind, sharp thunder, and lightning that cause damage to crops,houses, and animals. For this reason, a government cloud- seeding project at the beginning of the 1998 rainy season caused anxiety rather than relief among farmers in Bonam. Some spiritualists foresaw the 1997 drought and their re- sponses have implications for their potential role in diffus- ing scientific forecasts as well. The Tengsoba admitted hav- ing had dire premonitions during the dry season, but he did not reveal them. Other spiritualists confirm that they tend not to publicize dire predictions because to do so \"would belike launching a curse\" against those under their authority. Verbalizing negative forecasts would reify them into an in- evitable outcome by voiding any possibility for supplicationand negotiation with the spirits. The failure to alter dire predictions may also undermine the credibility of spiritual- ists responsible for interceding between the living and thespirits. Furthermore, a bleak forecast may also discourage people from farming and induce them to migrate, under- mining the social order on which the elders' authority rests. Integrating local and scientific forecasts Bonam farmers recognize that both society and climate have undergone significant changes in the last few decades.Traditional leaders lament that formal education, monothe- istic religions, and modernization ideologies have dimin- ished their authority, especially among the youth. Climatevariability has also weakened farmers' confidence in local knowledge. Elders recalled that in the past they were able to predict the rain onset so accurately that they could mobilizefamily labor plant on dry soil, knowing that the rains would soon follow, but now their sons refuse to go to the field until it actually rains.But this does not mean that farmers perceive scientific in- formation as a threat to local culture. On the contrary, be- cause they perceive local forecasts to have become less reli-able, farmers are keenly interested in alternative sources of information. Rather than being static and uniform, their cognitive landscape already incorporates a plurality ofknowledge frameworks. Local forecasting combines empiri- cal observations and spiritual insights that draw from a va- riety of religious traditions. Farmers mix local and intro-duced practices and technologies and families pragmatically combine modern medicine and local treatments when one of their members is sick. It is the imposition of any one knowl-edge system as representing the totality of truth that is re- sented and resisted. Hence, scientific information must be presented in ways that conform to cultural notions concerning the nature of knowledge, its production and validation, and its relation- ship to society. Local systems of thought emphasize the par-tial nature of human understanding, which means that no one source of information is considered as having the entire picture. Local forecasts systems rely on a range of indicatorsthat become available to different people and at different times. Farmers do not resolve contradictions among indica- tors into a cogent scenario. Discrepancies among forecastsor between forecasts and outcomes are explained in terms of the diversity of ecological niches and cropping systems. The probabilistic nature of the forecast may also be explained byreference to the uncertain nature of destiny as the outcome of negotiations between the living and the spirits and, ulti- mately, of the arbitrary will of the latter. There are several aspects of method and content where local and scientific knowledge of forecasting converges. For example in formulating predictions, spiritualists use ap-proaches reminiscent of scientific practice. Zambende prophecies derive from the exegesis of textual material and from consultations among spiritualists, who then officiallycommunicate them to the lay public. In the domain of envi- ronmental knowledge, farmer forecasts resemble scientific methods in their reliance on the systematic observation ofnatural phenomena. The generation of knowledge from ob- servation is consistent with cultural learning styles whereby children learn from watching adults rather thanthrough verbal instruction or asking questions. Meteorologists could build on local understanding of the relationship between temperatures and rainfall to explainthe technical aspects of scientific forecasts based on sea sur- face temperatures. Farmers' interpretations of wind pat- terns also recognize the ocean as the origin for rain. Duringthe dry season, farmers expect winds to blow westward, that is, to go to the ocean to pick up water, and then return200IK Notes Number blowing eastward at the onset of the rainy season. Farmers predicted and explained drought from the absence of such winds. But farmers' forecasts diverge from scientific ones in im- portant ways, particularly the scale and parameters they address. Unlike scientific forecasts, which are formulated inreference to \"zones,\" the production and the application of local forecasts are deeply localized. They derive from an inti- mate interaction with a microenvironment whose rhythmsare intertwined with the cycles of family and community life. It is not the generic sibga or taanga that farmers usu- ally consider in predicting rainfall, but specific trees neartheir home or their fields that they might have observed over a lifetime. While scientific forecasts hinge on estimates of total sea- sonal quantity, farmers evaluate seasons in terms of types and time of rainfall. For instance, they recognize that the same amount of rainfall can lead to different productionoutcomes if it occurs as sa nyanga (prolonged but consistent rain that leaves the soil moist for several days) or as saraogo (localized thunderstorm accompanied by violent wind). Wa-ter-deficit periods that occur during establishment or head- ing will cause more damage to crops than those that occur during other crop growth stages. The time of onset and of termination, marking the dura- tion of the rains, is such a salient parameter that a forecast of an \"above average\" seasonal rainfall is invariably under-stood by Bonam farmers as predicting a longer season. Cur- rently, science is unable to reliably predict either the dura- tion or distribution of seasonal rainfall, but the integrationof scientific forecasts with local knowledge might allow some inferences in this regard. For example, the abnormally heavy rains that fell in July and August 1999 could havebeen predicted by combining farmers' predictions of delayed onset with the scientific forecast for above-normal seasonal rainfall.Conclusions Our findings show that neither the experiences of bridging knowledge systems nor the concepts of rainfall forecastingare alien to the farmers of Burkina Faso. Local forecasts converge with scientific ones in some aspects of content and method, but also diverge in terms of practical significanceand moral meanings. These contrasts challenge science on two fronts. On the one hand, the specificity of local forecast param- eters urges science to be more responsive to farmers' infor- mation needs and more relevant to the livelihood decisions they face. On the other hand, local systems of expertise andleadership tightly link knowledge and social responsibility, calling for scientists to be more aware of and accountable for the impacts of the knowledge they produce and provide tousers. This responsibility propels us beyond the task of integrat- ing local and scientific knowledge in form and content fore-casts, to face the challenge of addressing consequences and context of their use. In particular, the provision of informa- tion needs to be integrated with appropriate interventionsthat bolster farmers' ability to negotiate a mitigated out- come of predicted scenarios. Scientists, policymakers, do- nors, and development practitioners must work together todevise consistent and sustainable approaches to improving the flexibility of local production systems and the resiliency of livelihood security for the resource-limited farmers of theSudano-Sahel region.39201IK Notes 40 January 2002Maternal Health Care in Rural UgandaLeveraging Traditional and Modern Knowledge Systems This article was written by Dr. Maria G.N. Musoke (PhD), Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda. Uganda is one of the least urbanized countries in Africa, where over 80 per- cent of the population of about 20 mil-lion people live in rural areas. Uganda's economy depends mainly on agricul- ture and women contribute 60-80 per-cent of the labour. Women's health, therefore, has vital social and economic implications for national development.However, among Ugandan women of reproductive age, maternal health is- sues are a major problem as demon-strated by the following indicators: a high maternal mortality rate estimated at 506/100,000; an equally high fertilityrate of about 6.9; only about 38 percent births are attended to by trained health workers, the rest (62 percent) are at-tended by traditional birth attendants 1 (TBAs) and relatives.2 To address these problems, the Ugandan Ministry ofHealth (MoH) identified several strate- gies and activities. Some of these activi- ties included expanding the referral sys-tem and improving the TBA network as well as training TBAs. The Rural Ex- tended Services and Care for UltimateEmergency Relief (RESCUER) project was started as one of these initiatives.Project description The RESCUER project was launched in March 1996, on a pilot basis, in Iganga 3 District, Eastern Uganda. It is basically a referral project, designed to address the high maternal mortality problem.The project was initiated by the MoH, UNFPA, and the Uganda Population Secretariat. A multi-sectoral Iganga dis-trict task force implements the project, while UNFPA and the MoH do the monitoring. RESCUER has three components: communication, transport and quality health services delivery. Communication The type of information communica-tions technology (ICT) selected was dic- tated by a number of factors, some of which include: unavailability of electricpower supply in most rural areas, lack of wired telephones, the need for the ICT to be accessed twenty four hours aday, flexibility, the need to re-use the system in other parts of the country and the economic sustainability of thesystem when donor support ended. For these reasons, the VHF radio was the type of ICT selected to be used in theproject. This included fixed base sta- tions at the health units, mobile202IK Notes Number 40 walkie-talkies with the TBAs, and vehicle radios in the refer- ral hospital ambulance and the District Medical Officer's ve- hicle. The VHF radio communication is solar-powered, avoid-ing electric power shortage or surge problems. The RESCUER project was designed to link the tradi- tional rural community health providers with the formalhealth delivery system in a cost-effective way, such that when an obstetric emergency occurs in a village, a TBA uses a walkie-talkie to call for assistance from the nearest healthunit. A message on what to do is immediately relayed over the radio system. If the TBA cannot manage the case, trans- port is dispatched from the health unit with a midwife tocollect the patient. If a case cannot be managed at the health centre level, the hospital is called and an ambulance is sent to transport the patient to the referral hospital. Transport Tricycles were provided to each of the participating pri-mary-level referral health units which were generally sub- county health centres. An old ambulance at the main refer- ral hospital was repaired and equipped with radio commu-nication. TBAs were given bicycles to assist them with transport to the health units to charge the walkie-talkie bat- tery and to collect monthly statistics. Quality health services delivery This included capacity building (e.g., training of TBAs, mid-wives, technicians), recruitment of at least two midwives and a clinical officer in all the participating health units, renovation of the maternity wards (including provision ofdelivery beds, oxygen, and I.V. fluid stands) and regular pro- vision of maternal emergency kits and other supplies. Implementation A district task force comprising of the Director of District Health Services (DDHS\u2014formerly known as the District Medical Officer), and officials from other sectors in the dis-trict was set up to oversee the planning, development, and implementation of the project. It is answerable to the high- est tier of district leadership, namely, the LC5 chairperson.The task force is chaired by the DDHS, and comprises rep- resentatives from sectors relevant to health in the district. Results and impact In July 1999, the author carried out a study to investigate the effect of the communication system on maternal healthcare, and its contribution to the referral project. She identi- fied factors affecting the project, as well as the costs and sustainability of the project. Data were collected from bothsecondary and primary sources. Secondary sources included progress reports and other project documents. Primary data were collected qualitatively, through interviews and basedon incidents narrated by health workers and TBAs. The study sample focused on Iganga district where the project had been running since March 1996. The increased number of deliveries under trained person- nel and increased referrals to health units led to a reduction of about 50 percent in the maternal mortality rate (MMR)in three years as indicated below: \"A survey carried out recently in three districts of Arua, Iganga and Tororo, which all had got their TBAs trained,showed that Iganga's MMR had reduced from 500/100,000 in 1996 to 271/100,000; whereas rates for Tororo and Arua had reduced, but both were above 350/100,000. This indi-cated that communication and transport facilities in Iganga contributed to a reduction in MMR. Before the project, there were problems of lack of communication facilities andtransport, which made referrals slow and sometimes led to the death of the mother or baby or both\" (Administrator). Six health units and one referral hospital participated in the project. Of these, four health units and the referral hos- pital were studied and their midwives interviewed. In addi- tion, ten TBAs, three project administrators and fourwomen beneficiaries were interviewed. To the TBAs, the walkie-talkie technology was a great source of empowerment as it improved their image andcredibility, thus increasing compliance with referral advice, and also augmented their income by increasing the number of women they attended to. Those who are not able to writefurther pointed out that : \"Since I can't write, it was difficult for me to refer women; I had to go with them to the health unit and explain... butnow, the walkie-talkie saved me all that trouble, because I just call the midwife and explain the condition of the person I am referring... I don't have to go escorting every person Irefer\" (TBA7). The communication technology brought the rural mid- wives closer to each other, thereby reducing isolation andfacilitating consultation. Panic situations and the uncertain management of complications were reduced considerably. In the referral hospital, communication was reported to have made the work of midwives easier as they were able to know in advance what to expect and prepare for emergen- cies. Women beneficiaries reported that this communicationlink gave them hope in critical situations.203 Lessons learned The study highlighted a number of lessons. Complementarity \u007f A critical mass of complementary activities is needed to achieve maximum impact. For example, the study foundthat although the communication component made a very significant contribution to the success of the RESCUER project, it could not stand on its own. For the project toachieve its objectives of improved referrals leading to in- creased deliveries by trained personnel, the other two com- ponents (transportation and quality of services delivery)had to play their complementary role. When transport broke down, however, it was reported that the presence of a midwife and the communication system played a big role insaving lives: the TBAs called to consult health units, these also called to consult colleagues and seniors. However, where the emergency necessitated a referral, the need fortransport became very crucial. Technology \u007f The impact of ICTs is enhanced if the technology is appro- priate to the local conditions. As indicated, the ICT choice was made after careful considerations of the local problemsin rural Uganda. \u007f The use of solar power by the radio communication sys- tem could also benefit rural health units, which have noelectricity. In particular, the study recommended that the solar power should be extended to provide light in the ma- ternity wards / labour suites in the first-level referral units.\u007f The simple design of the radio communication system fa- cilitated its use according to all the people interviewed. \u007f The public audibility of the radio communication systemrenders it difficult to abuse or misuse. Interviewees re- ported that calls made are usually brief and to the point, and that the nature of this ICT protects it from theft.\u007f A multi-tiered ICT approach can help bring the benefits of advanced technology to the rural population in Sub-Sa- haran Africa. Such an approach will cater to the differentcapabilities in African situations. For example, telemedicine and other advanced technology facilities (e.g., the Internet) can be adopted at the district hospital, while simple tech-nologies like radio can serve lower levels (rural health units, TBAs, etc.). The consultations made by lower units to the district hospital would ensure that the rural populationbenefits indirectly from the technology. Institutional capacity \u007f The project built on existing infrastructure and local ca- pacity, including traditional knowledge systems. The TBAs' knowledge of local culture, values and their ability to con-nect traditional and modern practices was critical to the project. Indeed the project started at the grassroots with the traditional knowledge held by the TBAs, and improved it byconducting refresher courses and equipping TBAs, as well as professional health workers, with simple ICT, transport and regular supplies.\u007f Leveraging traditional and modern knowledge systems can increase impact. For example, the RESCUER project brought together traditional and modern health practitio-ners and inculcated mutual understanding and trust that has enhanced maternal health care. 1 A traditional birth attendant (TBA) is a person from the community with no formal training, but who has knowledge of indigenouspractices which has been acquired through apprenticeship andbeing part of a local community's culture and value system. She/heattends to women in childbirth, advises on and treats matters offamily health usually using herbs and / or other traditionalmedicines and practices.

Wolff M.D., Harvard Medical School, Boston MA02115, USA.. For more information, e-mail: wolff_p@tch.harvard.edu Female genital mutilation is wide- spread throughout many regions of Af- rica and elsewhere. It is usually perpe-trated during early childhood and has serious consequences for the medical, gynecological, and obstetrical well-be-ing of girls. These effects persist throughout the childbearing years and beyond. Less often recognized are thepsychological suffering, humiliation so- cial dignity and self-concepts of the girls and women subjected to this tradi-tional practice. Infibulation that is usually per- formed during early childhood is themost radical and destructive form of fe- male genital mutilation. It also has the most destructive gynecological and ob-stetrical consequences. The practice of infibulation was traditionally wide- spread throughout the Lowlands ofEritrea, and particularly among the no- mads. During the thirty-year war for Eritrean independence, the medical de-partment of the liberation forces that treated not only the combatants but also the civilian populations in the lib-erated zones frequently had to treat girls and women with major gyneco- logical and obstetrical disorders. Themajority of these were directly related to genital mutilation. The question was therefore discussed in detail among thecombatants as to what measures couldbe taken to ease this dreadful burden on women to prevent serious medical complications. At the same time it wasrecognized that this practice was to- tally incompatible with the efforts to improve the social status of women inthe society. Expatriate visitors to the field who were informed about the practice ofgenital mutilation among Eritrean no- mads, and others abroad who heard about these practices were outragedand immediately insisted that the sur- gical infibulation be forbidden, with se- vere penalties for those who continuedto this harmful traditional practice. These expatriates failed to understand either the delicate balance between lib-eration forces and the civilian popula- tion, or that the overall policy of the in- dependence forces to unify the countrydepended on cooperation and close working relationships among all sec- tors of the population. Most outsidersfurther assumed that, at the present time, it was primarily the men who per- petrated these mutilations on women.Historically, the nefarious practices were no doubt instituted by males on females, but over centuries women hadassimilated the cultural importance of the practice, on the premise that women who were not infibulated or cir-cumcised were in danger of becomingEritrea205 sexually promiscuous or of becoming prostitutes. To pre- serve their respect in the community, women therefore in- sisted on the mutilation, and in many countries still do. The medical department of the Eritrean independence forces therefore made the decision not to forbid the practice in the lowlands or to impose any penalties on those who con-tinued the practice. They recognized that trying to stop it by force would only alienate the population and drive the prac- tice underground. Instead, voluntary meetings were calledat which Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) who were the civilians who performed the infibulations were invited to participate in repeated month-long workshops conductedby nurses and doctors on a voluntary basis. At these work- shops TBAs were given detailed information about the se- vere harmful immediate effects of hemorrhage and infec-tion; as well as about the serious long-term gynecological consequences, increased infant and maternal mortality, and the like. They also underwent courses in modern steriletechnique, obstetrical practices, etc. As is the practice at Eritrean workshops, the transmission of information was followed by active discussion. Thereafter, the TBAs re-turned to their villages. Although there were no systematic follow-up studies, an- ecdotal reports suggested that there was a gradual reduc-tion in the adverse consequences of genital mutilation as the TBAs applied their new knowledge. However, it could not be expected that the practices were abandoned alto-gether during, or even after the war. Since independence, the National Association of Eritrean Women makes fre- quent visits to the nomads to continue these discussionbased on mutual respect and cooperation. The general im- pression is that the practice is slowly disappearing.Impact The quickest solution for stopping the practices of female genital mutilation (and the one proposed by foreigner infor-mal advisors) might at first glance appear to be to forbid the practice and to impose penalties on those who continued the practice. However, in view of the delicate relationship be-tween the independence forces and the civilian population it would in any case have been politically inappropriate to im- pose such legal measures. Moreover, the practices wouldhave merely continued underground. Instead, the indepen- dence forces relied on the inherent intelligence and willing- ness of the TBAs to modify their gynecological practicesgradually, once they were given the necessary modern medi- cal information as to how they might modify them, and to educate the civilian population by practice rather than byfiat. This approach also laid the groundwork for the con- tinuing education of women by women after indepen- dence\u2014an additional step towards assuring the equality ofwomen.206IK Notes 42 March 2002Developing Indigenous Knowledgein Francophone AfricaA Four-Nation Overview The mission in mid-2001 comprised the authors of this article, Peter Easton (consultant),Emmanuel Nikiema (World Bank staff, Burkina Faso Field Office), and Suzanne Essama (WorldBank staff, Washington D.C.). For more information, please e-mail sessama@worldbank.org How well is indigenous knowledge (IK) taking hold and being integrated into the development policy and practice inthe Francophone countries of West and Central Africa? Results of a World Bank mission in early summer 2001 tofour of these nations\u2014Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Cameroon\u2014offer a brief panorama of the current situa-tion. This note is based on contacts with public and private sector counter- parts involved in different facets of in-digenous knowledge promotion and in- terviews that grew, in many instances, from these initial contacts. The situa-tion in each country was different\u2014a function of its own history and the challenges and opportunities it faces;yet there were important commonali- ties as well. Both are briefly explored below. An abundance of initiatives Much is going on in relation to indig- enous knowledge in all four countries,both in the public sector and among non-governmental and community- based organizations. Activities arecropping up across multiple domains of development: health, agriculture, edu- cation, natural resource management,cultural affairs. A few examples:\u007f An NGO in Mali devoted to \"adding muscle to local knowledge\" ( muscler le savoir local ) recruits students from across West Africa to attend seminars on the dynamics of indigenous knowledge and to carry out first handresearch\u2014particularly in the agricul- tural zone of the Office du Niger\u2014on how local farmers have adapted tra-ditional understandings of crop fer- tility and production to the exigen- cies of commercial operations. \u007f A center in rural Senegal gathers to- gether over 400 traditional healers to exchange methods and test the effi-cacy of their ministrations with mod- ern medical diagnosis. \u007f The Ministry of Culture and Art in Burkina Faso sponsors, through its \"Direction of Cultural Heritage,\" a series of local museums devoted topreserving indigenous crafts and a program of fora on local know-how. \u007f A researcher at the Natural Products Research Foundation in Cameroon has carried out, under OAU sponsor- ship, an ethno-botanic survey of tra-ditional uses of the vast store of plants in that country. Indigenous knowledge now appears to be a hot topic. There are sources of funding, both private and foreign aid-207 based, for studies and initiatives in this area, and it is in- creasingly politically correct to endorse related efforts. Cross-country undertakings are not uncommon. The Minis-try of Culture in Mali recently held an international collo- quium of traditional hunters and \"bush chieftains\" ( chefs de la brousse ) from several West African countries to discuss indigenous methods of natural resource preservation; and the NGO PROMETRA (Promotion des medicines traditionnelles or \"Promotion of traditional medicine\") in Senegal has joined forces with similar organizations or cre- ated branches of its own structure in twelve other African countries. It is evident that any further effort now envis-aged in these countries must take careful account of what has already been initiated and of the lessons learned from practice to date. Uneven development The very popularity of indigenous knowledge as a banner for action, and funding, attracts such a variety of aspirantsand contributors that testing claims against field-level re- sults is a critical means for identifying best practice and separating the wheat from the chaff. Yet such assessment isfar from the rule. There is nonetheless an increasing amount of substance in the domain of indigenous knowledge throughout the fourcountries visited, but it remains unevenly developed in a number of respects. \u007f Despite the creation of Ministries of Culture (as in Mali and Burkina Faso), the preponderance of activities re- mains in the NGO and voluntary sector. Cultivation of in- digenous knowledge is seldom part of the policy or prac-tices of pubic agencies. In Senegal, for example, almost all of the experiments with traditional medicine have been carried out under private auspices, and their proponentshave had little success in interesting the mainline medical system in such initiatives. \u007f There is also a marked divergence between what might be called the \"hard\" and \"soft\" sectors of development. Most IK initiatives have been undertaken in social service do- mains like health, culture and education. There are some,though fewer, in agriculture The further one moves from the realm of social development toward engineering, fi- nance and the more technical sectors of development, thefewer people one finds who understand the role of IK or are ready to take it into account. Natural resource man- agement constitutes perhaps the most notable exception. \u007f Use of African languages is in many cases closely related to efforts to record, develop, and incorporate local knowl- edge; but practices in this regard are conditioned by a hostof other policy concerns. It is typically more difficult to adopt coherent policies promoting them in coastal coun- tries with hundreds of African languages than in interioror Sahelian countries with a more limited number of tongues and a few predominant lingua franca . Cameroon, for example, must deal both with official (French-English)bilingualism and a number of different African languages and is therefore still struggling with its policy regarding use of the latter in the educational system. Why this record of uneven progress? Dominant models of development are difficult to change, it is true, and the moretechnical the domain the more it is tied into international norms of procedure and performance. Indigenous knowl- edge is therefore naturally a phenomenon where rhetoricand practice tend to diverge a bit: there is often a political payoff to endorsing it but a real political cost to doing some- thing concrete about it. But there are other valid reasons for uneven develop- ment. The NGO sector provides a good laboratory for ex- perimenting with innovative approaches before trying to in-corporate the most successful or appropriate of them into public policy; it is scarcely surprising therefore that new ini- tiatives crop up there. In a multicultural context, whose in- digenous knowledge will be given prominence is a thorny question, just like the issue of which African language or languages will achieve official status. There are good rea-sons for advancing slowly with such decisions. One result of this uneven development is of course a lack of coherence and coordination in the \"indigenous knowl-edge sector.\" Actors in one arena do not know what those in another are doing, there are few commonly accepted stan- dards for work, and there is a good deal of competition. Thisis not all bad, however. The multiplicity of efforts at least favors the emergence of new ideas and creates a variety of approaches that experience may help to winnow out. Recognizing different varieties of IK One result of the increasing experience with the develop- ment of indigenous knowledge in the four countries visitedis increasing sophistication in understanding the various meanings and applications of IK. A group interviewed in Senegal presented perhaps the clearest analysis of the dif-ferent and potentially complementary interpretations of lo- cal knowledge now embodied in the field. They distin- guished three variant approaches:\u007fIndigenous knowledge as a heritage from the past to be carefully conserved and respected\u2014an approach display- ing the kind of reverence for the accumulated wisdom of208IK Notes Number previous generations so poignantly expressed in the fa- mous phrase from Amadou Hampate B\u00e2, \"each time an elder dies it is as if a library had burned down.\" \u007fIndigenous knowledge as an embodiment of a different and specifically African mode of thought\u2014 an African \"epistemology\" and therefore a means for rethinking de-velopment methods in areas like health, agriculture, and natural resource management. Proponents of this ap- proach point to the failure of current methodologies of de-velopment as evidence of the need for new concepts rooted in people's cultural heritage. \u007fIndigenous knowledge as a means and process for articu- lating what local people know, and involving them in the creation of the knowledge required for development , and so transmitting to future generations the best that thepresent has to offer. Proponents of this approach insist that IK is as much a question of enabling local actors to produce new knowledge\u2014based both on inheritance from the past and a clear-eyed assessment of current chal- lenges\u2014as it is one of simply inventorying and storing up the traditions inherited from the past. The synthesis of these three perspectives seems to have the greatest potential for stimulating widespread respect ofindigenous knowledge. But examples are rare, though the language people use increasingly reflects a compound per- spective. Our interlocutors talked of \"referring\" or havingregular \"recourse\" to indigenous knowledge in building new models for development, rather than simply enshrining it. Many were sensitive, moreover, to the virtues of the thirdapproach, which makes indigenous knowledge an active process, rather than purely a question of anthologies and museums, and ties it to an agenda of popular participationand decentralization. Building the missing links Where is the movement headed in these four countries? What are the principal challenges facing its proponents? The biggest \"missing link\" in all sites visited lies in the in- ability or insufficient opportunity to \"inject\" the results ofIK initiatives into the policies and procedures that govern local development, to move from gratifying forums and to- wards encouraging experiments to actual changes in policyand standard practice. The situation is reflected both in the countries visited and in donor organizations such as the World Bank. Indigenousknowledge concerns, if more frequently recognized now than in the past, tend to be compartmentalized in special-ized services or agencies that have this mission but have little effect on policy in the \"working\" sectors of develop- ment. At the national level, there may be a ministry oragency devoted to culture, yet operating largely in a vacuum without influence on practical issues of economic and social development. In donor organizations, programs for the pro-motion of IK may flourish but intersect little if at all with those mainstream offices that determine aid policy and practice. Crossing this divide remains a major challenge.Four dimensions of activity seem particularly important: \u007f Promoting the incorporation of indigenous knowledge into development projects through more explicit proce- dures for involving local actors in the design of interven- tion methods and in tactical decision-making. In many cases, this means making participatory management andaction research standard operating procedure in develop- ment enterprises. \u007f Systematically developing, preparing and disseminating tools and methods for this kind of participatory approach to local development. \u007f Making local schools a hub for the collection of indigenous knowledge and a place of encounter between development agents and local actors in negotiating investments and initiatives that include it. \u007f Designing, testing and implementing materials and meth- ods for the pre-service and in-service professional training of development workers that initiate them to fuller usage of local knowledge and assist them in discovering ways to synthesize the new and the old. Strategies must evidently be developed country by coun- try, although accompanied by ample means for cross-na- tional exchange. The first step forward might best be a sortof \"sector assessment\" or \u00e9tat des lieux carried out by na- tional researchers in order to inventory and compare the varied initiatives under way in a given country and what isknown of their results. This would serve as a prelude and criteria for prioritizing future efforts. Government minis- tries and donor organizations should be a part of this scru-tiny, which would entail as well an \"audit\" of their own poli- cies with respect to local participation in development plan- ning and utilization of indigenous knowledge. In all four countries, IK is a domain of increasing activity and immense potential. It is at the same time a realm where support from donor communities can help greatly tostrengthen existing efforts and \"winnow\" the most promis- ing initiatives from the many now under way, but where host country policy decisions must finally govern norms.42209IK Notes 43 April 2002Rural Seed Fairs in Southern Tanzania This article was written by O.K.K. Mponda ( Plant Breeder and Principal Investigator, Southern Zone Seed Fairs,ARI Naliendele, Mtwara) and E.M. Kafiriti (Agronomist, Mtwara),Naliendele Agricultural Research Institute, P.O. Box 509 Mtwara, Tanzania, Fax No. 255 023 334023; e-mailNARI@RAHA.COM Why southern zone rural seed fairs? The low productivity of agricultural crops is among the factors leading tolow income and food insecurity for ru- ral people in the Southern Zone of Tan- zania.. The use of improved seeds is oneway of increasing the productivity of agricultural crops. It was realized that the seed supply pipeline from the seed-producing regions in the Southern Zone was not flowing freely partly due to the poor infrastructure prevailing inthe zone. In the conventional Transfer of Technology Model (TOT), the seed supply pipeline begins with researchwhere breeding work is done and ends with farmers who access a final product of improved seeds/variety. The MultipleSources of Innovations Model acknowl- edges the contribution of informal seed systems. Therefore, it is argued by de-velopment experts that informal and formal seed/variety development ex- perts can complement each other andimprove the supply of seeds of pre- ferred varieties to farmers better than each expert's isolated efforts. The Southern Zone rural seed fairs have the following objectives: Short-term \u007f To create awareness of and accessi- bility to additional alternative seedsand planting materials from research institutions, seed companies and farmers; \u007f To enable researchers, extension agents and farmers to meet and ex- change ideas on their strategies, theskills they use in seed and variety de- velopment and to sell and exchange seed materials; and \u007f To create working contacts between seed expert farmers, extension agents, breeders/researchers and na-tional seed producers. These working contacts could lead to refinement of extension content and the creation ofnew seed/variety development pro- grams and schemes including more village-based initiatives and re-searcher-farmer partnerships for technology development Mid-term \u007f To increase significantly the number and availability of crop varieties bredfrom National Research Institutes, seed companies and farmers' own seed systems in the southern zone \u007f To promote farmers' own seed and exchange systems such that the offi- cial efforts, in addition to normalcommercial channels, also work creasingly towards enhancing indig- enous systems; and210IK Notes Number To encourage convergence between official variety devel- opment/seed production and farmers in their own comple- mentary seed/variety development Long-term \u007f To increase agricultural productivity, food availability and income for rural people in the southern zone. Organization and implementation of the seed fairs Over the years 1997-1999, seed fairs were organized and implemented by the Agricultural Research Institute (ARI), Naliendele and District Councils with financial support coming largely from the FINIDA-supported Rural Inte-grated Project Support (RIPS). However, since the year 2000, District Councils have been financing the rural seed fairs. Before each seed fair, a farmer seed expert survey is con- ducted and a seed fair site selected in each district. The farmer seed experts are those farmers who in their commu-nity are considered experts on certain crops based on expe- rience and who supply seed to others. These farmers are in- vited to exhibit during the seed fair day. Other farmers notidentified as experts are also free to attend and participate. They could bring seeds , local skills and demonstrate to oth- ers. The seed fair sites are selected by districts based on thepotential of the area for agricultural production, the avail- ability of accommodation, accessibility and how central it is to other villages so that farmers from the neighbourhoodcan easily attend the fair. The ARI Naliendele was being assisted financially by RIPS to purchase improved seeds from different places inthe country\u2014particularly from research institutions, seed companies, Tanzania Farmers' Association shops and some hard-to-obtain seeds from farmers. Small samples of 5-200grams of all seed types of different crops including cereals, legumes, oilseeds, vegetable crops and fruits and tree seeds are collected and packed in small packets. These seed packsare sold to or exchanged with farmers who are interested in testing in their fields. To spread awareness regarding the seed fair, radio spot announcements are made 2-4 weeks prior to the event and there is live coverage on the actual day. Farmers in selected villages set up booths for seed exhibi- tion. They also organize traditional dances on the eve of the seed fairs to entertain participants and make the seed fair a lively event. To coordinate the seed fair activity at the vil-lage level, various committees are formed, e.g., a building committee (ujenzi), a committee for food (chakula), a com-mittee for traditional dance(utamaduni), and a committee for security (ulinzi na usalama). District Councils provide extension officers with a budget to attend and participate in the seed fairs. They also provide seed experts with food and transport to and from seed fair sites. The seed fair lasts for two days in each selected village. District Commissioners are invited to inaugurate the seed fair event. It begins in the evening with traditional dances.And from 7.00 pm to 10.00 pm, farmers are shown video films on various agricultural technologies. The actual seed fair goes on from 8.00 am to 5.00 p.m. after which the seedfair team moves to another selected village in another dis- trict. On the seed fair day, apart from the seed exhibition, demonstrations are held on grafting, farm tool manufac-ture, etc. Researchers document the knowledge of seed ex- perts through note-taking, photographs and video films The participation of politicians, researchers, extension, farmers,and private seed entrepreneurs creates working contacts and therefore improves the linkage between stakeholders. Sustainability of the seed fairs The Southern Zone rural seed fairs started in 1997 in the three villages of Marambo in Nachingwea, Mbonde in Masasi and Kitangari in Newala Districts. In 1998, the seedfairs were extended to include nine District Councils of the Southern Zone and in 1999 they were conducted in ten Dis- trict Councils. To sustain the rural seed fairs in the zone,from 2000 District Councils were encouraged, as mentioned earlier, to take the leading role in organizing them without support from RIPS, with the ARI Naliendele playing a coor-dinating role. Achievements of the seed fairs \u007f Increased awareness of improved seeds and accessibility of seeds to farmers. Farmers are now demanding seeds of preferred varieties. \u007f The seed fairs have demonstrated that farmers have valu- able local seeds, skills and knowledge that can be docu- mented, disseminated and commercialized. \u007f Seed fairs have been a valuable tool of technology transfer from research to farmers. \u007f Over seventy crop varieties of cereals, legumes, vegetables and oilseeds bred from the formal seed system have beenmade available to farmers.211 \u007f The seed fairs have helped to create awareness among re- searchers and extension regarding local varieties and have helped them to access the local knowledge of crops. \u007f The fairs have demonstrated how crops can be protected from genetic erosion; thus, one may recover certain types of seeds which might have been lost in one area/villagefrom other farmers. \u007f The seed fairs have increased the debate on seed issues in the zone and help zonal initiatives on seed multiplication. \u007f The ARI Naliendele is now linking local individuals, farmer research groups, local institutions to multiply seeds of preferred varieties such as oilseeds. \u007f Beans cultivation has been introduced in Chilangala Divi- sion as an alternative cash/food crop.The difference between agricultural shows and seed fairs There have been some questions as to why rural seed fairs should not be combined with the National Nanenane Agri- cultural shows (an annual event in each district and at Na-tional Level) to minimize costs The reasons are summarized below. Understanding these differences is very important be- cause most of the farmers in Tanzania are subsistence, small-scale farmers who may not qualify for the agricultural shows. Subsistence farmers grow various crops for food se-curity. Agricultural shows seems to have been designed for the so-called progressive and commercial farmers. It follows that even the poorest farmers can qualify to participate inseed fairs. Rural seed fairs encourage the participation of re- source-poor farmers in the conservation of plant genetic re- sources that contributes to their food security and rurallivelihoods. This, consequently, empowers the rural poor and builds confidence in their knowledge and in indigenous plant genetic resources. Agricultural shows Rural Seed Fairs Extension staff influences what is displayed Undermines local knowledge and traditional cultures Demonstrates achievements from formal research only Uniformity is a major concern Stresses increased production Encourages farmers to adopt best options Crops and livestock displayed Encourages mono-cropping Commercialization leads to genetic erosion Some minor crops are neglected Is conducted after crop harvest in August The major objective is to show formal scientific achievements Farmers decide what to display Promotes local knowledge and traditional culture Demonstrates achievements from research and farmers' own seed system Diversity of crop plants is a major concern Stresses food security Monitors availability of seeds of various types The emphasis is on seed crops Encourages farmers to grow many crops Protects crops from genetic erosion Minor crops which might have medicinal properties are encouraged to be displayed Promotes soil fertility by growing many crops with different nutrient requirement, some of them improving soil fertility Is conducted at the onset of the rainy season The objective is to improve seed supply bred from research and farmers' own seeds in rural areas. 212IK Notes 44 May 2002The Contribution of Indigenous Vegetablesto Household Food SecurityUganda This article was written by E.B. Rubaihayo, Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute, P.O. Box 7065,Kampala, and was first published in the African Crop Science Journal, Africa Crop Science Conference Proceedings, Vol. 3, pp. 1337-1340. The present version has been lightly-edited and excludes the text of the abstract in English and French. A lot of effort has been invested by the Government of Uganda to produce enough food for Uganda's populationand a surplus for export. However, the indigenous vegetables, often referred to as traditional vegetables, have been un-derrated in favor of introduced exotic vegetables (Rubaihayo, 1995). Hence, the potential of traditional vegetableshas not been exploited. Traditional vegetables are perish- able, low yielding and their value ascommercial crops has not been ex- plored. Yet, the majority of local farm- ers cannot always produce exotic veg-etables because of the unavailability of seeds and/or high production costs of these vegetables. Unfortunately, the re-source-poor urban and rural popula- tion often find it difficult to purchase exotic vegetables from local marketsbecause of the high costs. They there- fore, depend on traditional vegetables as a regular side dish or sauce accompa-nying the staple foods such as maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, banana, millet, sorghum and yams (Rubaihayo, 1994).The staple foods provide calories needed for body energy but are very low in other nutrients while the tradi-tional vegetables have a very high nu- tritive value. They contain vitamin A, B, and C, proteins and minerals such asiron, calcium, phosphorus, iodine and fluorine in varying amounts but ad- equate for normal growth and health.For example, vitamin A which is re- quired to prevent blindness especially in children is found in all dark greenleafy traditional vegetables such as hand vegetables Solanum indicum subsp .. distichum (Katunkuma) are be- lieved to control high blood pressure. The traditional vegetables, therefore,meet the major protein-calorie nutri- tional needs especially in children, the sick, elderly, expectant and lactatingmothers (FAO, 1988). Unfortunately, the consumers have not been sensitized to appreciate the role of the traditionalvegetables in fulfilling the above hu- man needs. Most of the traditional vegetables are produced throughout the developing world mainly in kitchen and home gar- dens. Because of the importance ofthese gardens, an international Work- shop on Household Garden Projects was held in Bangkok, Thailand in May1991 to consolidate lessons learned from experience with household garden projects. The workshop analyzed the213 relevance and effectiveness of household food production as a development intervention, targeted at the most nutrition- ally and economically disadvantaged people and identifiedviable implementation strategies of household gardens (Midmore et al., 1991). The purpose of this paper is to prompt policy makers and development managers to reassess and give more weight to the neglected production and consumption of traditional vegetables so as to enhance nutrition, income generationand food security for small scale households. The views ex- pressed in this paper are a result of interviews with several people from many countries including Uganda, Ethiopia,Kenya. Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Rwanda, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Senegal, etc. although there is more focus on the Uganda situation. Kitchen gardens. Kitchen gardens are common in urban centers and their suburbs. They are normally made up of very small plots of usually pure stands of traditional veg-etables as part of the garden of the residence. The veg- etables are produced cheaply in these gardens using com- post rather than commercial fertilizers (Midmore et al.,1991) The commonly grown traditional vegetables B. oleracea and Daucus carota are also commonly grown. The yields of some fresh vegetables in Uganda are shown in Table 1. Home gardens . Home gardens are found in villages. The plots are larger than those of kitchen gardens and a number of vegetables and other crops are mixed are mixed togetherincluding fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants, staple foods and shade trees. The home gardens in villages surrounding the suburbs of the urban centers are often planted with cab-bages, cauliflower, carrots, Amaranthus lividus (grown in dischum mostly as monocrops. These veg-etables are sold in the neighboring urban and their suburbs markets. The contribution of indigenous vegetables to household food security The home gardens of traditional vegetables in the rural set- ting are characterized by intercropping systems and volun-teer plants during the rainy seasons. In many developing countries, where these gardens predominate, the contribu- tion of traditional vegetable gardening as a food productionstrategy has been overlooked by policy makers and exten- sion staff in favor of exotic vegetables which are mainly pro- duced for commercial purposes (Rubaihayo, 1994). Unfortu-nately, the resource-poor rural households do not benefit from the remarkable increase in exotic vegetable commer- cial production due to the costly inputs of agriculturalchemicals needed for their successful production. There- fore, it is extremely important to develop research and pro- duction strategies that directly enable the poorest of thepoor to produce not only traditional vegetables but also staple foods. Although the contributions from these gardens to family welfare are supplementary in nature, such modest contribu- tions are very important to those who have very little in the rural and urban areas. These poor people often have accessto only under-utilized marginal land and others have very small pieces of land. Intensive home and kitchen gardening can turn this land into a productive source of food and eco-nomic security by using narrative agricultural practices and the traditional vegetables that are already locally adopted. Importance of traditional vegetables. A large proportion of the Ugandan population do not consume adequate amounts of traditional vegetables to meet their daily requirement of vitamins, minerals and proteins. Even what is consumedhas a large proportion of these nutrients destroyed or lost during preparation and cooking. There is reduced effective- ness in ensuring food security all year round due to the factthat very few traditional vegetables are cultivated, with the majority being collected from the wild or fields and planta- tions. In some of the ecosystems they are regarded as weedsand are often weeded out and are not available during the dry season (Rubaihayo, 1994). But this situation can be re- versed through concerted efforts by the government to edu-cate the general population and extension services to cover traditional vegetables and increase research to produce im- proved cultivars, processing, marketing and storage meth-ods. This would lead to the increased consumption of tradi- tional vegetables and their contribution to food security will be enhanced. Family gardens are far more common in less well-to-do households, and constitute the major or the only source of food between harvests or when harvests fail. They provide acritical source of energy and protein, especially to weaning- age children, the sick and elderly. Some of the traditional vegetables can continue to be productive even during thedry season although at a reduced rate due to stunted growth. Habitat destruction and migration to urban areas214IK Notes Number mean that wild foods are no longer available to these re- source-poor rural farmers. Moreover, the commercialization of agriculture has displaced many indigenous crops thatused to ensure a balanced rural diet (Rubaihayo, 1992). It is important to appreciate that traditional vegetables, especially the leafy ones like Amaranthus, (dodo, Bugga) Solanum aethiopicum (Nakati), etc. can be handy under emergency circumstances and hardships arising out of civil conflicts and natural disorders that result in the displace-ment of communities. These traditional vegetables come into production with a short time soon after the onset of rains and can be harvested in three to four weeks afterplanting. These leafy vegetables could then be followed by crops like beans which take two to three months as culti- vated relief food, so that purchased foods are a temporary orsupplementary measure (Rubaihayo 1995b). Women and traditional vegetables . In Uganda, though ru- ral women are responsible for feeding their household, yetthey have limited access to resources. Household gardening offers women an important means of earning income with- out overtly challenging cultural and social restrictions ontheir activities. Home and kitchen gardens can enhance women's purchasing power and food production capacity which has a direct impact on household nutrition, healthand food security. Where traditional vegetables have been commercialized around the city of Kampala and in other urban areas, it is mainly the men who cultivate them. Middle men purchase these vegetables from the farmers(men) and transport them to the markets, and in the mar- ket women buy them and retail them to the general public. The sale of traditional vegetables in women-accessible mar-kets do not only provide food security to those with purchas- ing capacity but the trading women are able to educate their children and, dress and provide their household with essen-tial items in the home thus avoiding abject poverty.Home and kitchen gardens and the environment. Al- though there has not been an extensive study of the effects of traditional vegetable gardening on the environment, it isgenerally believed that household gardens conform to eco- logically sound land management systems. Household food production uses organic farming practices which arefriendly to the environment. The traditional style of house- hold gardens is also critical in conserving diverse plant ge- netic resources (Midmore et al., 1991). Conclusion Traditional vegetables are a common household food and make a substantial, though rarely appreciated contributionto the food security of the rural people in many African countries. Therefore, extensive education about their im- portance as a nutritionally balanced food and as a direct andindirect source of income, particularly for the resource- poor families, must be undertaken by African governments.

For further information email: Sprakash@worldbank.org Knowledge is transferred from one gen- eration to the next and from one coun- try to another through trading ties andsocial interactions between different communities. This has given rise to a number of cross-country exchangesand knowledge sharing activities within Africa and beyond. Farmers and local healers from Mozambique haveexchanged knowledge of best practices with similar communities in Uganda. A number of regional projects such as theLake Victoria Environmental Manage- ment Project have brought together neighboring fishing communities fromKenya, Tanzania and Uganda. These activities reinforce the univer- sality of IK, which is embedded in thetraditional practices of communities in different regions. Despite geographical differences, the ways in which commu-nities in India for instance, make effec- tive use of their environmental and so- cial assets, can provide useful lessonsfor similar communities in Africa. The Sodic Lands Reclamation Project in India provides a good ex-ample of how the integration of tradi- tional knowledge into Bank-supported operations can help transform barrensoils into fertile arable land. In the state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in North India, agricultural yields declined,while the population continued to risethrough the 1980s. Inappropriate irri- gation practices salinated the soils, while brown plant hoppers destroyed40-60 percent of paddy and wheat crops. Most of these lands were owned by poor farmers. To raise agricultural productivity, government extension agencies tried to propagate the use of new farming tech-nologies and systems. However, these practices were not implemented by lo- cal farmers, who, in any case, viewedgovernment agents with suspicion. However, due to poor participatory methods, the technology disseminationdid not reach the farmers. In 1993, the UP Government launched a World Bank supportedfarmer driven Sodic Lands Reclama- tion Project. The goal was to strengthen local institutions, empowerthe beneficiaries and develop a model for transferring service delivery to com- munities. The first challenge was to treat the high build-up of salts in the fields. These soils contain high concentrationsof exchangeable sodium in which finer soil particles are dispersed. As a result, water and air cannot penetrate, andhighly alkaline conditions are created. Known as sodic soils, they are toxic to plants and adversely affect agriculture,human and plant health.216IK Notes Number 45 Application of traditional knowledge Farmers created local site implementation committees and self-help groups. Applying their own knowledge and experi-ences, farmers reclaimed over 68,000 hectares belonging to 247,000 families. They spread gypsum, built bunds, leached the soil, started multi-cropping, green manuring and croprotation, used compost and plowed the land. Maintaining continuous ground cover through intensive cropping pro- tected the soils from a return of surface salts. From the planning to implementation process, the project managers, NGOs and local farmers worked together to de- velop endogenous strategies. These were constantly inno-vated, modified, and adapted to suit local or specific condi- tions. For instance, certain modern practices such as the use of chemical fertilizers were found to be more harmful thangood. In this context, farmers developed indigenous tech- nologies based on traditional knowledge and practices that have proved to be cost-effective and environmentallyfriendly. In some cases, farmers drew from farming practices in other states. In Maharashtra, a local farmer had developed anew technique of composting. The Nadep compost relies on a compost structure using bricks instead of a pit and was ap- plied in over 100 villages in the project area. The higher levels of soil nutrients found in this form of compost reduced the need for fertilizers and pesticides by a quarter, and also reduced the costs of farm inputs. Usingless chemical fertilizers improved the quality, taste and weight of food grains. The flavor and color of scented grains like wheat and basmati rice were also enhanced, enablingfarmers to increase prices. Previously, farmers used various pesticides such as Melathian dust. Today, they are applying indigenous formsof pest control practices, such as the sowing of Daincha (green manure crop) in paddy field boundaries. In some vil- lages like Jivelly, Devari and Dhanepur, farmers use neemproperties to protect crops from pest attacks. In 1997, there was a massive attack of brown plant hop- pers and over 40 percent of the paddy crop was destroyedthroughout Uttar Pradesh. Local farmers knew that kero- sene oil keeps away snakes and can even kill some types of snakes. One of the more knowledgeable farmers in the re-gion speculated that if kerosene oil could kill a snake, it could also kill the brown plant hopper. To test this idea, he sprayed kerosene oil in one square meter of his field, where the attack had occurred. Within a few minutes, all the pests had been destroyed. Based on these results, kerosene was sprayed in the corners of thefield and subsequently in nearby fields. Initially, 10 liters ofkerosene oil were applied on 0.25 hectares. Over time, the farmer modified this technology, using five liters of kerosene oil, mixed with 25kg of paddy husk to treat 0.25 hectares ofreclaimed land. Economic impact These various practices were tried by 600 farmers in differ- ent districts. The result was a substantive reduction in the damage caused by brown plant hoppers from 49 percent down to 2 percent. The success story was soon being repli-cated, as farmers across the state began to control brown plant hopper attacks with neem extracts, rice husks and green manure. In addition, several other indigenous prac-tices that had been used by generations of farmers were back in vogue. These included traditional animal husbandry practices to treat common diseases such as worms, foot dis-ease and pain common to cows and buffaloes. Over time, the knowledge and wisdom of local farmers began to bear fruit. Cropping intensity increased from 37percent to 200 percent. Yields of wheat and rice on re- claimed land were double the projections. After five years, yields and incomes had risen by 60 percent. In some areas,land values have quadrupled after reclamation. Wage rates have doubled as a result of increased economic activity. Women self-help groups are generating incomes by diversi-fying into poultry farming and horticulture. There has also been a substantial reduction in seasonal la- bor migration out of project villages. As one beneficiary inShobapur village said, \"because my usar (sodic) fields were barren, I used to go to Bhopal, Bombay and Calcutta looking for work. Now that they have been reclaimed, where is thetime?\" Farmers' School in Pratapgarh, Uttar Pradesh However, the sustainability of any reclamation project de- pends upon the effective management of these lands. Regu- lar access to information on new agricultural practices and technologies are some of the vital ingredients needed to sus-tain multi-cropping systems in such areas. Keeping this in mind and the fact that Bank support would not last forever, a group of key resource persons and trained farmers cametogether to devise innovative new strategies, drawing upon indigenous resources and knowledge about agricultural practices. This led to the formation of a Farmers Field School in Pratapgarh. These practices were institutionalized and widely disseminated through the school. Initially there were217 twelve master trainers in the school. Each one had to dem- onstrate in his own field how certain practices proved to be beneficial, before others began to replicate these practices.Training was conducted in the local dialects such as Avdi. Topics covered included improved drainage networks, green manuring, composting, use of bio-fertilizers, creditmanagement, self help groups and multi-cropping. Each of these drew on years of indigenous experiences in dealing with challenges such as the brown plant hopper attacks.Once the results showed positive gains, they were dissemi- nated from one village to another through trainers. The training is mostly hands-on and involves farmer-to- farmer exchanges. For instance, a group of farmers are taken to an area reclaimed earlier to see differences in soil fertility and rates of progress. Farmers from the project areahave also been taken on study tours and exchange visits to other parts of the country (Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat) to share and learn from the practices of otherfarmers. Such exchanges have broadened their knowledge base through exposure to different types of traditional knowledge systems. Today, Uttar Pradesh has begun to hand over training and extension services to local farmers' schools, which reach more than 7,200 farmers in 65 villages beyond the project area. The village of Dhanepur In 1996, in the middle of barren lands in Narangpur, that had been reclaimed, a project worker planted a bale tree.The sodic land was ash white and completely deserted. There was no sign of any vegetation. Slowly, the tree began to blossom and farmers from nearby villages started to cultivate the land. Soon veg- etables were being grown. Small settlements began to emerge around the Saroj tree. Today, an entire village hasmushroomed in the areas, known as Dhanepur. The village has a community-owned water pump, sugar cane processor, flour grinder, paddy thresher and animalfodder processor. These are all near each other, to be jointly operated by electricity or a diesel engine. The machinery has been adapted to local conditions, using local innovations. Earlier, farmers could only harvest a single crop from their fields. Today they are planting four crops, using the multi-cropping techniques taught by the school, growing pi-geon pee, millets and black gram. These are sown together in the fields which are watered through drip irrigation. The result is four/five times higher yields from the same fields.Incomes have increased by five times as a result of these higher yields. In the past, farmers managed to save $110 per year. Today their annual savings have risen to $555. These savings have been carefully invested in housing, electricity and roads to connect the village to other areas and markets. Previously, there were poor linkages and com-munications. Higher incomes have dramatically improved the quality of life in the village. Most people were illiterate. Today, thereare educational programs for children. There has been a significant change in local attitudes. Ini- tially, the farmers were divided over the project. One groupwas ready to cooperate with the implementing agencies and the other comprising of larger farm-holders, opposed the project. However, when these farmers saw the lands of thosewho actively participated in the project turn green, while theirs remained infertile and ash-colored, they soon came around. Today, they are only too eager to participate in thesecond phase of the project. Self-help groups empower women The training provided to women by the farmers school has had a major impact at the household level, driving forward social and economic changes to improve the welfare of the entire family. Today over 175 women's' self help groupshave been formed, such as the Kaveri Mahela Self-Help Group. Formed in 1995, the Kaveri group initially comprised 15 members. Each member saved 10 cents per month, which then increased from 40 cents to 80 cents over the next six months. Today, each member saves up to $6 per month. Thefunds are saved in the local bank under a joint fund called the Kaveri Self Help Fund. Having saved a fair amount, the women started an inter- nal lending scheme within the group. They also took out in- dividual loans worth $100-$200 from the local bank to in- vest in modern technologies such as a sugar cane processor. These self help-groups have also become effective agents of social change in the countryside and have addressed sev- eral sensitive issues, such as the dowry system. Today, alarge number of women in this district can read, write and comprehend complex aspects of their business transactions. The State Minister for Agriculture visited the school and recommended that such innovative methods of self-help ag- ricultural extension should be replicated through-out the state. The European Union is funding a reclamation project218IK Notes Number with the same design in three other districts. This will build on the primary lessons learned from the first phase of the project: building on indigenous knowledge increases sus-tainable agricultural production and provides a model for transferring service delivery to communities.Community-to-community exchanges could be the con- duit for transferring such knowledge across countries and continents. Given that agriculture is the dominating factorin most African economies and in India, the appropriate dis- semination and use of indigenous knowledge could prove very fruitful.45219This article was written by Fernando Dava, Zuber Ahmed, and Peter Easton.

IK Notes 46 July 2002The Role of Myths and Rites in Managing NaturalResources along the Mozambican Shoreline Mozambique is a country both rich in natural resources and increasingly threatened by the depletion and degra-dation of this heritage. Years of war, economic pressure, falling crop prices, urbanization and climate change havebegun to have drastic effects on the country's resource base. Though 10 percent of the land is kept in forest re-serve, large stretches of land have been denuded, particularly along the borders with Zimbabwe and South Africa. Ma-jor areas of coastline are suffering from pollution from industrial and agricul- tural run-off. Population pressure hasresulted in the near disappearance of the large wild animals that once inhab- ited much of the country. Depletion of natural resources is a national issue, but it is also a local one. As in many developing countries, nu-merous Mozambican communities de- pend for their survival on the judicious exploitation of their physical environ-ment. Managing them so they remain available generation after generation is the key challenge. Nowhere is this feltmore acutely than along the country's extensive coastline, which stretches al- most 3,000 km. from the Tanzanianborder in the north to the frontier with South Africa. Communities all along this natural barrier rely heavily on har-vesting the resources of the sea: fish,mussels and other forms of marine life. They are a source of protein and a source of revenue. The importance ofthis bounty to the community's very existence has given rise to a complex of rites, myths and rituals. These serveboth to enshrine the sanctity of the en- vironment and to \"manage\" its com- munal exploitation. How do these \"indigenous\" forms of management function and how\u2014if at all\u2014can they be adapted to master thenew challenges to the natural resource base: population pressure and pollu- tion? Local institutions in Mozambiqueare just beginning to come to grips with the issue, but their experience is in- structive. The mussel farmers of Zimilene Zimilene is a small village situated at the mouth of the Limpopo River in theGaza Province of southern Mozam- bique, a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo. It is also known by the lo-cals as Kamhula, Inhampurra, or Zongoene . In this region of the Indian Ocean, rock formations have createdthe basis for a thriving local economy and the focus for a particular spiritual understanding of the relation of peopleto their environment.220IK Notes Number 46 The rocks lie close to the surface in areas of water rich in phytoplankton, providing a rich milieu for the growth of dense mussel colonies. For years, the villagers have har-vested this resource yearly, using it as a source of protein and of revenue. For them, the rocks were placed at that point along the coast by divine intervention and have beenthere as long as collective memory can recall. The community believes that their ancestors became the owners and stewards of these rocks when they settled in theregion. The principal original families to take up residence along this part of the coast\u2014the Bunzula, the Palate, Machava, Nhancuma, and Nhabanga\u2014parceled out the re-source and assumed responsibility for the management of the mussel shoals, guided by the guardian spirits of their clans. Each family assigned guards to watch over the musselbeds. But family representatives function under the super- vision of a higher local authority, the Chief Zimila, a lineal a descendant of the first person to have occupied the region,whose clannic spirit is considered more powerful than those of the family lineages. The system ensures a source for re- solving conflicts and allotting usage rights that are acceptedright down to individual community members. The catch of the mussels Mussels are normally harvested during the cold season in Mozambique, between March and August. In the early months of the year the first signs of mussels appear along the shoals, and the colonies start growing. As soon as thesesigns are detected, the guards of each mussel bed inform family chiefs of the event, requesting permission to begin the cleaning of algae and other weeds that enhances musselgrowth and eases harvesting. This weeding of the beds re- quires care, as it is easy to damage the young mussels. Thin sticks and machetes are used for the purpose. Once the\"field\" is clean, the mussels grow much more abundantly. Under normal circumstances, villagers are not allowed to begin harvesting until the mussel beds have reached fullmaturation. Special dispensation is allowed, however, in cases of emergency or pronounced need, such as famine or visits from unexpected visitors. This early harvest is care-fully regulated and limited by the family and supreme chiefs. Also, the role of the chiefs is to ensure an even distri- bution of the resource between the villagers. This is ensuredby a local saying\u2014\"the mussel is eaten in community.\" When the mussels are fully mature, the guards blow whistles throughout the community to inform everyone,even those who are not from the village itself, that the catch is open. Outsiders have traditionally been allowed to har- vest mussels along with local residents as a form of hospital-ity. Each person collects what their family needs and hun- dreds of people may turn out to harvest the mussels. The work is arduous and can be dangerous. For this reason, col-lection is not carried out randomly and everywhere at once. Rather the work starts at one end of the rock shoals and slowly moves to the other end. This allows family and com-munity chiefs to keep control of events and provide immedi- ate care for anyone wounded. They are also charged with ensuring a fair allocation. The \"spirits\" and the rule of law The authority of the chiefs to regulate the mussel harvest is anchored in the firm belief that the spirits of the ancestorswatch over the shoals. The guards posted by each family leave the rocks at sunset and the spiritual guardians from each lineage are considered to take over the role of protectoruntil sunrise. That spiritual patronage is celebrated in rite and myth. \"We talk to the spirits embodied in our curandeiros (tradi- tional priests) or called by them,\" explains the chief of the Banzula lineage. \"The spirits teach us how to preserve the rocks. It is to keep the spirits happy that we do our ceremo-nies, so that they will protect the rocks and the mussels.\" Ceremonies are in fact held at two levels; within each lin- eage or family and for the community as a whole. The chiefof each of the families takes charge of ceremonies for the portion of shoals under his lineage's responsibility. The community-wide ceremony is presided by the Chief Zimilahimself and includes all families in the region. Before orga- nizing the large ceremony, the paramount chief consults with all the family chiefs in a meeting of the council of el-ders. Family chiefs are responsible for catering the event.. All members of the community are expected to participate in the large event as well as to contribute goods for cateringthe ceremony. The contributions are remitted to the family chiefs who in turn hands them over to Chief Zimila. One ceremony is held before the catch is open to ask for a goodmussel harvest, and another when it is over to give thanks for the bounty received. The spirits are believed to have an important role in sanc- tioning those who violate the rules. As one family chief puts it, \"During the day each family has a guard who controls ac- cess to the rocks. At night the spirits of each family guardthe rocks until sunrise. Everyone knows they cannot take this lightheartedly. Violators risk being thrown into the sea [by the spirits] or being unable to leave the collection area,never finding their way back home. The path to their houses becomes deeply dark.\"221 Stolen mussels are also believed to be poor fare. \"Once in the cooking pot,\" the chief says, \"the mussels can be boiled for a full day without ever becoming cooked. No one whoknows these rules wants to risk the sanctions of the spirits).\" The challenge of cross-breeding systems The local system of myths, beliefs and rites in Zimilene pre- served the mussel shoals for generations, but under the pressure of the changes afoot in Mozambique they have be- come more than a local resource. In recent years the popula-tion of nearby cities like Xai-Xai has had increasingly easy access to the Zimilene shoals, and at the same time the pres- sures of poverty and population density have pushed themto exploit the mussel beds in ways inconsistent with tradi- tional management and with survival of the resource. The families of Zimilene appealed to administrative au- thorities to help solve the problem and save the mussels. After consultation, it was decided to put in place a Mussel Rocks Management Committee, composed of the traditionalleaders and and one or more representatives of the adminis- trative authority. The regional chief supervises selection of delegates from the family lineages responsible for eachstretch of shoals. On the administrative side the head of the administrative post of Chilaulene, which encompasses Zimilene, either serves on the committee or picks someoneto represent him. The committee serves both to give wider sanction to the rites, ceremonies and regulations of Zimilene and to dealwith violations, particularly by urban dwellers and other outsiders who are increasingly drawn to the mussel beds. In fact, \"violators\" are principally outsiders because, whilestrong beliefs prevent most local people from poaching on the beds, city-dwellers typically do not have the same belief system. The committee therefore has the authority to rec-ommend a variety of administrative or even penal sanctions for those who violate the usage rules of the mussel beds. Consequently, in the initial operations of the committee, the traditional and spiritually sanctioned management sys- tem was simply placed side-by-side with a more \"modern\" and administrative one. The first applied to local people, thesecond to outsiders.But this \"split personality\" solution also has its weak- nesses. For one thing, outsiders may be able to more easily evade administrative sanction than insiders feel they canevade the wrath of the spirits. For another, increasing out- side pressure on the resource base would likely result in the administrative apparatus and system of penal sanctionstaking on increasing importance and the traditional and spiritual one shrinking in scope until it was only a folkloric remnant. The challenge facing the committee is therefore how to \"cross-breed\" the two systems\u2014how to infuse what must be a more widely administered regulation system with some ofthe essence of traditional management, with its reverence for natural resource and internally-driven compliance. Two directions have opened up, but it is not yet sure whether either, both or yet another will be principally adopted. One solution involves expanding the role of family guardians both logistically and spiritually by assisting themin ensuring twenty-four-hour monitoring of the shoals as the embodiment of ancestral concern for the sanctity of the entire nation's resource base. Another, perhaps a comple-mentary but longer-term one entails using some of the curanderios to teach ecological responsibility in schools and campaigning for a new region-wide ethos of respect for theenvironment. The traditional mechanisms show that rural communities have their own ways to explain the world and to protecttheir own resources. Such examples can be found in various regions of the country, where resources such as forests, land and fish and seafood are protected through these mecha-nisms. They allowed for these resources to be used by gen- erations of people without endangering their availability. Yet the use of such myths and rites cannot easily be gener- alized, because they are closely tied to place and historical experience, and are sanctioned by a particular set of ances- tors. Other Mozambicans do not share the same history and\"cosmogony\" as the population of Zimilene. But they do share, to some extent, a common fate, as a community, a common risk of resource depletion and alienation from theirphysical milieu. The challenge of the mussel shoals, re- peated in many sites around the country these days, is how to blend traditional systems of regulation, myth, and ritualwith a necessary administrative armature to build new com- munally shared meanings and a new culture of natural re- source management.222IK Notes 47 August 2002Using the Indigenous Knowledge of Jatropha The use of Jatropha curcas oil as raw material and fuel This article was written by Reinhard K. Henning, e-mail: henning@bagani.de, internet: www.bagani.de. For more information on the Jatropha System see also: www.jatropha.org Mali is a landlocked country in the middle of West Africa, just at the south- ern edge of the Sahara desert. Thecountry's average annual rainfall ranges from 200 mm in the north to 1200 mm in the south. For generations,farmers have protected their gardens with hedges of Jatropha curcas , or physic nut, which is not eaten by ani-mals and thus protects the food crops as a living fence. Jatropha curcas is a plant of Latin American origin which is now wide- spread throughout arid and semiarid tropical regions of the world. A memberof the Euphorbiaceae family, it is a drought-resistant perennial, living up to 50 years and growing on marginalsoils. A close relative to the castor plant, its oil has the same medical prop- erties. Jatropha seeds contain about 35percent of non-edible oil. The produc- tion of seeds is about 0.8 kg per meter of hedge per year, with an oil yield of0,17 l. 1 Currently, Mali has about 10.000 km of Jatropha hedges with a growth rate of 2.000 km per year, whichrepresents a potential of 1.700.000 li- ters of oil per year. The average length of these hedges, in those areas of Maliwhere they are most prevalent, is be- tween 2 and 15 km per village, with a maximum of up to 40 km per village. 2Jatropha curcas is generally well- known among the populations of Mali and has long been recognized as a plantof many uses. If carefully planted, Jat- ropha hedges not only protect gardens from hungry livestock but also reducedamage and erosion from wind and wa- ter. Traditionally the seeds were har- vested by women and used for medicaltreatments and local soap production. As far back as at the end of the 1930s the oil's potential as a fuel source wasalso recognized. 3 Currently, it can be used to substitute for the \"gazoil\" mix- ture used in the Indian type diesel en-gines that drive grain mills and water pumps in rural areas of Mali. The high- quality oil extracted by engine-drivenexpellers or by manual Bielenberg- ram-presses or the sediment of the oil purification process may be used forlarge-scale soap making in rural areas, giving local women the chance to gain additional income and strengthen theireconomic position. The press-cake as another extraction by-product can be used as a high-grade organic fertilizer. The Jatropha activities were initi- ated in Mali in 1987 by German Tech- nical Assistance (GTZ) in the frame-work of a renewable energy programme. The Jatropha Project it- self started 1993 and ended in 1997. It223 worked to combine the above mentioned and other factors into the \u00ab Jatropha System \u00bb. This system focuses not sim- ply on the use of Jatropha oil as fuel, but rather on the useof this oil as a crucial element to activate a circular system combining ecologic, economic, and income-generating ef- fects, the latter specifically for women. 4 Thus, the Jatropha system promotes four main aspects of development, which combine to help assure a sustainable way of life for village farmers and the land that supportsthem: \u007f Erosion control and soil improvement \u007f Promotion of women\u007f Poverty reduction \u007f Renewable energy Erosion control and soil improvement Jatropha \"living fences\" in Mali not only control unwanted animal access to the fields; they also reduce wind erosion and, if planted parallel to slopes to fix small earth or stonedams, they help control water erosion. The plant's roots grow close to the ground surface, anchoring the soil like miniature dikes or earthen bunds. These dikes effectivelyslow surface runoff during intensive downpours, which are common, thus causing more water to penetrate into the soil and boosting harvests. The press cake which remains after oil extraction by the expellers is a very good organic fertilizer, with mineral com- position comparable to that of chicken manure. This hasgreat value for agriculture in the Sahelian countries, since soils there are rapidly depleted of humus and chemical fer- tilizers are very Malienne de D\u00e9veloppement Textile), uses Jatropha hedges to assure a program of improved fallow: the cotton fields areprotected with Jatropha hedges to keep out cattle, while the fields are sown with legumes to improve soil fertility. Promotion of women Many government and non-government organizations pro- vide rural Malian women with engine-driven grainmills to ease their work of food preparation. However, thesegrainmills need external resources of fuel, lubrication oil, spare parts and maintenance. Consequently, the introduc- tion of such a grainmill tends to lead to an impoverishmentof the village because of the cash required both to buy and to transport these external resources to the village. By using locally produced Jatropha oil as fuel and lubrication oil,some of this cash outflow from the village can be stopped.Traditionally, rural women used Jatropha curcas for medicine (seeds as a laxative, latex to stop bleeding and against infections, leaves against malaria) and for soap pro-duction. The traditional soap-making process is very labor- intensive, producing small amounts of relatively poor-qual- ity soap. When Jatropha oil is used, either alone or in combi-nation with other local plant oils such as shea butter, larger amounts of a more refined soap are produced. The women can easily sell this soap in local markets and nearby towns,increasing their possibilities of earning income with local resources. Some details of the economy of soap production with the means of the Bielenberg hand press are shown in the follow- ing table (prices in US$, 500 FCFA = 1 US$): Poverty reduction By promoting the integrated utilization of the Jatropha plant, the Jatropha System can provide direct financial ben- efits to the rural economy. To illustrate this with a roughcalculation, assume the average village of the pilot area has 15 km of Jatropha hedges, which represents 12 tons of seeds. These 12 tons of seeds may generate 1.800 US$ of cash income when the oil is extracted and the products are sold: \u007f 9.000 kg of presscake for 0.03 = US$270 2.400 liters of oil for 0.60 = US$1.440 \u007f 600 kg of sediment for 0.15 = U S$90 Total US$1.800US$ If we take the real example of an entrepreneur in a small village near Bamako, who buys the seeds for soap produc-tion and hires people for the production process (extraction with Bielenberg ram press, soap production, see table above), the cash income for the village population, includingthe entrepreneur, amounts to 3.630 US$: \u007f 12.000 kg of seeds for 0.10 5.000 hours of labor for 0.20 US$1.000 \u007f profit of the entrepreneur US$1.430 Total US$3.630 If these figures are extrapolated to Jatropha plantations, a profit in the range of cotton farming is within reach. The \"Jatropha System\" also helps reduce poverty by: \u007f Reducing crop losses caused by wandering livestock or wind damage; \u007f Increasing rainfall infiltration, resulting in less work/irri- gation water needed for local gardens; \u007f Increasing soil fertility by use of presscake as fertilizer;224IK Notes Number 47 \u007f Increasing use of inexpensive local resources rather than expensive external resources; \u007f Reducing disputes between farmers and livestock owners regarding crop damage, as well as among farmers them-selves regarding the boundaries of their fields; \u007f Providing local jobs, lessening the need for local villagers to migrate to cities to find employment. Because of its economic value the rural people are plant- ing new Jatropha hedges in a large extent. In Kita, one ofthe pilot regions of the Jatropha project, the average length of hedges went up from 5 km to 15 km in the last 8 years. Renewable energy In the rural areas in Mali, Lister-type engines are used to drive grainmills and waterpumps. These inexpensive pre- combustion chamber diesel engines of Indian origin requireonly the addition of a fuel filter to be able to run on pure Jatropha oil, thus eliminating the need for gazoil entirely. Furthermore, at maximal load conditions the Jatrophaoil.gives even better results than gazoil because of its high oxygen content. 5 Based on tests conducted by the Jatropha Project, the oil can also be successfully used as a lubricant inthese engines. 6 In equivalent terms, the energy needed to produce Jatro- pha oil in mechanical presses amounts to about 10 percentof the oil obtained. Because Jatropha oil can be produced in- expensively, 7 it can also be sold at prices lower than gazoil'sofficial price at the petrol stations. Even more important than the price is the possibility of local energy production, becauseof the periodic unavailability of gazoil in the rural areas caused by lack of road access during rainy season. The technology for using natural pure Jatropha oil as substitute for paraffin oil for lamps and cookers is not yet available. Different research centers are working on it. Conclusions The results of the Jatropha Project to date show that the chances of this system being successfully implemented are high, provided that a cautious approach is taken. Above all,care must be taken to ensure that women retain their tradi- tional responsibilities for harvesting and processing the seeds. Furthermore, Mali is a typical Sahelian country; its large geographic expanse and climatic variations mirror the eco- logical conditions found throughout the Sahel. Because ofthis, the efforts already being made in Mali to derive value from oil-bearing plants can be taken as representative and used to elaborate a \"concept for production and use of plantoils as fuel\" that is valid for the Sahel region as a whole, and even for other African countries. To summarize, the Jatropha system is characterized by the many positive ecological, energetic and economic as- pects which are attached with the commercial exploitation of this plant. The more this plant is exploited, the better forthe environment and for food production.Description Quantity Unity Price per Amount unity US$ in US$ InputsSeeds (give 3 l of oil with handpress) 12 kg 0,1 1,20 Caustic soda 0,5 kg 1,2 0,60Labour (4 h pressing,1 h soap 0,27White soap 28 pieces (170 g) 0,15 4,20 Total revenues 4,47 Net Profit 1,43 Profit per liter of oil 0,48 Profit per kg of soap 0,31 Price per kg of soap 0,89225 References 1 Reinhard K.

For more information, e-mail hcfp.aau@telecom.net.et In many developing countries, the in- adequacy of current health financing arrangements, typified by progres-sively declining budgetary allocations and more cost sharing schemes have led to the exploration of additional andalternative approaches to improve the financing situation. Among the alter- natives suggested are risk-sharingmechanisms that include community- based schemes that tap the potential of traditional social arrangements. In Ethiopia, eders are forms of tradi- tional arrangements utilized mainly for assisting those bereaved and for ex-ecuting funeral-related activities. These associations are also called upon for various self-help activities andsometimes act as health insurers, though largely in a less formal manner. They have an obvious potential forserving as social financing mecha- nisms. Since these are already func- tioning groups, the administrativecosts for the extra health-related activ- ity are not as inhibiting as when form- ing a new insurance entity. In addition,eders are based on mutual understand- ing among members, which reduces the possibility of adverse selection.Organization and structure of eders Eder is a form of traditional social insti- tution that is established by the mutualagreement of community members in order to collaborate with each other whenever any member or their familymembers face adverse situations. The primary function of the eder is taking care of the burial and consolatory ac-tivities when death occurs within mem- bers. However, eders also provide assis- tance to offset losses to a member (dueto theft, etc), during the weddings of members, etc. Besides these, eders are of paramount importance in other de-velopmental activities within the sur- rounding community. Eders raise funds or coordinate the free labor of membersin activities such as building roads, schools, health institutions and the like. Some eders contribute money to members who have lost their houses in a fire or to compensate for the loss of farming oxen, while others also provideassistance to members to cover their medical costs. The organizational setup of most eders is very simple. All eders have a chairman or a 'judge' and almost all will have a Secretary and a Treasurer.Eders are said to be the most demo- cratic and egalitarian social organiza-Ethiopia227 tions in Ethiopia\u2014membership is open to everyone regard- less of socio-economic status, religion, sex, and ethnic affilia- tion. Even though very few respondents mentioned not be-ing able to pay contributions as a reason for non-member- ship of eders , almost all eders have provisions for members who face economic problems and are unable to pay contri-butions after having been members for some time. These members are considered as \"pensioned\" by the eder and are allowed to receive all the benefits that are due to othermembers. The potential of eders in financing health care The organizational structure of eders that currently have a health care function is not very different from those that are not providing these services\u2014obviously, there would be a clear emphasis in these on health issues. Essential here is aclose link and on-going communication with health institu- tions that give services to members. The financial logic of the eder is not different from any in- surance system. In most situations members contribute a fixed amount of money on a weekly or monthly basis. When- ever a member has a problem, a fixed amount (depending onthe by-laws of the particular eder) is taken out of the com- mon pool and given to that member. There are also a few eders which raise the fixed contribution whenever the prob- lem arises. In a community-based health insurance feasibil- ity study conducted by the author and a representative of BASICS* (Basic Support for Institutionalizing Child Sur-vival, an organization that helps to implement USAID-sup- ported programs) in three towns, Adama, in the oromia Re- gion and Yirgalem and Arbaminet in the Southern Region,eders were found to provide financial assistance for mem- bers' medical problems. For instance, in one of the eders in- cluded in the study, a lump sum payment of up to US$15was given to households where a family member needs hos- pitalization. This amount covers the advance payment re- quired by the hospitals prior to admitting a patient. A follow-up survey was also conducted by the author in 1999 in systematically selected rural villages of the country. The data for this part of the survey were collected throughhousehold and health facility exit interview surveys. Ac- cording to the findinngs of this latter survey, about 87 per-cent of household survey respondents and 72 percent of the exit interview survey respondents were participating in eders with mean annual payments of US$7 (ranging from1.5 to 60 birr) and US$8 (ranging from 1.5 to 68 birr) for household and exit respondents respectively. More im- portantly, 21.5 percent of the household survey respondentsand 16 percent of the exit interview respondents claimed that their eders provide assistance during the time of medi- cal need. The type of assistance provided ranges from loansto covering all medical costs of members. The respondents in both the exit and the household interviews were asked if they would be willing to join a possible eder-based health insurance scheme. Eighty six percent in the household sur- vey and 90 percent in the exit survey were willing to join such a scheme. The average monthly contribution whichthe respondents reported as being able to raise was birr 2.5 (US $0.3) with a range of birr 1 to 36 (US $0.13 to $4.5) in the household survey and birr 3.4 (US$ 0.4) with a range ofbirr 1 to 48 (US $0.13 to $6) in the exit interview survey. Respondents in the exit survey (who had a recent experi- ence of the financial cost of illness) sowed a higher propen-sity to join possible eder-based health insurance schemes with a slightly higher willingness to pay in terms of monthly premiums. The benefits most valued by the respondentswere emergency services followed by drugs. It is obvious that people in rural areas where there are inadequate facili- ties for emergency services (including obstetric services)would be willing to join schemes that would make these ser- vices available to them. A case in point is an eder in one of the sampled villages that gave a loan of about US$25 to apregnant mother-to-be facing obstructed labor. The money was used to hire emergency transport service to take the mother to a health center located about 40 kilometers fromthe village. The popularity of the eder amongst people from all walks of life has been growing. These non-profit-making institu-tions based on solidarity, friendship and mutual assistance among members may possess both the techniques of en- forcement and the appropriate incentives for applyingthem\u2014vital qualities that one looks for when examining the role of indigenous institutions in socio-economic develop- ment. Overall, it can be surmised that eder-based schemes would improve the efficiency of service delivery. *Dr. Logan Brenzel (health care financing advisor for BASICS .228IK Notes Number Rreferences Aredo, D.

In Honduras, as the result of the work of some 20 agricultural development agencies up through the early 1990s,hundreds of farmer experimenters (FEs) have been experimenting totally on their own for anywhere from two toten years after the closing of the pro- grams in which they were previously involved. In 1999, the Association ofAdvisors for a Sustainable, Ecological and People-Centered Agriculture (COSECHA) in Honduras decided tofind out what technologies these FEs had been developing on their own, and how these technologies could best bedisseminated to other farmers. To that end, COSECHA has systematically in- terviewed 50 of these FEs. The tech-nologies counted were only those that small farmers had developed on their own, after program termination, andthat had not been promoted or known within the country prior to the FE's discovery of the technology. The study shows that FEs are able to develop large numbers of significant and original technologies, providingevidence that the collection and dis- semination of FE technologies in other nations around the world could be auseful activity for institutions involved in agricultural development.Participatory technology develop- ment (PTD) programs in Honduras Starting with the initiation of the World Neighbors-managed Guinope Program in January of 1981, PTD hasbecome a fairly widely used methodol- ogy of agricultural development in Honduras. Some 20 development orga-nizations taught farmers to experiment in at least 30 different programs around the country. Many of these pro-grams ended by the early 1990s, with the result that Honduras is one of the richest nations in terms of its per capitaconcentration of FEs who have been ex- perimenting without any institutional support. However, no institution hadever studied this phenomenon. The study COSECHA has made visits to both the FEs homes and the fields where they apply the technology they developed. During these visits, an interview is car-ried out, which consists of an informal conversation in which the interviwer tries to make sure thateach of a list ofsome twenty issues is covered. After each visit (which typically takes at leasthalf a day), the list of questions230IK Notes Number 49 prepared at the beginning of the study is checked to make sure all the questions have been dealt with, and those that have been missed are asked. The questions deal with such issues as what technologies the FE has experimented with, and what technologies seem to be successful (i.e., which ones the farmer has adopted forcontinuing use). Detailed descriptions of the successful technologies are made, with a cost/analysis in each case comparing this technology to control plots. Data as to theelevation, amount of rain, total size of landholding, slope of the fields, etc. are also taken. The farmer is also asked about other farmers' responses to, and adoption of, the technology.COSECHA also inquired into such issues as what the farmer feels are his/her limiting factors, whether he/she would be interested in working with certain marketing ven-tures, whether the farmer would be interested in joining a nation-wide organization of FEs and, if so, what the princi- pal objectives of the organization should be. The results to date: technologies discovered Fifty-two FEs from 10 of Honduras' 23 departments have been interviewed. These FEs include farmers who had beenoriginally trained by 17 different organizations, ranging from 12 NGOs to 3 governmental and semi-governmental organizations and 2 academic institutions. They also in-clude 7 women FEs, even though women in Central America, by and large, are not heavily involved in extensive cropping (that is, outside the homestead garden) until afterthe harvest, nor had they been trained to be FEs by the pro- grams in the 1980s and early 1990s. These 52 FEs have developed 82 technologies, mostly hav- ing to do with extensive agriculture, but including a small minority of post-harvest and food preparation technologies. An attempt has been made to grade these technologies inthree categories. Category A represents those technologies which seem valuable enough in terms of farmer benefits ac- crued and width of applicability among other farmers inHonduras rendering them worthy of further validation and then, depending on the results of the validation process, dis- seminating to other farmers. Category B includes thosetechnologies that might be worth validating, but which would be done later. Category C includes those technologies that very likely are not worth disseminating. Althoughthese are necessarily rather subjective evaluations, COSECHA does work with a list of 19 criteria of an appro- priate technology (Bunch 1982) that helps us evaluate eachtechnology.Of the 82 original technologies developed, 39 have been classified as being in Category A. Of these 39, the following number pertained to each of the categories listed below: Insect control 15 Fertilization 10 Control of plant diseases 8Weed control 2 Food preparation 2 Animal husbandry 2Plant propagation 1 Green manuring 1 Soil conservation 1Others 3 __ 45 The total of technologies is greater than 39 because some of the technologies included aspects of two categories. It can be observed from this list that FEs have chosen to experiment with a wide variety of different technologies, in- cluding even some (e.g., food preparation) which are notcommonly included within the purview of agriculture. It is also interesting, however, that a few categories of technologies have been totally left out. Not a single FE ex-perimented with water harvesting or use, even though many areas of Honduras have moderate to severe droughts;in much of southern Honduras, periodic and over-all water shortages are without doubt the critical limiting factor in the production systems of villager farmers. Fur- thermore, experience with FEs in current programs pro-vides major evidence that while they are very interested in experimenting with water harvesting and more efficient water use, none of these FEs are included in the study be-cause this COSECHA program is still in operation. It is also interesting to note that none of the technologies have to do with the introduction of new crops (although thecriteria used in the study, perhaps too restrictive, would eliminate the inclusion of the introduction of any crop that already existed anywhere else in Honduras) or the use oftree crops or agroforestry. First of all, it is very likely that some categories of technology (e.g., water harvesting) were never experimented with because farmers either neverthought any solutions were within their grasp, or simply because working with such technologies had never occurred to them. Thus, future agricultural programs should discusswith farmers before they terminate their work in an area, what possible future technologies might be used.231 Second, farmers may be aware of certain types of tech- nologies they could work with, but may not perceive those technologies as being of a very high priority for them. Forinstance, in the case of tree crops, FEs are certainly aware that they exist and are profitable, but may feel that the many years one must wait before payback make these tech-nologies of less priority than those with a quicker payback. This might also be the case with agroforestry systems, al- though farmers in southern Honduras in the FAO program,which is emphasizing dispersed trees, are experimenting quite a lot with various modifications of the dispersed tree system. Of course, FEs probably did not experiment with new crops because the crops, in order to be included within the study, would have to be crops only grown outside Honduras,in which case the FEs would have had considerable diffi- culty learning about the crops or obtaining planting mate- rial. Promising technologies developed \u007f Farmers observed that aphids died if dried out. They therefore tried using wheat flour diluted in water to sprayon fruit trees in their tree nurseries, and found they could control aphids and other similar sucking insects fairly easily this way. \u007f Sugar water or slightly salty water, applied to the growing tip of the plant, was tried successfully as a way of control- ling the corn borer. \u007f Another FE noticed that leaf-cutter ants did not like liv- ing near neem trees. By planting neem trees immediately over several troublesome nests of leaf-cutter ants, he wasable to get rid of them (they moved their nest elsewhere). \u007f Foliar fertilizers were developed using either animal ma- nure, mother of cacao leaves, the leaves of several com-mon weeds, or even wood ashes (the last one also proving to be very useful in disease prevention). \u007f One woman FE found that coffee pulp could be dried just by spreading it out to dry in the sun. Another FE found that just mixing the wet coffee pulp with chicken manure or sawdust would also dry it out. Once dried, the coffeepulp is an excellent fertilizer, one that previously just pol- luted the country's rivers. \u007f A solution of leaves of mother of cacao and eucaliptus was found to be very good as a fungicide for tree nurseries. \u007f One farmer found he could apparently disinfect the soil in a nursery by cultivating the soil well and then covering itwith clear plastic so that it heated up thoroughly under the mid-day sun.\u007f Both spraying crops with wood ashes dissolved in water, as well as placing wood ashes around the stems of plants, have been found to control a series of plant diseases, evenvery treacherous ones like late blight ( Phytophthera infestans) in tomatos and potatoes. \u007f A maize-based animal feed was made including leaves from the Tithonia and eggshells, thereby increasing egg production. \u007f One FE found that, at altitudes over 500m, grafting neem material on to the locally available \"paradise\" tree root- stock resulted in much faster growth of neem trees. \u007f Another FE found that by intercropping jackbeans (Canavalia ensiformis) among his cassava plants, he greatly reduced his weeding time and increased his cas- sava productivity by over 25 percent. It should be noted that these technologies are in almost every way technologies that would be included under the la-bel of low-input or ecological technologies, and in many cases, in the category of totally organic technologies. They are also technologies that are highly appropriate for poorlycapitalized villager farmers. By and large, they are ex- tremely inexpensive (most require absolutely no cash out- put), they use locally available resources, they do not in-crease risk, they provide fairly quick, recognizable returns, most of them are highly cost-efficient, and most of them are fairly widely applicable. The above list shows quite clearlythat villager FEs not only can develop innovative technolo- gies, but that the technologies they develop are highly ap- propriate for other small farmers. One of the most disappointing results of the study was that the technologies developed by small farmers had not been disseminated very widely. In no case did FE-generatedtechnology spread to more than 10 other farmers through the exclusive efforts of local villagers. Lessons learned \u007f This study leaves little doubt as to whether villager FEs can develop, on their own, both adaptive and basic tech- nologies that appear to have considerable potential forfarmers around the country, if not around the world. While these technologies still need to be further verified, their potential, according to established criteria of appro-priateness and their economic cost-benefit ratios, would seem to be quite high. \u007f Different organizations in Honduras have used different techniques to train FEs. It was noticed, in the course of this study, that organizations which had used the tech-232IK Notes Number nique of maximizing success in farmers' experiments dur- ing the first few experiments they did, had motivated far more farmers to experiment in the future than did the re-maining organizations. Achieving rapid, recognizable suc- cess among farmer experimenters right from the start is thus an important part of the total motivational processnecessary for people to expend the effort to experiment frequently. \u007f In some cases, programs will not be able to find any al- ready validated, successful technology already being used by any programs in a similar situation (ecologically, cul- turally, etc.). The program may have to experiment withseveral technological possibilities before working with the farmers. Nevertheless, as time passes, fewer and fewer programs find themselves in such a situation.\u007f Thus, programs that have given a high priority to having the PTD process start with future FEs selecting the tech- nologies from a long list of potentially useful technologies,might consider reducing the list to a rather short one of technologies already proven to provide rapid, recogniz- able success in the vast majority of cases. \u007f The study provides major evidence that the collection, validation, and further dissemination of FE-developed technology may well be a very valuable activity for someresearchers and/or NGO's to become involved in. Devel- opment agencies should therefore help disseminate ideas around the world through various printed media, infor-mation technology, international conferences, such as the present one, and courses and workshops to spread infor- mation about this possibility and its usefulness.49233IK Notes 50 November 2002Collective Responsibility for War Orphans The source for this article is the Ministry of Labour and Human Welfare, Government of Eritrea, Asmara, Eritrea. The articlewas written by Peter H. Wolff, M.D., Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. For more information, e-mailwolff_p@tch.harvard.edu Before the thirty-year conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the concept of \"orphans\" as usually defined in west-ern societies, was virtually unknown. The only exception was children who had been abandoned for various rea-sons and were cared for in institutions (orphanages) supported by foreign church agencies. Within traditionalEritrean society, it was generally as- sumed to be self-evident that children who had lost both parents would betaken in by members of the extended family; or if no relatives could be traced, they were taken in by neighborsor family friends. Children who had lost both parents automatically become members of the new family and had allthe rights and responsibilities of other children in the same family. This \"grass-roots\" pattern of caring for chil-dren in urgent need of protection was wide-spread throughout the country, and especially in village communitiesand among the nomads. Because the process was taken for granted, no for- mal agreements or legal documentswere required, and adoption and foster care were alien concepts. As a result of the thirty-year war, the number of children who lost both par- ents increased in geometric propor- tions. At the same time, the socialstructure of the traditional society wasgrossly disrupted. As a result, the in- digenous practices of caring for unac- companied children no longer func-tioned, and the Eritrean administra- tion had to make special provisions of group care as long as the war lasted.Immediately after independence, a na- tion-wide survey conducted by the So- cial Affairs Authority of the newly-formed Eritrean government deter- mined that a total of at least 14,000 children below the age of sixteen yearshad lost both parents due to the vio- lence of war; and that, in addition, a minimum of 100,000 children were inneed of special protection because their surviving parents were no longer able to provide the basic necessities of food,shelter and educational opportunities for their children. In order to help, for- eign NGOs and church organizationsbegan to construct or rebuild and en- large orphanages in population centers, and made a concerted effort to intro-duce the concept of adoption to foreign countries and foster care as the strate- gies that were widely accepted as thepreferred remedies of caring for unac- companied children. However, the so- cial service agencies in Eritrea had hadvery negative experiences with foreign adoptions during previous occupations. Therefore, they rejected all offers ofhelp that involved adoption.or fosterEritrea234IK Notes Number care, and made concerted efforts to close all orphanages as soon as possible. Instead, they formulated a nation- wide plan for the rescue and rehabilitation of unaccompaniedchildren that was largely built on indigenous practices of child care. The main component of this plan was the reunification of orphans and other unaccompanied children with their ex- tended family. A nation-wide search was implemented to first trace the extended families (aunts, uncles, grandpar-ents and the like), and then to select those members of the extended family who were in the best position to provide the children with the necessary economic and social protectionsHowever, most of the families, including those in relatively good economic circumstances, had been so impoverished by the 30 years of war that accepting one or more childrenwould have imposed unacceptable additional burdens on their lives. An income-generating scheme was devised and implemented whereby every potential host family that ac-cepted one or more children received financial assistance in kind that would enhance their economic capacity in accor- dance with their usual means of livelihood. For example,farmers were given one or more cows, a plough or several goats. Town dwellers received materials that allowed them to open small stores or start up cottage industries. This program of reunification by means of income en- hancement has now in place for at least seven years. It is carefully monitored to ensure that the material assistance isused for its intended purpose and does in fact provide eco- nomic and social protections for the reunified children and the host families. In short, the Eritrean social service agen-cies have been able to provide decent family environments for many thousands of unaccompanied children by relying on, and slightly modifying, traditional practices of child carethat have been an implicit part of indigenous Eritrean cul- ture for centuries. At the same time, the Authority of Social Affairs was able to resist the well-intentioned but culturallyalien proposals for international adoption of Eritrean chil- dren (without or with parents) that, according to past expe- rience often had serious consequence that were not in thebest interests of the children. Despite extended and prolonged searches it was, however, not possible to trace the extended families of all war or-phans. Therefore, an alternative plan was implemented in parallel to provide protection for children who could not be reunified with their own extended families. Small grouphomes are now being constructed in the various zones of the country. They are designed to provide decent physical and social environments for twelve children who live togetherwith one or two permanent surrogate house mothers. Wher- ever possible, orphaned siblings are assigned to the same group home, and any group of twelve children living in onesmall group home is deliberately selected so that they will be of different ages ranging from two to sixteen years, so that over time they, together with their house mother, willform their own new extended family. Moreover, children are placed in group homes close to their village or town of ori- gin, so that in time they will be reintegrated into their owncommunities. The alternative plan is still in relatively early stages of development, but monitoring of the group homes that have been in existence for at least two years indicatesthat they appear to be very successful in addressing the needs of the children. Like the reunification program, the group homes are based on indigenous traditions of childcare in which the larger community, rather than the nuclear family takes on the responsibility of caring for children who have no parents and are in need of special protection.50235IK Notes 51 December 2002Traditional Medicine in Tanga Today This article was written by David Scheinman. For centuries, traditional healers have been the main providers of primary health care to most Tanzanians. Today,healers in Africa, especially in Tanga, still play crucial roles since\u2014in addi- tion to their roles as primary healthcare providers\u2014they carry the burden of care for treating people with HIV/ AIDS. In Tanga, the Tanga AIDS Work-ing his- Block of Bombo Hospital\u2014 has been successfully collaboratingwith traditional healers since 1990. This is the story of a promising part- nership between the ancient and mod-ern worlds to combat HIV/AIDS. A thumbnail sketch of medicinal plants Plants have been used as primary sources of medicine for thousands ofyears and were our very first medi- cines. Over 4,000 years ago, the Red Emperor of China published a list of4,000 medicinal plants. Literature about Babylonian medicinal plants was compiled in 1770 BC. The ancientEgyptians even placed medicinal plants in Pyramids to treat their Pharaohs af- ter death. The mummified Pharaohswere preserved by using plants, herbs, spices, and minerals. Up until 150years ago, the sciences of botany and medicine were the same. Plants have medicinal qualities due to the substances they produce to pro- tect themselves from insect pests and pathogens. We just \"borrow\" these sub-stances to treat our own viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. Many medi- cines are extracted from the roots, rootbark, and bark of plants since these ar- eas are the most vulnerable and pro- vide a plant's first line of defenseagainst an invader. Within seconds of an attack, plants begin producing and excreting a potentarray of substances that are lethal or toxic to the invading virus, bacteria, fungus, insect\u2014or even mammal. Indi-vidual plants can produce up to ap- proximately 1,000 unique chemicals. Hence a natural anti-viral produced bya plant to defend itself can also be used by a human as an anti-viral. Traditional healers in Tanzania have been identifying, experimenting, and using these substances to treat patients for millennia. By combining forces withthem, we have access to thousands of years of research results. This is com- monly known as indigenous knowledge(IK). Many of today's modern medicines are derived from plants. Over 120 phar-maceutical products are derived from236IK Notes Number 51 plants, and 74 percent were first used by native cultures! The correlation between healer use and positive lab results is clear. Data clearly indicates that plants collected fromhealers provide more solid leads toward developing new drugs than random screening. Twenty-five percent of our present perscription drugs are derived from plants. Thebest known are quinine from the cinchona tree, morphine from the poppy, aspirin from the willow, digitalis from fox- glove, vinblastine and vincristine (first choice drugs treat-ing Hodgkin's Disease, Acute Leukemia, various lympho- mas, Advanced Breast Cancer, and now HIV related Kaposi's Sarcoma) from the rosy periwinkle\u2014which growsright here in Tanga\u2014and now cotexin from Artemisia annua for treating malaria. Traditional healers in Tanga Tanga District has approximately 670 traditional healers (Waganga). 337 are in Tanga Urban District and 333 are in Tanga Rural. The average age of a healer is 52. Most areMuslim and have been practicing for an average of 19 years. There is one healer for every 343 residents of Tanga town and one healer for every 146 rural residents. There is onewestern trained medical doctor in Tanzania for every 33,000 residents. Therefore, many more people receive health care from healers than from conventional health workers. Manyhealers have participated in TAWG Seminars. These figures positively correlate with data from Sub Sa- haran Africa. Healers are already in place; health ministriesdo not have to assign them since virtually all villages have residential healers and traditional birth attendants. This is especially true in rural areas where modern medicine ismuch less available than in towns. Hence, combining forces with healers to combat HIV/AIDS and promote public health makes very good sense. Healers in Tanga are mostly herbalists, diviners, medi- ums, surgeons, midwives, and traditional psychiatrists. The majority use some of the many medicinal plants available inthis biologically diverse region. The Eastern Arc range of mountains, which includes Amani in Muheza district, is one of only 20 biological hotspots in the entire world. A hotspotis a region characterized by an unusually diverse range of species, many endemic to the area. Amani has the second highest amount of biodiversity in Africa\u2014a site inCameroon is first. Healers have specialized knowledge for treating physical, cultural, and psychological ailments. Healers are accessible,affordable, usually have credibility, and in Tanga have a treasure trove of biological diversity from which to collect efficacious plants.Healers and doctors join forces in Tanga In order for public health goals to be realized in Africa, heal- ers should be active participants in the health system. Thismakes good sense, since each community has it's very own indigenous healers. In Tanga, TAWG has received interna- tional recognition of its innovative work with traditionalhealers, and has received support from OXFAM, the World Bank, and USAID. Today in Tanga, traditional healers and modern physi- cians and health workers have combined forces in an excit- ing and promising program implemented by TAWG. TAWG is an innovative non-governmental organization (NGO)that links traditional healers, physicians and health work- ers, botanists, social scientists, and people living with AIDS (PLWAs). TAWG's goal is to bridge the gap between tradi-tional and western biomedicine by treating PLWAs with tra- ditional medicine. TAWG evolved from meetings that a German physician and his Tanzanian colleagues initiated with traditional healers in Pangani, a coastal town 50 kilometers south of Tanga in 1990. The health workers observed that many pa-tients\u2014this is true throughout sub-Saharan Africa\u2014visited both the hospital and traditional healers. Hence, they de- cided to make contact with local healers in hopes of initiat-ing a referral network. They were successful, and their net- work evolved into TAWG. Healers responded enthusiastically to the initiative. They relished being taken seriously and treated like fellow profes- sionals. The initial dialogue evolved into meetings where participants discussed how to treat various ailments, whento refer a patient to the hospital, public health issues, and how to cooperate with biomedical personnel. One day the subject was HIV/AIDS. Waziri Mrisho, a 84-year-old healer, asked if he could try treating HIV/AIDS in-patients. The group agreed, and Waziri treated a few confirmed HIV+ patients with threeplants TAWG still uses today. Bio-medical personnel soon observed that patients treated with Waziri's three plants generally had improvedappetites, gained weight, suffered from fewer and less se- vere opportunistic infections, and enjoyed improved health and well being. The plant remedies soon became thehospital's standard HIV/AIDS treatment for patients who preferred herbal medicine. The original three plants\u2014along with others that have been added\u2014are still used to treat a variety of opportunistic infections commonly caused by HIV/AIDS. Waziri was a real pioneer. He readily shared his knowledge and generouslyagreed to have his plants scientifically identified by bota-237 nists the Lushoto Herbarium in Lushoto, Tanga Re- TAWG eventually developed a home care service to de- liver the plant remedies to HIV/AIDS patients and their families. Home visits are the foundation of the TAWG's day- to-day work. Activities include monitoring general health,administering traditional remedies, and providing counsel- ing for patients and their relatives. In 1994, TAWG was officially registered as the Tanga AIDS Working Group (TAWG) with the Ministry of Home Affairs. TAWG is the leading HIV/AIDS NGO in Tanga Region. Its staff are highly qualified, dedicated, and committed to improving the quality of PLWAs lives. Members have exper- tise in counseling, psychology, medicine, education, botany,research, medical anthropology, and management. TAWG's work is an outstanding example of how positive results can be achieved in the fight against AIDS by synergisticallycombining local expertise, indigenous knowledge, and mod- ern health workers to provide effective low cost treatment for people living with AIDS. TAWG's treatment program TAWG's signature activity is treating patients in the hospi- tal or at home with medicinal plants. In the newspaperNipashe dated February 23, 2002, TAWG has reported that its treatment generally lengthens patients' lives and that some patients who were in bad shape clearly improved aftertaking the traditional medicines (Dr. Samuel Mtullu, Nipashe, February 23, 2002 ). The medicines are more effec- tive, however, if treatment is initiated during the earlystages of HIV/AIDS. The medicines are low cost, effectively treat selected opportunistic infections, readily available, are provided to patients free of charge, and have been used forTanzanian healers for centuries. Given in the proper form and dosage, they are very safe. TAWG's medicines increase appetite, help patients gain weight, stop diarrhea, reduce fever, clear up oral thrush, re- solve skin rashes and fungal infections, treat herpes zoster, and clear ulcers. Treating patients extends their longevity,improves the quality of their lives, and reduces the number of orphans since parents remain alive.TAWG also works closely with the government, runs seminars for traditional healers, and has an effective educa- tion and HIV/AIDS prevention program. It currently treats around 400 patients in Tanga, Pangani, and Muheza Districts. Since TAWG began in 1990 they have treated around 2,000 patients. During the last sixmonths, the amount of patients treated has doubled, indi- cating the rising number of HIV/AIDS cases. TAWG's collaboration with traditional healers and the Ministry of Health has created a small island of hope in this seaside town. Patients are now living longer and better lives, and consequently there are fewer recently-orphanedchildren. Healers have taken the prevention and public health messages back to their villages and many know when to refer a patient to the hospital. Though not a cure, the traditional medicines prolong life by combating pathogens similar to those that attack plants. At least now, patients in Tanga region, and Tanzania, have alow-cost alternative to expensive imported therapies. Incidentally, these expensive new therapies often tend to lose their knockout punch over time. Hence, treating pa-tients with traditional medicines has as much validity now as it did thousands of years ago. By having healers and doc- tors synergistically combine forces, new trails are beingblazed which benefit everybody. TAWG welcomes inquiries and visitors.

In a nearby hamlet, amother may be in the midst of prepar- ing a traditional plant treatment be- lieved to 'restore strength', relievestomach cramps, heal a skin condition, or perhaps alleviate symptoms of a respiratory tract infection affecting herchild. It is such routine use of plants by ordinary members of local communi- ties across Ethiopia's diverse rurallandscape, which largely accounts for the widely cited 80 percent estimate of the population who continue to rely ontraditional plant-derived medicines for their basic 1985; Abebe andHagos, growing recogni- tion that the study of indigenous healthknowledge and practices requires an essentially multidisciplinary research framework, to date, botanists, naturalchemists, pharmacologists, an- thropologists and health-workers have generally pursued their specific re-search interests in this area in relativeisolation from each other. In Ethiopia, there have been few cross-disciplinary linkages among the various approachesof researchers or the analysis of their findings. 1 Moreover, much of the existing lit- erature on Ethiopian traditional herbal medicine is dominated by plant-focused work, resulting from the 'mainstreamresearch agenda', which has been largely driven by an overriding interest in the specific therapeutic properties ofindividual plants. In search of informa- tion on the properties of various Ethio- pian medicinal plants, researchers havegenerally focused their attention on two main sources: (i) the professional traditional health practitioners and (ii)Ethiopia's ancient medico-religious manuscripts herbal letters containing elaborate recipes of plant-derived treat-ments for a wide range of health condi- tions (see, e.g., Abebe and Ayehu, 1993). By contrast, there have been few studies focused specifically on tradi- tional knowledge and practices outsidethe 'professional' realm of traditional medicine. The purpose of this article, derived from a larger study, is to sharesome of the findings of current re- search 2 envisaged focusing explicitly on the 'lay domain' of traditional knowl-edge in the Ethiopian context.This article was written by Hareya Fassil, University of Oxford, International Development Centre, Queen Elizabeth House (QEH) 21 St. Giles, Oxford 0X1 3LA, United Kingdom. For further information, email: hareya.fassil@green.oxford.ac.uk239 Objectives and methods The fieldwork-based study aimed to gain insight into the lo- cal distribution of traditional health knowledge and theuses of various medicinal plants among ordinary men and women in rural communities, who constitute the vast ma- jority of Ethiopia's population. The overall aim of the re-search is to contribute to the growing body of literature and experience pertaining to the role of indigenous/traditional systems of knowledge in development. Underlying this ob-jective is the fundamental premise that health constitutes the linchpin of the development process, viewed at once, both as the means as well as the end of development. The fieldwork was carried out with the participation of communities in the rural Bahir Dar Zuria district of Gojam (now part of the Amhara Regional State) located in theNorth Western Highlands of the country. A combination of research tools from various disciplines were employed. Gen- der considerations constituted an integral and cross-cuttingaspect of the methodology, as important gender factors were expected to be involved, inter alia, in the distribution of traditional health knowledge and its inter-generationaltransmission. Among the instruments applied for gathering data were: \u007f household surveys (viewed as the main component of the fieldwork); \u007f oral histories (based on open discussions with widely rec- ognized knowledgeable elders); \u007f focused discussions with mothers at local health centres; \u007f local market surveys; \u007f questionnaires administered to high-school students; and\u007f structured interviews with (both modern and traditional) professional health practitioners. Preliminary assessment of the data In-depth quantitative and qualitative analyses of the data gathered from these various sources are still under way. Fol- lowing are some highlights of the preliminary findings ofthe research. The tacit and pervasive nature of traditional health knowledge In general, traditional knowledge about medicinal plantsand its application are very much taken for granted by both men and women in all the study communities. Such tradi- tional knowledge and practices constitute routine aspects ofdaily life and are deeply engrained in the socio-cultural and economic fabric of these rural societies. This is a significantfinding in itself, as it clearly demonstrates the sheer scope and significance (actual and potential) of local traditional knowledge. Gender and age dynamics Some general trends could be discerned suggesting consid-erable gender and age differences in the type and extent of traditional health knowledge. For example, middle-aged and older women and men generally appear to have a greaterbreadth of medicinal plant knowledge. In addition, men more often demonstrated knowledge of plants primarily procured from the wild, whereas women generally showedgreater familiarity with the therapeutic uses of weedy and semi-domesticated plants found around the homestead. Main sources of traditional knowledge 'Routine observation and practice' or 'learning by doing', was the most widely-cited method through which knowl-edge is acquired. Here again, a relatively larger proportion of men indicated having obtained their knowledge in this way, suggesting some notable gender differences in terms ofthe mechanisms by which traditional knowledge is im- parted. The medicinal plant resource base The local names and specific uses of more than 80 plants with medicinal value were documented throughout thestudy. The large majority of these are wild/weedy species, often occurring around the homestead or farm and requir- ing little management. This finding alone is strongly sup-portive of the original research hypothesis, i.e. that signifi- cant knowledge about medicinal plants resides in the 'non- professional' or public domain. In addition, the local namesand specific uses of most medicinal plants cited by different informants were appreciably consistent. Role of rural professional health practitioners In general, professional traditional health practitioners seem to play a much less pronounced role in the rural com-munities than has generally been presumed. It appears that most ailments are diagnosed and treated at the household level. Very few informants reported seeking professionaltraditional help on a regular basis. Where professionals are consulted, it is often for their specialized traditional knowl- edge and skills pertaining to a relatively limited range ofhealth problems.240IK Notes Number The qualities of traditional knowledge Further reflections about the various features of the tradi-tional knowledge characterized above raise some questions, inherent paradoxes and eye-openers. These relate to the po- tential role of traditional health knowledge, the nature ofthe traditional learning process and the intrinsic contrast- ing features of traditional knowledge. The potential role of traditional health knowledge: chal- lenges and limitations. The term 'challenge' immediately brings to mind the single largest health problem in the study area\u2014malaria. However, no specific traditional plantmedicines for malaria were reported. While this raises ques- tions regarding how 'new' malaria is to the area, it also seems compellingly related to the fact that overall under-standing of malaria aetiology is extremely poor among the local people. The latter underscores the urgent need for community-based health education and preventionprogrammes. Nevertheless, some traditional perceptions regarding the general 'ecology' of the disease could be dis- cerned, which may provide an advantageous basis for effec-tive locally adapted health education and promotion efforts. Another basic challenge has to do with the dire sanitary conditions in the rural communities. Indeed, it would seemthat such communities that rely heavily on traditional plant treatments are caught in a vicious cycle, as many of the ail- ments that the local plant medicines are used for are linkedto poor environmental sanitation. Thus, the lack of proper latrines, waste disposal and clean water can be viewed as the raison d'etre for many traditional treatments. Con- versely, however, it can also be argued that, were such very basic and vital provisions in place, then health care efforts at the local level could perhaps, have been more effectivelyand appreciably targeted at the prevention of some of the more difficult health problems in the area, such as malaria. Hence, these very shortcomings can, in a sense, be viewed asamong the greatest impediments to the realization of the full potential of indigenous ingenuity and traditional ap- proaches in meeting local health needs. The knowledge transmission process. Exactly how is traditional health knowledge transmitted over generations? Are the traditional mechanisms that have been in place inthe past still intact? These are complex questions, requiring detailed contextual longitudinal evidence, which is ex- tremely elusive and difficult to unearth. However, one ob-servation that may have some relevance to these questions concerns traditional knowledge among children. It was ob- served that boys and girls as young as 6-7 years had remark-able 'botanical' knowledge, i.e. the ability to distinguish various medicinal plants growing around the homestead. But what of other aspects of traditional knowledge pertain-ing to the preparation and administration of plant medi- cines and the diagnosis of diseases? Could knowledge about these aspects be 'selectively' threatened? Such important is-sues will be investigated through further analysis of the in- formation gathered. Contrasting features a/traditional practices. With increas- ing interest in the role and value of traditional knowledge systems, such knowledge and its application have often sweepingly but perhaps, precariously, become associatedwith positive outcomes. Yet, if traditional health systems are to be strengthened as a whole, due attention should also be given to those practices that appear, at least prima facie, to be less than beneficial. Gases in point are, traditional surgical procedures such as the removal of the uvula, tonsils and teeth, and even graver practices of bloodletting and fe-male circumcision 3\u2014all of which remain widespread in the study communities. Perhaps even more so than in other as- pects, the particularly complex issues entailed in such tradi-tional practices, necessitate the utmost socio-cultural sensi- tivity and a sound understanding of the local context in which they persist. Conclusion It is anticipated that some significant conclusions will emerge from the ongoing study. What can be generally sur-mised at this stage, are some of the broader implications and expected contributions of the research. First, over the last decade or so, increasing interest in tra- ditional knowledge, particularly regarding medicinal plants, has been fraught with debates regarding intellectual prop- erty and traditional resource rights. Often, driven primarilyby interests and forces external to indigenous communities, these remain extremely complex and indeed, urgent issues with which policy-makers and stakeholders from both theNorth and South are actively grappling in various interna- tional fora. But this highly politicized focus at the global level seems to have diverted research attention away fromthe local context, i.e., from a real understanding of the ac- tual and potential roles of traditional health knowledge and practices in addressing arguably the most urgent health-care needs of growing populations in resource-constrained developing countries like Ethiopia. Hence, it is hoped that the present study and others like it can, in the first instance,help to redirect some research attention to the community level. Second, as this study has demonstrated, at least in the context of rural communities in the North-Western High- lands of Ethiopia, traditional knowledge regarding the use52241 of medicinal plants is far from being a corpus of wisdom or expertise generally presumed to be restricted to the male- dominated elite of professional traditional health practitio-ners. Indeed, most of the traditional treatments used in the communities studied are collected, prepared and adminis- tered by ordinary men and women at the household level. Hence, this implies that those 80% of the population, who are said to rely on traditional plant-derived medicines, do not invariably consult professional practitioners. Indeed,the fact that traditional health knowledge is so pervasive and the use of local medicinal plants so widespread has paramount implications, which simply cannot be ignored bythose concerned with health development and practitioners in the closely allied field of natural resources management. Finally, it has become evident that research and develop- ment efforts must also identify and address the challenges and threats faced by traditional health knowledge systems, in toto. The ultimate goal is to strengthen and improve this vast knowledge base for the benefit of the great majority of the developing world who have survived on it for centuries and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.References Abebe, D. and E.

This IK Note is a condensed version of a new UNECA publication by theauthor, titled \"Why Industrial Revolution Missed Africa: A Traditional Knowledge Perspective.\" African Indigenous Knowledge (IK) is labeled variously and misconceived at international discussions and in mod-ern literature. The most commonly used phrases are \"static,\" \"low-value- added\" and \"prior art,\" primarily in thecontext of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), of the World Trade Organization. Fre-quently one finds expressions like mys- tery, charlatan, irrational, or miracle in relation to traditional medicine, for in-stance. Achievements of traditional medicine are considered anecdotal or beyond scientific validation. The mis-conception is further aggravated by the little or no growth in the sector and a lack of understanding of the context inwhich practitioners apply traditional medicine. Yet, the literature produced on this sector has not given much at-tention to the factors that underpin these misconceptions. This article therefore provides a basic explanation to the apparent lack of un- derstanding and growth from African indigenous knowledge. The argumentis anchored on the African customary law system that only recognizes com- munal ownership of knowledge and ap-portions little reward for individual in- novations. The impact of this commu- nal ownership of knowledge had pro-duced different reactions from innova- tors and ingenuous knowledge bearers, in various sectors. In the high-incomesectors like the medicine, innovators use \"secrecy\" to protect their knowl- edge. In the low-income sectors such asagriculture, innovators are \"indiffer- ent,\" in the absence of public incentive and protection to making their knowl-edge public. When the knowledge bear- ers die, the knowledge disappears with them. The result is what we call a \"con-tinuous but non-additive innovation\" as against \"continuous and additive in- novation.\" In the absence of additivityin innovations, the knowledge remains basic and cannot produce much macro- economic growth. In line with the above, the study ar- gues that the \"static semblance\" labels and stigma are the product of the lackof incentive for individual IK innova- tors, in the customary law systems. In particular, it argues that traditionalmedicine is not a profession of charla- tans, but rather a part of Africa's devel- opment resource not well-studied, notadequately appropriated and devel- oped. African traditional healers (and other practitioners of IK) are equallycapable of research, innovation and healing as their \"allopathic\" counter- parts. Bone-setting, anti-snake venom243 production, active immunization practices or treatment of post-traumatic stress disorders are good examples of highly- appreciated products of African traditional medicine. Assuch, the study makes a case that it is the secretive applica- tions that have beclouded the true value of the activities. This secrecy, however, has some economic rationale. Theaim of this article, therefore, is to explain the economic ra- tionale behind such secret behaviours\u2014in what the author call the \"the Secrecy-Motivation Model.\" The questions expected to be answered, using African tra- ditional medicine as an example are: why are African tradi- tional medical practitioners secretive? Are the motivationsfor the secretive behaviours economic? What specific heal- ing powers do the practitioners have, requiring secrecy? What are the economic impacts of such secretive behaviors? To answer these questions, the study posits that three fac- tors determine the secret behaviours of African traditional healers. These are: the inadequacy of rents from innovation;absence of public protection of intellectual property rights in the African customary law system; and the threat of busi- ness-stealing and obsolescence by the arrival of new innova-tions. Innovation, has very little predictability. This is par- ticularly so in medicine and agriculture, where research can be costly and long-term, and where the results are uncer-tain. In this situation, the innovators and bearers of the unique knowledge consistently work to regulate against any threat of knowledge stealing or obsolescence. The explanation The author named the explanation the Motivation Model because of the motivational effects that explain the secrecy(search for innovation, investment in the research process and expected income effects). Initially, the study supposes that under normal economic circumstances, any new prod-uct is created not by a single innovation/imitation but by a whole sequence of innovations. The existence of the last in- novation leads to further developments and innovations.Some of what will result from it will be more fundamental (horizontal), some will be more secondary, hence vertical. That said, the study explains why an innovative traditionalhealer would choose to remain indefinitely secretive. In this explanation, the principal input/resource a tradi- tional healer invests in the production and innovation pro-cesses, is himself/herself, defined as his/her physical power and knowledge. Having done so, innovation arrives ran- domly at a rate expressible as a fraction of the investedknowledge, indicating the productivity of the research. Ran- domness means that at the current time, the possibility and specificity of the innovation cannot be guaranteed. The in-novator may find another innovation in the process of solv- ing a particular health problem at a time unknown to him/ her. Even by allocating a large amount of his time andknowledge resources, it is still uncertain, to the innovator, when the next innovation may take place. The individual that succeeds in innovating prefers to monopolize the pro-duction sector until replaced by the next innovator. When researching, the healer has to balance opportunity costs of marketable goods or services against the uncertainresults of research. Costs are likely to be high given the un- certainty of results of the research. Sharing the results of the innovation in the community would deprive him/her ofthe income deriving from the innovation, since it could eas- ily be copied not only by other healers but also by his/her fel- low community members in a do-it-yourself application ofthe new treatment. It is the possibility of a business-stealing effect as a result of openness that is of serious interest to the study and ofconcern to the knowledge bearer . Through this effect, it is entirely possible for a new entrant in the innovation field to successfully destroy the monopoly rent attributable to theprevious generation of innovators, by making their prod- ucts obsolete. Relating this to cost of innovation, one assumes that re- search costs/expenditures are financed at the proportional rate that is equal to the resources and labour force commit- ted to research. Only a portion of the resources and financewill produce research objectives. If the costs and benefits are also measured in units of final outputs, the marginal cost is the amount over and above initial investment. When the expected net income from the use of the innova- tion is included, one gets a different effect, where profit is the exponentiated at the time . In the case of business steal- ing, therefore, the loss will be expressed as a loss of both the invested resources as well as the expected profit. The double loss of both, investments and expected income is thus a driv-ing force to hide the new idea or innovation in the absence of institutional and other legal support or protection. Within the above framework, any \"new\" innovation poses a serious challenge to the livelihood and means of existence of the previous incumbent of the previous innovation. It is in anticipation of the loss of income and the threat of obso-lescence, to be associated with the introduction of the supe- rior rival good from the \"new\" innovation, that the incum- bent will create confusion regarding the value of goods andservices that he/she produces by keeping the technical infor- mation anonymous and secret. Also aware of the absence of any public institutions to protect his/her indigenous knowledge, the owner has to find a creative way to shield his/her monopoly earnings from imi-244IK Notes Number tators and the process of business/knowledge-stealing. In terms of application, other disguises follow in the form of incantation, masquerading, diversionary sacrifices andscare tactics. In this way, even the patients or customers who are allowed to come in close contact with the products may not easily and freely understand which among the ar-ray of acts contributed the actual solution that they re- quired. It thus appears magical . In the absence of guises and disguises, the probability in- creases that consumers of the medical products may imitate the innovation and increment the frequency of do-it-your- self (DIY) self-treatments, thus depriving the practitioner ofmonopoly income. This self-protective approach thus helps the innovator or bearer of the new knowledge to continue collecting monopoly rents as well as to protect against \"in-truders\" who may steal and improve on the intermediate input and render the original idea obsolete. The main argument once again is that those working in African traditional medical sector have finite resources, just like anyone else, and interest invested in their work. In the absence of public protection of their innovations and uncer-tainty associated with discovering a new solution, they hedge against getting these innovations into the public do- main. The objective they achieve through this is that thepublic cannot engage in imitation and do-it-yourself, thus depriving them of their monopoly rent. The process of hedg- ing induces the distortions and magical performances asso-ciated with the activities. The above explanations have been tested using empirical data. The results strongly support the main argument of the model. In the other low-income sector such as agriculture, what one found was that the innovators/indigenous knowledge bearers do not pro-actively hide their knowledge. Com-monly, they tend to be indifferent to whether their discover- ies are made public or not (partly, because most of their ac- tivities can easily be studied on their fields). When asked,they reveal what they know but most of the time, nobody asks. Also, since there are usually no forums to share their knowledge, the owners keep it to themselves. In the end, however, the impact of both \"secrecy\" and \"in- difference\" are unambiguously negative on the macro- growth of the economies and the original knowledge itself.When the knowledge-bearers cease to operate, they disap- pear with their knowledge. This means that the next gen- eration has to start afresh on the same process. The result iswhat the author calls \"continuous but non-additive innova- tion\" as \"continuous and additive innovation,\" In the absence of additivity of innovations, the knowledge can-not produce much growth. The conclusion from this is simple. African countries have not put in place the incentive policy that can help achieve a \"continuous and additive in-novation\" in the indigenous knowledge system. The cus- tomary law system has also not self-corrected for this. Therefore, the growth-enhancing effects of indigenousknowledge system will remain minimal, thus falsely sup- porting the misconception of the whole knowledge as static. What are the other conclusions that one can draw? The incentive structure to promote indigenous knowledge inno- vation and development has to be put in place. Doing this, may neither be inherently good nor bad, but holds the po-tential for great benefits. More research might also bring about a change of heart about African indigenous knowl- edge, in particular, medicine, natural resource manage-ment, and agriculture and livestock keeping. The abandon- ment of the associated stigma and lack of policy attention could be overcome by enabling the creation of constituen-cies; traditional healer associations are a first step. The potential for growth and poverty reduction and the expected contributions to the stock of knowledge for resolv-ing several intractable global problems, that could come from this locked potential, are an incentive for action .53245IK Notes 54 March 2003Traditional Medicine Practicein Contemporary Uganda This report was written by Anke Weisheit, freelance consultant, based on a study visit to theTraditional Healers Associations and Projects in Uganda 2002 in co-operation with MaleMoses, IK Consultant. This study was supported jointly by the World Bank and the MAKOHerbalist Association. Traditional medicine practice involves a complex combination of activities, or- der of knowledge, beliefs and customsto generate the desired effects for the diagnosis, prevention or elimination of imbalances in physical, psychological orsocial well-being. Traditional medicine practice is based on the indigenous knowledge of agiven people, a given community, and their experiences in the context of the local culture and environment\u2014it isdynamic and changes with time de- pending on the prevailing situation. Traditional medicine practitioners (TMP) comprise herbalists, bonesetters, psychic healers, tradi- tional birth attendants, faith healers,diviners, and spiritualists who use in- digenous knowledge for developing ma- terials and procedures. The health service situation The relative ratio of traditional practi- tioners and university-trained doctorsin relation to the whole population in Uganda is revealing as is true for many parts of the African continent. In Uganda, there is at least one tradi- tional healer for nearly 290 people com-pared to one Western-trained medical practitioner for every 10,000 people in the urban areas and 50,000 people inthe rural areas respectively. The major- ity of the population in Uganda have greater access to traditional than towestern health care. Traditional heal- ers are an integral part of the local cul- ture and are appreciated as key andsustainable sources of care and knowl- edge on disease and illness. About 80 percent of the population of Ugandarely on traditional medicine because western-trained medical personnel are limited or not really accepted by thecommunity, and traditional healers are easily consulted, living in the same community (Bannerman, et al. 1993). The country imports most of its drugs from abroad and often experi- ences serious shortages. That points tothe demand for TMPs for medicinal plants and the fact that the majority of the people, rural and urban alike, de-pend largely on herbal medicines for treating a variety of diseases (Esegu, J.F.O. 2002). This reliance is mainly dueto the high cost of conventional medi- cine and inaccessibility of modern health care facilities in most areas.246IK Notes Number 54 Economical advantage of traditional medicine The lack of foreign exchange and the high cost of western manufactured drugs make modern health care inaccessibleto the majority of the population. This consequently re- quires the conservation, domestication and growing of me- dicinal plants. Propagation techniques are needed in some cases as propagation will lead to the conservation of rare medicinal plants and ensures that the wealth of the products remainsin the country through using local knowledge, skills and materials. The health system thus becomes less dependent on external sources such as multinational companies. De-veloping conservation and propagation strategies of the cur- rently-known medical plants is based on the communities' local knowledge of the environment, and shared experiencesof institutions like the Entebbe Botanical Gardens, of the National Agriculture Research Organisation, and the Na- tional Chemotherapeutics Research Laboratory. Governmental efforts in promoting traditional medicine The Uganda Law Reform Commission is developing a law for the recognition, the protection and practice of tradi- tional medicine (Kakooza, J.M.N. 2002). This enables na-tional institutions and international organizations to pro- mote and integrate herbal medicine into their development plans. The National Agriculture Research Organisation is inte- grating the modernization and commercialization of indig- enous knowledge for wider economic and social benefits inareas such as food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, aromatics and handcrafts. The Ministry of Health Strategy and Policy has recog- nized traditional medicine and it is developing regulations for integrating it into the primary health care system. The Ugandan National Council for Science and Technol- ogy (UNCST) is implementing a project on indigenous knowledge and institutional development. The National Chemotherapeutics Research Laboratory is the main research laboratory appointed by the government and is internationally funded\u2014it has done the following: \u007f Mass screening of herbal remedies\u007f Toxicological testing \u007f Formulation and preserving herbal medicine \u007f Standardization of products.Non-governmental organizations promoting traditional medicine Prometra Uganda , an affiliate of Prometra International, is an Association for the Promotion of Traditional Medicine and is promoting traditional medical knowledge and prac-tices for improved health through mutual co-operation amongst health systems. The headquarters of Prometra Uganda is in Kawempe -Kampala, the capital city ofUganda. The symbol of the organisation is a clay pot with holes and these holes are to be symbolically filled through collaborative effort of other professions. The summarizedobjectives of Prometra Uganda are: \u007f To generate and disseminate knowledge on traditional medicine so as to increase its utilization \u007f To strengthen and advocate for the use of traditional medicines across the entire rural and urban population \u007f To identify and fight against harmful traditional health care practices through educational programs, establish- ment of cultural centers and centralized treating areas \u007f To strengthen collaboration between traditional and other health practitioners so as to increase information sharing on traditional medicine \u007f To initiate, encourage and support community programs on the sustainable utilization of the environment, conser- vation and preservation of all species of medicinal value. THETA\u2014Traditional and Modern Health Practitioners Together against Aids and other diseases, is a Ugandan or- ganization where traditional and modern health practitio-ners (THs) are working together. Its activities include: \u007f Training THs as community counselors and educators on sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV/AIDS), aswell as training for other organizations targeting THs country-wide \u007f Training THs in basic HIV/AIDS patient care and sup- porting their efforts to provide quality health care \u007f Exchanging information through a Resource Centre cre- ated in 1995 for research documentation and dissemina-tion of information on traditional medicine and AIDS \u007f Hosting a library, publishing a newsletter, organizing a monthly speaker bureau and carrying out advocacy fortraditional healing systems \u007f Comprehensive training of traditional healers as trainees in THETA district outreach \u007f Herbal medicine processing and packaging as well as the maintenance of a herbal garden.247 IIACM\u2014the International Institute of Alternative and Complementary Medicine does the following activities: \u007f Managing over 10,000 different medicinal plants from Uganda and abroad on the institute's farm \u007f Improving formulation of herbal medicine \u007f Medicine processing and packaging\u007f Teaching various local and foreign traditional healing methods, including Chinese Herbal Medicine, Indian Herbal Medicine, Acupuncture, Music Therapy and Yoga. MAKO Herbalist Association , whose activities include: \u007f Training herbal medicine users on the basis of clinical di- agnosis and supporting their efforts to provide quality pa- tient handling and care \u007f Generating information through documentation and re- search about herbal medicine and making information available to and co-operating with researchers \u007f Complementing the activities of traditional birth atten- dants by using skill and knowledge in areas such as tradi- tional family planning methods \u007f Bridging the gap between elders with indigenous knowl- edge and the young herbalists for better knowledge re- garding herbs, i.e., transfer of knowledge \u007f Interacting with partners who have an interest in pro- moting herbal medicines \u007f Continuously identifying indigenous plants with medici- nal value in order to benefit patients \u007f Emphasizing the need for medicinal plant/tree cultivation among the public. Various other institutions are also involved in promoting and integrating Traditional Medicine into the health care system : religious organizations, private companies, media,and individuals. However, there is no systematic national program.Future research Increased urbanization and change in societies make it nec- essary to modernize and develop traditional medicine andpractice to meet demand in the context of changes in habits, cultural values, the environment, and economic conditions. This will require a new legal framework to prevent the ex-ploitation of indigenous knowledge and resources. The pic- ture that emerges is that overall, Uganda has a supportive environment for promoting traditional medicine. References Bannerman, R.H.

The IK Learning Exchange was jointly conceived and organizedby Siddhartha orKpidatala@worldbank.org In March 2002, a multi-sectoral team of 33 World Bank staff from the Africa Region embarked on a learning tour offive East Asian countries\u2014Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam\u2014in order to better under-stand the Asian development process. The main objective of pioneering learn- ing across regions was to enable staff toprovide better quality service to clients by helping expand their knowledge of successful development practices, andby enhancing their behavioral skills in adapting good practices from one re- gion to another. Inspired by the success of the pilot study tour, the Africa Region embarked on an initiative to build cross-regionalpartnerships between E. Africa and S. Asia seeking to integrate indigenous knowledge and practices into Bank-supported operations. The aim was to leverage the experience of IK good practices from South Asia into Bank-supported projects in East Africa. This would also help foster new partner- ships for South-South dialogue, coop-eration and technical assistance. The focus was on indigenous knowl- edge as it is a key element of the socialcapital of the poor, assisting them in their struggle to improve their liveli-hoods. For example, farmers have used organic fertilizers to increase soil fertil- ity in parts of Asia and Africa for centu-ries; similarly, local healers have used medicinal plants in India and Tanzania to treat common human and animaldiseases. Many local organizations, institu- tions and communities have a wealth ofknowledge of IK practices. However, these practices are not disseminated ef- fectively because community-based or-ganizations lack the capacity to cap- ture, document, validate and share them. As a result, IK is underutilized inthe development process, and local communities are constrained in their ability to shape the debate on develop-ment priorities and lack the means to achieve them. To bridge the knowledge gap, the Africa Region organized across regional IK learning exchange be- tween East Africa and South Asia. The first step was to identify poten- tial projects in South Asia and East Af- rica that had either already developed effective IK components to promotecommunity driven development and those lacking these elements. The pur- pose was to match knowledge-seekingcommunities with those that made good use of their local assets for development.249 Proposed activities The cross-regional partnership is being built in four phases. The first phase will build linkages between the East Africanand South Asian projects. The second phase will involve a learning exposure for project personnel and CBO partners from project communities on actual project sites in Indiaand Sri Lanka. The third phase will focus on building capac- ity for integrating IK into project activities and strengthen- ing country-level initiatives in the East African projects.The fourth phase will help the projects to continue the part- nership for further cooperation and learning. The activities are designed in these four phases to emphasize the impor-tance of building and continuing the partnership rather than merely undertaking study tours. Phase I. Building linkages Mapping exercise. The first activity to be undertaken was to identify nodal persons from each of the participatingprojects and develop shared perceptions on the purpose of the initiative and role of the partners. Information and guidelines already available on integrating IK and practicesinto project planning and implementation were shared withthe projects. Initiating dialogue. Contacts between the various partners was initiated and initial information on the initia-tive was exchanged. The use of IT for exchange of informa- tion was encouraged. Those projects already having web sites will be encouraged to post IK-related information andthe progress that has already been made in identifying the IK and practices. If needed, a common web page for the partnership will be created to link to project specific infor-mation. Finding a facilitator. Given the broad range of clients and variety of topics to be covered during the exchange, itwas necessary to identify a facilitator to ensure a structured learning process during the exchange. The Executive Direc- tor, Uganda National Council for Science and Technology(UNCST) was selected as an appropriate facilitator. Video conference and exchange of information. A video conference was arranged involving all participatingclients where specific information on the use of IK (case studies) was presented and discussed. This gave them an opportunity to understand the importance of IK and tovoice their opinions on what they hoped to get out of the ex- change, thereby giving the organizers an opportunity to de- sign the study tour in way that met the needs of the clients.A separate video conference was held with the facilitator, tofamiliarize him with the planned activities and agree upon a modus operandi. Phase II. Learning exposure for EA countries In September 2002, a group of clients (16 development prac- titioners) from Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, accompanied by 5 Bank staff visited India and Sri Lanka. The partici-pants included project staff from early childhood develop- ment and medicinal plants projects, civil society representa- tives, a traditional healer, a parliamentarian and a minister.The learning exposure comprised of (a) field visits to se- lected project sites/communities to understand how the pro- cess worked, (b) interaction with field functionaries to un-derstand how IK catalyzed the communities' environmental and social assets into economic gains (c) meetings with three State Chief Ministers in India to understand how goodgovernance and leadership have led to relatively sustainable development policies. Learning through reflection : In addition to discus- sions with counterparts and visits to project areas in South Asia, the learning exchange included opportunities for the group to reflect on their learning through debriefings. Thislearning approach, recently pioneered in the Africa Region, involves video-taped narratives based on open-ended ques- tions designed to distill a \"story\". Over five debriefings theparticipants were encouraged to reflect on what they learned, how relevant the learning was in the East African context, and what adaptation to the observed practices willbe needed to replicate it in East Africa. The debriefings re- sults were synthesized into short video clips that are avail- able on-line on the Intranet. Phase III. Capacity building at country level and strengthening country level initiatives The participants from Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia devel- oped Country Action Plans for strengthening the incorpora- tion of IK and practices in their projects and also to sharetheir learning experiences with other partners in their country such as NGOs and Ministries of Health. The activi- ties will involve training and technical support for initia-tives using IK for development and also for networking with other partners in the country. Each country team focused on the following areas for South-South Cooperation:\u007fPartnerships and networking (mainstreaming IK into de- velopment policies, documentation and exchange of IK practices, use of ICTs for rural development)250IK Notes Number 55 \u007f Cross-institutional capacity building (institutionalization of traditional medicine, collaborative research on medici- nal plants, policy formulation and resource mobilization) \u007f Policy level (legal protection of traditional knowledge, validation of IK practices, and integration into ECD pro- grams) \u007f Grassroots (integration of women's empowerment in all pro- grams, involve communities in project design and implemen- tation, use ICTs to link communities with markets) \u007f Awaren ess raising and dissemination (seminars to share South Asian experiences with national stakeholders, in- ter-ministerial Meeting to raise IK at the policy level,press conferences to disseminate experiences to public). The East African delegation felt that South Asia was more advanced in several key areas related to the application of indigenous knowledge in early childhood development prac- tices, the conservation of medicinal plants and the use ofICTs for rural development. They were particularly im- pressed by India and Sri Lanka's holistic approaches to de- velopment and were keen to test some of these methodolo-gies in an African context. In exchange, they also felt that South Asia could learn from East Africa, particularly from their efforts to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The key les-sons learned and areas for future cross regional cooperation include the following. Ethiopia The Conservation and Sustainable Use of Medicinal Plants Project seeks to initiate support for the conservation, man-agement and sustainable utilization of medicinal plants for human and livestock healthcare in Ethiopia. The Project is into its second year of implementation. Project staff visiteda similar project on medicinal plants in Sri Lanka that is near completion. There were a number of lessons learned from the Sri Lankan experience that the Ethiopians plan tointegrate into their project. These include the legal protec- tion of IK and benefit-sharing mechanisms, documentation of IK practices and exchanges of experiences, institutional-ization of traditional medicine, in-situ and ex-situ cultiva- tion of medicinal plants. To this end, the project team in- tend to consult IUCN Sri Lanka on the Medicinal PlantsProject and the Tropical Botanic Garden Research Institute of India on conservation and benefit-sharing mechanisms. Uganda The Nutrition and Early Childhood Development Project seeks to improve the growth and development of childrenunder five years of age, in terms of nutrition, health, psycho-social and cognitive aspects. The project is nearcompletion and a second phase is in the pipeline. A number of lessons learned from India and Sri Lanka are planned to be integrated into the new project. These include the inte-gration of IK into ECD policies, integrated approaches to early childhood development, training of care-givers and adolescents in integrated ECD services and parenting, useof ICTs for community data collection, documentation and information-sharing to improve access to information for decision-making and market access. In this context, as a fol-low-up to the Learning Exchange, the Minister for Primary Healthcare recently took another official delegation to India and plans to host a regional training workshop in Ugandaon traditional medicine. The Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNSCT) is sponsoring a group of IK practitioners to visit India and Sri Lanka. UNCST alsoplans to develop an IK proposal for South-South Coopera- tion, with NASTEC\u2014its counterpart in Sri Lanka. Kenya The Early Childhood Development Project seeks to improve the quality and education of poor Kenyan households, witha focus on improved teacher performance and community capacity building. The lessons learned from South Asia re- lated to IK and ICTs were similar to the ones mentioned inthe Uganda case. The project is in its third year of imple- mentation and also plans to focus on issues that were being dealt with in India and Sri Lanka. These include: commu-nity empowerment, women's self-help groups, income-gen- erating activities, microfinance, multi-sectoral approaches to development and poverty reduction that involve the com-munity at all levels of planning and implementation. Phase IV. Continuing linkages for further cooperation The last phase will have activities that will ensure that the partnership is continued beyond the initial exchanges and visit. Two activities are envisaged at this stage: (a) The South Asia and East Africa projects will access and use in-formation on IK already available to them through the web and be part of a regional partnership that builds on IK and people's participation; (b) The participating projects willalso put together a newsletter on IK initiatives and partici- patory M&E. In case more than one project is involved in a country, one of the institutions/projects will be chosen as anodal agency. Client feedback In a client survey, the East African delegation provided the following feedback on the study tour:251 \u007f This is a window of opportunity for opening up institu- tions to each other's programs. \u007f One can see the different options and approaches that can be used to implement development activities. \u007f Such exchange visits are beneficial in guiding policy objec- tives and targeting vulnerable groups; and help redirectefforts to move towards holistic approaches towards de- velopment. \u007f Participants should be selected from multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary activities to include legislators, research- ers and community workers. \u007f There is a need to develop networking for both regions and also between the institutions that have common pro- grams. The East African country teams should organize exchange visits among themselves. \u007f Learning experiences once documented and disseminated to rural communities can strengthen poverty alleviation efforts in each country.252IK Notes 56 May 2003Kanye Ndu Bowi: An Indigenous Philosophical Context for Conflict ManagementGhana This article was written by Ben K. Fred-Mensah, Assistant Professor of International Relations and consultant inInternational Development at Howard University, Washington, DC. e-mail bfred-mensah@howard.edu orbmens@earthlink.net Since the late 1980s there has been a search for new conflict manage- ment1concepts and methods in order to deal with Africa's ubiquitous and ap- parently intractable conflicts. It can be argued that the main problem militat-ing against conflict management in Af- rica is that the contemporary conflict management systems of the region'smodern states are generally not con- tinuations or adaptations of those of the indigenous communities overwhich they have gained jurisdiction since the colonial period. In other words, the main drawback in the con-flict management in Africa is that there exists a disconnect between the conflict management systems of the modernstates and those of their ethnic con- stituents. Thus, an understanding of the indigenous conflict managementsystems in the Africa in general may go a long way towards improve our knowl- edge and strategies in addressing theever increasing conflicts in the region. This article intends to summarize findings from a study carried out by theauthor between the winter of 1995 and spring of 1996 among the Buems on the Ghana side of the Ghana-Togo border.The objective in this paper is to identify and discuss the main philosophical con- texts within which the indigenousBuem conflict management system op-erates. The paper also assesses the rel- evance of these principles to the manage- ment of modern conflicts in the area, par-ticularly land-related conflicts. For administrative purpose, the area under study is called Buem-Kator 2; it constitutes the eastern half of the larger Buem chiefdom in the Jasikan District of the Volta Region of Ghana.In terms of Ghana's current decentrali- zation program, the area is an area council, one of the six area councils thatconstitute the Jasikan District Assem- bly establishment. The indigenous people about whom this article is writ-ten are called Buems. Because the area is generally covered with tropical rainforest, which is highly conducive tothe cultivation of cocoa and coffee, it has since the turn of the last century attracted large numbers of migrantfarmers. Kanye Ndu Bowi Buems maintain that the paramount concern of their community is to sus- tain harmony within the social system. The philosophical foundation of thisworld view is encapsulated in the phrase, kanye ndu bowi, which trans- lates literally to mean the \"ingredientsof social harmony.\" Kanye ndu bowi is a253 broad ideological orientation, which provides the moral and legitimate basis for all manner of social control3and is translated into practice through the imposition of \"intrinsicsanctions.\" Intrinsic sanctions in the Buem context are both positive and negative. They are the subtle, though per- vasive, means by which the members of the community aremolded to uphold the normative order. Whereas the positive sanctions consist of the psyche rewards that the people re- ceive when they conform to the approved mode of behavior,negative sanctions are the feeling of moral discomfort that they experience when they default. Even though Buems insist that social harmony is the overriding ideology in their relationship with each other, needless to state, the people do not follow the dictates of the rules of conformity with undeviating passion. Conflicts arepart and parcel of Buem social life. Conflicts occur within kinship units and between members of different kin groups. They also occur between communities and between themand their non-Buem neighbors. In defining their conflict situations, Buems distinguish between anger (konyi), quar- rel (kador), duelling war (kekpe). Disputesusually involve breach of contract, slander, and witchcraft and sorcery accusations. Conflicts can also result from the problems of political succession, marital misunderstanding,injuries against persons, and damage to property. Land boundaries and rights of access to land are often contested. However, in conformity with the principles of social har-mony, disputants are essentially expected to settle their dis- putes by the most amicable means available. Thus, recidi- vism in particular is severely sanctioned by the communityas a whole whose duty it is to provide the public officials with support in enforcing the community's normative order. Pillars of social harmony in Buem-Kator The Buem philosophy of social harmony is supported and sustained by other political values, among which are the people's notions of benyaogba ukpikator andlelorkalorbunu and their uncompromising emphasis on in- stitutional and personnel trustworthiness. (i) Benyaogba ukpikator One means by which the ideology of kanye ndu bowi is sus- tained is through active emphasis on mediation, which thepeople refer to as benyaogba ukpikator. Benyaogba ukpikator, as an essential pillar in the ideology of kanye ndu bowi, provides adversarial parties a forum to underplay con-flicts and convince each other that irrespective of the nature and cause of the conflict between them, the prospects ofnon-adversarial relationship is greater than that of dis- putes. In other words, by emphasizing benyaogba ukpikator as the chief conflict management method, disputants aremade to avoid the winner-loser mentality that is fundamen- tally associated with adjudication, which the people call bate kate. By its nature, benyaogba ukpikator is a generally flex-ible and amicable method of resolving disputes. This is ap- propriate for a community whose members live on a face-to- face basis and are bound by webs of social, ritual and eco-nomic relationships. The managers of benyaogba ukpikator are usually lineage elders, priests, and influential individuals who are knownfor their wisdom and skills in their official and professional capacities, as well as in their private dealings. These indi- viduals are normally known widely within their communi-ties and have the capability to persuade disputants who have been summoned to attend hearings. It often happens that such individuals are often invited to mediate conflictsoutside of their own kin group or community. While doing the fieldwork, the author came across cases of this nature. One elder in New Ayoma was often mentioned as an adeptmediator. He was particularly remembered for his success in resolving a chronic land boundary dispute between two farming settlements in the area. This mediation wasdeemed a success because, at the time of the interview, it had been over thirteen years since the dispute was settled and had not been reactivated. (ii) Lelorkalorbunu One other pillar in the ideology of kanye ndu bowi is thestrife for, and emphasis on, lelorkalorbunu. Lelorkalorbunu represents the people's concept of fairness and justice. Buems maintain that the primary objective of their disput-ing forums is to achieve lelorkalorbunu. Lelorkalorbunu lit- erally refers to a mutual acceptance, not only of the dispute- handling process, but also of the verdict. It is a basic prin-ciple among the Buems that until parties to a dispute have accepted the verdict that is reached at any dispute-handling forum, the conflict cannot be deemed resolved and, as a re-sult, settlement and/or penalty (kornu) cannot be sug- gested. In other words, once lelorkalorbunu has been at- tained, which means that the disputing factions have ac-cepted both the process and the verdict, managers of the disputing process will then begin to suggest courses of ac- tion to repair the damaged relations between the formerdisputants in order to return them to the previous state of their social relationships. It is believed that a good dispute- handling forum does not force a decision on the parties butgets them to concur.254IK Notes Number (iii) Institutional and personnel trustworthiness The third pillar, which undergirds the indigenous Buem conflict management system, is the uncompromising em-phasis on institutional and personnel trustworthiness. It must be noted that there is no explicit separation of powers among the indigenous organs of the Buem political system.The same public officials\u2014the chiefs, fetish priests, and eage heads\u2014who exercise the powers of state administra- tion are also the lawmakers as well as the law-enforcers.However, contrary to the modern expectation that such con- centration of powers can be a recipe for autocracy, despo- tism, and even dictatorship, power concentration amongBuems has rather made imperative political openness, trust, and transparency at both personnel and institutional levels. By resolving disputes, these politico-judicial officialsmeet not only the expectation of the disputants that their conflict has been resolved, they also strengthen the trust that people have in them. In other words, successful resolu-tion of conflicts does not only restore marred social harmony, it also enhances the legitimacy and political standing of the public institutions and officials. 4Buems often say that any community leader who cannot be relied upon to settle com- munity disputes is a kwesia panin \u2014a worthless elder. Conclusion One key question regarding the sustenance of the indig- enous principles of conflict management in Buem-Kator is whether the conditions that made them effective in the pastare still intact to cope with the dramatic social changes that the area has been experiencing since colonial times. 5This is because the apparent effectiveness of the indigenous prin-ciples in the past was possible because they evolved with, and were tailored to, the scale of society and exigencies of the time. As in all other areas in Ghana, and, in fact, in allAfrica, indigenous principles and values have been signifi- cantly altered with the advent of the modern state, the in- troduction of Western-style education, world religions, in-creased monetization of local economies, and the develop- ment of modern infrastructural and communication facili- ties. The Buem with whom the author spoke conceded thisfact. The changes have posed a challenge to the effective mobilization and utilization of the indigenous principles in the management of the modern conflicts. One area in which indigenous Buem principles are in con- flict with those of the modern state is the determination of land rights, which has become the major source of conflictin the area. This clash of principles is most obvious in the conflicting notions of statute of limitation, as applied to theoccupancy and use of land. For example, in 1972, the Govern- ment of Ghana passed a law, Section 10, 6which specifically provides that a person who has been in continuous possessionof land for twelve or more years cannot be evicted from the land. The central tenets of this law are fundamentally incom- patible with the indigenous Buem land laws. The indigenousBuem land laws do not restrict the length of time within which an action to recover land from an occupant can be ef- fected. Thus, the Buems have contended that the mere occu-pation of the land, particularly by migrants (who are often viewed as outsiders), irrespective of length of stay on the land, is not a sufficient condition to make it a property that theycan perpetually hold. The central issue therefore is: Is it not appropriate for the Government of Ghana and, in fact, African governments ingeneral and their development partners to seek means by which the relevant aspects of the conflict management sys- tems of the indigenous communities can be synthesizedwith those of the modern states in order to harness the po- tential benefits of both systems. 7 1 The term conflict management as used here refers to any means by which conflict is prevented, reduced, or resolved. 2 The area is a cluster of farming communities, the main settlements of which are New Ayoma, Dzolu, Old Ayoma, Baglo, Odumase, Kute, andLekante. 3 Social control in this context refers to the community's moral code, comprising its beliefs and value systems, which influence the people'sattitudes and behavior. 4 More elaborate views regarding this can be found in Marc J. Swartz, \"Bases for Political Compliance among Bena Villages\" Marc J Swartz,Victor W. Turner, and Artheu Tuden, eds., Political Anthropology,Aldine Publishing Company, Chicago, 1966 and a more recent work byBen K. Fred-Mensah, \"Bases of Conflict Management among theBuems of the Ghana-Togo Border Area , I. W. Zartman, ed., Tradi-tional Cures for Modern Conflicts, Lynne Rienner Publishers, Boulder,2000. 5 A similar question was earlier raised by Hareya Fassil in the article, \"A Qualitative Understanding of Local Traditional Knowledge andmedicinal Plant,\" IK Notes, No. 52, January 2003, p. 2. 6 Ghana Government, Limitation Decree, 1972. This legal system dates back to the British legal tradition, particularly its Limitation Act,1833. 7 Such an attempt has been suggested by Ben K. Fred-Mensah in his article, \"Capturing Ambiguities: Communal Conflict ManagementAlternative in Ghana,\" World Development, June, vol. 27, no. 6, 1999.It must also be noted that by virtue of its Interpretation Act, 1960 and1992 Constitution, the indigenous laws (called customary laws) of thecountry's ethnic constituents are recognized as part of the country'slegal system. However, in principle the national laws have precedenceover them and also their application is limited to the ethnic group inwhich it has evolved.56255IK Notes 57 June 2003Cultural Rights for Zimbabwe'sSui Generis Legislation The author of this article, Chloe Frommer, conducted this anthropologicaly research under the auspices of McGill University, as a researcher for the Centre for Society, Technology and Development (STANDD), and the Centre forDeveloping Area Studies\u2014(CDAS) in Montreal, Quebec. She can be contacted at Chloe@culturalrights.com. The fullversion of this article with a complete list of works cited can be found at www.culturalrights.com Throughout two decades of develop- ment activity, reports on the \"crisis\" of desertification, food scarcity, and eco-nomic inefficiency have been chal- lenged by local counter-narratives which show local people uniquely en-gaging in their environment in ways that deny the relevance of economic in- centives (Lansing 1995; Leach andMearns 1996; Appadurai 1990). Recently, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) characterizedplant genetic resources as the \"heritage of mankind\" (Cullet 2001) in order to globalize conservation of them. Like-wise, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) legislation hasenabled biotechnology companies to enclose aspects of this heritage within intellectual property rights (IPR) inways that primarily fuel international industry. As a result, the local cultural practices related to biological resourceshave been dismissed as inefficient or discussed as barriers to development. This may begin with the fact that therelationship between territorial cul- tural practices, biological resources, and intellectual properties has not beenmade explicit. The author has found the following distinctions helpful:Biological resources (plants, miner- als and animals): are the natural sources of medicinal, agricultural, cos-mological, veterinary and ecological utility. Their presences helps balance the overall ecological and social healthof specific territorial environments. They are also the substrates of cultural resources, practices and traditionalknowledge systems. Cultural resources (practices): are the inherited territorial (customaryand non-customary) practices that fol- low local systems of production, circu- lation and reproduction of the environ-ment\u2014natural and social\u2014which char- acterizes them. They continue to evolve in conjunction with individuals and theterritorial environment. They are also the substrates of intellectual resources. Intellectual resources (capital): are products that have been abstracted, de- rived or synthesized from prior cultural or biological resources. In order to re-ceive protection, cultural or biological resource had to have been transferred from their original territorial environ-ment and are either (a) transported (as impersonal information bytes) to a new milieu so that they may be reckoned\"novel;\" or (b) components of them are reduced, standardized, and miniatur- ized for mass reproduction and distri-256IK Notes Number 57 bution to be deemed \"commercially applicable.\" Hence, they are synthesized or abstracted to receive an intellectual property right (IPR). In regional, territorial and national contexts it becomes clear that there can be no intellectual properties (even re- lated to plant genetic resources) without the reproduction ofcultural knowledge and practice. Hence, significant initiative on the part of developing countries has brought unique (sui generis) national legisla-tion to facilitate both international and local interests in ac- cessing, keeping, using, sharing and valuing biological, cul- tural and intellectual resources simultaneously (SeattleMinisterial Meeting of the WTO 2000). The African Union (AU) has been especially concerned with maintaining the unique relationship between plant genetic resources andcultural practices and has subsequently handed down the African Model Legislation for the Protection of the Rights of Local Communities, Farmers and Breeders and for theRegulation of Access to Biological Resources (African Model Law 2001) as a guide for its member states in developing National Sui Generis Legislation. However, because Na-tional Sui Generis Legislation (in accordance with Trade- Related Intellectual Property Rights Article 23(b) of the World Trade Organization) counters globalizing initiativesit has little to no international aid. Hence, it is being drawn up without the participation of local communities who ac- cess, keep, use, share, and value biological and cultural re-sources in customary and non-customary ways. Research question Because the requisite institutional reforms of WTO mem- bership create new needs in developing countries such as Zimbabwe, development practitioners might effectively aid national development by working in conjunction with thenational goal to create Sui Generis Legislation. This could be done most effectively by taking an anthropological study of how repertoires of knowledge exist in a priori 1 local condi- tions first. Based on this qualitative data, an analysis of the cultural practices that both vitalize and sustain traditional knowledge systems should follow. The author endeavored todo this with one repertoire of knowledge in Zimbabwe, Tra- ditional Medicinal Knowledge (TMK), by exploring how it is accessed, kept, used, shared, and valued in both customaryand non-customary ways. Subsequently, this has helped her develop several recommendations for Zimbabwe's own Na- tional Sui Generis Legislation.Methodology With a cognizance of cosmopolitan movements and high ac- tivity border zones, the author's fieldwork was carried outin three varied locales: (1) in the capital of Harare where a variety of Bantu linguistic traditions from sub-Saharan Af- rica meet in creolized forms commonly exchanged throughEnglish, (2) along two border areas\u2014in Zimbabwe's East- ern Highlands that straddles Mozambique, and to the North going to the wetlands that seep across to Zambia, and(3) in the central high-grass, veld, region of Zimbabwe where Shona 2 customary traditions are still strongly repro- duced. The overall study and analysis was made with key infor- mants, oral traditions, oral histories, participant-observa- tion in ritual and medicinal plant use, former ethnographicstudies completed by anthropologists, as well as the official discourse of a national association of traditional healers. The author spoke to traditional healers merchants, and their councilors, rural district officials, and urbanite Zimbabweans. All of these in-terviews were conducted, with the help of a translator, in Shona. Findings In Zimbabwe, the natural substrates of TMK are conceived of both as magic 3 and as medicine ( mishonga). Yet, these substrates manifest as a magic and/or a medicine only whenthey are wielded by an individual possessing an entire rep- ertoire of practices, rituals, divinations, symbols and acute timing based on a familiarity with the social, cultural, envi-ronmental and physical milieu (the hun'anga ). 4 In addition to the individual practitioner, the individuals who comprise the greater social field validate by their own consecrationwhether the magic and medicine become effective (kushanda ). Access to the full repertoire of ancestral TMK ( vadzimu hun'anga ) begins when the juvenile kin of an elder family healer selects one among their descendants to assist them in their practice (Chavanduka 1997; Reynolds 1996). Whilethe apprenticeship demands hands-on practice with TMK\u2014 identifying, collecting and preparing plants; identifying,understanding and healing illnesses\u2014it also re-quires lessons in the greater customary, symbolic and social milieu. The sum of the extended apprenticeship is the at- tainment of invaluable intuition ( mapipi ) related to the re-257 lationships and cultural codes that direct an entire TMK system. For Zimbabweans, the elders (as well as the de- ceased ancestors) are the key to continuing access to and in-heritance of TMK through special kusvikirwa ) knowledge is re- vealed as a gift (Frommer 2002). 5 Hence, while a general familiarity with traditional medici- nal plants is possessed by many within the local community, only selected and trained individuals gain enough familiar-ity with TMK to know with certainty what combination of plants, rituals, charms, divinations and diagnoses are effec- tive under what conditions. As a result, different lineagesand bodies of TMK have evolved\u2014some more specialized, customary, effective or powerful than others, depending on the different territories or situations. 6 Symbolic and social capital While innovation in TMK is necessary to meet the changing needs of local Zimbabwean communities, it is not economicincentives that fuel this process. Traditional healers who have been specially selected to access and keep the ancestral knowledge finds themselves entrusted with a duty in whichthey are expected to share and cure before remuneration is even considered. 7 Further, it is not required that the in- sights, intuition, and innovation of a personal practice beshared in order to gain remuneration because healers are valued first as cultural authorities, second as practitioners, and third as practicing scientists. Hence, traditional healersreceive a different type of payment\u2014that of community consecration (symbolic capital). 8 The highest authority and rewards are given to those healers who appropriately reverethe TMK ( kuchengetera ) and demonstrate respect for the customary rituals, healing, figures, symbols, proverbs, and narratives that are used to enrich and illuminate the entiresocial field. 9 For instance, in addition to healing, mishonga is used symbolically to give impetus to culturally ordained responses, rituals, and activity that may manipulate any setof factors in the environment, e.g., for success in business, politics, winning arguments, extending influence, or set- tling disputes. Because these practices exist in a realmwhere they are accepted, spoken of, and understood they become \" kushanda ,\" or, effective. However, just because these practices are \"cultural\" and rely on the traditionalcodes does not mean they are not scientific or innovative. In fact, one of the strengths of these practices lies in their flex- ibility in diagnosing and healing each problem or illness in-dividually. As a result, careful customization (opposed to a standard set of diagnoses) yields many opportunities for in- novation and advancement in practice.Non-customary practices Presently, however, several non-customary practices that appropriate the physical substrates of TMK ( mishonga ) also neglect the importance of the cultural and ritual matrix that may spark individual insights and innovation. As Zim- babwean merchants, scientists and a trade union of tradi-tional healers have begun to remove the physical mishonga for product development and distribution, the entire repro- duction of TMK practices ( hun'anga ) as well as the entire cultural symbolic system is threatened. Further, when these non-customary practices are linked with foreign pharma- ceutical companies, the focus on product developmentweakens the emphasis on ancestral gift and heritage and thereby also the expectations of duty and responsibility with respect to the local communities who rely on thesepractices (Wyneberg 1999; 2000). Because TMK has always had a degree of collective sharing, unconsecrated and non- customary practitioners have been able to take libertieswith the mishonga in ways that have begun to breed local misuse, misdiagnoses, and fraud. 10 As a result of these diver- gent practices, an estrangement between traditional healersand their communities is settling in to such an extent that the entire reproduction of cultural practices and relation- ships that fuel innovation within the traditional medicinalknowledge system is threatened. Prognosis Nonetheless, Zimbabwe has a changing and evolving cul- ture. Recent years have seen specific customary figures from the distant past ( PasiChigare ) or from the \"Liberation War\" 11 used to encourage the tourism industry. In theory, new local practices cannot be conceived of as not \"cultural\" simply because they do not flow directly from the orthodox tradition. Hence, so as to not conscript and freeze the pro-cesses that reproduce culture as a resource, both customary practices and non-customary practices must have legisla- tion to support and protect traditional medicinal knowledgeas part of the social service sector. Conclusion While industrial countries believe that IPR for intellectual resources fuels innovation through reward, the value-added to biological resources by cultural resources has symbolicengines that move it. The singular focus in development circles on protecting \"plant genetic resources\" overlooks the relationship between it and other resources and denies that258IK Notes Number cultural resources are crucial for the continued health, re- production, and innovation in each type of resource. The author's findings show that TMK is accessed, kept, and used by individual practitioners in order to share it ef- fectively and to attain full valuation in the surrounding community combats the assumption in development circlesthat TMK is primarily a collective resource. It is important to look past this assumption, which is married to the expan- sion of an intellectual property rights regime, especiallysince this has served to justify the alienation between indi- viduals, families and communities and their cultural and biological heritage. While plant genetic resources have been called a \"green- gold\" in recent years, in reality it is has been the access to territorial cultural resources (based on customary and non-customary practices with local medicinal plants) that have yielded the pharmaceutical applications receiving protec- tion as intellectual property (Wyneberg 1999; 2000). There-fore, cultural (customary and non-customary) practices re- lated to biological heritage need a system of protections that enhance a capacity to keep relationships, social systems, so-cial/symbolic matrices that reproduce territorially impor- tant knowledge alive. The author has outlined how this may be done in accordance with the United Nation's Interna-tional Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights (1966) in more detail for Zimbabwe.1 A prior, or \" a priori \" right is recognized for local communities in the Af- rican Union's Model Law (2001). 2 Shona is a national language of Zimbabwe from the Bantu heritage. The importance of doing fieldwork in a territorial language is illustrated inthe discovery of concepts unique to Bantu tradition that can not be eas-ily translated into English without casting doubt on their non-supersti-tious reality, e.g., charm, magic, 3 Magic, according to Leach (1976) is an index of the possible. While the cause of an identified effect is not verified, the potential effects still havevery real implications for believers. In the author's research this in-cludes an affirmative belief that banal empiricism may be transcendedwith ritual and mishonga . 4The customary and the cosmological, the magical and the spiritual, the bureaucratic and the modern all of these may represent simultaneousrealities, sub-realities and hyperrealities for Zimbabweans who traversethe beliefs, practices and ways of individuals inhabiting rural, custom-ary, urban, scientific, entrepreneurial, spiritual and magical realms andcommunities. 5 A special phrase, gift of the ancestors, ( chipo vadzimu ) indicates the spe- cial rules pertaining to a heritage and gift as opposed to a commodity.Anthropologists such as Marcel Mauss, Bronislaw Malinowski, andAnnette Weiner, have all written about the engines and rules of gift giv-ing. Common to each analysis is the emphasis that these special itemsdo not follow economic rationale but are rather tied into social and sym-bolic status aquisitions. 6 The author's research found that the \" godobori' n'anga is said to have the most customary appeal and therefore the most powerful wielding ofmishonga . Further, she found some patterns suggesting distinctions be- tween regional, family, childbirth, environmental and magic mishonga . 7 Often, a token or a delayed reimbursement is satisfactory. 8 In recent years, development officials have begun to pay more attention to symbolic capital (Bourdieu 1977). Yet, that this capital is a convert-ible form that can encourage particular products, services and values oreven efficiency in the absence of monetary input has not to date receivedadequate credit in the development of individuals, practices or societies.Symbolic capital is also most evident vis-\u00e0-vis ones position in a family. 9 This helps build status and power for that family, clan ( dunhu ) and/or totem ( mutopa ). 10 I case of the African Potato ( Hypoxesis hemericallidae ) in my published research: The Cultural Right to Traditional Medicinal Knowledge in Zimbabwe\" (2002) McGill University. 11 The second Chimurenga , the Liberation War, was fought for Zimbabwe's independence from the British Colonial goverment.57259IK Notes 58 July 2003Grassroots Women's Approachto Capacity Building The narrative presented here is part of the doctoral research study prepared by Preeti Shroff-Mehta at the StateUniversity of New York at Buffalo during 2000-2002. Prof. Anil Gupta at Society for Research and Initiativesfor Sustainable Technologies and Institutions (SRISTI), India,www.sristi.org, guided the field study inGujarat and Tamilnadu states in India. Indigenous knowledge context of a grassroots woman innovator Malatiben Chaudhari is a female farmer in Gujarat, India who has struggled with her life in a challengingrural environment and disenfranchised community. In the face of these con- straints, she has built and improved in-digenous capacity to create efficient and profitable livestock enterprises, and supported sustainable develop-ment in her community and beyond. Through her innovations, Malatiben has successfully transformed the eco-nomic activities of an agriculturally de- pressed region in the Mehasana district of Gujarat. Over the years, she has suc-cessfully built a thriving farm and live- stock enterprise. Malatiben Chaudhri's narrative summary presented here highlights two aspects of indigenous knowledge: \u007f Understanding by local community members of specific needs and their ability to find unique and sustainable solutions to seasonal and long-termproblems; and \u007f The ability of grassroots women to overcome constraints and build ca-pacity within their communities and regionsMalatiben Chaudhari's narrative I am a woman farmer and livestock keeper. I always feel the urge to dosomething new despite difficult circum- stances. I was born in a Prajapati fam- ily (a marginal caste group) in a poorrural community in Gujarat, India. As a child, I observed a local teacher who used to walk to the Harijan (Dalit) community every evening to conduct adult education classes. After a while, I gathered the courage to ask himwhether I could also attend classes. These were my early lessons in 'lit- eracy'. We had no school or classroommaterials. We all wrote with a stick in the sand. I managed to study up to the 4th standard and then had to drop outbecause the high school was too far away. In those days, not many girls could continue their education beyondthe primary school. My husband belongs to a Chaudhari caste family. Its social status is higherthan the status of my family. After mar- riage the family gave us a small room in their home in the village. My husband'sfamily did not own agricultural land and did not earn much. We tried to start a small grocery shop but failed. Iwas not happy and wanted a profession of my own that would make me proud260IK Notes Number 58 of my work. Because of my parents' background as poor prajapati (pot makers), my husband's family never fully ac- cepted me and considered me not capable of thinking on myown. My Sasri and the gam (in-laws family and village com- munity) considered me ill-equipped for land ownership or farming. I had to face humiliations every day. They told mein many ways that my knowledge was not valuable and that I did not posses 'Avadat' (worthy skills). I remained silent for a long time but continued to observe the village situation. Almost all families produced a monoc- ulture cash crop Bajara ( Pennisetum glaucum, Pearl Mil- let). Poor land quality and continuous droughts prevented viable or profitable commercial farming. People kept live- stock mainly for farm work. They concentrated on agricul- ture and not on livestock rearing and milk production as asource of income. Buffaloes and young calves were not given proper care. The livestock was always kept in crowded and unclean spaces. The young calves were given left-over fod-der and received poor quality care. It took 6-7 years for the buffaloes and cows to produce milk. The average milk pro- duction per buffalo was 2-3 liters a day. It was clear thatpeople in the region were wasting their money on the live- stock. It was too much of a burden for the women to manage agricultural activities, children, household work and live-stock husbandry. I thought that it should be possible to grow local fodder in the poor quality soil. Why not try livestock managementand earn money through selling milk? I was convinced that if we focused on livestock husbandry, the animals should produce milk within 2-3 years and we would save 4-5 extrayears' expenses and efforts. The challenge was to achieve it all: no pesticides, utilization of local resources, high quality care for the livestock, manageable workload, improved over-all milk production and incomes and community recogni- tion of my knowledge. No one believed me. So it was impor- tant to demonstrate the new approach to the entire village. Kudarati Niyam and scientific approach (natural logic and systematic efforts)The way our children require nutritious food and constant care, calves also need special care. So in 1970, I decided to try out dairy livestock. I was determined to prove that I hadthe knowledge and the capacity to perform difficult tasks on my own. No one gives an opportunity to a woman...we have to find one and pursue it. Initially I borrowed money and bought two calves for Rs. 40 in the local market. I looked after them day and night like my children. I thought carefully about the daily needs ofthe buffaloes and young calves, such as dry and green fodderrequirements, health problems and home remedies, con- tinuous water supply, clean environment, pregnancy cycle and other seasonal needs. My own family members and thevillage people ridiculed me to remind me that I did not have the required skills and knowledge to manage the livestock and that I was crazy to look after the livestock as my chil-dren. Yet, I was determined to work hard and learn more de- spite the lack of encouragement from my own family and community. I needed the milk money to support my family. I always wanted to understand the 'science' of livestock management and at the same time rely on my Kotha Suz (context-specific knowledge and intuition). Kotha Suz is not exclusive like formal schooling and expert knowledge\u2014even illiterate and poor women have it and use it. My mother taught me about taking care of animals. She had foundhomemade and quickly available remedies from the house- hold or the nearby forest for treating livestock. I have also learned\u2014and continue to learn\u2014a lot by observing ecologi-cal and economic changes within my village. I always believed that Chila per chalava karata chilo padvo vadhare agatyano che (it is more significant to set a trend rather than follow it). I agree that it is important to learn from external knowledge but the critical task is to un- derstand the application of any knowledge within our spe-cific context. It is also important to focus on innovation pro- cess and optimize it in order to facilitate a broader impact at the regional and national level. Planning a locally successful enterprise: key principles and valuesThe critical aspects in livestock keeping are: knowledge of the daily care process; knowledge of available fodder mate- rial; continuous learning about innovative livestock hus-bandry practices. From the beginning I have focused on an integrated farming and livestock management approach. Utilization of agricultural waste: I observed that many residues of dried Bajara ( Pennisetum glaucum , Pearl Millet) were left behind after harvest in the fields. I tried to mix the residues with fodder grasses and created a special ration formy livestock. This has become a highly nutritious fodder formula used by other farmers and communities in the re- gion. The mix is always prepared especially for the animals depending upon their health, weight, height, size and cur- rent condition. A special mix of several local ingredients in- cluding green and dry fodder, crop residues, governmentrecommended nutritious feed additives and other secret homemade ingredients such as Jaggery (unrefined brown sugar)are mixed to prepare a local feed. I am stronglyagainst the use of chemicals and artificial ingredients in261 farming and livestock management. The total milk produc- tion per buffalo/cow in my stable is 2-3 times higher than the average in the region. High-quality care People in the village were shocked when my buffaloes pro-duced a total of 17.3 liters milk per day for the first time. This was double the average of milk produced by other ani- mals in the village. Soon the livestock management experts,agriculture scientists and government veterinarians came to see my small farm and innovative practices. Both buffalos won awards in the local livestock and regional milk qualitycontest. For the first time in my life, I won Rs. 25 ( approxi- mately US$0.50 at present rates) and Rs. 200 as a reward in various contests. Finally my hard work had paid off andsomeone had recognized my efforts. My knowledge had be- come valuable. Once my livestock enterprise got stabilized and I could hire more help, I began to focus even more on the special needs of my animals rather than on increased milk produc- tion alone. The question I asked myself was \"If I feel theneed to drink water anytime, animals probably feel the same way\". So I installed a continuous water supply system for drinking and insisted on keeping the animals and stableclean. At present, five workers look after the stable day and night. All animals are given baths three times a day. I makesure they do not get ticks. A clean environment and not medication prevents ticks. Residual fodder from the trough is removed immediately to maintain a clean stable. Theyoung calves, buffaloes and cows receive fresh fodder mix according to their age, size and weight. All workers ensure that fodder is not mixed up with droppings. Many otherfarmers do not pay attention to these details. Most male farmers own 4-6 animals and use family labor (mainly women) to manage their livestock. It is very difficult for awoman to take care of so many animals, given the house- hold, family and farm responsibilities. It is so important to have a small number of livestock that is manageable for thewomen in the family. Knowledge sharing and learning I also believe that specialists in the field and professional in- stitutions must test local experiments and new knowledge. I attend local and national innovation-related workshops andlivestock management related events. I always interact with government and foreign veterinarians, agricultural scien- tists and other dairy-management experts during their visitto the area and during a village level meeting or a workshop.Women are not supposed to attend these kinds of institu- tional gatherings but I make it a point to participate. I am trying to convince other women in my village to do the same\u2014but it is not easy. It is so important for rural women to have access to institutions of knowledge and external net- works . Regional impact A few years ago, I heard about a specially prepared animalfeed mix distributed by the AGRO Research Company and the Doodh Sagar Dairy (Regional Milk Dairy Cooperative), which was not popular in the area. The animals did not likeit very much and therefore farmers did not buy it. I mixed the feed with the locally available fodder in a particular way and animals started to eat this new, very nutritious feed.Now I feel proud because farmers in the district are using the same feed by using my methods to increase milk produc- tion. I am happy to have set a trend. Company representa- tives visited my farm and thanked me for developing the lo- cal version of their product. Many farmers in the area are now focusing on dairy keep- ing rather than farming. Initially, the women in the region observed my practice carefully and adopted them. The male farmers took some time to recognize the new approach.Now we grow crops for subsistence purposes only and fod- der for milk production. Many farmers and communities in the region now rely on dairy keeping. We support the second largest Milk Cooperative\u2014Mehsana Doodh Sagar Dairy\u2014 in the region. Grassroots women's participation and asset ownership Today I own two buffalos and nineteen cows (Sankar Gai\u2014 the local breed). My livestock averages 10-12 liters of milkper animal per day, which is more than double the average in the region. I am earning well and live a comfortable life. The Mehsana Dudh Sagar dairy in the village has comput-erized its functions and now we women can measure the fat percentage in our milk and receive the appropriate price for the milk. This way it is easier to keep track of daily produc-tion and monthly income. I have purchased land with this income, employed four full-time workers, renovated the house, installed a bore-well in my farm and sent my son tothe university. My status in the family and within the community has changed\u2014now I command respect and moral authority. Lifeis never easy for women, but they have to learn to struggle despite difficult circumstances. I believe that 'Mushkeli to Sanshodhanni Janamdata Che' (Hardship is the mother ofinnovation).262IK Notes Number My only fear is that the next generation expects quick re- sults and forgets that details such as a clean stable or con- tinuous water supply are critical components of successfullivestock keeping. The younger generations have received formal education and do not respect 'rural professions' or the knowledge of the rural poor people. It is a tragedy that acquiring formal education means the loss of Kotha Suz and Atmagyan (indigenous knowledge and wisdom) . My only hope is that organizations like SRISTI, which recognize andsupport our efforts, will preserve innovative and sustain- able indigenous practices.Narrative by Malatiben Chaudhry, Gujarat, India.

(prtshroff@aol.com)58263IK Notes 59 August 2003Adzina : An Indigenous System of Trial by Jury on the Ghana-Togo Border This article was written by Ben K. Fred-Mensah, Assistant Professor of International Relations and consultant in internationaldevelopment at Howard University, Washington, DC. E-mail bfred-mensah@howard.edu or bmens@earthlink.net In a recent article in this series, the au- thor discussed the indigenous prin- ciples that undergird the maintenanceof social control among Buems of Buem-Kator on the Ghana side of the Ghana-Togo border in the Buem Tradi-tional Area in the Jasikan District in the Volta Region of Ghana. The current article, too, is about the same Buems.In this one, the author presents the in- digenous Buem jury system, known as adzina . But before discussing the na- ture and process adzina , he first dis- cusses bate kate , which the Buem fo- rum for adjudication of which adzina is an integral part. Bate Kate Bate kate can mean adjudication and can also mean arbitration. In the indig- enous Buem conflict management sys- tem, bate kate is a means of external control which disputing parties seek from a third party. This form of control, which can be exercised by a lineagehead or the town chief, becomes neces- sary when disputants can no longer rely on trust between them. The conse-quences of lack of trust are thus miti- gated by the external control, which provides an alternative source of confi-dence that expectations will be met.According to the Buem elders, Buems make it a point to try to avoid bate kate which they consider to be adversarialand time-consuming, not only to the disputants, but also to their respective kinsfolk who are customarily obliged toaccompany them to hearings. Unlike benyaogba ukpikator \u2014discussed in the article earlier mentioned\u2014 bate kate is a more elaborate process, which proceeds in stages and normally involves inten- sive cross-examination and assemblingof witnesses and, where necessary, ex- hibits. In terms of monetary outlay too, bate kate can be expensive. This is be- cause fines, and in some cases, costs are imposed on convicted parties. Cases that are submitted for bate kate normally include cases that either have failed to be resolved through the benyaogba ukpikator option or are con- stitutionally defined to be criminal. Criminal cases include murder, trea- son, and disparaging statementsagainst chiefs or public officials. In- fringements of well-revered taboos of the chiefdom are also a criminal casefor which settlement must be sought at bate kate . Bate kate suggests a number of char- acteristics of both procedure and con- tent. It can be conducted either at a lin- eage head's court or the town chief's264IK Notes Number 59 court, depending upon the gravity of the offence. In theory, bate kate can go through a number steps before a dispute is finally settled. In other words, one or both parties to a dis-pute can express dissatisfaction with a settlement and may decide to forward the matter to a higher court. Appeals from lower courts have to be sent to the most immediate highercourt. For example, an appeal from a lineage head's court has to be sent to the town chief's court and an appeal from the town chief's court must be forwarded to the court of thesenior chief' of the area, known as akwamuhene . The akwamuhene is the most senior divisional chief in Buem- Kator; hence the paramount chief's direct representative inthe area. If settlement cannot be reached at the akwamuhene 's court then the case must be referred to the paramount chief's court in the traditional capital. In practice, however, most disputes are settled at the town level, especially because of the costs (in terms of time and physical resources) that are incurred when cases are al-lowed to go through a number of steps before they are fi- nally settled. There is the notion among the Buems that if a dispute can be settled at all, it must be possible for lineageheads or the town chief and his elders to settle it at the low- est possible level. Since kinsfolk of disputing parties are tra- ditionally expected to support kin members and accompanythem to all courts, they tend to prevail upon kith and kin to accept a settlement at the lowest possible court. Deliberations at bate kate can be an elaborate process. In line with its usual procedure, each disputant presents his or her version of what has occurred. After both have been heard, adjudicators closely question each disputant on thebasis of what he or she has said. The objective is to reach an agreement on a single story by eliminating ambiguous ele- ments in the statements of the adversaries. There is an ex-tensive use of evidence, witnesses, and cross-examination. Court deliberations are usually opened to the general public and everyone present has the privilege to cross-examine anyof the disputants. Order at court is strictly enforced and the use of abusive language is discouraged as this can lead to contempt of court. Adzina For the purpose of this paper, the word adzina may be trans- lated as \"going into seclusion to meditate on an issue.\"Adzina provides a mini forum within which a verdict (badunkortor ) from bate kate proceedings is determined. This step in the bate kate process is primarily meant to en- sure fairness to the adversarial parties or an accused person brought before a hearing. Adzina is said to offer the manag-ers of bate kate an opportunity to \"consult with the abrewa\". Abrewa literally means grandmother or an old woman who is believed to be endowed with supernaturalwisdom, an unquestionable sense of fairness, and the capa- bilities to preside over adzina deliberations. As the Buem version of trial by jury, Adzina works this way: to arrive at a verdict in all manner of cases that come before a lineage head or town chief, some of the court par- ticipants, who have been present throughout the courthearing and have been following the proceedings, are se- lected at the end of the hearing to deliberate and come out with a verdict. The jury is normally made up, among others,of the respective representatives of the presiding judge, the adjudicating council, and the disputing parties. This newly appointed jury will then leave the courtroom and go andfind a place where they are both out sight and ear reach of the other court attendants. There, they will deliberate among themselves until reaching a verdict. In doing so, theyare said to be consulting with the abrewa . When a verdict is reached, the jury will return to the courtroom and present their findings to the judge. Throughthe returning jurors, the abrewa will send words of admoni- tion to the guilty party and words of consolation to the inno- cent. The verdict is either accepted wholly and a fine is im-posed on the convicted party, or it is rejected and the case forwarded to a higher court. The presiding judge will deliver the verdict this that \"according to the Old Woman's verdict, to which they, the panel members, have agreed, so and so hasbeen found guilty. The Old Woman has sent a message of admonition to the guilty party and words of consola- tion to the innocent\"). Once a case is settled, it is assumed that lelorkalorbunu, which represents the people's concept of fairness and jus-tice, has been attained. Fines ( banyinkortu ) are thus sug- gested. The fines are normally in kind, involving alcoholic beverages usually palm wine\u2014called kubo nte\u2014 and live- stock. The size of the fine depends on the gravity of the of- fence, the manner in which the convicted party has con- ducted himself or herself in the course of the deliberation,and previous offence records. Once the fines are paid, it is assumed that the settlement has been accepted by the dis- putants. The drinks are used as a libation in order to propi-tiate the gods ( atibluku ). It is poured by the fetish priest, in the absence of whom an elder will do it.265 With a calabash of drinks in hand, the fetish priest will pour the libation accompanied by statements such as: The almighty God up in the heavens, the earth on which we stand ( Oh! Atibluku atsa drink, we beseech the gods to help us to restore peace between the adversarial parties. Asboth parties drink from this calabash, none should nurse malicious intentions against the other. Strike down whoever will nurse malicious intention towardsthe other, or flout the authority of the judges, or at- tempt to bring calamity into the community. It must be noted that in more grievous cases, particu- larly cases in which a culprit was found to have used a weapon which is more harmful than the fist in a fight and,in doing so, has spilled the blood of a fellow Buem, the party is liable to fines, which involve livestock, usually a ram (kofonu ). This fine is imposed whether the party is found guilty of the offence or not. In such a case, the fetish priest will pour a libation and call the spirits of the ancestors of the disputants three times, mention the earth ( kalor ) three times, and implore them to the ( ntedie musue ) that the blood-spilling may bring upon the community. After this, the ram will beslaughtered at the very spot at which the human blood was spilled. Both the drink and the flesh of the animal will be shared among all those present. With this ritual ceremony,the gods are believed to have been propitiated and the earth and the parties cleansed.Analysis Unlike the modern jury system, whereby jurors are selected before the start of the trial, jurors in the Buem adzina sys- tem are appointed after the prosecution and defense argu- ments are over. The benefit of this manner of selecting ju- rors derives from the fact since no one can tell who the ju-rors will be and since anyone present at the proceedings, and who are considered to be of good standing in the com- munity can be selected, everyone at the trial is compelled toattentively follow the process. Also, because members of the Buem communities live in close contact with each other and are connected by webs of ritual, political, and economic ties,jurors cannot afford to be deliberately biased. The invocation of supernatural forces as a means of en- forcing court decision among Buems shows that the people'sconflict management methods provide not only the secular means and guidance to disputants to strive for reconcilia- tion, but that the fora are also the media through which thegods are expected to sustain the rules of social control.This should not be surprising given the fact that the Buem po- litico-judicial system lacks any form of legally approved useor threat of use of physical coercion, normally carried out by the police and incarceration of the guilty, as associated with the state in the modern systems.266IK Notes 60 September 2003Institutional Constraints in Promoting IK Community Access to Social Networks and Formal Institutions This article is written by Preeti Shroff- Mehta and is based on her Ph.D. field research study conducted in India during 2000-2 001. The research study documented personal narratives of sixteen local innovators and community members experiences in reviving and tra ns- forming Indigenous knowledge practices. The study was supervised by Prof. Anil Gupta at Society for Research and Innovations fo r Sustainable Technologies and Institutions (SRISTI) and Mr. P. Vivekanandan at Sustainable-Agriculture and Environmental Volunta ry Action (SEVA). Ms. Shroff-Mehta is affiliated with the University of Maryland and will teach Indigenous Learning and Global Act ion courses starting Spring 2004. In recent years, many international de- velopment agencies and non-govern- ment organizations have renewed theirefforts to provide and promote indig- enous knowledge orientation in devel- opment planning and practice. Theseefforts emphasize local knowledge sys- tems and practices as valuable re- sources in global development. Thefour distinct aspects of indigenous knowledge oriented development inter- ventions frequently debated are:\u007fDocumentation : indigenous knowl- edge documentation, communication and adaptation; \u007fOwnership : local ownership of spe- cific knowledge practices; \u007fReward system : rewarding local knowledge innovations (through documentation and dissemination, cross-region recognition, global appli-cation and value addition); and \u007fAccess to knowledge and institutions : linking modern and indigenous insti-tutions for sustainable development and enhancing local community ac- cess to markets, government agen-cies, financial institutions, university based research centers and interna- tional development publications.This study of local innovators in In- dia reflects on the IK aspects outlinedabove, but emphasize the institutional access dimension in promoting innova- tive local approaches. Clearly, there arelikely to be more similarities than dif- ferences between what is described here and the situation in other develop-ing countries of the South. Indigenous knowledge revival and adaptation: Local community goals Ongoing efforts to revive community and region-specific agricultural, health,education and economic livelihood practices in global development efforts point to the value of local knowledgeinitiatives in international develop- ment. In a series of interviews with lo- cal innovators conducted during an IKresearch study, the sixteen community members across two states in India out- lined the goals of IK practice revival:(1) Addressing poverty and livelihood issues; (2) Cost and labor efficiency in agricul- ture production; (3) Environmental sustainability and conservation;267 (4) Managing seasonal externalities such as drought, floods, labor shortages; (5) Community self-reliance and preservation of values;(6) Improved socio-economic status and employment gen eration; (7) Women's representation;(8) Community members' need to learn. While outlining the goals of indigenous knowledge revival and adaptation, the local community members also pointed out a series of institutional constraints in adding value to lo- cal knowledge innovations. 1 (1) Family and community constraints: Many local inno- vators face opposition from immediate family members and/ or broader community members. In some cases, such as ex-perimental agricultural plots on existing farm land, family members feel hesitant to invest years of hard work as well as forgo immediate income without a clear sense of the finaloutcome of crop innovations. Community members do not adapt innovative farming and natural agriculture practices unless the benefits of mass-scale production are well-dem-onstrated in the short run and the innovative product is well-established in the market. In many cases, poorer local farmers also do not have access to farm land for seed andtechnology cultivation and knowledge of legal certification and appropriate marketing channels. (2) Seasonal constraints : The greatest local constraint in reviving and modifying innovative local knowledge systems is seasonal factors. A group of local farmers in Tamilnadu and Gujarat states pointed out that their investments in ag-riculture and herbal farm experiments have often failed due to poor monsoons and consequent droughts, lack of drink- ing and irrigation water, loss of livestock and labor migra-tion. Another critical dimension is understanding the his- torical context within which a traditional practice was vi- able, for example the size of land, land-people ratio, foodpatterns. Reviving certain traditions in contemporary times requires adaptation and modification in order to incorpo- rate evolving context. (3) Formal institutional constraints: The formal institu- tional constraints identified by community members reflect local people's lack of access to 'new social networks' such asagricultural technology and extension agencies, higher edu- cation and research institutions, financial institutions, po- litical parties, NGOs and international organizations (as op-posed to the village based and community specific tradi- tional social networks. 2The table summarizes the perceptions of local community members regarding institutional constraints in promoting local innovations and their efforts to overcome specific con-straints. It outlines a series of institutional constraints iden- tified by local innovators and other community members. These include their concerns pertaining to 'negative socialcapital'\u2014i.e., the cost of maintaining access to and partici- pating within social networks, the 'exclusive' nature of cer- tain dominant urban and rural networks and the burden ofconforming to social networks (over-embeddedness, paro- chialism and rigidity). 1 The local innovators identified a range of institutional constraints that reflect their limited access or the lack of access to established formaland informal institutions and associated social networks. Institutionsrepresent organizational structures, ideologies, adherence to particulardevelopment approaches, internal and external networks and explicit aswell as tacit value set and beliefs. Also, institutions follow establishedrules and regulations and adopt certain mechanisms to ensure the en-forcement of rules. \"Institution builders can be diverse\u2014such as policy makers, businesspeople, or community members. Corporate, collateral, and bank-ruptcy laws are public institutions, as are the judiciary, tax collectionagencies, and regulatory agencies. Banks, reciprocity between com-munity members, and land inheritance norms are private institu-tions. Many private institutions exist under the aegis of public insti-tutions. Private banks, for example, operate within the framework ofpublic law. Social norms exist within (or without) formal laws.\"(World Development Report 2000 , Box 1.2, p.6) 2 The notion of social capital refers to the actual and potential resources individuals obtain from knowing others, being part of a social networkwith them, or merely from being known to them and having a goodreputation. The two distinct aspects of social capital are: an individual'sability to access resources given his positioning within a specific socialnetwork, and a communities' access to multiple social networks. \"BothBourdieu and Coleman emphasize the intangible character of socialcapital relative to other forms. Whereas economic capital is in people'sbank accounts and human capital is inside their heads, social capital in-heres in the structure of their relationships. To possess social capital, aperson must be related to others, and it is those others, not himself, whoare the actual source of his or her advantage. [ ......] the motivation ofothers to make resources available on concessionary terms is not uni-form. At the broadest level, one may distinguish between consumma-tory versus instrumental motivations to do so.\"268IK Note Number Institutional Constraints in Adapting Local Knowledge Innovations Innovation [Maturation Stage]* Institutional/Sector Constraints Innovator Strategy Outcome Livestock Management Process [Advanced] development planners and local communities' lack of faith in 'rural women's knowledge' the female innovator's lack of access to rural and urban institutional and social networks establishment and demonstration of the innovative practice to the village community and outside institutions educating the outside 'experts' and various development agencies *regional livelihoods transformation * the innovator's active participation in the emerging grassroots knowledge network Energy Free/green Agricultural Technology , machinery [Advanced] lack of commercial investments in locally developed machinery limited marketing and dissemination collaborative product development and marketing efforts with SRISTI regional and national demand for the products and growing sales High-Yielding Organic Crop [New] poor agricultural drought management mechanisms -
