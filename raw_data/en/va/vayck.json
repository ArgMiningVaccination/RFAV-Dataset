To ready myself for these jobs I do a Detox Diet Week. I do this to reduce bloat, trim a few pounds, clear up my skin and ensure my long hair will shine under the lights. I also participate in the detox cleanse when I feel I've gotten too obsessed with food, a common issue for a cookbook author. And I recommend it to people who need a boost in [weight loss](https://loseweightbyeating.com/how-to-lose-weight/), want to cleanse their bodies and in general just feel better.

Why Does The Detox Diet Week Work? The reason this Detox Diet Week works so well is the plethora of raw fruits and vegetables. Raw fruits and vegetables help scrub your body clean( [1](https://www.wikihow.com/Cleanse-Your-Body-With-Fresh-Fruits-and-Vegetables)) with removing toxins( [2](https://www.livestrong.com/article/372610-natural-foods-that-remove-toxins-from-the-body/)) and extra body fat. Raw fruits and vegetables have more nutrients than cooked produce so when you have a metabolism boosting, beautifying vegetable like raw broccoli it's more effective than steamed or grilled broccoli, simply because it's still in the raw state. So try to be open to this very raw way of eating, and before you know it you will be feeling satisfied and fabulous while detoxing and losing weight. Below you'll find the [Detox Diet Week Guide](#detoxweekguide), 5 new [detox smoothie recipes](#detox-smoothie) (plus a link to 10 more), 5 [big bowl salad recipes](#bigbowlsalads), 3 [detox meal options](#detoxmealrecipes) (along with more links to more meal options), [detox snack options](#detoxsnacks), a [detox water / drinks guide](#detoxwateranddrinks) and a [detox meal plan](#detoxmealplan) to keep you on track. To give your weight loss an additional boost, I recommend using [detox water](https://loseweightbyeating.com/detox-water-recipes-fast-weight-loss/) for an extra detox cleanse. This Detox Diet Week slowly guides you into 2 all smoothie days, and gently back out. This way you gradually change your diet while boosting metabolism.

Chicken Fajita Lettuce Wraps I make 2 servings of this detox diet week recipe, and put out tortillas for my daughter, this way I don't have to make an extra meal for her. You can also make a few extra servings of this detox plan meal for leftovers, they are helpful if you have a family to cook for on the smoothie diet only days... you won't want to cook on those days and you can just serve leftover fajitas in tortillas, atop a salad, or inside a quesadilla to family members not participating on the 7 day weight loss detox plan.

Vegetarian (or turkey) Chili This chili can be made vegetarian, or with ground turkey or leftover shredded chicken. It works in perfectly in this cleanse diet program. To add ground turkey, brown it with the onions, to use leftover chicken, add it in with the tomatoes. You can also make this one week detox recipe in a crock pot. Once the onions and bell peppers are soft, move to the crock pot and continue the rest of the recipe in the crock pot. Cook on high for 4 hours or on low for 7. Freeze the leftovers in individual containers, this chili is great over an omelet or atop a baked potato.

So I wanted to include an all day breakfast option. Omelets are great any time of the day, I added cheese here in place of meat, so if you want to add meat you need to take out the cheese, leftover chicken or chopped turkey bacon work great here. Eggs, onions, bell pepper, and avocado are all great cleansing diet ingredients! You may notice these fat burning ingredients are in most of the detox weight loss recipes. Veggie Omelet Equipment - Skillet Ingredients - 1 teaspoon olive oil - 1 red bell pepper chopped - \u00bc cup sliced mushrooms - 5 cherry tomatoes sliced in half - 1 green onion chopped - 2 egg whites - 1 egg - 3 tablespoons sharp cheddar cheese - \u00bd avocado sliced - \u00bc cup fresh salsa optional Instructions - In a large skillet heat \u00bd teaspoon of olive oil on medium, add in the bell pepper, mushrooms and tomatoes. - Cook for 10 minutes until the bell peppers are soft, while they cook prep the eggs and shred the cheese. - Once the veggies are done cooking add in the green onion, turn off the heat and cover. - In a small skillet heat the remaining \u00bd teaspoon olive oil on medium low. Whisk the egg whites and eggs together with a tablespoon of water until light and airy and add to the small skillet. - Let the eggs cook slowly undisturbed until \u00bd of the eggs have set. - Use a spatula to gently lift one side of the omelet so that the runny eggs can pool below, then lay back down the cooked eggs and top the entire top of the omelet with cheese and cooked veggies.

On a Weight Loss Detox- DON'T drink processed water flavorings: Those little packets of flavoring that people add to their water actually are packed full of toxins that cause fat storage, weight gain, migraines, breakouts... the list goes on and on, so skip the flavor packets and go all natural. On a 7 Day Detox- DO drink coffee or tea (in moderation): What about [coffee](https://loseweightbyeating.com/benefits-of-coffee/)? I've got you covered, ideally it's good to skip coffee during this Detox Diet Week, but that's not always so easy to do. So limit yourself to one cup per day, you can have 1-2 cups of organic herbal tea, so if you drink coffee in the morning, choose herbal tea for your second cup in the afternoon. On a Detox for Weight Loss- DON'T have fake sugars Now that you know coffee in moderation is ok, lets talk about what to put in it. We are trying to skip processed sugars this week, so in lieu of sugar or flavored creamers (many with the same issues as the little flavor packets in the water paragraph above) choose an all natural creamer and an all natural sweetener. On a 7 Day Detox Plan- DO try low calorie creamers and all natural sweeteners I like coconut creamer and honey, but you can also try organic half and half, and coconut sugar or maple syrup (don't knock it till you try it, it's good!) I've included an all natural under [50 calorie latte recipe](https://loseweightbyeating.com/almond-milk-latte-drink/) below for those of you with coffee house tendencies.
