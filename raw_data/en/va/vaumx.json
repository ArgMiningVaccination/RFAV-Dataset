If you have extra time off work, use it to recuperate in case you have any vaccine side effects, like fatigue or mild fever. COVID-19 vaccination sites throughout King County are open this Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Story Memorial Day weekend is a great time to get a COVID-19 vaccination. Multiple vaccine sites are open over the holiday weekend, and the King County vaccination sites at Kent ShoWare Center and the Auburn Outlet Collection mall will remain open on Memorial Day. Everyone age 12 and older is eligible to be vaccinated. There is no cost for the COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of immigration or health insurance status. This Friday, Saturday and Sunday are especially good days for vaccination if you have some extra time off from work. Some people experience symptoms like headache, a sore arm or fatigue after getting the shot. These symptoms are more common after the second dose of vaccine. These are all signs that the body's immune system is building up protection. This holiday weekend can provide some extra time for recuperation. Thanks to vaccination we are heading into the Memorial Day weekend in a much better place than we were a few months ago, and I'm optimistic that the burden of COVID -19 will continue to decrease as more people are vaccinated,\" said Dr. Jeff Duchin, Health Officer, Public Health - Seattle & King County. \"However, COVID-19 is still circulating in our area. About 97% of current COVID-19 cases in King County are among unvaccinated people. That means if you are unvaccinated, your risk of catching COVID-19 is actually higher right now than it was last Memorial Day. If you haven't been vaccinated yet, getting your first shot this weekend will mean a safer summer for you, your loved ones, and your community.\" \"Getting vaccinated is quick, easy and free,\" said Francisco Arias-Reyes, King County's vaccination clinics manager. \"Our staff speak multiple languages and can answer your questions. You don't need an appointment and we can typically get you in and out in as few as 20 minutes. We would love to see you and your family at our Kent or Auburn site this weekend!\" Numerous sites throughout King County are open this Friday, Saturday and Sunday, with no appointment necessary.
