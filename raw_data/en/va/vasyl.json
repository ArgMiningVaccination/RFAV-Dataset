Acupuncture treats the system by causing the body to respond to the insertion of small pins placed in your body. This, in turn, causes a healing response to occur. Recent research indicates the connective tissue, or fascia, as the main tissue to be affected by the lightning quick healing signals transmitted throughout the body during an acupuncture session. In addition to the pain relief and myriad of other symptom alleviated, patients tend to report increased feelings of well-being immediately after, if not during their visit. Improved digestion, reduction of stress and anxiety and improved sleep are other helpful side effects. Chinese Herbs Classical Chinese herbal formulas are hundreds of years old, and even some are well over a thousand years old. The reason they are still used today is that they have been well-proven to be effective in treating imbalances in every organ and system of the body. Chinese herbal medicine is taken in many forms from pills to granules (which can be tailored to your exact needs), from teas to tinctures, or can also be used topically. Synergistic and sophisticated, these formulas are based on a Chinese Medicine diagnosis that is different than your Western Medicine diagnosis. In contrast to the practice of single herb usage such as in Western herbalism, these formulas are used as a primary form of medicine in much of the non-Western world. Massage Massage can be chosen as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with acupuncture, myofascial cupping or guasha. Whether your preferences are for a deep tissue massage, like Tuina, an energetic approach like Shiatsu or a Swedish style or a Structural Integrative approach, we aim to make your healing process as tailored to your needs as possible. Massage is an excellent way accelerate healing from accidents, and injury causing acute or chronic pain. Massage might truly be the oldest profession known to mankind. Integrative Medicine All of our board-certified practitioners are committed to utilizing evidence-based medicine. That means we focus on understanding what the scientifically proven interventions are that work best for your conditions. We also have respect for the modalities you choose to for your care and will work collaboratively with other providers in your care. Integrating means we will happily communicate and refer our to other doctors and specialists to optimize your treatment plan and help you meet your wellness needs. Nutritional Therapies Nutritional therapies take front and center in any comprehensive integrative medicine plan. One of the three foundational pillars of health involves healthy nutrition, alongside adequate sleep and physical activity. Not only limited to suggestions regarding which food is best for you, nutritional therapies can also include special diets, medicinal recipes and some form of functional medicine testing to learn more about the foods that may be ideal for you. Sometimes you might just need better focus with how to eat. We can do that, too. Pediatric Wellness Pediatric services in our clinic are wide-ranging and comprehensive, treating conditions from infancy to young adult. Newborns can benefit from gentle, non-retained needle (in and out acupuncture), as well as craniosacral treatments and non-insertive acupuncture techniques such as Pediatric Tuina Shonishin methods. Children generally decide which Chinese Medicine techniques they would like to try once, especially as after about 1.5 years old they make their preferences known. Primary family medicine services are available through osteopath Dr. Bair episodically or as long-term family care. Supplement Therapies Practitioner quality supplements including vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, amino acids, protein powders and other common nutraceuticals are often recommended as a shortcut to supporting your optimal health. Many patients prefer to purchase their products through us so that we can be in communication about the best products for you. Not only that but we help you to get the products that are the industry best at the best prices possible. We can provide functional medicine testing to hone in on the right products, and refer out for that service as well. Our Team We welcome you to our site and look forward to you visiting us in our lovely clinic. What Clients Say \"My healing journey started for me about 4 years ago or so, the moment I stepped into Kevi Keenom's office. I have had chronic lower back and neck pain after a very bad car wreck. She is very compassionate in her work. She is totally focused on her patient, she listens to your history and is fully engaged in the healing. She poses thoughtful questions to clarify all facets of the medical problem. Kevi has such a passion for the two thousand year old, Chinese medicine and educates the patient with all her knowledge and beliefs to help in the healing process. I started seeing Kevi for weekly acupuncture visits and after the very 1st one I knew I was at the right place. If you have any doubts about the effectiveness of acupuncture in today's world, you will leave Kevi's office the first time a believer in acupuncture because of the wonderful results you will receive. Kevi has been a true blessing to me and my healing.\" - Lisa Archuleta, Portland, OR "}
