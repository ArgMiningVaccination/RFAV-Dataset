And it seems odd to me that they'd focus especially on healthcare - not that it's not important, of course - but with reports of utilities like water and power being vulnerable, seems to me these should be a focus, first, right? After all, a hospital without water and power won't be in operation for very long, and if the outage lasts for more than a few days, it's not just the hospitals you then have to worry about, but society at large.This is an ARPA call for proposals? Saying this will produce anything \"soon\" is a stretch worthy of Mr Fantastic. This article is really muddled actually. It's rare that I say a press release is better reporting than an article about a press release, but this really doesn't explain what ARPA-H, how it's different from ARPA/DARPA, or what this initiative is about. It does mention that ARPA-H is part of HHS - it's not related to ARPA except through the fact that they're taking the model that the the Defense Department uses and are trying to apply it to other areas to fund research. And in the case of ARPA-H it's not necessarily just academic blue sky research.That's what I thought. And it seems odd to me that they'd focus especially on healthcare - not that it's not important, of course - but with reports of utilities like water and power being vulnerable, seems to me these should be a focus, first, right? After all, a hospital without water and power won't be in operation for very long, and if the outage lasts for more than a few days, it's not just the hospitals you then have to worry about, but society at large. Today, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), launched the Digital Health Security (DIGIHEALS) project to protect the U.S. healthcare system's electronic infrastructure. Through a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), the project will solicit proposals for proven technologies developed for national security and apply them to civilian health systems, clinical care facilities, and personal health devices. So as to \"why healthcare\" it's because the agency doing this funding is specifically interested in solutions for healthcare. It's not a broad ARPA grant, it's a Health and Human Services grant program. The Defense Department actually has projects for protecting critical infrastructure stuff, but our healthcare system isn't one of the things they're concerned with since they're thinking power plants, water supplies, etc.DIGIHEALS aims to ensure patients continue to receive care in the wake of a widespread cyberattack on a medical facility \u2014 like those that have caused hospitals to close their doors permanently. they are basically holding patients hostage to protect their bottom linesFor what hospitals charge (aka gouge) patients and insurers, the US Health system should NOT be given a handout from the fed. Corporate-run health care is its own failure, and private equity firms should not be permitted to own or control them. Too many doctors are \"enlisted\" to these big hospitals, along with their practices, which means the doctor has to funnel their patients to these hospitals. But the IT isn't well funded because the board wants its share. They'll spend a billion on high-tech scanners and medical devices, but the nurse's station and receptionists are using simple passwords, non-2FA and using the systems for internet access - I watched this at a CHOP... It's a good point actually. All of the concerns regarding encryption and passwords and systems security. Yet...I was at a medical office wherein a fax machine was against the counter outside an admin station with a half-dozen received faxes just sitting on it for the entire 45 minutes I sat in the waiting area. Anyone who walked up to the counter could read or take the supposed HIPAA-protected documents with them.Personally, I think the health care industry should work on eliminating faxes. It's absurd at how inefficient it can be for a doctor to send orders to another facility. The above content is as close to a concise outline of the problems with ARPA-H as one can get. As a physician in the USPHS who also did some civilian training and have had an interest in EHR IT peripherally for the last 20 years, the biggest problem I can see is that no-one has looked at the following:It's important to note that there are a lot of differences across the US healthcare system. People immediately jump to the for-profit hospitals, citing them as greedy, incompetent, money-driven organizations. There is some truth, given that obviously any for-profit company is looking to drive revenue and maximize profit, but much of this is done via internal cost-cutting measures, not gouging patients. Turnover is very high, as is burnout for both physicians and nurses, both of which have nationwide shortages. This leads to internal pressure on existing staff, creating a very difficult work environment. Not for profit hospitals, ambulatory care, and public health are in very precarious positions. There is a lot of consolidation within the hospital and ambulatory care space, in order to cut overhead costs. Public health is woefully under-funded across the board and relies heavily on grants in order to subsidize care for under-insured patients. Technically, these organizations operate at close to net-zero, and if the grant subsides were removed, there would be a net loss in profit. Some not for profit hospitals are allowed to operated in the red as long as they provide certain services (i.e. ER trauma triage, not allowed to go on diversion, etc.) but that can only happen for so long. If you want to blame somebody for the rising costs, go yell at the payers. Private payers barely cover the actual costs associated with the care provided, in both hospitals and ambulatory care. Medicaid varies state to state. Medicare pays surprisingly well compared to all other payers. Under-insured patients are the biggest write-off loss for hospitals and public health, as there's no way they are going to collect the highest-dollar visits. There is an in-between spot in out-of-pocket costs where patients will pay, but it's an insignificant flow of revenue. If you have private insurance, go look at the EOB from a hospital visit. Yes, the hospital charges are inflated, but it means nothing because there are negotiated rates based on DRGs for reimbursement. The hospital could inflate the billed charges 10x and it wouldn't matter. The payers determine everything, and if you want a semi-reliable flow of revenue, as a hospital you'll agree to their terms, because some money is better than none. I included this info to provide some insight into the crowd yelling \"OMG HOSPITALS ARE MONEY-LOVING GREEDY CORPS SCREW THEM ALL\" rioting with pitchforks. I'm not saying they are blameless, but to put it into context. On the IT side, it's a hot mess no matter which side you're on. There's going to be a mix of ancient legacy systems that haven't been migrated off of due to some very expensive clinical device(s) needing it, and replacement costs are exorbitant. There is also the ever-moving target of integration standards and the increase in federal reporting and data sharing requirements on top of standard end-user and IT systems infosec. Health IT systems, especially EHRs, are incredibly expensive to deploy, not counting additional costs around integration, legacy data migration, ongoing maintenance, updates, etc. As a reference point, the average cost for a single hospital to deploy EPIC is around $300M. Larger systems with multiple hospitals will spend over $1B to integrate all of their facilities. Cerner is only slightly cheaper, and those two absolutely dominate the hospital EHR market. It takes numerous experienced IT professionals with different experience domains to maintain a health IT infrastructure. It's not a lack of spending so much as that there are a lot of industry requirements, you need highly-specialized knowledge domains, and it's incredibly expensive to maintain and grow. The recent CARES Act is making things more difficult, as is HHS's increasingly ambitious regulatory prowess. Source: IT professional, worked in health IT for over a decade now, some grad school education in Health Informatics. Held multiple roles including sysadmin, EHR admin, health informatics, and project manager for ambulatory EHR migration for a public health department that also runs a FQHC with nine clinics. I have friends and contacts in the industry, across different aspects of healthcare, from clinical to IT to management. I find it odd that HHS/ARPA-H thinks that healthcare networks are completely unique when it pertains to cyber security. Sure they have some elements that are different from other types of environments. However for the most part the same security problems which healthcare faces have already been solved by other organizations, and with commercially available products. There simply needs to exist the money and will to implement them. Maybe the will should be enforced by HHS. US topic addressed to a US audience. Not everything has to \"reflect the global nature of [your] readership\" any more than topics on the UK NHS need to include primers for US, continental Europe, or Oceanic readers.Your headline doesn't reflect the global nature of your readership. I appreciate your post. Coming from the medical side of things, I recall a report from the head of our hospital once, and he remarked that the only industry with thinner margins than the hospital were supermarkets. People see high dollar amounts and assume that it's all going to the people providing the services, without realizing that the cost to obtain and maintain equipment, personnel, and medicine stocks (which all have expiration dates) is quite high. Then there's the fact that for-profit insurance (a strange concept, in itself) represents a terrible partner to work with. I've been on cases where the insurance company refused to pay the full amount of something, unless the hospital would cover half of the cost as well. It's the real-life equipment of that joke format that goes \"nice hospital you have there, would be a shame if something were to happen to it.\"I included this info to provide some insight into the crowd yelling \"OMG HOSPITALS ARE MONEY-LOVING GREEDY CORPS SCREW THEM ALL\" rioting with pitchforks. I'm not saying they are blameless, but to put it into context. No, they don't believe they're unique. But health care in the US does have unique regulatory requirements that make it especially vulnerable to attack. Those regulatory requirements makes the whole system extremely arthritic and brittle and unable to adapt easily to the threat environment that now exists. Hospitals, doctors offices, etc. can no longer depend on the nature of their business nor the Geneva Accords and the rules of civilized warfare to keep them out of harm's way. Many outlaw gangs and equally outlaw nations consider health care legitimate targets, either because many for-profit organizations have money (they are criminals after all morality doesn't enter into it, just level of risk) or because they can't be similarly attacked. Since it's often legally impossible (due to the requirements for each change to go through lengthy & expensive certification requirements) to mitigate or fix known vulnerabilities in health care appliances, support software, and records keeping due to antiquated laws that Congress is unlikely to adequately address any time soon, health care must rely on isolation & perimeter controls more than is wise in nearly any other industry. This creates some unique challenges that ARPA-H, HHS, and other agencies can study to see if there are other methods to address the issues. Why specifically health care? Because that's the industry those agencies investigate and support, not because there's anything inherently technically different about the W/LAN network in a hospital versus the local discount chain other than the topologies of their networks. Ultimately though, Congress is going to have to get its head out of its collective ass and come up with a comprehensive regulatory regime that takes into account rapidly shifting threat models in all federally regulated industries. The US is no longer immune to regular attacks on its infrastructure and the powers that be aren't as aware of this fact as they should be. US topic addressed to a US audience. Not everything has to \"reflect the global nature of [your] readership\" any more than topics on the UK NHS need to include primers for US, continental Europe, or Oceanic readers. The sponsor of an application or submission must confirm compliance with four core cybersecurity requirements: - A plan to monitor, identify, and address postmarket cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exploits, including coordinated vulnerability disclosure and related procedures. - Processes and procedures that ensure devices are cybersecure, which includes issuing updates and patches promptly when the devices are on the market to address known unacceptable vulnerabilities and critical vulnerabilities that could cause uncontrolled risks. - A software bill of materials, including commercial, open-source, and off-the-shelf software components. - Comply with such other requirements that may be added through regulation to demonstrate reasonable assurances that devices and related systems are cybersecure. You are right. The vendors do try to hide behind FDA certification requirements.From what I've read and seen discussed amongst security professionals is that vendors hide behind the \"changes/patches require re-certification\" in order to just avoid having to do the work + implement the infrastructure to reliably and securely push out the updates. Thankfully, the new FDA Cybersecurity requirements require patching to be part of the life-cycle of the product. [https://www.hipaajournal.com/fda-cybersecurity-requirements-for-medical-devices-now-in-effect/] Despite my recent enrollment in Medicare, I'm totally dependent on the VA for my health care needs.This is an ARPA call for proposals? Saying this will produce anything \"soon\" is a stretch worthy of Mr Fantastic. I'm in the same business, and your observations are entirely correct. On top of that there are:I work in healthcare IT and it's a mess. We get daily reporting of systems and network outages that point to a huge patchwork of systems stitched together because of an ongoing process of acquisition and poorly coordinated amalgam of device manufacturers. Philips Healthcare bought Agilent (formerly HP ultrasound) 20+ years ago, if you can still buy older HP ultrasound machines then you're buying refurb.I'm in the same business, and your observations are entirely correct. On top of that there are: - Medical device manufacturers relying on old technology: HP currently sell ultrasound machines where the base operating system is Windows XP. - Manufacturers insisting on you using their switches and routers because ... money. - Most patient information systems reflect 1990's state of the art which means you cannot implement effective protection. - Things being done that cause security issues because health is \"unique\". Hey, 2FA is almost to the top of our backlog. And no, that's not a joke. I'll be one of the ones implementing it for our product.For what hospitals charge (aka gouge) patients and insurers, the US Health system should NOT be given a handout from the fed.

Yes, but it's also the only way some small offices can send information over. You want to connect to a big hospital. you need an approved method like sFTP, as email will not work for PHI as it's not encrypted across the internet. Or a VPN connected to the HL7 network which is even more complicated.Personally, I think the health care industry should work on eliminating faxes. It's absurd at how inefficient it can be for a doctor to send orders to another facility. I'd agree that Cerner's offering does a good job from a security posture perspective. They've passed pen testing with no issue.Philips Healthcare bought Agilent (formerly HP ultrasound) 20+ years ago, if you can still buy older HP ultrasound machines then you're buying refurb. The two largest Hospital Information Systems (HIS) providers are Epic and Cerner (now Oracle). They are well beyond 1990s state of the art. I would say the security practices for medium and large enterprises are much improved, even for companies that haven't been hit by Ransomware, which is a great motivator btw. You can't even bid your products and services if you don't check off all security checkbooks, at most institutions, miss one and your competitor will get the deal. Thanks for the insights, sorry to hear about the slow service, you're paying, they should, you know, actually deliver.I'd agree that Cerner's offering does a good job from a security posture perspective. They've passed pen testing with no issue. Where they fail miserably is in initial response to technical issues with development teams. The initial month or so of engagement on ANY issue seems to consist entirely of creative misunderstanding in an attempt to get us to give up and just find a solution that works around the problem or spend all our time doing the research and figure it out ourselves. Yes, we're paying the usual extortionate rate for a service contract. You just wouldn't think so given the runaround we get. Eventually we get past that thick barrier to the actually helpful people and the problem gets resolved in short order. I'm going into all this to make a point. This doesn't give me confidence that an outage due to a successful hack won't turn into another month long creative exercise in finger pointing before getting fixed.

It may not be sexy start-up-style work, but the silver lining is that, in Healthcare IT, doing this kind of work to harden against threat actors, you are doing very important, honorable work. You may not be holding a scalpel or performing an x-ray on a patient, but the work you do quite literally may save lives if it prevents a cybersecurity intrusion that would have taken down part or all of a hospital IT system. One person in Healthcare IT fighting this fight is worth a thousand people in tech working at SnapChat or DoorDash.From a technology perspective, I am going backwards in my career. I'm still working on Server 2008. And even the \"cloud\" stuff I'm doing is boring vanilla cloud. I have made peace with it because it is important work and I feel good at the end of the day. But if I was in my 20s and still trying to build my career, instead of my 40s, I wouldn't want to be working in this sector. The exec raising a stink thing was tried and we got all sorts of promises to do better that haven't materialized. Oracle and Cerner are a great match in that respect.Thanks for the insights, sorry to hear about the slow service, you're paying, they should, you know, actually deliver. You probably already know this, but if the service (from any vendor) ain't where it should be, have you CEO start raising a stink with the vendor and/or log some FDA complaints. "}
