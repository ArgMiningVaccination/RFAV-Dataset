To Request an Action Plan to Address Neuropathy [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Neuropathy Neuropathy is a common condition caused by damage to the peripheral nerves of the nervous system. Neuropathy is also known also peripheral neuropathy. Nerve Problems Spotlight The peripheral nerves spread out from the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nerves relay nerve impulses and sensory information from the body to the spinal cord, where they are then carried to the brain. The peripheral nerves also carry motor signals for muscle movement and other functions, such as organ function, from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body, including the organs. Damage to the peripheral nerves interferes with normal functioning of the peripheral nervous system. Typical symptoms of neuropathy include unusual or abnormal sensations of the extremities, which commonly occur in the feet. A wide variety of other symptoms can occur as well because there are many types of peripheral nerves with specialized functions that can be affected by neuropathy. For example, peripheral nerves control the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for involuntary functions including: - Blood pressure - Breathing - Contraction of the smooth muscles of organs, such as the heart and bladder - Digestion - Sexual functions A very common cause of neuropathy is diabetes. This is called diabetic neuropathy. Neuropathy can also result from certain metabolic disorders, infections, malignancy, inflammation, vitamin deficiencies, toxins, inherited conditions, and other abnormal processes. Treatment of neuropathy involves diagnosing and treating the underlying disease, disorder or condition. Some conditions can be successfully treated and cured, while others may require more intensive treatment. Complications of untreated neuropathy and its underlying causes can be serious and include permanent loss of nerve function, muscle wasting, paralysis, serious infections, and gangrene. Seek prompt treatment with a Holistic Chiropractor who uses the \"ReBuilder,\" if you have symptoms of neuropathy, such as changes in sensation, difficulty moving, or any other unexplained or persistent symptoms. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of neuropathy and its underlying cause reduces the risk of permanent nerve damage and serious complications. Some complications of neuropathy can be life threatening. Seek immediate medical care (call 911) if you, or someone you are with, have chest pain, difficulty breathing, or a change in alertness or passing out. Symptoms Symptoms Neuropathy generally develops slowly, over a period of months, as peripheral nerves are progressively damaged. A wide variety of symptoms can occur because there are many types of peripheral nerves that have many specialized functions that can be affected by neuropathy. Symptoms of Neuropathy that affect the nerves of the limbs and muscles Common symptoms of neuropathy often affect the sensory or motor functioning of the arms and legs. Symptoms include: - Muscle twitching or cramps - Muscle weakness and atrophy (wasting of muscle tissue) - Poor coordination and balance, leading to falls - Poor muscle control and body movement - Problems with swallowing - Sores or lesions that do not heal, leading to infections Unusual sensations, such as - pain, - numbness, - pins and needles, - tingling, - burning, or - prickling, that begin in the feet. In later stages of neuropathy, the hands can be affected as well. In some cases, the abnormal sensations can extend to the arms, legs and trunk. Other Symptoms of Neuropathy Neuropathy can also affect the transmission of involuntary or partially voluntary nerve impulses from the Central Nervous System (brain and spinal cord) to certain areas of the body, such as - the bladder, - intestines or - stomach. Called Autonomic Nerves, these nerves carry signals that regulate bodily functions, such as - sweating, - digestion, - breathing, and - blood pressure. Symptoms of Autonomic Neuropathy include: - Abdominal bloating - Blurred vision due to abnormal pupil dilation and constriction - Constipation or diarrhea - Drop in blood pressure and feeling light-headed - Heat intolerance due to impaired sweating. Excessive sweating is also possible. - Increased heart rate - Nausea and vomiting due to slow emptying of the stomach - Problems with urination, such as incontinence and hesitancy with urination - Sexual dysfunction, such as impotence (erectile dysfunction) in men and vaginal dryness in women Serious Symptoms That Might Indicate a Life-threatening Condition Over time, neuropathy can lead to serious and possibly life-threatening complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and gangrene. Seek immediate medical care (call 911) if you, or someone you are with, have any of these symptoms: - Change in alertness or consciousness, such as passing out, lethargy or unresponsiveness - Chest pain or palpitations - Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath - Difficulty or inability to swallow - Hot, dry skin and a lack of sweat - Severe dizziness that does not resolve Causes Neuropathy is caused by damage to the Peripheral Nervous System. The peripheral nerves are responsible for relaying messages from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. Widespread nerve damage can result from - metabolic disorders, - infections, - malignancy, - inflammation, - vitamin deficiencies, - toxins, - inherited conditions, and - other abnormal processes. A common cause of neuropathy is [diabetes](diabetes.asp). Uncontrolled diabetes causes high blood sugar levels that permanently damage nerves over time. Neuropathy can also be caused by long-term pressure or compression of a nerve or nerves. What are the risk factors for neuropathy? A number of factors increase your risk of nerve damage and neuropathy. Risk factors include: - Alcoholism - Certain diseases, such as - diabetes, - cancer, - lupus, - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, - rheumatoid arthritis, - hepatitis, - vasculitis, - hypothyroidism, and - HIV/AIDS - Certain medications, including chemotherapy - Exposure to certain toxins, such as - insecticides, - lead, - mercury, - glues, - solvents and - arsenic - Long-term pressure on a nerve due to such conditions as a - Nerve trauma - Poor circulation - Vitamin B deficiency and vitamin E deficiency Reducing Your Risk of Neuropathy You can lower your risk of neuropathy and permanent nerve damage by: - Avoiding exposure to toxins, such as - insecticides, - lead, - mercury, - glues, - solvents and - arsenic - Not drinking alcohol or limiting alcohol intake to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men Seeking regular medical care throughout your life and following your treatment plan for diseases and disorders, such as - diabetes, - hypothyroidism, - vasculitis, and - other diseases and conditions that can cause neuropathy Taking frequent breaks and using proper techniques for repetitive activities that can cause pressure or compression of a nerve, such as keyboarding or using a jack hammer. Using proper technique when using crutches and notifying your health care provider if a cast is too tight or if other orthopedic devices cause discomfort. Traditional Medical Treatment Options and Diagnosis Medications Medications used to relieve peripheral neuropathy pain include: Over-the-counter pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can relieve mild symptoms. For more-severe symptoms, your doctor may recommend prescription painkillers. - Medications containing opioids, such as tramadol (Conzip, Ultram ER, others) or oxycodone (Oxycontin, Roxicodone, others), can lead to dependence and addiction, so these drugs generally are prescribed only when other treatments fail. - Anti-seizure medications. Medications such as gabapentin (Gralise, Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica), developed to treat epilepsy, may relieve nerve pain. Side effects may include drowsiness and dizziness. A cream containing this substance found naturally in hot peppers can cause modest improvements in peripheral neuropathy symptoms. Doctors may suggest you use this cream with other treatments. Skin burning and irritation where you apply the cream may occur, but usually lessens over time. However, some people can't tolerate it. Certain tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, doxepin and nortriptyline (Pamelor), have been found to help relieve pain by interfering with chemical processes in your brain and spinal cord that cause you to feel pain. The serotonin and norepinephrine also may ease the pain of peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes. Side effects may include dry mouth, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, decreased appetite and constipation. Your doctor also may prescribe medication to treat the underlying condition that's causing the neuropathy. For example, - medications to reduce your Immune System's reaction, such as - prednisone, - cyclosporine (Neoral, Imuran), may help with peripheral neuropathy associated with Autoimmune Conditions. Intravenous immunoglobulin is a mainstay of treatment for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and other inflammatory neuropathy. Treatment goals are to manage the condition causing your neuropathy and to relieve symptoms. If your lab tests indicate no underlying condition, your doctor may recommend watchful waiting to see if your neuropathy improves. If exposure to toxins or alcohol is causing your conditions, your doctor will recommend avoiding those substances. Therapies Various therapies and procedures may help ease the signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS). Adhesive electrodes placed on the skin deliver a gentle electric current at varying frequencies. TENS should be applied for 30 minutes daily for about a month. - Plasma Exchange and Intravenous Immune Globulin. People with certain inflammatory conditions may benefit from these procedures, which help suppress immune system activity. Plasma exchange involves removing your blood, then removing antibodies and other proteins from the blood and returning the blood to your body. In immune globulin therapy, you receive high levels of proteins that work as antibodies (immunoglobulins). If you have muscle weakness, physical therapy can help improve your movements. You may also need hand or foot braces, a cane, a walker, or a wheelchair. If you have neuropathies caused by pressure on nerves, such as pressure from tumors, you may need surgery to reduce the pressure. In addition to treating the underlying cause of neuropathy, other forms of treatment offered in the healthcare field may include: - Physical therapy and occupational therapy to maintain and increase your strength and function - Surgery to relieve pressure on a damaged nerve - Walkers, canes, and other assistive devices, such as grab rails in the bathroom, to maintain your independence and maximize safety Dr. Huntoon's Alternative Medical Treatment Options Breakthrough Technology Recently, there has been a breakthrough in treating neuropathy using a technique called [Neurologic Relief Centers Technique (NRCT)](https://www.nrc.md). With light pressure applied to the base of your skull and spine, specific to the individual, 85 % of people suffering with neuropathy have had total resolution, sometimes in mere seconds. Call the office and schedule your FREE Test to determine if NRCT may be the miracle you are looking for. We are a Certified Facility that can offer NRCT to you. There is also a second solution that involves a technology called a \"ReBuilder.\" The \"ReBuilder\" is a process where the patient places the affected limbs (feet or hands) in a bath that allows the patient to sit comfortably while an electrical current is run from one side of the body (foot or hand) through the spine and back down to the other side (foot or hand) of the body at a specific speed, thus allowing the nerve to begin functioning at a normal rate and allowing the nerve to \"ReBuild\" back to normal. In addition to this treatment, whole food nutritional supplements are given to the patient to help feed the body the necessary ingredients to help the nerve(s) return to normal, thus helping the condition to resolve. This helps to treat the underlying cause of the neuropathy. The ReBuilder is currently being used at all of the Cancer Treatment Centers of America because one of the side-effects of receiving cancer treatment using radiation is neuropathy, which was not ideal for the cancer patient. The great thing about the technology is it is helping people recover from a health condition that was once considered permanent. Advanced Alternative Medicine Center is pleased to announce that we are now offering treatment for this difficult condition using the ReBuilder with the intention of helping people who are currently suffering from this condition. Many allopathic doctors will tell their patients that nothing can be done and the patient will have to learn to live with it. This is unacceptable and hope you will come in to have a consultation to learn how your neuropathy can be addressed using this breakthrough technology. What to Discuss with Your Doctor Your doctor will likely ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on later. Your doctor may ask: - When did you begin experiencing symptoms? - Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional? - Do your symptoms tend to occur at the same time of day? - Do they occur during the same season each year? - Does alcohol appear to cause your symptoms? - How severe are your symptoms? - What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms? - What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms? 8 Facts About Diabetic Nerve Pain A disease of the Nerves Diabetes can damage your nerves over time, making it harder for the nerves to carry messages between the brain and other parts of the body. This leads to symptoms such as burning and tingling sensations and loss of feeling. The nerve damage is called diabetic neuropathy. However, taking the right steps now can delay neuropathy and slow its progression. Here's what you need to know. 1. Nerve damage is common in diabetes. About half of people with diabetes develop some type of neuropathy. With time, the nerves become injured by high blood glucose levels. The excess glucose damages the walls of the small blood vessels that nourish nerves and injures the delicate coating that surrounds nerves. What can be done is to make sure a person's nutrition is ideal. Obviously, a person with diabetes and diabetic neuropathy have advanced stage diabetic effects and would need some whole food concentrates to address the nerve problem and the blood sugar problem. By feeding the body the necessary ingredients vital to addressing the neuropathy and the diabetes, this will enable the person the best chance at recovery. In addition, using the breakthrough technology of the \"ReBuilder\" will help address the damage to the nerves and allow for normal nerve function to return. 2. Symptoms may develop slowly and go unnoticed at first. Some symptoms of neuropathy are pain, burning or tingling sensations in the tips of fingers or toes, and loss of feeling in your feet or hands. Abnormal sweating, urination and bowel problems, difficulty having an erection, and having trouble swallowing or keeping food down are other symptoms. 3. Certain things make nerve damage more likely. Not controlling blood glucose well boosts your risk of developing neuropathy. Smoking, high blood cholesterol, and high blood pressure also increase your risk. Alcohol use and being overweight may contribute, too. Addressing these concerns by working with a Holistic Chiropractor who has experience in addressing these issues in vital to your recovery from this difficult health issue. 4. Neuropathy is diagnosed with an exam. Along with your symptoms, a physical exam is used to diagnose neuropathy. Your doctor may test your feet to see how well you sense a pinprick, light touch, vibration, or temperature. Assessment of muscle strength and reflexes are other helpful tests. Nerve conduction studies are done in some cases. If you are given a diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy, consulting with a holistic Chiropractor who uses a well rounded, multi-faceted approach that includes whole food supplements and the \"ReBuilder\" will go a long way to addressing the problem and the underlying cause of the diabetic neuropathy. 5. Glucose control and pain medication are key treatments. The most important treatment is to improve blood glucose control to prevent further nerve damage. Antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioid or opioid-like drugs may help relieve pain. Skin creams containing capsaicin or lidocaine can also provide relief. Other treatments may be needed for neuropathy that affects the bladder, bowels, or other organs. Using the breakthrough technology of the \"ReBuilder\" along with whole food nutrition specific to the individuals needs is vital for restoring balance and addressing the condition fully. 6. Lifestyle changes make a difference. Good glucose control protects your nerves, so try to follow a healthy eating plan, get regular exercise, and take your diabetes medications. Monitor your blood glucose daily, and talk with your doctor if you're having trouble managing it. If you smoke, ask your doctor for advice on how to quit. Using the Acu-Pen Stop Smoking Treatment Protocol will help you stop smoking and will greatly assist in your recovery from this difficult health concern. 7. Daily foot care is a must. Neuropathy often strikes the feet. If you've lost feeling in your feet, you could get an injury, such as a blister or cut, and not know it. Untreated problems can lead to infections and amputation. Check your feet every day, feeling for sore, hot, cold, numb, or dry spots. Look for bumps, cuts, sores, and swelling, and report any concerns to your doctor. Clean your feet and apply lotion daily. Wear thick socks and comfortable shoes. 8. Partner with your doctor. Make sure your doctor checks your feet at every visit and does a thorough foot exam once a year. Tell your doctor right away if you have symptoms of neuropathy, because early treatment may delay further damage. Addressing the underlying cause is the best form of care you could employ. Therefore, speak with your [Holistic Chiropractor](holistic-chiropractor.asp) about your treatment options using the \"ReBuilder\" and whole food nutritional supplementation to address the underlying cause of your condition.
