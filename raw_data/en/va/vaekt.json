He is growing out of severe eczema, but I still use an emollient cream and occasionally hydrocortisone cream on his body. I bath him and wash his hair each night with Oilatum Plus, never shampoo. I've been using Daktarin cream to get rid of the ringworm, but it keeps coming back. Does diet have an impact ? It's taken a while to get my son eating a healthy diet due to his nut allergy and dairy intolerances as a small child, but he now eats cheese and yogurt, fruit, meat and fish, and takes an omega-3 supplement and multivitamin each day. Would a probiotic help? Or a special shampoo? And should I try herbal remedies? If you have a health question for our experts, email [health@observer.co.uk](mailto:health@observer.co.uk) The dermatologist - Mark Goodfield It's unusual to have ringworm going on this long, so if your doctor hasn't already done so, I would ask him or her to send a sample of your son's skin to the lab to find out whether it's a fungal infection, and if so, which one. Only when you have a definitive diagnosis can your son's problem be properly treated. It could be a recurrence of the childhood eczema, but it's more likely to be psoriasis, as this often involves circular skin lesions and an itchy, flaky scalp. However, if it does turn out to be ringworm, topical treatments are unlikely to help as your son obviously has a virulent form of the infection. Daktarin isn't the answer, because it works by suppressing the fungus and relying on your body to expel it rather than getting rid of the problem itself. This is possibly why the ringworm goes for a time and then returns. An oral treatment is best , but this should be prescribed by a dermatologist in the first instance, so ask your GP for a referral to a specialist. Mark Goodfield is a consultant dermatologist and Honorary Secretary of the British Skin Foundation Jacqui Lowdon - The dietician You are being very sensible about your son's diet - introducing his old allergy foods slowly, making sure he has fruit, carbohydrates, dairy and proteins. However, I'm sorry to say that there isn't any evidence that diet affects ringworm. Try a probiotic if you want - unless your son has a low immune system it won't do any harm - but there's no evidence to support its use to treat his infection. On diet in general, do make sure he is on the right dosage of multivitamins for his age. It's possible to inadvertently give him dangerous levels of certain vitamins - vitamin A, for example, is toxic to the liver in large amounts. His maximum daily dosage should be 400 micrograms. Omega-3 is broadly recognised as a 'brain food' and is perfectly safe to take, but some brands contain vitamin A , so make sure he is taking pure Omega-3. Keep up the good work on your son's diet, but contact your GP for a solution to his ringworm. Jacqui Lowdon is a registered dietician at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff John Biffa - The holistic doctor In natural medicine, it is generally believed that the fungal (yeast) organisms responsible for infections such as ringworm thrive on foods containing sugar (including the sugar in fruit), refined carbohydrates (like pasta and white rice) and foods that are mouldy, yeasty or fermented (most breads, aged cheeses, dried fruit, mushrooms and vinegar). For a more permanent solution to your son's ringworm, it may help to 'starve' the fungi in his body by avoiding these foods for two or three months and restricting his fruit intake to a piece or two each day. Restocking healthy gut bacteria with a probiotic is likely to reduce overgrowth of fungal organisms and may help clear his skin condition. Natural anti-fungal agents (including garlic, golden seal and pau d'arco) may also help , but they need to be handled with care, especially in children, so seek the advice of an experienced naturopath (see [www.naturopathy.org.uk](http://www.naturopathy.org.uk)) or herbalist (see [www.nimh.org.uk](http://www.nimh.org.uk)).
