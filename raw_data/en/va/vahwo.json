You may think of chiropractic as a snap, crackle, pop that relieves back pain, but it's actually a holistic medicine that turns on the healing power within your body. Your nervous system coordinates just about every concious and unconscious function in your body. Every day your nervous system integrates a myriad of experiences: some physical, biochemical, emotional, or spiritual. Sometimes the flow of energy gets stuck and stored so it can't do its job of keeping organs and muscles functioning optimally. Appropriate, gentle, individualized, and specific Chiropractic adjustments help your body release and reintegrate energy to bring more balance and overall improved function. In addition, adjustments activate the innate intelligence of the nervous system, remove nerve interference, and enhance the flow of energy throughout the body promoting health and vitality. Chiropractic truly is the medicine of the future. What To Expect In our fast-paced culture, we're conditioned to seek quick-fixes to our problems. Unfortunately that approach often leads to more complex problems. With the exception of miracles (which do happen), real lasting change takes time. Patterns of dis-ease do not happen overnight -- they accumulate over repetitive trauma, lack of awareness, and stress. My approach to ensure you are well-adjusted and healthy is to meet your specific needs, align with your goals, and tweak your lifestyle through consistent care. Together we will unravel and heal long-standing patterns as well as establish new lifestyle habits that promote your health and well-being.
