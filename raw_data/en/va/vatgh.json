Pan is simply a descriptor used to refer to an organ in its entirety. When you put it all together, pancolitis is chronic inflammation that impacts your entire colon, or large intestine. One of the main causes of pancolitis is ulcerative colitis (U.C.). Sometimes you'll see this term used to describe advanced U.C. that affects\u2014you guessed it\u2014the entire colon, but U.C. isn't the only condition that can lead to pancolitis. [Ulcerative colitis](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/ulcerative-colitis) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), along with [Crohn's disease](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/crohns-disease), that causes inflammation in the lining of your colon. It's autoimmune-related (meaning your immune system attacks cells in your colon) and can cause tough-to-deal-with symptoms like [bloody diarrhea](https://www.self.com/story/blood-in-poop-causes-advice), [abdominal cramps](https://www.self.com/story/stomach-cramps-after-eating), and unintentional weight loss. When ulcerative colitis does affect your entire colon, pain and other symptoms can be quite severe\u2014you may even run a fever. If the inflammation isn't managed, it can even increase your chances of developing complications. Non-ulcerative colitis causes of pancolitis include bacterial infection, medications, and other problems with blood supply to the colon (more on this later). If you've been recently diagnosed with pancolitis or if you're concerned that you may have this condition, you probably have a lot of questions. We spoke with two gastroenterologists to get answers about pancolitis diagnosis, symptoms, treatment options, and more. [How the digestive works](#digestive-system) complications](#complications) [Pancolitis in First, let's talk about the digestive system. Because pancolitis is a term that involves where inflammation is happening in the digestive tract, it's pretty important to understand what that means in terms of anatomy. Here's a quick refresher: First up is your mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach, all of which enable you to eat, swallow, and begin to break down your food. (You're probably pretty familiar with these). Next comes the small intestine, which further digests your food, and helps absorb nutrients and vitamins into your bloodstream. The small intestine then delivers what remains of your food into your large intestine, also called your bowel or colon. When a stool is ready to be released, it makes its descent into the sigmoid colon (the lowest, S-shaped portion of your bowel) and makes its exit through your rectum, according to the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/digestive-system-how-it-works) (NIDDK). The colon is where people with ulcerative colitis can run into some digestive trouble. The colon's lining is called its epithelium, and it regenerates and repairs itself constantly. The colon's epithelium absorbs nutrients as it creates the waste product we know as stool, feces, or its most popular name, [poop](https://www.self.com/story/straining-to-poop-health-effects). When the epithelium becomes inflamed (whether due to IBD, bacterial infection, or other issues), the colon can't complete the absorption process normally (cue the [diarrhea](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/diarrhea)).1 How is pancolitis connected to ulcerative colitis? To understand pancolitis as it relates to ulcerative colitis, we have to see where it lands on the \"spectrum of disease,\" [David Schwimmer, MD](https://www.fdhs.com/david-schwimmer-md/), a gastroenterologist in Sarasota, Florida, tells SELF. Ulcerative colitis is a general diagnostic term for chronic, inflammatory bowel disease affecting your colon. Here's a quick breakdown of the different types, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326): - Ulcerative proctitis: This is the mildest form of ulcerative colitis, which Dr. Schwimmer explains is inflammation that only affects your rectum, the few inches closest to your anus. Rectal bleeding may be the only symptom you experience. - Proctosigmoiditis: This is inflammation that affects both the rectum and the sigmoid colon, which is the lower end of the colon. This is where you may start to get those classic symptoms of ulcerative colitis, like bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and an urge that you have to go now. - Left-sided colitis: In this scenario, the inflammation affects everything from the rectum to the descending colon on the left side of your body. In addition to the previously mentioned symptoms, you may feel pain specifically on the left side of your abdomen. - Pancolitis: This is where the inflammation impacts your entire colon lining, and in addition to having more severe symptoms, you may also have fatigue and [unintentional weight loss](https://www.self.com/story/conditions-weight-gain-loss). What are the most common pancolitis causes? There actually aren't many things that can cause pancolitis, [Matthew Bechtold, MD](https://www.muhealth.org/doctors/matthew-bechtold-md), a gastroenterologist, and professor of clinical medicine at the [University of Missouri](https://www.muhealth.org/conditions-treatments/medicine/gastroenterology), tells SELF. He says they can generally be broken down into four I's: - Ischemia: This is a lack of blood flow to the colon, which can occur from things like injury, bowel obstruction, and surgery, among other things per the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ischemic-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374001#:~:text=But%20several%20factors%20can%20increase,scar%20tissue%20or%20a%20tumor). - Inflammation: We've talked about this, but it's often [due to ulcerative colitis](https://www.self.com/story/ulcerative-colitis-causes)or Crohn's disease (though Crohn's typically affects the small intestine). - Infection: This typically occurs from bacteria like C. difficile. - Iatrogenic: This is from a reaction to medication, like chemotherapy drugs or NSAIDs. Sometimes, pancolitis occurs from the progression of [ulcerative proctitis](https://www.self.com/story/ulcerative-proctitis) that isn't being managed effectively, says Dr. Schwimmer, though it's important to note that most people will not progress to pancolitis. It is possible, though, that people who've had ulcerative colitis for a long time may not be able to find a treatment that works to control the inflammation, which can then progress to affect the whole colon. Other times, people may not even get an ulcerative colitis diagnosis until their disease has already progressed to inflame the whole colon. Though, it's estimated that only about 20% of people with ulcerative colitis have pancolitis.2 What do pancolitis symptoms feel like? The symptoms of pancolitis are generally the same as [symptoms of ulcerative colitis](https://www.self.com/story/symptoms-of-ulcerative-colitis) but can feel more severe since it affects the entire colon. These symptoms vary widely from person to person, according to the [NIDDK](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes), but can include the following:1 - Abdominal pain or cramping - Bloody stool or mucus in your stool - Unintentional weight loss - Fatigue - Rectal bleeding - Low-grade fever - A constant, urgent need to go to the bathroom, even when your bowels are empty Dr. Schwimmer also notes that people with ulcerative colitis that affects the entire colon may be more likely to experience what's called extraintestinal manifestations. That's a fancy way to say inflammation that occurs outside the colon. This can cause symptoms like eye irritation, skin rashes, and even arthritis, according to a 2011 study published in the journal Gastroenterology and Hepatology.3 How do you get a pancolitis diagnosis? If you're going to the doctor for the first time due to symptoms like bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps, they'll likely want to do a number of different tests to determine what's going on. That can include a medical history, physical exam, blood and stool tests, and likely an endoscopy of the large intestine, in which your doctor will use a scope to examine the lining of your colon, per the [NIDDK](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/ulcerative-colitis/diagnosis). Sometimes a biopsy is performed\u2014a piece of tissue is removed and examined in the lab\u2014during the endoscopy to look for signs of inflammation or potentially cancer. These tests can rule out or confirm whether there is inflammation or other issues present. If you've already been [diagnosed with ulcerative colitis](https://www.self.com/story/ulcerative-colitis-diagnosis), your doctor may schedule an endoscopy to determine whether the inflammation has spread to affect more parts of your colon. What can you expect from pancolitis treatments? How pancolitis is treated depends on the cause, so let's dive into the more straightforward ones first. For example, if a bacterial infection in your digestive tract is the cause, you'll be prescribed an antibiotic to clear up the infection. If medications such as NSAIDs are the cause, you'll probably be asked to switch to a different type of medication to avoid further side effects. Now, let's talk about ulcerative colitis, which can have various treatment options. [Medications for ulcerative colitis](https://www.self.com/story/ulcerative-colitis-treatment) are a biggie, and there are many on the table. Corticosteroids are often first prescribed to bring down inflammation in your digestive tract. These are typically used for short periods of time to avoid side effects and can be taken orally or rectally.4 Immunomodulating drugs may also be prescribed to regulate your immune system and control inflammation. In cases where inflammation is severe, drugs called [biologics](https://www.self.com/story/ulcerative-colitis-biologics-questions) may be used. [Biologics](https://www.self.com/story/how-do-biologics-work) work by suppressing your immune system, which can make you more vulnerable to bacterial and viral infections, according to the Mayo Clinic. Surgery, called a colectomy, to remove part or all of the colon is sometimes necessary in severe cases of ulcerative colitis and when lack of blood flow is the issue. It's important to note that surgery isn't a first-line treatment for pancolitis, and is typically only necessary if your inflammation isn't responding to oral or intravenous medication. Whatever your treatment journey looks like, open communication about how you're feeling is important to keep your ulcerative colitis in check, says Dr. Schwimmer. \"We have to keep a good handle on the disease and keep track of how you're doing.\" Can lifestyle changes help treat pancolitis? There's a lot of talk in alternative health spaces about [controlling ulcerative colitis with diet](https://www.self.com/story/ulcerative-colitis-diet) and improved gut health. But Dr. Schwimmer cautions against lifestyle changes as a sole treatment. \"I don't necessarily believe that there's a certain diet or exercise regimen that's going to keep your colon healthy,\" he says. Dr. Schwimmer maintains that the best thing to do if you have any type of ulcerative colitis is to \"take the medicines and let them do their job.\" Dr. Bechtold had a similar opinion. \"I don't know if there is any one thing that can prevent ulcerative colitis, ischemia, or infection. Sometimes, pancolitis just happens,\" he says, but working closely with your doctor can help you find a plan to ease your symptoms. What causes pancolitis flare-ups? Like any type of ulcerative colitis, pancolitis may have periods of remission, where symptoms get better or go away for a period of time, followed by [flare-ups](https://www.self.com/story/ulcerative-colitis-flare-up), where symptoms get worse again. Your pancolitis flare-ups might be triggered by different things, including stress and infections. Frequent use of NSAIDs has also been linked to flare-ups.1 Keeping a diary of potential [food triggers](https://www.self.com/story/foods-to-avoid-with-ulcerative-colitis) may be a good idea since food is often a big one for people with IBD. You'll want to pay special attention to your symptoms (and write them down) after you have any snacks or meals. A few common triggers for people with U.C. include dairy products, foods with gluten like bread, and alcoholic beverages\u2014but everyone is different. You can bring your food diary with you to your next doctor's appointment to figure out your personal food triggers, and how to best avoid them moving forward. Are there pancolitis complications to be aware of? The most alarming short-term complication of pancolitis is a rare condition called toxic megacolon.5 \"That's when your colon becomes dilated due to inflammation and eventually perforates (a hole in the wall of the colon), which can be fatal,\" Dr. Schwimmer says. When toxic megacolon is discovered, he says, \"it means the person needs surgery immediately.\" One bright spot, Dr. Schwimmer says, is that toxic megacolon happens less these days because people are more aware of ulcerative colitis symptoms, and modern medications work much better to control inflammation. A more long-term consequence of pancolitis is an increased risk of [colon cancer](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/colorectal-cancer). Still, the risk is pretty low\u2014about 2% for someone who has had ulcerative colitis symptoms for at least 10 years, according to an older study published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology.6 The more colon tissue you have that is inflamed, the higher your cancer risk becomes. Since pancolitis affects the whole colon, it means more opportunity for inflammation. That's why it's extremely important for people with IBD to be [screened for colon cancer](https://www.self.com/story/uspstf-colorectal-cancer-screening-guidelines) according to their doctor's recommendation. Does pancolitis affect children? Children can develop ulcerative colitis, including pancolitis. In fact, there's reason to believe that rates of IBD in children are actually increasing, according to a 2015 study published in JAMA Pediatrics.7 Researchers hypothesize that formula feeding, high amounts of dietary fat, and exposure to antibiotics early in life may all play a role in these rising rates. Treatments for pancolitis are the same for children as they are for adults, and revolve around controlling ulcerative colitis inflammation. Dr. Bechtold explains that in many cases, the same medications can be used, just at a lower dosage. Kids with ulcerative colitis do need to be watched carefully, though, as colon inflammation can impact how nutrients are absorbed which can impair growth, according to a 2012 study published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology.8 The good news is no matter your age, people with pancolitis can go into [long-term remission](https://www.self.com/story/ulcerative-colitis-remission) with the help of a dynamic, ongoing treatment plan, says Dr. Scwhimmer. \"The hope is always that the medications will keep inflammation down and the risk of cancer down as well.\" Sources: [StatPearls, Ulcerative Pathogenesis, and Diagnosis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pancolitis#:~:text=20%25%20of%20patients%20have%20pancolitis) [Crohn's and Colitis Foundation, Corticosteroids](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/sites/default/files/legacy/corticosteroids.pdf) [StatPearls, Toxic Megacolon](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547679/) Gastroenterology, Risk for in Changes, Causes and Management Strategies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2725331/) and Hepatology, Extraintestinal Manifestations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3127025/) [JAMA Pediatrics, Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Children and Adolescents](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4702263/) [World Journal of Gastroenterology, Crohn's "}
