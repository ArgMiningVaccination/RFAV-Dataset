(Unpublished) (Rousseau, Bernard) Updated: 202 2.07.04 32 ____________________________________________________________________________ PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES TEACHING: I have in my 1 7 years of service to the professions served on faculty search committees, the admissions committee, a committee responsible for developing a strategic plan for Ph.D. recruiting, and a committee responsible for addressing opportunities to ensure the continu ed success of the Ph.D. program. Our department ranks # 3 among departments of speech language pathology and # 7 among department of audiology across the country . My various appointments in academic medical centers and schools of health and rehabilitation s ciences have provided me with a diverse combination of curriculum preparation experiences, including training of medical students, residents, graduate students in the M.S. SLP program, Ph.D. students, and post -doctoral fellows. Additionally, I co -developed and served as Co -Director of the Voice Specialty Track, a specialty training track within the M.S. SLP graduate program in the Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences at Vanderbilt University. This specialty track provided students with advanced compete ncies in the assessment and management of voice disorders. My teaching includes an exceptional blend of clinical and traditional didactic classroom teaching. I have taught the Acoustics and Perception of Speech and Speech Disorders course to the second - year masters of speech -language pathology (M.S. SLP) graduate students and the Advanced Voice Instrumentation Seminar to the M.S. SLP graduate students enrolled in the Voice Specialty Track. I have also co -taught the Grants and Contracts course taken by Ph. D. students in the Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences and Vanderbilt's Peabody College of Education and Human Development and lecture in the Voice Disorders course taken by the first-year graduate students in the M.S. SLP program. I have lecture d to the otolaryngology residents in our Departmental Basic Science Research Conference in Otolaryngology and to the graduate students in Hearing and Speech Sciences in our Speech Language Pathology Grand Rounds. In my role as Director of the Laryngeal Biology Laboratory at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, I directed a research program of approximately 11 research and staff , served as PI or CO-I on 16 research awards , secured $8.5 million dollars in resear ch funding, and led a $2.0 million dollar laboratory expansion and renovation project. I have mentored in various capacities more than 60 research trainees over the past 17 years . My laboratory is active in the training of pre- and post -doctoral research f ellows, residents, medical students, graduate students in the hearing and speech sciences and engineering, and undergraduate students with a strong interest in academic, research, and teaching careers . My federally funded research program focuses on the molecular pathophysiology of acute phonotrauma, and outcomes studies related to the assessment and management of patients with benign vocal fold disease. Our program of research has experienced considerable growth, which has led to several multidisciplinary collaborative grant collaborations and large -scale space and infrastructure initiatives, including the formation of a novel interdisciplinary program of research, coined MODEL ENT: Modulation Of Disease Environments Laboratory by Engineering Nano Therapeutics, which leveraged a core group of faculty from the School of Medicine, School of Engineering, and College of Arts and Sciences at Vanderbilt University to advance a vision for an interdisciplinary collaborative engineering and (Rousseau, Bernard) Updated: 202 2.07.04 33 biomedical researc h program. In 2014, I was the recipient of the Elaine -Sanders Bush Award for Mentoring Graduate and/or Medical Students in the Research Setting. Dr. Sanders -Bush was a leader in the development of research and graduate education at Vanderbilt. In 1997, she spearheaded the creation of a new Ph.D. program in Neuroscience. She served as director of the neuroscience program until 2008. In recognition of her impact in graduate education at Vanderbilt, the Elaine -Sanders Bush Award for Mentoring Graduate and/or M edical Students in the Research Setting was established in 2006. Throughout the course of my professional career, my clinical practice has included serving on multi -disciplinary teams involved in the assessment and treatment of patients with voice disorde rs, including muscle tension dysphonia, benign vocal fold lesions, paradoxical vocal fold motion, and spasmodic dysphonia. The members of the multi -disciplinary team have included fellowship - trained laryngologists, fellows, residents, singing specialists, speech -pathologists, and nurses.

The lamina propria is an area of connective tissue that is uniquely different from tissues found elsewhere in the body. Histologi cal and physiological comparisons can be made with other tissues such as skin and joints that undergo frequent trauma, repeated cycles of inflammation, and decreased function secondary to injury. However, no other tissue in the body undergoes mechanical fo rces similar to the vibration that the vocal folds experience during phonation. Our federally funded research program investigates the cellular and molecular events underlying phonotrauma and the identification of unique mechanisms involved in protection o f the vocal fold from injury. We have developed a novel in -vivo phonation model to better understand the role of acute phonotrauma on repair of vocal fold tissues. Our laboratory was the first to report changes in the expression of key genes involved in ex tracellular matrix metabolism following acute phonotrauma. In addition to these more fundamental investigations, we are also deeply committed to the understanding of outcomes and the availability of health related services in the treatment of phonotrauma. Our laboratory is conducting translational investigations focusing on the role of treatment adherence in recovery from phonomicrosurgery, outcomes studies related to the assessment and management of patients with benign vocal fold disease, and multi -center randomized controlled clinical trials in voice disorders. Our research efforts are funded by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders . Our research program has experienced considerable growth ov er the past 1 7 years . The growth and success of our research, education, and outreach efforts have been made possible through strong institutional support and cross -institutional collaborations. These joint initiatives have led to multidisciplinary intramu ral and extramural collaborative research grants and large -scale space and infrastructure initiatives, including an interdisciplinary collaborative engineering and biomedical research program coined MODEL ENT: Modulation of Disease Environments Laboratory by Engineering Nano Therapeutics. The MODEL ENT concept was developed with the following four ideas in mind: 1) make a case for co -locating faculty from engineering and medicine, 2) bring together faculty with a commitment to collaborative research, 3) lev erage existing institutional shared resources, and 4) advance innovative ideas with strong potential for extramural funding and sustainability. The synergies created by bringing together a core group of faculty from the School of Medicine, School of Engine ering, and College of Arts and Sciences at Vanderbilt University uniquely positioned our research programs to solve problems that are particularly tractable to interdisciplinary approaches. (Rousseau, Bernard) Updated: 202 2.07.04 56 Our efforts address ed an important goal in understanding proper c ell and extracellular matrix interactions, a process that is critical to maintaining functional homeostasis in tissues and organs. MODEL ENT investigators utilize d a range of in vitro, in vivo, and computational models to provide a fundamental understanding of the biochemical and biophysical factors that influence tissue injury and repair. These efforts contribute d to an improved understanding of extracellular matri x signaling and the mechanobiological responses of organs and tissues to environmental and chemical cues. These studies are essential to the development and testing of surgical and pharmacologic treatments for human disease. Support for these initiatives h as the potential to lead to significant progress in how patients are managed in the next 10 years. In our current R01 research program we use a unique combination of in vitro , in vivo , and computational models to provide a fundamental understanding of the biological characteristics of vocal fold tissue and the physiological factors that influence tissue response to treatment. Over the past 1 7 years, our research program has been deeply committed to the understanding of tissue injury and repair with an eye towards future drug development and the investigation of the safety and efficacy of treatments for voice complaints. Our research efforts have provided critical new insights into the cellular and molecular pathophysiology of phonotrauma. Despite widespread clinical use, the indications for use, safety, and demonstration of efficacy of synthetic glucocorticoids in the treatment of dysphonia remains poorly understood. In the current R01, the mechanisms underlying therapeutic efficacy of these treatments is ex plored. Our collaborative work with Haoxiang Luo, Ph.D. and colleagues in Mechanical Engineering on the dynamic interactions between biological structures received international attention in 2013, following a publication that appeared in the Journal of Co mputational Physics, entitled \"Fluid - Structure Interaction Involving Large Deformations: 3D Simulations and Applications to Biological Systems\". This research supported by the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health instantly became o ne the \"Most Downloaded\" Journal of Computational Physics papers since its publication in February 2014 and was awarded the 10th International Conference on Advances in Quantitative Laryngology Voice and Speech Research Best Paper Award. The work profiled in the VUMC Reporter \"Math Models to Aid Voice Disorders\" present ed a versatile numerical approach for the simulation of 3D fluid -structure interactions, representing a significant milestone in the modeling of a range of biological structures such as insect wings, fish fins, heart valves and human vocal folds. This work r epresents a significant contribution to the fluid dynamics community since biological systems often involve large deformations and their three -dimensional modeling has been a standing challenge. Our goal is to use high -fidelity computational models that in corporate patient -specific features of the laryngeal anatomy to quantify the magnitude and spatial distribution of vocal fold biomechanical stresses to improve surgical outcomes in patients with vocal fold paralysis . SERVICE: Narrative Report of Service Contributions : My contributions to the professions include service on committees charged with the development of official practice policy documents in speech language pathology and audiology, service to federal agencies, and academic leadership. (Rousseau, Bernard) Updated: 202 2.07.04 57 Over the past 1 8 years, I have served on editorial review boards as editor, associate editor, or reviewer for various journals. I have also regularly provided service to the professions and to federal agencies. I serv ed a six -year term as a charter member of the M otor Function Speech Rehabilitation (MFSR) study section of the Center for Scientific Review at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Charter members of NIH study panel are selected on the quality of their research accomplishments, publications in scien tific journals and other scientific activities, achievements and honors.

The COH reviews nominations for awards of the association, including Fellow and Honors, the highest awards of distinction awarded by the association. I serv ed a four -year term as a site visitor for The Council on Academic Accreditation (CAA) in Audiology and Speech Language Pathology. The CAA establishes standards for the accreditation of graduate programs in Speech Language Pathology and Audiology. I am currently serving a 3 year term on the American Speech -Language -Hearing Foundation Board of Trustees. Narrative Report of Academic Leadership and Accomplishments: Prior to accepting my current position at Saint Louis University, I served as Associate Dean for Equity, Inclusion and Community Engagement in th e School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences and Professor and Chair of the Department of Communication Science and Disorders at the University of Pittsburgh . As associate dean, I created the Office of Equity, Inclusion, & Community Engagement (OEICE) in the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. And developed a school -wide cluster -hire proposal through a highly collaborative effort and engagement of all department chairs across SHRS and involving the Department(s) of Communication Science & Disorders, Health Information Management, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Physician Assistant Studies, Sports Medicine and Nutrition, and Rehabilitation Science and Technology. I provided leadership of a school -wide strategic planning process for t he Office of Equity, Inclusion, and Community Engagement; implementation of an SHRS DEI Framework for Action to leverage faculty, staff, and student engagement and support for school - wide DEI initiatives; development and implementation of SHRS OEI&CE Guidi ng Principles to align with the Plan for Pitt and Our People, Our Programs, and Our Purpose pillars. As department chair, I created a senior executive leadership team with appointment of three new vice chair positions in the department: 1) Vice Chair for A cademic Affairs, 2) Vice Chair for Clinical Education, and 3) Vice Chair for Research. I led a successful department reorganization, including the establishment of three new offices to support faculty, staff, and students: 1) CSD Office of Research, 2) CSD Office of Clinical Education, and 3) CSD Office of Academic Affairs. I successfully recruited 11 new faculty members in the department -including 5 tenure stream faculty positions and 6 appointment stream faculty positions. I increased the number of admini strative support staff in FTE (FY18) to 20.75 FTE (FY21) to support our 3 new offices and department core missions. I successful ly recruit ed 3 new program directors -including a new director of the Clinical Science Doctoral Program (CScD) in speech - language pathology; new director of the graduate program (MA/MS) in speech -language (Rousseau, Bernard) Updated: 202 2.07.04 58 pathology; and a new director of the undergraduate program (BA) in Communication Science. I led several successful tenure and promotion cycles and recruitm ent at mid -career and above ranks result ing in a more optimal balance in the department across academic rank and appointment type . I increased the diversification of research personnel (e.g., post -docs) in the department from 0 (FY18) to 5 (FY21) and the n umber of a dvanced research trainees (e.g., post -docs) increased to 25% of the 21 research trainees during my tenure as chair. Our Ph.D. advisory council increased the number of graduate student researchers (GSRs) funded on extramural research training gra nts and fellowships, from 100% GSRs funded on hard -money allocation from the provost (FY18) to 75% GSRs funded on research grants and 100% (all) post -docs receiving some form of fellowship support (FY21). During my service as chair , the number of grants, contract submissions, and total grant revenue increased by 2073% ($750K to $16.3M and indirect cost recovery to the department increased by 289% ($28K to 109K). During my service as chair, enrollment in the PhD Program in Communicatio n Science and Disorders increased by 30% ; enrollment in the Doctor of Audiology (AuD) Program increased by 160% (10 to 26 students) ; and enrollment in the MA SLP Program increased by 20%. During my service as chair, the department established SLP Concentrations in 1) Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 2) Dysphagia (Swallowing), 3) Pediatric Speech and Language, and 4) Voice Disorders. The SLP Concentrations provided oppor tunities for students to develop advanced clinical skills, research opportunities, and seamless integration of theory and clinical practice, through experiential learning with clinical instructors and research faculty at UPMC and VAMC. During my service as chair, 3 department laboratories were renovated , including a new lab buildout and I increased the overall department space footprint; increased alignment of faculty, space, and research programs to increase research operational efficiencies and lower the costs of new faculty laboratory renovations by approximately $250 -350 K ; and c reated operational efficiencies through greater alignment of CSD space, personnel, and research programs to reduce costs and increase the number of scientific collaborations of g reater impact within the department and across the school and university. As chair, I strengthened collaborations between the Department of Communication Science and Disorders and several academic units across the university and greater Pittsburgh region, including the Department of Otolaryngology in the School of Medicine; Electrical and Computer Engineering in the Swanson School of Engineering; Center for Neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh; Center for Neural Basis of Cognition: a joint venture b etween the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University; VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System; and the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. I established a formal partnership between the University of Pittsburgh School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences and DePaul School for Hearing and Speech , marked by the signing of a memorandum of understanding to provide research and educational opportunities, clinical training, adjunct teaching, summe r camps and professional development, and high -quality research training experiences for students. I negoti ated a clinical contract to provide speech and swallowing services at UPMC Passavant. I established a gift with the University of Pittsburgh to create an endowed fund, the Bernard Rousseau Student Resource Fund in Communication Science and Disorders to enhance opportunities for underrepresented students in the School of Health and Rehabilitati on Sciences. I commissioned an Equity, Justice, and Inclusion workgroup in the department to develop action -oriented solutions to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in CSD. During my service as chair, gift revenue to the department increased by 905% ($25,430 to $255,760) and the number of donors and gifts to the department increased by 50% (55 to 83). As chair, I increased alumni engagement and attendance at alumni events at the American Speech Language Hearing Association (ASHA) and American Academy (Rousseau, Bernard) Updated: 202 2.07.04 59 of Audiology (AAA) ; increased engagement with alumni through the establishment of a Chair's Newsletter and external communications to provide regular updates on CSD accomplishments ; and d evelop ed and implement ed department academic, clinical, and research benchmarks ; including the implementation of a department s cientific review process to increase faculty publications, grant activity and success rates by 20%. During my service as chair, I led a significant improvement in 2021 U.S. News & World Report rankings , with Speech -Language Pathology realizing the largest climb in the Best Graduate Schools rankings up four spots from its previous # 7 ranking to the #3 ranked SLP program in the country. As chair, I provided leadership of a department -wide strategic planning process for the Department of Communication Science and Disorders and t ransition ed the department from a centraliz ed allocation budget model from the provost to a responsibility center management (RCM) budget model . Prior to my service as Chair of the Department of Communication Science and Disorders at the University of Pittsburgh, I served as Associate Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Otolaryngology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. In this role, I served on the Executive Leadership Team that reported directly to the Director of the Vanderbilt Bill Wilkerson Center for Otolaryngology and Comm unication Sciences and the Guy M. Maness Professor and Chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology, Roland D. Eavey, M.D., S.M. This included fiscal and administrative oversight of a $1.0 million dollar annual operating budget and $4.7 million dollars in annual grant revenue . In my academic leadership role, I provided specific oversight of the basic science research programs, laboratories, and support for the basic science research missions of the department. Departmental research activities include d feder al, non -federal, and industry sponsored research grants and a portfolio of 15 federally funded research awards ($3.1 million dollars ), 10 industry sponsored clinical trials ($700 thousand dollars), and 2 internal grant awards ($140 thousand dollars) . Inves tments in growth of departmental research laboratories, faculty, research infrastructure, and support for faculty research activities led to a 37% increase in federal research funding and 23% increase in funding for industry sponsored clinical trials durin g the period 2015 -2017 . The department ranked #4 among departments of otolaryngology in NIH sponsored research. I also served on faculty search committees and chaired a faculty search in Neurogenic Speech Disorders that resulted in the successful recruitment of 2 senior/mid -career level faculty recruits to the Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences. These two positions strengthened an already strong and robust clinical program in the area of adult neurogenics at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and the Pi Beta Phi Rehabilitation Institute at the Vanderbilt Bill Wilkerson Center. With the successful recruitment of a junior faculty hire in speech sciences (dysarthria) in 2013/201 4, these two additional facult y hires in 2015/2016 led to strategic growth of the research enterprise by strengthening the academic missions of the department in the adult neurogenics, with particular emphasis in dysarthria (speech), aphasia (language), an d cognition/memory. The department was consistently ranked #1 in Speech -Language Pathology in the USNWR rankings.
