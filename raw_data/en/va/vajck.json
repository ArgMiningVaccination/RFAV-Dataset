Despite many studies proving immunization as the best defense against catching the flu, many people still avoid this defense because they believe the myths associated with getting vaccinated. So, this month, I'd like to share some of the more common falsehoods about the flu vaccination, in hopes that this year, EVERYONE who is medically able, will protect themselves and their loved ones, and get immunized. \"It's too early for flu immunization.\" \"I am healthy and don't need the flu immunization.\" \"I can get the flu from taking the flu vaccine itself.\" \"The flu vaccine causes autism.\" \"I got the flu immunization last year, I don't think I need it again this year.\" Additional Steps While the flu vaccine remains the best defense against the flu, you can take additional steps to help protect yourself and your family from the flu and other viruses. Those steps include the following: As a physician and a parent, I hope that debunking these common misperceptions encourages everyone to do what's best for themselves and their families and get immunized today. To your good health, Muntu Davis, MD, MPH Los Angeles County Health Officer September 6, 2019 IT'S TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE DANGERS OF E-CIGARETTES Dear Parents/Guardians: As the father of a child nearing middle school, one of my biggest daily worries is the health and safety of my child. A concern I think we share. And now, after decades of progress in the fight against tobacco use and cigarette smoking, a new health threat has emerged on the horizon. The National Youth Tobacco Survey recently released a report that showed a nationwide rise of 1.5 million new e-cigarette users among middle and high school students between 2017 and 2018. Middle school users rose by 48%, while high school users increased by 78%. E-cigarette use is skyrocketing among our youth, with horrifying but preventable health consequences down the line. To date, more than 450 possible cases of lung injury associated with e-cigarettes have been reported, with four deaths, and the number is growing. Together, we must act to stop this dangerous trend. Prevention begins with a conversation with our children on this new danger to their health. Below are some facts about e-cigarettes, vaping, and their risks. They are helpful resources that each parent/guardian can use to inform this crucial conversation with their children: What is an e-cigarette? What's inside an e-cigarette? Teenagers say \"It is just flavored water.\" What are other names for e-cigarettes What kind/types of e-cigarettes are out there? products? Are e-cigarettes safe? How can e-cigarette be dangerous when smokers use it to kick their cigarette-smoking habits? Can e-cigarettes be used to vape other substances? What can I do to prevent my child from vaping? Finally, our children look to us to be the examples. If you don't want your kids to smoke vape, don't vape either. Please look to the above links for assistance should you need help quitting or call 1-800-NO-BUTTS. Sincerely Muntu Davis, MD, MPH 1 Cullen KA, Ambrose BK, Gentzke AS, Apelberg BJ, Jamal A, King BA. Notes from the Field: Increase in use of electronic cigarettes and any tobacco product among middle and high school students \u2014 United States, 2011-2018. MMWR Morbid Mortal Wkly Rep. 2018;67(45). 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Smoking and Tobacco Use: Electronic Cigarettes: Retrieved from November 20, 2018 Influenza is here. Early immunization can prevent illness, hospitalization or death. Dear Los Angeles County Residents, It's November! Almost time for the holidays. Have you gotten your influenza (\"flu\") immunization? The traditional season for influenza is here. Flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. These viruses are mainly spread when droplets, made when people cough, sneeze or talk, land in your nose or mouth or are inhaled into your lungs. While flu circulates worldwide throughout the year, the Flu season in Los Angeles County has started and typically runs from the first week of October through the end of March. Depending on the circulating flu virus, a person's age, and their prior health conditions flu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Everyone 6 months of age and older should get immunized as soon as possible. Influenza immunizations remain an available and effective tool against the most common flu viruses during the flu season. So, get your flu immunization today and help prevent the flu. This is no time for complacency. Anyone, including an ordinarily healthy person, can get the flu, and serious problems related to flu can happen at any age. However, the following groups of people are at high risk of developing serious complications if they get sick with influenza: people 65 years and older, people of any age with certain chronic medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), pregnant women, and children younger than 5 years. We must urgently come together as a community to reverse an unfortunate trend. Did you know that Los Angeles County recorded a higher influenza activity in the past 2017-18 season (Oct. 1, 2017-May 13, 2018) more than the previous five influenza seasons? Public Health recorded a total of 278 influenza associated deaths last flu season, exceeding any other flu season since the county initiated mandatory flu reporting. The first and most important step in preventing flu and reducing the chance of you spreading flu is to get your flu immunization. Flu immunizations have been shown to reduce flu related illnesses and the risk of serious flu complications that can result in hospitalization or even death. Also, take the following everyday preventive actions to help slow the spread of germs that cause respiratory (nose, throat, and lungs) illnesses, like The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health offers flu vaccination at no charge to people without health insurance or whose healthcare provider does not offer flu vaccination. You can find your local public health center, and the many available influenza community outreach clinics If you have health insurance, please contact your regular health care provider or insurance provider to confirm the cost. The cost to get immunized of the flu varies at pharmacies and community clinics. You may need to call ahead to confirm the cost. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has also compiled the following toolkits designed to help schools/childcare centers, businesses, Los Angeles County workers and the community at large prevent the flu. These are printable materials explain the need for yearly flu immunization, highlight ways to prevent the flu, and offer targeted approaches to preventing the flu: Your, your family and your friends overall good health is our priority here at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. We remain committed to our vision of creating, \"Healthy People in Healthy Communities.\" Be safe this Flu Season. Make immunization against the flu a high priority. Take those everyday preventive actions to help slow the spread of germs that cause the flu in our community. More information on the 2018/2019 Flu Season in Los Angeles County is available at Sincerely, Message from the Interim Health Officer for Los Angeles County Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, MD, MPH Dental Scams: Protect Yourself and Your Family Preventing and treating dental disease is essential to maintaining overall health and well-being at every stage of life. Even though dental health is extremely important, many people do not see a dentist every year. Co-pays and other costs may be expensive even if someone has dental insurance. Patients may worry that they cannot afford to pay for dental care and, as a result, might look for cheaper options that could be risky. This might explain why unlicensed dentistry is becoming an increasing problem in Los Angeles County. Unlicensed Dentistry is a Serious Problem in Los Angeles County People who seek care from an unlicensed dentist usually find out about the services by word of mouth and may be tempted by promises of lower costs or minimal wait times for appointments. Some consumers seek this care only to learn later, often after unexpected complications, that the person who performed the dental treatment was not licensed or qualified. Unlicensed dentists perform a range of unlawful and potentially dangerous practices including invasive dental procedures like tooth extractions and root canals, or tests like x-ray imaging. They work in offices, homes, and other non-clinical, unhygienic settings such as hair salons, garages, and restaurants. They may also operate illegal dental laboratories that make poor quality or harmful implants and dentures. People who practice illegally may have limited dental experience such as a dental assistant or a dental laboratory technician, may have been dentists in other countries but are unable to meet California's licensing standards, or have had their license revoked by the Dental Board of California due to malpractice or illegal activity. Getting dental care from an unlicensed person can lead to dangerous complications, permanent injury, and chronic health problems. It can also delay or prevent a person from getting the proper treatment they need. In one recent case, a woman was convicted of practicing dentistry without a license from her living room. She injured a patient during a procedure that led to hospitalization and risk of permanent nerve damage. A patient of another convicted unlicensed dentist became seriously ill with an infection and ultimately lost several teeth after having a dental procedure in a garage. How Can I Get Safe Dental Care? Consumers may not know that free or low cost, safe dental care is available in Los Angeles County to any child or adult who needs it regardless of their ability to pay or their immigration status. All adults and children (after their first birthday or once the first baby tooth has erupted) must visit a licensed dentist for check-ups and preventive care semi-annually and maintain a minimum daily dental hygiene routine that includes brushing and flossing twice per day. Take the following steps to ensure that you and your family have safe dental care. How Can I Report a Problem? Visit the Department of Public Health's Health Care Consumer Protection March 23, 2018 Infant Mortality Infant mortality, defined as the death of a baby before her or his first birthday, is one of the most important measures of the health of a community. Improvements in the ability of all infants to survive the first year of life has been a long-standing public health goal, as the infant mortality rate is widely recognized as a fundamental measure of a country's health and well-being. Infant mortality is typically measured as a rate and expressed as the number of infant deaths out of every 1,000 live births. In 2014, the rate in the US was 5.82 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. Although the overall national rate decreased by 15% in the decade prior to 2014, significant differences between racial/ethnic groups persist. Most notably, the infant mortality rate for African-American babies in the US is more than double that of white babies. These inequities are also evident here in Los Angeles County, where African-American infant deaths are three times higher than those among white infants. This gap is unacceptable in light of efforts by other communities that have been successful in narrowing the divide. A multitude of factors create this health inequity, including poverty, educational attainment, racism, intimate partner violence, the environment, and access to quality health care. Although these risk factors are diverse and complex, closing the equity gap is largely attainable. As a result, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has identified infant mortality as a priority health equity issue and has established the goal of substantially reducing the gap between the white and African-American infant mortality rates within the next five years. Efforts have already begun to reach out to key partners to highlight the inequity, express the Department's commitment to reducing the gap, and identify strategies that are both effective and acceptable. Our work will need to both recognize the impact of poverty, racism and associated stress on health, and invest in a broad, collaborative effort to address the root causes of inequities in health outcomes. Building on a strong foundation of initiatives housed in clinical settings, communities, and the homes of women themselves, new efforts will be anchored in understanding the challenges facing women of color in Los Angeles County and offering a compassionate, respectful approach to women's daily struggles to address those challenges. Causes of Infant Mortality In the US, the top five leading causes of infant deaths are: Ways to Reduce the Risk of Infant Mortality The prevention of infant mortality begins before pregnancy occurs. Healthcare providers and community organizations also play a crucial role in improving birth outcomes. Connect female clients of childbearing age with health and community resources including education, screening, health insurance, housing, and social support. Join with other providers and organizations to create solutions that promote racial equity, counter all forms of discrimination, and support access to opportunities and resources necessary for optimal health and well-being for all. In particular, it is important that African-American women and families are supported before, during, and after pregnancies. Click here to learn more about resources for public health agencies, health care providers, and communities to better understand and reduce infant deaths in the US. Efforts to Address Racial Inequities in Birth Outcomes in Los Angeles County The Department of Public Health is committed to protecting and improving infant health in Los Angeles County through an array of programs, initiatives, and collaborative relationships with community organizations. In June 2017, the Department of Public Health convened a meeting to address poor birth outcomes for African-American babies. Over 50 community partners and Los Angeles County Health Agency colleagues discussed the factors that influence the inequity gap and identified potential opportunities for collaboration. In October 2017, the Department of Public Health launched the Center for Health Equity in concert with the Los Angeles County Health Agency and the support of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. The Center's mission includes advancing racial, social and environmental justice in partnership with committed organizations and residents, and one of its initiatives is to close the gap between African-American and white birth outcomes. Many other activities are underway to ensure healthy babies, mothers and families in Los Angeles County. Additional information and local resources on having a healthy pregnancy and child can be found on the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health's Maternal, Child & Adolescent Health January 30, 2018 Influenza, often referred to as \"the flu,\" has increased significantly in recent weeks and is now widespread in the state of California and Los Angeles County. As of January 13, 2018, there have been 96 confirmed influenza-associated deaths in Los Angeles County, which is much higher than the 30 deaths reported at the same time last year. Emergency room visits for influenza-like deaths are also up 130%. Compared to recent previous flu seasons, the Department of Public Health has received significantly more reported respiratory outbreaks in long-term care and skilled nursing facilities, as well as significantly more reported flu deaths, particularly among those older than 65 years of age. All of this points to a much earlier and serious flu season than in previous years; however, it is not too late to get vaccinated. Influenza typically peaks in January and February and can linger into the spring, so vaccination for anyone over 6 months of age is still highly recommended. Influenza is a disease caused by a virus that can be mild in some persons, but serious in others. It is spread from person to person by a cough or sneeze. You can also get the flu by touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after touching a surface that has the virus on it. Illness often starts 2-5 days after being exposed, and usually begins suddenly. Symptoms commonly include fever, cough, sore throat, headaches, body aches, chills, runny or stuffy nose, extreme tiredness, and weakness. Some people may also have diarrhea and vomiting, but this tends to be less common in adults. Most people get better within two weeks with rest and fluids, but some may develop serious complications like Get Vaccinated The best way to prevent the flu is to get the flu vaccine. The vaccine not only protects you from becoming ill with the flu but also prevents the possibility that you may pass it on to your family, friends, or people you work with. Everyone 6 months of age and older should get vaccinated every year, especially those who are at high risk for complications. Individuals at high risk include people who are 65 years of age or older, people who have certain chronic medical conditions, pregnant women, and young children. For the second year in a row, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) only recommend the vaccine in shot form. The nasal spray form is not recommended this season due to concerns about its effectiveness. Here are some key facts about the flu vaccine: Flu vaccines are available at your doctor's office and local pharmacies. You may want to call ahead to make sure they have the vaccine in stock. Most insurance plans fully cover flu vaccines and there is usually no out-of-pocket cost for patients who get the vaccine at their doctor's office or at some pharmacies. If you do have health insurance, contact your regular healthcare provider or insurance carrier to confirm your flu vaccine benefits. Public Health Centers Offer Free Vaccines If you do not have health insurance or your provider does not offer the flu vaccine, you can get a free vaccine without an appointment during clinic hours at our Tips to Protect Yourself from the Flu and Other Respiratory Illnesses People experiencing flu symptoms are urged to call their doctor or nurse hotline rather than visit an emergency department where wait times may be exceedingly long right now. Please visit the Department of Public Health's Vaccine Preventable Disease Control November 21, 2017 The influenza season is upon us once again. In the US, the flu season occurs during the fall and winter months with peak activity usually occurring from December through February. However, there are some years in which flu activity may last until May. During last year's flu season, seventy-seven deaths occurred in LA County. The first deaths from influenza in Los Angeles County this year were reported on November 16th, 2017. So, influenza is present in our County and is causing serious illness, even death, among our population. Therefore, I highly encourage you and your family to get vaccinated as early in the season as possible.

The declaration was based on the discovery of cases among individuals who appear to have acquired the infection within Los Angeles County. As of late September, Public Health has identified a total of 12 cases in Los Angeles County associated with this outbreak. Many of these cases had direct links with outbreaks in other counties. The most recent cases had no known links with other cases, suggesting that transmission may be occurring within our County. The outbreak in Los Angeles County follows on the heels of much larger outbreaks that have been on-going in San Diego and Santa Cruz counties and are largely restricted to persons who are homeless or use drugs. Prior to the declaration of the outbreak in Los Angeles County, the Department of Public Health had been preparing for this possibility, given our proximity to What is Hepatitis A and How is it Spread? Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection that is caused by a virus. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, stomach pain, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, diarrhea, and yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice). Some people may not have any of these symptoms even though they are infected with hepatitis A. In some persons the illness can last for weeks or even months. Among individuals with pre-existing liver disease or other serious health problems, the illness can be severe, possibly leading to death. Hepatitis A is spread from person-to-person through what is called the \"fecal-oral\" route. Persons who are infected excrete the virus in their stool. Other persons become infected by ingesting food or other material that has been contaminated with fecal material from an infected person. This is why hand-washing after using the bathroom or before eating food is so important. The ways in which hepatitis A is spread from one person to another include: Hepatitis A-infected individuals can spread the infection for two weeks before they exhibit symptoms. Once they have symptoms, they may spread the virus for another week. Some people will not have symptoms but can still pass the virus to someone else. Once someone fully recovers, they are immune and protected against ever getting the infection again. Who is Most at Risk for Acquiring Hepatitis A? Anyone can get infected with hepatitis A. However, in the current situation, those who are at-risk are limited to specific groups. These include persons who: Hepatitis A Treatment There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A infection. Most people will recover completely and, while they are ill, should rest, stay hydrated, eat nutritious foods, and be under the care of a doctor. However, those who become very ill may need to be hospitalized. Patients who are over 50 years of age, have underlying medical conditions or weakened immune systems are at greatest risk for severe illness. This is why it is very important to seek medical care if you experience the symptoms of hepatitis A. Hepatitis A Prevention The Persons who are at-risk for infection as a result of the work they do can often receive the vaccine from their employer. Vaccine can also be obtained from a person's primary care provider. Some Additional important steps to prevent hepatitis A infection include the following: Additional Hepatitis A Resources The You have probably been hearing about What is IMD? IMD is caused by a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. It is spread via direct contact with the secretions of someone who has the bacteria in their nose or throat. Kissing, coughing, or sharing items that put you in direct contact with an infected person's saliva or spit are some of the most common ways IMD is spread. When a person becomes sick with IMD, they may initially feel like they are coming down with the flu. Usually, there is a sudden onset of fever, headache, and stiff neck. The illness can then progress to include confusion and a rash. If not treated, it can lead to swelling of the brain and spinal cord, loss of a limb, brain damage, or even death. This is why it is important to know what it is and how to prevent it. The IMD Vaccine Can Protect You The vaccine prevents IMD infection and is recommended for the following groups: Seek Medical Care Immediately if You Think You Have IMD, or if You Have Had Recent Close Contact with Someone Who Has IMD It is important to contact your health care provider if you experience symptoms that suggest you may have IMD. You should also talk to your health care provider if you have had recent close contact with someone who has IMD. IMD is treatable with antibiotics, but being vaccinated is the easiest and most effective way to prevent illness. Our Ways to Prevent IMD In addition to staying current with the vaccination recommendations, it is important to limit activities that spread saliva: Further information on IMD can be found on the Department of Public Health Every year, World TB Day is celebrated on March 24th to commemorate the day in 1882 that Dr. Robert Koch discovered the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis and identified it as the cause of the disease tuberculosis (TB). Well over 100 years later, TB persists as a global health threat, causing almost 1.8 million deaths worldwide in 2015 even though it is a preventable and curable disease. Approximately 2.4 million Californians currently have the inactive form of TB infection. In Los Angeles County, 553 people suffered from TB disease in 2016. The best way for us to eliminate TB here and across the globe is to provide preventive treatment to those who have the inactive form of TB infection. This prevents them from becoming ill and from spreading it to others. In Los Angeles County, we seek to eliminate TB within the County, which would be fewer than 10 cases of TB per year. This would be a remarkable achievement! Please join me in celebrating World TB day on March 24th and commit to taking action that will help us achieve our goal of elimination. In order to get there, we need you to: Know the symptoms of TB disease. This is the form of TB in which the person is sick. Most people with the contagious form of TB have symptoms which include fever, cough, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue lasting greater than three weeks. If you have two or more of these symptoms, see a medical provider immediately. If you do not have health insurance, you may be evaluated at a Know your risk for TB infection. The people most at risk for TB infection are those who were born or have lived in countries with high rates of TB, have medical conditions that suppress or will suppress their immune system, or know that they have had contact with a person who has the contagious form of TB in their lungs. If you are at risk for TB infection, get tested for TB. Your provider should have TB testing available with either the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) TB blood test. If your provider does not offer these tests or you do not have health insurance, If you have TB infection, get treated. There are new drugs to treat TB infection. In addition, people with TB infection are now able to be treated with drugs that are safer and require less time to treat. We now have effective regimens that can treat the inactive form of TB infection in 3-4 months rather than 6-9 months. Talk to your provider about the treatment for TB infection. Local Community Efforts to End TB It will take a community-wide effort to eliminate TB in Los Angeles County. The Coalition to End TB consists of agencies and providers who serve populations at risk for TB and have committed to work together to find and treat TB infection and accelerate progress toward TB elimination. If you are a provider or agency and would like to get more information about the Coalition, click If you have any questions about TB, please contact the Los Angeles County TB Control Program at 213-745-0800 or visit their We are now in the middle of the 2016-2017 flu season.

These trips are great opportunities to unplug from daily life, spend quality time together with family, and share new experiences. Whether camping in a nearby From a health perspective, traveling for pleasure is good for our bodies and minds. Many vacation destinations offer recreational activities--from winter sports to water sports--and we're more likely to explore our new surroundings while walking, biking, hiking or kayaking. Active transportation gets us physically moving and cuts down on pollution caused by motor vehicles. New environments also stimulate our brains with novel sights, sounds, and situations. We have the chance to practice new skills--like building a campfire or speaking a different language--and we learn more about different cultures in museums, on tours, or when talking with residents. All of these mental activities exercise our brains and may promote health in a variety of ways, including the possibility of reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Ultimately, travel can be a time to have fun, rest, relax, and get away from the routine stresses of daily life. To make the most of your time away, it is important to take steps that ensure your vacation time doesn't turn into sick time. When traveling near or far, keep these health tips in mind to stay healthy, happy and safe over the holidays or while on vacation in the new year! Check out the CDC's Wherever you go or whatever you do this holiday season, have a very happy and safe holiday and wonderful New Year! Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are the most commonly reported communicable diseases and rates are rising in the United States, California and Los Angeles County (LAC). In LAC, there were nearly 75,000 STD cases reported to the Department of Public Health (DPH) in 2015. This reflects rising rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and congenital syphilis observed over the past few years. It is believed that these rates are the result of several factors, including: What are STDs? STDs are diseases spread from person to person through unprotected oral, vaginal, or anal sex. Women can also transmit STDs to their babies during pregnancy and delivery, or while breastfeeding in the case of HIV. More than 20 different STDs exist, although the most common include: If left untreated, many of these STDs can cause serious health concerns ranging from infertility to increased risk for certain types of cancers. HIV and syphilis can be fatal without treatment. Therefore, it is important that you take steps to prevent STDs to protect your health, the health of your sexual partners, and your children. Protect Yourself and Others If diagnosed with an STD: Your sexual health is an important part of your overall well-being. If you live in Los Angeles County and are at least 12 years old, call the STD/HIV Hotline at (800) 758-0880 to find out where you can get tested and treated for free. The hotline can also help you with Mosquito-Borne Diseases Climate change is a source of concern for many, especially as warmer, drier weather is observed throughout the county. This affects us in many ways. While the mild El Ni\u00f1o season helped fill many of California's reservoirs, water is still a major concern. We continue to experience record-breaking temperatures. In addition, in the past few weeks, a number of fires have caused many square miles of brush and property to burn. Yet another result of our changing climate may be a rise in diseases, especially those that are related to insects. Warmer temperatures may allow mosquitoes to thrive, including two species of mosquitos recently introduced into Southern California that are known to spread diseases: Aedes aegypti (the yellow fever mosquito) and Aedes albopictus (the Asian tiger mosquito). Two mosquito-borne diseases I would like to cover this month include Zika and West Nile Virus. Zika Virus On August 1st, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released travel guidance advising pregnant women, or women who may become pregnant, to avoid Wynwood, a neighborhood in Miami, Florida. This warning followed reports of mosquito-transmitted Zika virus in the area. More than 20 people in Florida have become infected locally by mosquito bites. To date, no local transmission of Zika has been reported in LA County. However, the Aedes mosquitoes that can transmit Zika are present in the San Gabriel Valley and in the eastern part of the County. Recently, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) reported that two infants with Zika-related microcephaly have been born in California to women who had Zika virus infections during pregnancy after spending time in a country where the virus is present. At the same time, state officials confirmed that a total of 21 infections have occurred in pregnant women. These events highlight the known, serious risks of Zika virus infection to the children of pregnant women. These include not only microcephaly, but also eye defects, hearing loss, impaired growth, and other brain defects. To learn more about microcephaly, The CDC outlines four simple recommendations to prevent Zika infection for women who are pregnant: For couples who want to get pregnant, tell your doctor if you plan to travel to or if you or your partner recently returned from an area with known mosquito-borne Zika transmission. West Nile Virus West Nile Virus (WNV) is another disease spread by mosquitoes that are present throughout the county. Local transmission of the virus occurs every year in Los Angeles County and typically occurs during warm weather months when mosquitoes are the most active. In 2015, there were 300 cases leading to 24 deaths in LA County. This year, seven cases have been reported so far.

Follow these tips: Those you love are counting on you! *Please note, these numbers exclude cases reported to Long Beach's and Pasadena's public health departments. Mosquito-Borne Diseases Climate change is a source of concern for many, especially as warmer, drier weather is observed throughout the county. This affects us in many ways. While the mild El Ni\u00f1o season helped fill many of California's reservoirs, water is still a major concern. We continue to experience record-breaking temperatures. In addition, in the past few weeks, a number of fires have caused many square miles of brush and property to burn. Yet another result of our changing climate may be a rise in diseases, especially those that are related to insects. Warmer temperatures may allow mosquitoes to thrive, including two species of mosquitos recently introduced into Southern California that are known to spread diseases: Aedes aegypti (the yellow fever mosquito) and Aedes albopictus (the Asian tiger mosquito). Two mosquito-borne diseases I would like to cover this month include Zika and West Nile Virus. Zika Virus On August 1st, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released travel guidance advising pregnant women, or women who may become pregnant, to avoid Wynwood, a neighborhood in Miami, Florida. This warning followed reports of mosquito-transmitted Zika virus in the area. More than 20 people in Florida have become infected locally by mosquito bites. To date, no local transmission of Zika has been reported in LA County. However, the Aedes mosquitoes that can transmit Zika are present in the San Gabriel Valley and in the eastern part of the County. Recently, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) reported that two infants with Zika-related microcephaly have been born in California to women who had Zika virus infections during pregnancy after spending time in a country where the virus is present. At the same time, state officials confirmed that a total of 21 infections have occurred in pregnant women. These events highlight the known, serious risks of Zika virus infection to the children of pregnant women. These include not only microcephaly, but also eye defects, hearing loss, impaired growth, and other brain defects. To learn more about microcephaly, The CDC outlines four simple recommendations to prevent Zika infection for women who are pregnant: For couples who want to get pregnant, tell your doctor if you plan to travel to or if you or your partner recently returned from an area with known mosquito-borne Zika transmission. West Nile Virus West Nile Virus (WNV) is another disease spread by mosquitoes that are present throughout the county. Local transmission of the virus occurs every year in Los Angeles County and typically occurs during warm weather months when mosquitoes are the most active. In 2015, there were 300 cases leading to 24 deaths in LA County. This year, seven cases have been reported so far. More cases will occur as the summer progresses.* WNV can cause very serious illnesses such as Protect Your Community To protect the people most at risk for serious harm due to mosquito-borne disease and to help keep LA County free of Zika transmission, help reduce the spread of mosquitoes by getting rid of places where they lay their eggs. Follow these tips: Those you love are counting on you! *Please note, these numbers exclude cases reported to Long Beach's and Pasadena's public health departments. Meningococcal Disease In the last two months, 7 cases of invasive meningococcal disease have been reported within the Los Angeles County Public Health jurisdiction. Additional cases have been reported in surrounding jurisdictions. While a common social link among infected individuals has not been identified, the investigation is on-going and additional information may be available in the near future. Of note, most of the cases occurred among gay and other men who have sex with men (MSM). In light of these recent cases among gay/MSM individuals, the Department of Public Health has reiterated its recommendation for meningococcal vaccinations among the following key risk groups: The Department of Public Health offers meningococcal vaccines for people at higher risk. To ensure access for individuals without health insurance or whose healthcare provider does not offer the vaccines, there is no charge. What is Meningococcal Disease? Vaccines to help protect against the types of meningococcal disease most common in the U.S. are the best way to prevent this disease. In addition to the recommendations above, meningococcal vaccinations are also recommended for: Ask your doctor about whether you and your loved ones are at risk for meningococcal disease and what vaccine might be right for you or your family. The following are more ways to help reduce the spread of disease by limiting the spread of saliva, such as: Meningococcal disease can start with flu-like symptoms, and progress to high fever, headache, stiff neck, confusion and rash. People who experience these symptoms should seek medical care immediately. For more information and other resources on meningococcal disease, June 27th is What is HIV? Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( Ways to prevent or lower the risk of getting HIV include: What is PEP and PrEP? PEP and PrEP are HIV prevention tools that protect against HIV in a way similar to how emergency contraception (aka the morning-after pill) and birth control pills are used to prevent pregnancy. PrEP is a great tool to protect people who share needles or who do not use condoms every time they have sex with partners who may have HIV. People interested in getting PrEP should discuss it with their primary care provider or can seek care at a The Department of Public Health (DPH) now offers PrEP at Ruth Temple and North Hollywood Public Health Centers. The clinics help people who are at risk of HIV get started on PrEP. This fall, DPH will be funding several community health centers to provide PEP and PrEP for uninsured and underinsured persons. Last month, DPH launched its first-ever public education campaign, called \"The Protectors,\" to increase awareness about PrEP. To learn more about PrEP and see the campaign, visit Alcohol is a huge continuing problem that affects many lives and can tear families apart.

It's a great time to learn more about cervical cancer and ways to prevent this disease from affecting family and friends. What Is Cervical Cancer? Today, approximately 12,000 women in the U.S. get cervical cancer each year, and 4,000 women die from it. Compared to all women, Latina women are more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer, while African American/Black women are more likely to die from it. These health disparities are largely the result of unequal access to healthcare, which leads to lower cervical cancer screening rates and delayed treatment if abnormal cell growth or cancer is identified. Some real-life stories from women and their families impacted by cervical cancer and HPV are available at this Cervical Cancer Screening: What You Need to Know The HPV Vaccine Helps Prevent Cervical Cancer There is an HPV vaccine available to protect people from diseases caused by HPV, including cervical and other cancers.

Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work November 16-22, 2015 is Unnecessary antibiotics can be harmful. Antibiotics are powerful drugs. They can be lifesaving when used appropriately, but using antibiotics incorrectly or when it is unnecessary can lead to more antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, it is very important to only use antibiotics when needed to treat bacterial infections. They do not work and should not be used to treat infections caused by viruses. Use of antibiotics when someone has a viral infection can actually be harmful. Antibiotics won't cure a viral infection and can kill protective bacteria in our bodies, increasing the chance to develop a serious infection or an infection caused by bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Antibiotics can also cause an allergic reaction or other unpleasant side effects. Protect yourself and your loved ones. Use antibiotics appropriately. Be a champion for proper antibiotic use at your doctor's office, in your family, and in your community. Here are a few tips to help prevent more antibiotic resistance in our communities: The Department of Public Health (DPH) works hard to ensure that antibiotics are used properly in hospitals, nursing homes, and in the community. We track antibiotic-resistant infections, as well as antibiotic use in healthcare facilities to prevent and measure our progress in limiting the spread of these life-threatening infections. We also collaborate with healthcare facilities to improve infection prevention practices throughout the County. In the community, DPH plans to provide educational resources for patients at community health clinics on proper antibiotic use. Thank you for helping us to reduce the rise of antibiotic resistance in our communities!

Get your influenza vaccine now. Influenza, or the flu, is a virus that causes mild to serious illness. Flu symptoms usually start suddenly and may include fever, coughing, sore throat, headaches, body aches, chills, runny or stuffy nose, extreme tiredness, and weakness. Some people may also experience vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children. Most people get better within two weeks, but some people can develop serious complications, such as Protect Your Loved Ones - Get the Flu Vaccine The flu spreads from person-to-person through coughing and sneezing or by touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after touching a surface that had the virus on it. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting the flu vaccine. The vaccine helps protect you from getting the flu and then passing it on to your family, friends, and people at work. Everyone ages 6 months and older should be vaccinated, especially those at serious risk for flu-related complications. These include people 65 years of age and older, I encourage everyone to get the flu vaccine as soon as possible. Some key facts about the flu vaccine include: The Department of Public Health (Public Health) kicks off a number of County-wide flu prevention activities this month.

Use the following methods to properly dispose of unused prescription medication: Currently, the Department of Public Health is working on an initiative with other County Departments to expand safe and secure disposal options. This will help prevent more unused prescription medication from misuse and abuse. Last Thursday the Human plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and takes one of three forms depending on the area of infection within the body. Bubonic plague is an infection of the lymph nodes; pneumonic plague is an infection of the lungs; and septicemic plague is an infection in the blood stream. All three types of infections can be deadly in about 50% of infected individuals if not treated right away. Today, human plague is rare but does occur in the western United States, including California. It is typically transmitted by flea bites from infected rodents or direct contact with sick animals. In very rare cases, it can spread person-to-person from a patient with pneumonic plague. The last reported previous case in California was in 2006, although two other cases of human plague have been reported this year in Colorado. Both patients in Colorado died from the disease. Reduce your risk of exposure to human plague by doing the following when hiking or camping: When at home: Visit I am happy to report that new Ebola cases in West Africa have significantly declined due to the extraordinary efforts by healthcare professionals to care for infected individuals and reduce community transmission. The number of new weekly cases in West Africa has remained below 30 for several weeks and efforts remain strong to bring the epidemic to a closure as soon as possible. Here in LA County, we continue to maintain surveillance activities as necessary to ensure the health and safety of travelers returning from Ebola-affected countries and we anticipate a decrease in active monitoring as the situation continues to improve in West Africa. At this time, I wish to thank all of our County Departments and community partners for their very strong support and dedication in the deployment of our Ebola preparedness and response strategy. Their collaboration strengthened local efforts to protect LA County residents, and there remains no confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola in our jurisdiction. Second, I want to share that Senate Bill Vaccines are the best defense we have to prevent serious illnesses from spreading in our communities, such as Last month our To improve immunization rates and protect residents from vaccine-preventable diseases, our For more information about immunizations or other health topics, please review the material available on our webpages or call 2-1-1 from any land or mobile phone in LA County to speak with an operator.

Earlier this week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added Mali to the list of Ebola-affected countries, which continues to include Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. To date, more than 15,000 individuals have contracted Ebola during this latest epidemic and there have been 5,420 related deaths worldwide. In the United States, a second Ebola-related death occurred last Monday after Dr. Martin Salia was transferred to Nebraska Medical Center from Sierra Leone for medical care following several days of illness. His tragic passing highlights the critical importance of early intervention and care in recovery. There are no suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola in LA County. Our level of vigilance remains high in LA County as we continue to closely monitor individuals who have traveled here from affected countries and may be at risk of developing Ebola based on their activities abroad. The Department of Public Health has spent the last several weeks strengthening local efforts to ensure we have the most effective strategy possible in place to respond to a potential case of Ebola in LA County. To test key elements of our Ebola preparedness and to practice our response, the Department successfully completed a tabletop exercise with our County partners. The exercise demonstrated our high level of preparation and strong commitments to protect LA County residents' health and safety. Additional departmental activities that are ongoing include: For more information about Ebola, please review the material available on our web pages or call 2-1-1 from any land or mobile phone in LA County to speak with an operator. Operators have general information about Ebola, including how it is prevented, how it is spread, and why the risk of getting Ebola in LA County is low. The information can help you and your family stay informed. Ebola outbreaks continue to affect Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in West Africa with some new cases reported in Mali. While the rate of new cases in Liberia and Guinea has leveled off, the rate of rise in Sierra Leone continues to accelerate. To date, approximately 14, 000 individuals have contracted Ebola during this latest epidemic and there have been 5,160 related deaths worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will continue to monitor the situation and coordinate relief efforts to control the spread of infection. It is important to note that only two cases of Ebola have been exported from West Africa to other parts of the world, which is a testament to the effectiveness of the strategies that are in place to prevent spread. Those two cases are, of course, the case that was diagnosed in Dallas on September 30, and the more recent case in a physician in New York City who has recovered and been released. There are no suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola in LA County. Our level of vigilance remains high in LA County as we continue to closely monitor individuals who have traveled here from affected countries and may be at risk of developing Ebola based on their activities abroad. The Department of Public Health (DPH) has spent the last several weeks strengthening local efforts to ensure we have the most effective strategy possible in place to respond to a potential case of Ebola in LA County.

The information can help you and your family stay informed. The Department of Public Health continues to coordinate efforts to ensure we have an effective strategy to respond to a potential case of Ebola in LA County. As part of these ongoing efforts, we met last week with the Hospital Association of Southern California and the California Association for Health Facilities. The meetings were held jointly with LA County Emergency Medical Services and provided hospitals and long-term health care facilities with an update on Ebola, our current activities, and response plans for LA County. Each meeting was an opportunity to strengthen partnerships and facilitate coordination with all health care providers who may play a role in identifying and treating an individual with Ebola. To date, there are no suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola in LA County. We remain prepared to respond should a case occur here. Our strategy remains unchanged and includes three key elements: to rapidly identify and isolate any individual suspected of having Ebola, ensure the safe care of that individual, and monitor any individuals who may have been exposed. This includes closely monitoring individuals who have returned from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa and may be at risk of developing Ebola so that we can quickly isolate anyone who might develop symptoms and prevent the possible spread of this disease. As needed, I may issue quarantine or other orders to specific individuals. The Department is also in close communication with workplaces, schools, and other entities that may be directly impacted by any quarantine order. The University of California announced that all five UC Medical Centers are willing and able to provide in-patient care for individuals who have confirmed cases of Ebola. This includes the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. Public Health continues to work closely with UCLA and other hospitals throughout LA County to ensure that they remain prepared to medically support an individual with Ebola and safeguard the health of their workforce who may be involved in the patient's care. For more information about Ebola, please review the material available on our webpages or call 2-1-1 from any land or mobile phone in LA County to speak with an operator. Operators have general information about Ebola, including how it is prevented, how it is spread, and why the risk of getting Ebola in LA County is low. The information can help you and your family stay up-to-date. Videos: The State Health Officer from the California Department of Public Health recently issued a risk-based quarantine order for any individuals coming into California who had contact with a person confirmed with Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone, or Guinea. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health will comply with the State's order. To date, there are no suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola in Los Angeles County. We remain prepared to respond should a case happen here. Our strategy is threefold: to rapidly identify and isolate any individual suspected of having Ebola, to assure the safe care of that individual, and to monitor any individuals who may have been exposed. The State's directive builds upon a multi-layered strategy to strengthen local efforts that ensure that those who are at risk of developing Ebola are under close monitoring. This order creates a standard, statewide protocol for managing those individuals at highest risk of developing and possibly spreading this disease. Public Health applauds the brave and extraordinary work of health care workers in West Africa, and we welcome these dedicated individuals upon their return. Our department is in constant communication with local agencies that send health care workers to West Africa, and we will work with these organizations to identify any returning individuals to whom this order may apply. We will have an open process and clear communication with returning health care workers as to what the quarantine order entails. Our goal is to ensure the health and safety of all people in LA County, including the health care workers transitioning back home. If you have questions about Ebola, I encourage you to review the material available to you on our webpages, or dial 2-1-1 from any land or mobile phone in LA County and speak with one of the operators. These operators have general information about Ebola, including how it is prevented, how it is spread, and why the risk of getting sick with Ebola in LA County is low. This information can help ease concerns that you and your family might have about Ebola. Videos: Last week a doctor based in New York, who had treated patients with Ebola in Guinea, tested positive for Ebola. In Los Angeles County there are no confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola, and we remain prepared to respond should a case happen here. I have confidence in the procedures we have in place to keep the public safe. It is important for everyone to note that of the four cases that have been diagnosed in the U.S., two had exposures in West Africa and two were health care workers who had provided care to an Ebola patient. Our efforts to ensure the safety of the people of Los Angeles County are ongoing. The Department of Public Health continues to work with hospitals and health care providers to support their abilities to quickly identify and isolate any individual suspected to have Ebola. We are also actively engaging first responders, health care professionals, local elected officials, and community members with information on Ebola and supporting efforts to train health care workers on how to care for patients with Ebola symptoms and to capture patients' travel histories. For example, Public Health recently partnered with the UCLA Medical Center to test the hospital's plan and processes for caring for people with Ebola. UCLA emergency room doctors and nurses prepared as if they were receiving a person who was suspected to have the disease. Emergency department nursing staff led the patient through an outside entrance into an isolation room in the emergency department. The medical team then admitted the patient directly to a specially designated and prepared room in the hospital. Doctors and nurses practiced putting on the personal protective equipment, taking blood tests, disposing of waste, and taking off the personal protective equipment. Public Health doctors and nurses observed the drill and provided feedback to the UCLA physicians and nurses. Our role as the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is to be the bridge that connects us as quickly as possible with the lessons learned in other communities and puts those lessons learned into practice here locally. Our goal is to keep all health care workers, especially those on the front lines of patient care, safe. I recognize that ongoing coverage about Ebola has caused concern for adults and children alike. It's normal to feel some stress and anxiety; however, it is very important to manage our feelings effectively. We've been collaborating with the LA County Department of Mental Health to identify things we can all do to stay healthy: I would like to affirm once again that there are no suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola in Los Angeles County. We continue to monitor and learn from events that are occurring elsewhere in the U.S. and in the world so that each day we are more prepared than we were yesterday. For general information about Ebola, dial 2-1-1 from any land or mobile phone in Los Angeles County. For more information about mental health assistance, please call the Access Center 24/7 Helpline at (800) 854-7771. Videos: As the news continues to evolve around Ebola, I want to reassure all residents in Los Angeles County that, to date, there are no suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola in Los Angeles County. This past week, we have worked diligently to update and strengthen our plans to address Ebola. We are more prepared today than we were yesterday, and we will be more prepared tomorrow than we are today. Our efforts to reach out and partner with all the organizations that may be involved in the response to a case of Ebola are continuing. A taskforce consisting of multiple County agencies and departments is working together so that we are all prepared in the event we need to take action. We are working with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to address safety concerns regarding rail and bus lines, and to ensure people feel safe traveling by public transit. We continue to work with health care facilities. Our role as the Department of Public Health is to be the bridge that connects us as quickly as possible with the lessons learned in other communities and puts those in practice here. Our goal is to keep all health care workers safe in addition to ensuring patients have the best care possible. We encourage all hospitals in the County to develop training exercises for their staff that can be adapted to their own facility's unique needs to help ensure staff is comfortable and skilled in the use of those safety procedures. I also want to reassure everyone in Los Angeles County that while health care facilities continue to train their staff to respond should a case of Ebola occur here, these same hospitals, clinics, and doctor's offices remain open to treat any patient with any illness. Finally, I encourage everyone to get the influenza vaccine as we enter flu season. This time of year, people start to travel more as we near the holiday season. Public transportation, including air travel, means that we are in close contact with each other, whether on a bus, a train, or airplane. The flu virus is much more common and more easily spread than Ebola. Influenza and Ebola may share some of the same symptoms, but there is very low risk of catching Ebola and very high risk for catching the flu. Free flu vaccines will be available at our | | "}
