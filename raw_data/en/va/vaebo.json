The ancient practice of acupuncture started in China around 100 BC, around the time The Inner Classic of Huang Di (Huangdi Neijing). While homeopathy was developed in the late 18th century by Samuel Hahnemann, a respected doctor in Germany. Homeopathy and Acupuncture are different branches of the healing tree. Their methods seem totally different from one another at the same time both therapies recognize that within the person energies/forces exist and are constantly in motion. Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, spoke of the vital force, while the acupuncturist (Traditional Chinese Medicine) practitioner spoke of Qi (pronounced 'chi') many centuries ago. Acupuncture uses very fine needles to stimulate certain points along the meridians. These points, once stimulated, can produce varying results from pain relief to reviving patients. Its efficiency is in bringing to a normalcy the imbalance that is present in the body. With proper diagnosis, using Traditional Chinese Diagnosis, a practitioner is able to understand where and what the disorders are, and formulate the best action plan to treat it. Homeopathy also recognizes the importance of treating individuals as individuals and of understanding the whole person, as opposed to only understanding a single disease. Therefore, a typical examination would include history taking and examination, as they are all important in establishing the diagnosis. This makes it easy to understand what the true cause of the disorder is. Homeopathy treats by repertorizing the patient's case, thus taking into consideration the patient's condition, personality, physical features, effects of external factors, such as environment, nature and time, and patterns of disease within the family. Both modalities of treatment, homeopathy and acupuncture, can be combined and delivered in their original form to complement each other by practitioners trained in both arts. Using homeopathy with acupuncture has brought about a union of the knowledge between the healing methods of acupuncture and homeopathy. Both treatment methodologies have shown their value in treating many disorders, and so in combination they can make possible even greater feats. If an acupuncturist, or homeopath, were to say \"why bother... acupuncture/homeopathy can do anything\", this would only indicate ideological rigidity, and they would have failed to see that the idea of any treatment is to heal the patient as soon as possible and as effectively as possible. In combining the knowledge of the two systems, homeopathy and acupuncture, person become equipped to have a better understanding about the patient and the illness. This enables practitioners to treat patients more efficiently. Discover the hidden healing power of small granules and gentle acupuncture treatment I'm only one "}
