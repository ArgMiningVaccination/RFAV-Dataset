I discovered the [Rudolf Steiner Bookstore](http://www.anthroposophynyc.org/bookstore/) on 15th St. between 6th and 7th Avenues as I was walking to an early morning radiology appointment. I was too tired and in too big of a hurry to go in, so I snapped a quick picture of the bookstore and texted it to my friend, Anissa. Anissa is a native New Yorker and fellow book-lover, so I was curious to see if she knew anything about it. She had never heard of it before and immediately said she was willing to check it out with me later that afternoon. After a much needed nap and matcha latte, I met up with her in Greenwich Village to explore this mysterious bookstore. We had no idea we were going to love what we found! The Rudolf Steiner Bookstore is part of Anthroposophy NYC, the New York City Branch of the Anthroposophical Society in the United States. According to their [website](http://www.anthroposophynyc.org/about-asnyc/), the Anthroposophical Society is \"dedicated to uniting spiritual truths with life's realities to nurture a shared community\". Anissa and I had never heard of the Anthroposophical Society, so we had a LOT of questions. Luckily, the woman working there had a beautiful, warm energy. She was patient, kind-hearted, extremely knowledgeable, and always willing to help. I love learning about different belief systems and I found Anthroposophy truly fascinating! The bookstore itself was filled wall to wall with books exploring some of our favorite topics such as psychology, spirituality, and childhood education. It was difficult to select just one book but I finally decided to purchase \"Sleep and Dreams: A Bridge To The Spirit\". I purchased it hoping to learn the meaning behind my own vivid dreams, a topic I have been long researching. If you're ever looking for unique books to read or to learn from a new perspective, I highly recommend checking out a Steiner Bookstore! I am not a Anthroposophist but our trip there made it clear to us that everyone is welcome. Tell me friends, have you ever accidentally stumbled upon an amazing bookstore? If so, please share in the comments. I would love to visit the places "}
