The Issue brings together 15 of Drexel's environmental experts to weigh in on what Philadelphia may look like in 2100.

Wondering how the superheroes compare to real insects, we checked in with the Academy's Entomology Department, which houses 3.5 million insect specimens - a treasure for researchers around the world. There we found Robert Conrow, an affable Drexel PhD student and teaching assistant who studies crane flies with Entomology Curator Jon Gelhaus, PhD, a world expert. Gelhaus also is a professor in Drexel's Department of Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science. Conrow says crane flies would make terrible superheroes \"because their long legs easily fall off in the slightest breeze.\" [Read More](http://drexel.edu/coas/news-events/news/2018/August/entomologists-view-on-ant-man/) June 08, 2018 Biological Sciences major and BS + MD student Anuranita Gupta will address graduates as the class of 2018 representative at the College of Arts and Sciences Commencement ceremony on June 15, 2018.

Today they face an uncertain future in local streams and rivers, creating a serious disadvantage when it comes to ecological health. Now, the Academy of Natural Sciences, the College of Arts and Sciences of Drexel University, the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary, Philadelphia Water Department and Department of Parks and Recreation, Bartram's Garden, and the Independence Seaport Museum have come together to develop the Aquatic Research and Restoration Center to coordinate large-scale restoration efforts that do not currently exist in the Philadelphia region.

And you create more pain on top of that trying to handle the original thing that hurt you.\" So recalls Ashley Ramey in the trailer for \"Original Body of Pain,\" a documentary about motherhood and opioid addiction co-directed by Stan Wright, BA Communication '15, and Dominic Silva, both MFA students at Wake Forest University.

[Read More](http://drexel.edu/coas/news-events/news/2018/January/boiling-down-warming-temperatures/) January 19, 2018 As hurricane Irma barreled toward south Florida in early September, Kathleen Reardon gathered her staff to give them something akin to a pep talk. The situation in the Caribbean looked truly frightening that morning, with Irma devastating island chain after island chain with a ferocity that left meteorologists astounded. There was talk, too, that the just-developing Hurricane Jose might turn northward and put Bermuda \u2014 the headquarters for Reardon and her team at global reinsurance firm Hamilton Re \u2014 in harm's way as well.

For geoscience prof Ted Daeschler, PhD, it resembles something more like a two-day flight, followed by a noisy jaunt via military cargo plane, culminating in a 100-mile helicopter ride into the remote terrain and sub-freezing temperatures of Antarctica's McMurdo Dry Valleys.

Part of a Drexel community-based learning course dubbed Story Medicine, the students were there to engage sick and disabled children through live broadcast programming, using skits to infuse laughter with a little education. [Read More](http://drexel.edu/coas/news-events/news/2018/January/lights-camera-medicine/) January 17, 2018 If you live in a town or city like Philadelphia where industrial facilities are emitting chemicals into the air, there is plenty of reason to wonder: How is this affecting me? Few communities have access to ambient air-monitoring data, and those that do rarely use it because it is complicated and lacks context. [Read More](http://drexel.edu/coas/news-events/news/2018/January/a-breath-of-fresh-air/) January 17, 2018 A sixth-grade science fair project in 2014 led to the discovery that erythritol, the main component of Truvia, is a natural insecticide. Today, that discovery is the basis of a new Drexel-backed startup, BioLogic Insecticide. Simon D. Kaschock-Marenda, now a freshman at Drexel in the College of Engineering, was 11 when he noticed that Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as fruit flies, died much quicker when they fed on Truvia than on other sweeteners. His father, Daniel Marenda, PhD, professor of biology in the College of Arts and Sciences, was unconvinced at first.

But what about animals' brains \u2014 including our own? Can they be affected by the changing climate? Sean O'Donnell, PhD, professor in the College of Arts and Sciences, argues that they absolutely "}
