[Ear infections](https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm) can be caused by [viruses](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), bacteria, or rarely yeast. There are three areas in the ear where [ear infections](https://www.medicinenet.com/middle_ear_infection_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm) can occur in adults and children. - infections](https://www.medicinenet.com/anatomy_of_an_ear_infection_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)(swimmer's ear): An outer [ear infection](https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm)( [otitis experienced is often known as \"swimmer's ear.\" This infection usually is due to bacterial infection of the skin tissue covering the ear canal. Excessive immersion in water or injuring the ear canal by putting things in it (such as using cotton swabs in the canal to remove [earwax](https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_wax/article.htm)) makes you more likely to develop an outer [ear infection](https://www.medicinenet.com/anatomy_of_an_ear_infection_pictures_slideshow/article.htm). - Middle [ear infections](https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm): A middle [ear is an infection just behind the eardrum (tympanic membrane) with pus trapped in the adjacent hollow [cavity](https://www.medicinenet.com/cavities/article.htm)(middle ear space) of the facial bone. Middle [ear infections](https://www.medicinenet.com/anatomy_of_an_ear_infection_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)frequently are a complication of the [common cold](https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm)in children. Most middle ear infections are caused by [viruses](https://www.medicinenet.com/viral_infections_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)and will resolve spontaneously. [Bacterial infections](https://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_infections_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)cause some middle ear infections, which require antibiotic treatment. - Inner ear infections: Inner ear infections are very rare, and usually are caused by a virus. These \"infections\" are more accurately characterized as the inflammation of the structures of the inner ear ( [labyrinthitis](https://www.medicinenet.com/labyrinthitis_inner_ear_inflammation/article.htm)). Since these structures affect [hearing](https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm)and balance, inner ear infections cause symptoms such as the ringing of the ears ( [tinnitus](https://www.medicinenet.com/tinnitus_ringing_in_the_ears/article.htm)) or [dizziness](https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm)and balance disruption ( [vertigo](https://www.medicinenet.com/vertigo_overview/article.htm)). Usually, inner ear infections in adults and children (rare) need medical treatment. Which parts of the ear can become infected? There are three separate elements of the human ear that anatomically and functionally work together to enable [hearing](https://www.medicinenet.com/deafness/article.htm) and interpretation of sounds as well as provide a sense of body position and balance during movements of the head and body. - The [outer ear](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/ear_picture/picture.htm)includes the cartilaginous structure (pinna) and ear canal ending at the eardrum (tympanic membrane). - The middle ear is composed of the eardrum and a small hollow area of the facial bone adjacent to the eardrum in which three small bones are linked together. The eardrum moves as a result of air pressure waves that are focused by the pinna and travel down the ear canal. Movement of the tympanic membrane causes a domino-like movement of these three small bones that ultimately transfers this stimulus to the inner ear. - The inner ear has two structures. - The cochlea converts movements of the [ear bones](https://www.medicinenet.com/human_body_quiz/quiz.htm)into nerve impulses that are sent to the brain, which then is \"translated\" into sounds. - The semicircular canals (part of a separate structure), have three parts that interpret the motion of the head allowing recognition of your position in space (for example, lying down, bending over, etc.) - The cochlea converts movements of the What are the symptoms of an ear infection? Common outer (swimmer's ear) and middle ear infection symptoms and signs - Mild to severe ear [pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm) - Problems hearing - Redness and inflammation - Pus draining from the ear Other swimmer's ear symptoms and signs Middle and inner ear infection symptoms and signs [Fever](https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm) - Problems with balance - A feeling of fullness in the ear Other inner ear infection symptoms and signs [Nausea](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm)and [vomiting](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm) [Vertigo](https://www.medicinenet.com/balance_disorders_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) [Tinnitus](https://www.medicinenet.com/tinnitus_ringing_ears_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)( [ringing in the of the inner ear) [](https://www.medicinenet.com/hearing_loss_quiz/quiz.htm) QUESTIONSee Answer Can I treat an ear infection at home? You can treat some outer and middle ear infections at home with remedies and [over-the-counter](https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm) medication for symptoms like [pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm) and inflammation. Swimmer's ear (outer ear infection) home treatment Usually, prolonged and recurrent immersion in water causes [outer ear](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/ear_picture/picture.htm) infections. The primary treatment for a swimmer's ear is to avoid getting water in the ear canal until the ear [pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm) is gone. An outer [ear infection](https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm) may take several days to heal, but the [pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_quiz/quiz.htm) usually is gone within one week. Moreover, the warmer the water, the higher the likelihood of getting a swimmer's ear, for example, people who swim in the summer are more likely to develop an outer [ear infection](https://www.medicinenet.com/anatomy_of_an_ear_infection_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) than wintertime surfers. Middle ear infection home treatment Numerous studies have shown that viruses cause middle ear infections. [Pain management](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm) for ear pain for two or three days will allow the body's natural immune system to fight and cure the infection, much like the [common cold](https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold_pictures_slideshow/article.htm). However, some people with middle ear infections may need to see a doctor or other healthcare professional for medical treatment. Inner ear infection and labyrinthitis home treatment Inner ear infections and labyrinthitis ( [inner ear inflammation](https://www.medicinenet.com/labyrinthitis_inner_ear_inflammation/article.htm) in adults and children are very rare, moreover, the symptoms of inner ear infections may be associated with other non-infectious causes, otolaryngologists (doctors that specialize in ear, nose problems) usually treat inner ear infections in adults and children. What home remedies relieve ear pain and cure ear infections? Natural and [over-the-counter](https://www.medicinenet.com/over-the-counter_products/article.htm) (OTC) nonprescription (not antibiotic) remedies for ear infections: - Over-the-counter pain relievers, for example, [acetaminophen](https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm)( [Tylenol](https://www.medicinenet.com/acetaminophen/article.htm)and others) and [ibuprofen](https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm)( [Advil](https://www.medicinenet.com/ibuprofen/article.htm)). Those over 18 years of age can also consider [aspirin](https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm)for pain. Those younger than 18 should avoid [aspirin](https://www.medicinenet.com/acetylsalicylic_acid/article.htm)due to its association with Reye's syndrome (a potentially fatal disease associated with [liver](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_anatomy_and_function/article.htm)and brain deterioration). - For ear pain associated with a middle [ear infection](https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection_quiz/quiz.htm)without an eardrum perforation, warm (not hot) oil (olive, vegetable) dripped gently into the ear canal and held in place by a cotton ball may help ease ear pain. Warm oil is less likely to be helpful for a swimmer's ear. - A warm or [cold](https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm)compress may help ear pain. Some people find alternating between a warm and [cold](https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm)compress helpful - Naturopathic eardrops have been tried to control ear pain and primary ear infections with limited success. Naturopathic eardrops have not been approved by the FDA [Tea tree oil](https://www.medicinenet.com/tea_tree_oil-topical/article.htm)eardrops are widely used but have the same limitations discussed concerning naturopathic eardrops. - An oil containing [ginger](https://www.medicinenet.com/ginger_zingiber_officinale-oral/article.htm)may be applied to the pinna. Advocates of this preparation urge to avoid pouring [ginger](https://www.medicinenet.com/ginger_zingiber_officinale-oral/article.htm)oil into the ear canal. - Anecdotal testimonies exist praising the use of [garlic](https://www.medicinenet.com/garlic_allium_sativum_l-oral/article.htm)oil poured into the ear canal as an effective therapy for outer and middle ear infections. - Parents of young children with middle ear infections ( [otitis media](https://www.medicinenet.com/ear_infection/article.htm)) have long since noted the reluctance to put pressure on the side of the infected ear. Sleeping with the painful side \"up\" may be of help in the management of ear pain. - Before antibiotics, a common \"natural\" technique to treat middle ear infections was for the doctor to make a small incision in the eardrum (myringotomy) to relieve pressure and allow any pus to drain from the ear. - Myringotomy is still considered when treating unusual bacterial ear infections in newborns, infants, and those with a compromised immune system and that may require antibiotics not commonly used to treat ear infections. - Chiropractic treatment has been used to treat and cure middle ear infections; however, comparative studies have mixed results. Chiropractic treatment to treat and cure ear infections may increase the risk of injury. Should ear infections be treated with antibiotics? Antibiotics and outer ear infections - The most recent policy statement by the American Academy of [Pediatrics](https://www.medicinenet.com/childrens_health/article.htm)(AAP) encourages [pain management](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm)and not antibiotics as the initial approach to most outer and middle ear infections. Since outer ear infections (swimmer's ear) are generally bacterial in cause, this type of ear infection can be prevented by avoiding prolonged ear canal immersion. - Antibiotic eardrops have been shown to accelerate the healing process in swimmer's ear, but avoiding prolonged water in the ear canal also is highly recommended. Rarely, severe cases of swimmer's ear will cause the ear canal tissue to become swollen shut. To treat this, an \"ear wick\" is placed in the ear to allow the antibiotic eardrops into the narrowed ear canal. Oral antibiotics often are used in severe cases. Antibiotics and middle ear infections - AAP guidelines for a middle ear infection (otitis media) recommend first-line use of antibiotics (instead of purely pain management) in children younger than 2 years of age experiencing moderate to severe ear pain and a [fever](https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm)greater than 102.2. F (39 C). This recommendation reflects the knowledge that this age group is much more likely to have a bacterial cause of a middle ear infection versus a viral cause in children above two years of age. - Children between 6 months to 2 years of age who do not have severe pain and do not have a temperature greater than 102.2 are candidates for parental monitoring without antibiotics. - Children older than two years of age should be monitored. - Regardless of therapy type (observation or antibiotics), parents or caregivers must have access to medical follow-up should symptoms worsen. Antibiotics and inner ear infections - Inner ear infections are rare and usually need to be treated by an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist. If you have an ear infection for which antibiotics are not prescribed, follow-up for re-evaluation by the doctor is important. When to call the doctor for an ear infection Some symptoms of an [inner ear infection](https://www.medicinenet.com/inner_ear_infection/article.htm) can be the same as a [stroke](https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm). If you have [vomiting](https://www.medicinenet.com/vomiting/symptoms.htm), [headache](https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm), vision changes, [fever](https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm), [weakness](https://www.medicinenet.com/weakness/symptoms.htm) in one side of your body, slurred speech, or are unable to walk, seek medical care right away. Infections involving high fever, discharge or bleeding from the ear canal, [headache](https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), [vomiting](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm), [dizziness](https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness/symptoms.htm), loss of hearing, or severe pain should be seen by a doctor. A doctor should see most people with an [inner ear infection](https://www.medicinenet.com/labyrinthitis_inner_ear_inflammation/article.htm).

See a picture of Ear Anatomy and learn more about the health topic. Ear TubesWhen a child has repeated middle ear infections or fluid build-up in the ears, which causes problems with speech or hearing, surgery to place tubes inside the ear is often recommended. The surgery is called myringotomy. Preparing your child for this procedure will help comfort them, and knowing what to expect before, during, and after surgery is important as well. Earwax RemovalEarwax (ear wax) is a natural substance secreted by special glands in the skin on the outer part of the ear canal. It repels water, and traps dust and sand particles. Usually a small amount of wax accumulates, dries up, and then falls out of the ear canal carrying with it unwanted particles. Under ideal circumstances, you should never have to clean your ear canals. The absence of ear wax may result in dry, itchy ears, and even infection. Ear wax may accumulate in the ear for a variety of reasons including; narrowing of the ear canal, production of less ear wax due to aging, or an overproduction of ear wax in response to trauma or blockage within the ear canal. Eustachian Tube DysfunctionThe Eustachian tube is a membrane-lined tube that connects the middle ear space to the back of the nose. Symptoms of Eustachian tube dysfunction or blockage include popping and/or clicking in the ear, and ear fullness and/or pain. Causes of Eustachian tube dysfunction or blockage include allergies, sinus infections, ear infections, and the common cold. Treatment includes home remedies to relieve pain and several maneuvers (swallowing, chewing gum, yawning, etc.), which can be done to improve Eustachian tube function.

Inner Ear InfectionAn inner ear infection or otitis interna is caused by viruses or bacteria and can occur in both adults and children. An inner ear infection can cause symptoms and signs, for example, a severe ear, dizziness, vertigo, nausea and vomiting, and vertigo. An inner ear infection also may cause inflammation of the inner ear or labyrinthitis. Inner ear infections are not contagious; however, the bacteria and viruses that cause the infection can be transmitted to other people. Good hygiene practices will help decrease the chances of the infection spreading to others. Inner ear infection symptoms and signs like ear pain and nausea may be relieved with home remedies or over-the-counter (OTC) medication. Some inner ear infections will need to be treated and cured with antibiotics or prescription pain or antinausea medication. Inner Ear Infection (Labyrinthitis)Labyrinthitis occurs when there is inflammation of the part of the ear responsible for balance and hearing), usually due to viral infections of the inner ear. Learn about causes, symptoms, and treatment. Ruptured Eardrum A perforated (ruptured, punctured) eardrum (tympanic membrane) is a hole or tear in the eardrum. The eardrum separates the ear canal and middle ear. Most ruptured eardrums do not cause pain, however, the condition can be uncomfortable. Bacteria, viral, and fungal infections are the most common causes a ruptured eardrum. Earwax removal attempts, changes in air pressure, and trauma are other causes of a ruptured eardrum. If you have a ruptured eardrum you may have symptoms like: - Ear pain - Partial or full hearing loss - A mucousy or pus-like blood-tinged discharge from you ear - Bleeding from the ear - Ringing in the ear - Vertigo - Nausea - Vomiting - Middle ear infection Most people do not need medical treatment for a ruptured eardrum, however, some may need surgery depending upon the cause and size of the hole in the eardrum.
