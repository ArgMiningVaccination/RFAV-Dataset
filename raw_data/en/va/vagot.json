It naturally cures the illnesses and prevents them from recurring. Besides, it has no side effects. Allopathy, on the other hand, refers to modern science. It was recently introduced in India. The antibiotics in allopathy provide rapid relief from the ailments. Homoeopathy was theorized by Samuel Hahnemann in 18th century Germany. For children and the elderly, it has now become one of the most accessible sources of medicine across the world. When it comes to choosing between the three, the decision can be confusing. So, here are the pros and cons that you should weigh in before picking Ayurveda over allopathy and homoeopathy. Ayurveda vs Allopathy 1. Ayurveda provides a lasting cure. Ayurveda treats a human body from its roots and provides a permanent solution, while allopathy provides rapid relief and does not cure the disease permanently. 2. Side effects Ayurvedic medicines are made purely from natural herbs. Thus, they cure diseases without leaving any harmful side effects behind. On the other hand, antibiotics do cure illnesses but leave behind harmful side effects. 3. Eco-friendly For those of us who are environmentally conscious, Ayurveda comes as a blessing. On the other hand, allopathic medicines contain harmful chemicals and deteriorate the environment. Ayurveda vs Homeopathy 1. The difference in focus points Homoeopathy alleviates the symptoms of a disease. But Ayurveda cures and rejuvenates the body from the inside out instead of merely focusing on the symptoms. 2. Multi-faceted approach Homoeopathy focuses on the principle of minimum dose and leaves behind certain lifestyle facets while curing a disease. On the other hand, Ayurveda believes in holistic treatment and considers all the factors, including lifestyle, mental and emotional determinants, while providing a cure. 3. Range of treatments While homoeopathy has a cure for the most common ailments like recurrent cold, asthma etc., there is insufficient evidence to support its claims regarding other diseases. Ayurveda has kept up with the pace of modern life. It has several more reliable treatments for skin, hair, mental and bleeding issues. Ayurveda also serves as a complementary source of medicine. You can use Ayurvedic medicine to speed up your recovery if you are currently on allopathic prescriptions. For more optimum medical advice, reach out "}
