JAMMBP strives to provide a platform for clinical practitioners, practitioners of alternative medicine, scientists, and lay persons to share research, best practices, and new insights into the field. JAMMBP is committed to providing a rigorous [peer-review](https://openaccesspub.org/peer-review) process to ensure that all research, best practices, and new insights are of the highest quality and that any potential biases are critically examined. As such, JAMMBP seeks out and encourages the submission of high quality, innovative, and meaningful research from all geographies, cultures and backgrounds. JAMMBP publishes original research and reviews from all fields of alternative medicine, such as acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy, meditation and mindfulness, energy medicine, herbs and nutritional supplements, and other holistic and spiritual healing techniques. The journal emphasizes integrative medicine, believing that evidence-based perspectives are vital in the quest for new treatments and preventative strategies. Alternative medicine complements or replaces conventional treatments, with particular importance to the research that explores the natural mechanisms of action, as well as their effectiveness, well-being, expenditures, patterns of practice. Mind and Body practices on the other hand use psychological and bodily aptitudes to develop fitness and health. These practices rank amongst the most popular complementary health attitudes. Though there is an upsurge in the investigation in these areas, many proportions persist to be explored as well as the substantial circumstances underlying the practical effects. Hence we believe this journal incorporating these subjects will prove to be a comprehensive source in addressing broad scope that directly influences patient care treatments, procedures, and approaches, eventually refining the quality of healing. JAMMBP also promotes the study of mind-body connections, aiming to translate the findings of recent research in psychology, spiritual practices, and philosophy into clinically useful insights. The journal encourages a wide range of topics and perspectives, from conventional, scientific perspectives to those based in humanistic, spiritual, and philosophical traditions. JAMMBP publishes articles that examine the science, theory, and practice of alternative and mind-body medicine from both a biological and social perspective. In addition, the journal publishes articles on research related to the efficacy and safety of these therapies, as well as on emerging topics. Furthermore, JAMMBP also offers a forum for the discussion of ideas and topics related to complementary and holistic health, such as the integration of natural and spiritual healing, the role of nutrition in health and well-being, and the psychology of healing. The goal is to enable readers to gain a better understanding of the various aspects of alternative medicine and mind-body practices, and to better appreciate the potential benefits and risks of the various approaches to health and healing. JAMMBP is an inclusive and welcoming journal, and welcomes submissions from all backgrounds, approaches, and perspectives. The journal is dedicated to promoting dialogue, understanding, and collaboration within the field of alternative medicine and mind-body practices, and strives to support the critical examination and synthesis of evidence-based approaches to health and healing.
