Many older adults have special nutrient requirements because aging affects absorption, use and excretion. A combination of macronutrients, vitamins and minerals, fiber and water are essential in providing the nutrients for the elderly. Macronutrient - Macronutrient constitutes the majority of an individual diet's, \"supplying energy and the essential nutrients needed for health, maintenance\". - Macronutrients are nutrients that provide calories or energy. There are three macronutrients which are carbohydrate, protein and fats. - Each of these macronutrients provides calories and their amount varies: - Carbohydrate provides 4 calories per gram - Protein provides 4 calories per gram - Fat provides 9 calories per gram Dietary fibre Dietary fibre constitutes parts of plant that are not digested by the human body. It is found only in plant foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains. There are two types of fiber. They are soluble and insoluble fiber. Insoluble fiber binds water, so it helps to increase bulk, soften stool and shorten transit time through the intestinal tract. Health benefits of dietary fiber. Among the health benefits of dietary fibre include: - Prevent Constipation - Lower blood cholesterol level. - The body eliminates cholesterol through the excretion of bile acids. Soluble fiber binds bile acids, suggesting that a high fiber diet may result in the excretion of cholesterol. - Reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases and some cancers (e.g colon cancer) Fibre content in selected foods: | | Food | | Serving Size | | Weight (g) | | Fibre Content (g) |Guava||1 small slice|| | 60 | | 16.0 |Chick peas||\u00bd cup|| | 66 | | 5.6 |Peanuts||\u00bd cup|| | 58 | | 4.8 |Red 100 | | 100 | 100 | | 4.0 |Pear||1 | 166 | | 4.0 |Baked beans||\u00bd cup|| | 95 | | 3.8 |Apple||1 whole medium sized|| | 138 | | 3.7 |Fermented soya bean cake (tempe)||2 small pieces (50g)|| | 50 | | 3.2 |Orange||1 whole small sized|| | 120 | | 2.8 |Peas (rebus)||\u00bd cup|| | 68 | | 2.8 |Potatoes||1 whole medium sized|| | 110 | | 2.6 |Banana||1 whole medium sized|| | 100 | | 2.4 |Almond||10 nuts|| | 15 | | 2.3 |Corn||1 comb medium sized|| | 77 | | 2.2 |Tomato||1 whole medium sized|| | 200 | | 2.2 |Carrot||\u00bd cup|| | 62 | | 2.0 |Prunes||4 pieces|| | 28 | | 2.0 |Spinach (bayam)||\u00bd cup|| | 60 | | 1.7 |Peas||\u00bd cup|| | 80 | | 1.6 |Okra (bendi)||\u00bd cup|| | 64 | | 1.6 |Cabbage||\u00bd cup|| | 60 | | 1.4 |High fiber bread||1 slice|| | 28 | | 1.3 |Barley||2 tablespoon|| | 26 | | 0.8 |Oats||2 tablespoon|| | 12 | | 0.2 Recommended Nutrient Intakes: The daily recommendation of fiber intake is 20-30 grams Vitamins and minerals that are important for the elderly The elderly have a higher risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies and are susceptible to several diseases such as gastritis, anemia and bone diseases.
