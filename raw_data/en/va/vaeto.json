Key Facts Called the KidCOVE study, it will be conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health and will test the vaccine on 6,750 kids ages 6 months to 11 years old. The study is an \"age de-escalation\" study, meaning that older children will get the vaccine first, and as it is shown to be safe, it will be given to progressively younger kids. It is also a \"dose escalation\" study, meaning that the researchers will start with smaller doses of the vaccine and work up to normal adult doses once the low doses are proven to be safe. A spokesperson from Moderna says the trial is still enrolling participants from throughout the U.S. and Canada. In December, Moderna began clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old; data from that trial is expected this spring.

Children don't often get severe symptoms of Covid-19, though some have been hospitalized and even died from the disease. A vaccine for children would also help contain outbreaks, since research has shown that children can pass the virus on to teachers and family members. Tangent Covid-19 vaccine competitor Pfizer announced [last month](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/pfizer-says-its-covid-vaccine-trial-for-kids-ages-12-to-15-is-fully-enrolled.html) that it had begun a trial of its Covid-19 vaccine in adolescents aged 12 to 15 (the vaccine is already approved for teens aged 16 and up), but the company hasn't said anything yet about dosing younger children. Crucial Quote \"We project that high school students will very likely be able to be vaccinated . . . in the early part of the fall,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose team has worked closely with Moderna throughout the development of the vaccine, on CBS [last week](https://twitter.com/FaceTheNation/status/1368590959680905219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1368590959680905219%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Ffauci-high-school-children-vaccines-timeline_n_6044fad4c5b660a0f389513b). \"Elementary school kids . . . they likely will be able to get vaccinated by the very first quarter of 2022.
