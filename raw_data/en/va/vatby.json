However, it is often misunderstood and can be very difficult to manage. Here at BeBalanced we understand the connection not only between your hormones, but also how they affect endometriosis. In this article we're going to give you 10 natural remedies for endometriosis that any woman can incorporate into their life. So, [what exactly is endometriosis](https://bebalancedcenters.com/blog/natural-relief-for-endometriosis/)? It is essentially tissue that is found normally within the lining of the uterus, that grows outside of the uterus and on other areas of the body where it doesn't belong. Common symptoms of endometriosis include painful or irregular periods, painful digestion, lower back and abdominal pain, pelvic pain, bloating, and infertility. These symptoms can be debilitating! Here are some natural remedies for endometriosis that you can start actioning today! Tip#1: Incorporate Tub Time When you suffer from endometriosis, the use of heat and warm water relaxes tense muscles and eases cramps. Soothing additions such as Epsom salts and essential oils add an extra layer of relaxation that is beneficial for your skin as well. You want to soak for at least 15 minutes to get the maximum benefit! And to keep the symptoms away when you can't get in the water, try using a heating pad either on your low back or abdomen. Just make sure that your skin is dry and that there is a layer of clothing between the heating pad and your skin. Tip #2: Go Lean and Green It's no mystery that symptoms of endometriosis flare significantly from what you eat, which is why women with endometriosis experience significant decrease in their symptoms when on the BeBalanced program. Foods that are processed and are [high in fat and sugar can stimulate cramping](https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/20688-study-links-high-fat-high-sugar-diet-to-muscle-pain). These foods are low in essential nutrients and fiber and may promote pain and inflammation. By focusing on foods that are high in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, [estrogen levels](https://bebalancedcenters.com/blog/estrogen-dominance-can-effect/) are stabilized and balanced. These foods also provide antioxidants which can prevent endometrial flares. And for those days when you are bloated and don't want to eat, try using a nutrient-rich smoothie to sip on during the day. Tip #3: Get Moving Exercise releases endorphins, which are pain relieving chemicals. Just 10 minutes of aerobic exercise a day can unleash these natural pain killers. It also improves blood flow and that means that oxygen rich blood is easily delivered to your body, preventing cramping and bloating. And since estrogen can be stored in excess fat, when you increase your steps and lose weight, you are also losing those estrogen triggers which are responsible for endometriosis. Tip #4: Consume Omega Oils Omega-3 fatty acids reduce pain and inflammation. Studies are now showing that by increasing omega-3 fats, you can reduce your risk of having endometriosis and limiting symptoms. Omega-3 fats are found in fatty fish, such as salmon and mackerel, and can be taken as a high-quality supplement such as our Essential Omega Oils. Tip #5: Manage Stress Chronic stress and inflammation lead to a significant imbalance between progesterone and estrogen. This imbalance can cause severe flare in endometriosis symptoms. Developing a stress relieving routine can both help your body and mind. Relaxation techniques including meditation, deep breathing exercises, yoga, and massage can significantly decrease symptoms of endometriosis. Tip #6: Reduce Inflammation Inflammation within your body can cause severe endometrial flares. There are over-the-counter medications that can help with this, however, to manage your inflammation long-term, you want to focus on natural anti-inflammatories and antioxidants. By using supportive supplements and herbs such as curcumin (found in our Curcumin Complex formula) and cinnamon, you can manage inflammation within your body and keep those flares at bay. Tip #7: Cut down on Red Meat Studies have shown that women who regularly consume red meat have a much higher risk of developing endometriosis. This is most likely due to red meat causing estrogen imbalance and triggering inflammation within the body. By keeping red meat consumption less than 1 time per week, those risks decreased. Consider choosing other proteins sources, such as fish, turkey, chicken, or a high-quality protein powder such as our Total-5. And remember to consume organic food products whenever possible. Tip #8: Limit Caffeine and Alcohol Caffeine and alcohol can both dehydrate you, which can induce endometrial cramping. Listen to your body and take notice of the way that it reacts to these substances. If it seems to trigger symptoms, try to limit your intake. Choose to hydrate with infused water and herbal teas. Something as simple as adding frozen berries to your water bottle, fresh squeezed lemon, or even cucumbers and mint can add amazing variety that entices you to stay hydrated all day long. And a soothing cup of hot tea before bed can help you relax at the end of the day. Tip #9: Rest and Rejuvenate As a busy woman, it can be very difficult to find time to relax and sleep. However, if you don't rest during a flare, your body will react, and symptoms make it much worse. By regulating your sleep and making sure that you get at least 7 to 9 hours per night, you are supporting your body. And when you have a flare of endometriosis, even taking just 20 minutes to lie down with a heating pad and rest, or listening the one of the BeBalanced relaxation tacks, can energize you and prevent suffering for the rest of the day. Tip #10: Find Support Support comes in many different forms. When it comes to managing symptoms of endometriosis, there are three that seem to be the most important: supportive/comfortable clothing, supportive belly wrap, and supportive people. You may still have a lot of daily responsibilities even when you experience a flare of endometriosis, therefore wearing clothing that is comfortable is crucial. Keep a few outfits in your closet (such as leggings and a cute flowing dress) that you can grab quickly on those days where you are struggling. Sometimes a supportive neoprene belly wrap can help with bloating and allows your body to produce extra heat which can alleviate symptoms of endometriosis. And more than anything you need people to support you every step of the way when your symptoms are at their worst. Surround yourself with people who encourage you on days when flares are at their worst and choose to work with a medical provider who is supportive and willing to help manage your symptoms.
