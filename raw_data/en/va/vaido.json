Because of the resultant decline in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, one needs to reconsider the evaluation andmanagement of the febrile child. In particular, for well-appearing febrile children who arevaccinated, routine screening for occult bacterial infections with or without empiric treatment can no longer recommended. At the same time, early evidence suggests that infections due to nonvaccine serotypes are increasing along with selected invasivediseases such as complicated pneumonia. Therefore, although likely to evolve, the optimal management strategy for the well-appearing, immunized, febrile child may be screening for urinary tract infections and observation with adequate follow-up. Continued surveillance ofdisease due to nonvaccine serotypes is essential. Clin Ped Emerg Med 9:221-227 \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. KEYWORDS fever, toddler, emergency medicine, bacteremia Fever is one of the most important reasons for child- hood visits to the emergency department (ED) and accounts for approximately 5.4 million ED visits annuallyin the United States [1]. Although most febrile children have an apparent source of infection or self-limited viralinfections, approximately 6% to 14% will have feverwithout source (FWS) [2,3] . Most children with FWS have a nonbacterial cause of fever and areclinically indistinguishable from the small proportion ofthose with serious bacterial infections (SBIs) (occultbacteremia [OB], meningi tis, lobar pneumonia, and urinary tract infections [UTIs]) when they first presentto the ED. Because there is no single reliable clinical orlaboratory (or a combination thereof) predictor of SBIs inotherwise well-appearing febrile children, practitionersfrequently depend on a variety of guidelines in the eva-luation of FWS [2]. This area continues to be debated, and substantial practice pattern variation has been documentedin the evaluation of a child with FWS. In addition, thewidespread use of highly effective and safe vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (conjugate pneumococcal vaccine PCV7) has impacted the epidemiology of SBIs, prompting experts to reconsider the evaluation and management of the febrilechild [4]. However, despite effectiveness against vaccine serotypes, there is evidence that invasive disease due tononvaccine serotypes of S pneumoniae is increasing since the introduction of PCV7 [5]. The disease caused by these serotypes is troubling because of its severity and resistanceto antibiotics [6-8] . This article will focus on FWS in young children (3-36 months old). We will discuss the changingepidemiology, diagnosis, and management of OB,meningitis, pneumonia, and UTIs in the era of wide-spread Hib and PCV7 immunization.

The epidemiology of OB has evolved substantially since the 1970s [9]. Before the introduction of Hib conjugate vaccine in 1990, the prevalence of OBwas 2.4% to 11.6% in all children with FWS [10,11] . S pneumoniae OB was responsible for 50% to 90% of cases, 3% to 25% were due to H influenzae , and the rest of the cases were due to Salmonella species and Neisseria meningitidis . Since the introduction of the Hib vaccine, the incidence of invasive H influenzae (all types) infections among children younger than 5 years hasdecreased by 96%; and importantly, invasive disease dueto Hib has decreased by 99% (34 cases per 100 000 in1989 to 0.4 case in 1995) [12]. Two large studies of febrile children in the post-Hib era demonstrated a significantdrop in the OB rate. In a prospective study of 9465 febrilechildren (3-36 months of age), Lee et al [13] found an OB prevalence of 1.57% (95% confidence interval [CI],1.32%-1.83%). In a retrospective cohort of 5901 febrilechildren aged 2 to 24 months, Alpern et al [14] found an OB prevalence of 1.9% (95% CI, 1.5%-2.3%). S pneumo- niae pathogens, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae S pneumoniae continues to remain a serious pathogen in the developing and developed world. Its only knownreservoir is the human nasopharynx, and there are 90known immunologically distinct serotypes. This organismis responsible for 1.2 million deaths in children youngerthan 2 years and causes more deaths than any othervaccine-preventable organism [15]. In the United States, in the absence of vaccination, S pneumoniae caused approxi- mately 17 000 cases per year of invasive disease amongchildren younger than 5 years, 13 000 of which were OB,700 cases of meningitis, and 200 deaths [16]. Although most cases of pneumococcal bacteremia resolve sponta-neously, it was estimated that 10% to 25% of infectedchildren develop focal complications including cellulitis,pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis [17]. Empiric treatment with antibiotics at the time of initial evaluation has been shown to reduce the rate of focal complications (from 10% to 4%), bacteremia (from 17% to 1%), fever (from 73% to24%), and the need for hospitalization (from 50% to 12%)[18]. The above estimates were derived on data in the pre- PCV7 era, and more recent data suggest that the risk ofdeveloping meningitis is closer to 0.04% (1 in 2500)[19,20] . In the study of Alpern et al [14], 96% of pneumococcal OB resolved spontaneously and only 0.03% developed sepsis or meningitis. Yet despite its low case fatality rate, the morbidity and mortality associatedwith S pneumoniae meningitis are higher than Listeria mono- cytogenes , or Prevention of Pneumococcal Invasive Disease Prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) by the use of vaccines is the most effective approach to reduce theburden of illness and its sequelae. The 23-valent poly-saccharide pneumococcal vaccine that was licensed in 1983 is ineffective in children younger than 2 years. Covalent coupling of weakly immunogenic polysacchar-ides with a carrier protein, called conjugate vaccine , elicits strong antibody production and a booster response [15]. Based on the experience acquired with the highly effectiveHib conjugate vaccine, a similar conjugate vaccine againstS pneumoniae was developed. This vaccine, PCV7, has serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) that are responsible for 80% to 95% of invasive diseases; and these same serotypes are also the most likely to be resistant toantimicrobials. Prelicensure studies [21] showed a 94% in IPD in children whoreceived PCV7, prompting the American Academy ofPediatrics and the Advisory Committee for ImmunizationPractices to recommend routine immunization for allchildren at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months of age in 2000 [16]. Postlicensure surveillance data published in 2003 by Blacket al [22] revealed no cases of vaccine serotype disease in children younger than 1 year, with similar diseasereductions seen in children younger than 5 years. Themost recent report by the Active Bacterial Core Surveil-lance Group of the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention continues to demonstrate the impact of PCV7,with the largest percentage decline (82%) and the largest absolute rate reduction in overall IPD (175.8 cases per 100 000) observed among children aged 1 year, the agegroup with the highest baseline disease rate [5]. The Epidemiology of OB in the Post-Pneumococcal Vaccine Era There are few ED-based studies in the post-PCV7 era that have specifically looked at the incidence of OB. Aretrospective study conducted by Stoll and Rubin [23] demonstrated that the incidence of S pneumoniae OB was less than 1% (0.91%; 95% CI, 0%-1.9%) in febrilechildren (n = 329) 2 to 36 months of age. Herz et al(2006) [24] examined 41 948 blood cultures obtained from febrile children 3 to 36 months of age over a 5-yearperiod (1998-2003) in the EDs and outpatient clinic.They compared the epidemiology of OB before and afterthe implementation of PCV7 vaccination in the KaiserPermanente Clinics of Northern California. There was an 84% reduction in S pneumoniae bacteremia (1.3%-0.2%) and a in overall bacteremia (1.6%-0.7%)222 P. Mahajan, R. Stanleyover the 5 years. In another ED-based study by Sard et al [25], the overall rate of OB was 0.7% in a community hospital ED among well-appearing febrile children 1 to36 months of age. Sixty-one percent of the cases of OB were due to S pneumoniae . Finally, Carstairs et al [26] conducted a prospective observational study on febrile children (38\u00b0C, b36 months) and compared the pre- valence of OB between those who had received PCV7(n = 833) vs those who had not (n = 550). The overallrate of bacteremia was 4.2% (including contaminants),with 2.4% of nonimmunized having OBcompared with 0% of those who were immunized with any dose of PCV7 [26]. The authors were able to verify the immunization status of each enrolled child. Although pneumococcus is the most common cause of OB, other causes of bacteremia can present with FWS. Data on other pathogens in the post-PCV7 era are lacking. Thelargest outpatient surveillance study in the post-PCV7 eraoffers some updated perspective on the relative frequencyof infecting organisms [24]. This 5-year data set from Northern California revealed that bacteremia is nowcaused by Escherichia coli , Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coliwas the second most common organism grown from the blood culture reflecting bacteremia in patients withUTI, which is the most common SBI in children with FWS.Experts suggest that without the availability of effective vaccines, the incidence of invasive disease caused by Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus is likely to remain constant [27]. In summary, the overall prevalence of S pneumoniae OB after PCV7 is less than 1%, much lower than theprevious estimate of 1.5% to 1.9%. Nonpneumococcalorganisms account for a higher proportion of OB in thepost-PCV7 era. Occult Pneumonia The decision to obtain a chest radiograph in theevaluation of a child with FWS is controversial and notevidence based. Accurate diagnosis of bacterial pneumo-nia is difficult because ( a) even if S pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of lobar pneumonia inchildren, most lower respiratory tract infections will beviral in nature; ( b) chest radiograph results are often negative in the early stages of pneumonia; ( c) it is often difficult to ascribe etiology, that is, bacterial or non-bacterial, on \"positive\" chest radiograph findings; and finally, ( d) there is substantial variation in interpretation of chest radiographs even among trained radiologists [28]. Although the presence of pulmonary symptoms (cough) and signs (tachypnea, rales, respiratory distress, etc) increases the likelihood of a positive finding on chestradiograph, Bachur et al [29] showed that occult pneumonia was present in 26% of children youngerthan 5 years with fevers of more than 39\u00b0C and whiteblood cell (WBC) counts of at least 20 000 cells permicroliter. Most research on occult pneumonia wasconducted during the pre-PCV7 era. Zhou et al [30] have shown that the routine use of PCV7 has markedly reduced the rates of all causes of pneumonia including pneumococcal pneumonia in children younger than2 years. The only published study addressing occultpneumonia in the post-PCV7 era was done by Murphyet al [31]. They reviewed the records of all febrile children younger than 10 years who had a chestradiograph for pneumonia. Among patients categorizedas having no signs of pneumonia (n = 1084), 5.3% (95% CI, 4%-6.8%) had occult pneumonia. The likelihood of occult pneumonia increased with increasing duration offever (likelihood ratio (LR+) 1.62 for fever greater than3 days and LR+ 2.24 for fever greater than 5 days),presence of cough (LR+ 1.24), prolonged cough (greaterthan 10 days, LR+ 2.25), and a WBC count greater than20 000 cells per microliter (LR+ 2.17). The authorsconcluded that there is limited utility in obtaining chest radiographs in febrile children without cough [31]. In summary, given the impact of the PCV7 and the available data on occult pneumonia, it seems reasonable to obtain a chest radiograph in well-appearing children withFWS who have cough, fever longer than 3 days, andleucocytosis greater than 15 000/ L (if done). Meningitis The most recent epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in children in the post-PCV7 era is provided by Tsai et al [32] based on an extensive review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1994-2004). They found a 66%decrease in the average annualized rate of pneumococcalmeningitis in children younger than 2 years and a 51.1%decrease in mortality. An estimated 1822 cases ofmeningitis in children younger than 5 years wereprevented because of PCV7. In addition, there was a 43% decrease in overall rates of meningitis in children younger than 2 years. They also documented a 17.5%,54%, and 50% decrease in meningitis due meningococcal meningitis, PCV7, along of peripartum antibiotics and use of meningococcal vaccine, hassubstantially reduced the incidence of bacterial meningi- tis. In well-appearing children with FWS, routine evaluation of meningitis by a lumbar puncture cannotbe recommended. Occult UTI Urinary tract infection is the most common cause of SBIin children with FWS, and the prevalence of UTI has notchanged because of PCV7 vaccine. This topic is furtherdiscussed elsewhere in this journal, and a recent223 Fever in the toddler-aged childcomprehensive evidence-based review on the evaluation and management of febrile UTI was published by Shaikhet al [33]. Guidelines for the Management of FWS The earliest version of management guidelines published simultaneously in 1993 in Pediatrics and Annals ofEmergency Medicine were based on consensus opinionsof an expert panel and on the available evidence [2]. These guidelines were revised by Baraff [34] in 2000. In these guidelines, screening urine analysis was recommended(based on age and sex) for all children with a fever greaterthan 39\u00b0C. For children who had not received PCV7 and had a temperature of 39.5\u00b0C, the recommendations were to obtain a complete blood count. Empirical treatment withceftriaxone was recommended if the WBC count was atleast 15 000 cells per microliter (absolute neutrophil count10 000). A chest radiograph was recommended in children with a WBC count greater than 20 000 cells permicroliter, an oxygen saturation of less than 95%, orclinical evidence of respiratory disease. In 2003, the American College of Emergency Physicians Clinical Policy Committee revised the guidelines based on a comprehen-sive review of literature and graded recommendationsbased on the strength of evidence [28]. They recommend empiric antibiotic therapy for all febrile non -toxic-appear- ing children with a WBC count of at least 15 000 cells permicroliter. Interestingly, the temperature cutoff in theAmerican College of Emergency Physicians guideline is lower at 39\u00b0C; and there is no mention of the immuniza- tion status of the child, although the preceding discussiondoes comment on the substantial impact of PCV7 vaccine.Apart from the fact that there is variation amongpractitioners [35], there are several guidelines that reflect local consensus opinion and practitioner comfort in theevaluation of a child with FWS. Children's Hospital ofBoston's guideline [36] recommends obtaining urine studies (analysis and cultures) if the febrile well-appearingchild is older than 6 months and has received 3 doses ofboth Hib and PCV7 vaccine. They recommend obtainingblood (complete blood counts, blood cultures) and urine(analysis and urine cultures) only if the temperature is atleast 39\u00b0C and if the infant's immunizations are incompleteor if the patient's age is younger than 6 months. Empiricantibiotics are recommended for WBC counts of at least 15 000 cells per microliter, and chest radiographs are recommended if the WBC counts are at least 20 000 cellsper microliter. The algorithm suggested in the evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for FWS in children 2 to36 months old at Children's Hospital Medical Center inCincinnati is even less conservative [37]. The guidelines recommend screening for OB if the child has an incompletePCV7 series for age (the child does not have to have all3 doses of PCV7), is ill appearing, has fever of at least 40\u00b0C,or has meningococcal contacts. In summary, there are several available management guidelines that reflect varying concerns about the pre- valence and likelihood of identifying SBI in the evaluation of the well-appearing child with FWS. FWS\u2014Old Concerns Replaced With New Conjugate vaccines provide serotype-specific protection.They also reduce carriage of vaccine-related serotypes thatare often antibiotic resistant in the vaccinated individual, aswell as in the population at large through herd immunity.However, by reducing the carriage of vaccine-relatedserotypes, an ecologic niche is left open that could be filledby nonvaccine serotypes [7]. The first report documenting a rise in IPD by nonvaccine serotypes was in a multicenter study of children requiring hospitalization for IPD by the United States Pediatric Multicenter Pneumococcal Surveil-lance Group. Kaplan et al [38] noted a rise in disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes (types 15 and 33) in childrenyounger than 2 years (the nonvaccine serotypes accountedfor 37.6% of isolates in 2002 compared with of isolatesin the pre-PCV7 era). In a population-based studydescribing the temporal trends of IPD in Utah, Byington et al [6] documented a significant increase in the proportion of severe IPD and empyema cases due to non- PCV7 serogroups. al [39] demonstrated an 82% increase in IPD in a highly vaccinated cohort ofAlaskan children younger than 2 years. Importantly, therewas a 140% rise in IPD in the post-PCV7 era nonvaccineserotypes, serotype 19A accounting for 28.3% of allinvasive disease [39]. Others have shown a rise in IPD due to serogroups 15 and 33 [40]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance data released in 2008showed that the largest absolute rate increase in non-PCV7serotype IPD was observed among children younger than 1year (10.8 cases per 100 000). Among children youngerthan 5 years, the incidence of serotype 19A IPD increasedfrom 2.6 cases in 1998-1999 to 9.3 cases per 100 000 in2005, the largest increase for any 1 serotype. In addition, in 2005, 40% of IPD among children younger than 5 years was caused by serotype 19A. Although PCV7 serotype inci-dence rates continued to decline through 2005 for allchildren younger than 5 years, overall IPD rates plateauedduring 2002-2005 [23]. The recent documented increase in antibiotic resistance among nonvaccine strains may be occurring because of\"serotype switching \"\u2014an ability of the pneumococcus to incorporate parts of capsules of other serotypes [41]. Thus, the potential exists for a vaccine serotype clone that isresistant to an antibiotic to switch its capsule to anonvaccine serotype and evade the protective effects ofPCV7 [7]. In particular, 19A variants have emerged as of nonvaccine serotype multiresistant IPD.224 P. Mahajan, R. StanleyComplicated Pneumonia The most common complications of pneumonia in children include necrosis, empyema, parapneumoniceffusion, and lung abscess. Until the introduction of thepneumococcal conjugate vaccine, S pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated bacteria in children with compli-cated pneumonia; but S aureus has become the most frequently isolated bacteria since 2000 [42]. A multicenter, retrospective study involving 8 children's hospitals in theUnited States examined 368 hospitalized children withpneumococcal pneumonia before the widespread use of thepneumococcal vaccine. Of these, 133 were complicatedcases and required thoracostomy drainage. The frequency of complicated cases increased during the study period from 23% in 1994 to 53% in 1999. Ninety-eight percent ofall patients recovered completely from the pneumonia[43]. A retrospective study published in 2005 looked at 230 cases of pediatric complicated community-acquiredpneumonia pre- and post -universal pneumococcal vacci- nation in the United States (1999-2000 vs 2001-2002) andfound that (1) the number of patients admitted with empyema (per 10 000 admissions) had decreased from 23 to 12.6; (2) the prevalence of S pneumoniae had decreased from 66% (29 of 44) to 27% (4 of 15); and (3) S aureus had become the most common pathogen isolated (18% vs60%), with 78% of those being methicillin resistant [42]. Issues Surrounding the Evaluation and Managementof FWS in the Post-PCV7 Era Screening tests lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity in detecting OB. Although appearance of the child, height of fever, and young age increase the likelihood of SBI, theyare by themselves insufficient for diagnosis. Screening testssuch as a peripheral WBC count cutoff of 15 000/ Lh a v e been traditionally used as predictors of SBI, but recentliterature continues to indicate that the WBC is neithersensitive nor specific (sensitivities have ranged from 45% to 80% and specificities from 67% to 79% in different studies) [44]. It is also important to recognize that traditionally accepted WBC cutoffs may no longer berelevant as the epidemiology of OB shifts away fromS pneumoniae . Twelve percent to 16% of all children with meningococcal disease have an unsuspected infection, andKuppermann et al [19] suggest that routine screening of febrile children for meningococcal bacteremia with com- plete blood counts is not useful. et al [45] retrospectively reviewed non- typhi Salmonella bacteremia and showed that 54% had a median WBC count of 10 000/ L. The addition of biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and interleukins to routine screen-ing tests for detecting SBIs has been unsuccessful inimproving the clinician's ability to evaluate well-appearingfebrile infants for SBI [44].There is lack of agreement between published guidelines, and substantial practice pattern variationexists in the evaluation of the febrile child. A survey conducted among 7500 pediatricians and 7500 ED physicians in 2004 regarding management of 2 hypothe- tical cases of well-appearing febrile children (ages 7 and20 months) with and without pneumococcal vaccinedocumented general reduction in the need for tests andempiric antibiotics attributed to the perceived impact ofthe vaccine [35]. This study also documented that there was a significant practice pattern variation in theevaluation and management of the febrile child based on the clinical setting, office vs ED. The diagnosis of bacterial infections in young febrile children is largely dependent on culture of the micro- bial pathogen in the appropriate clinical specimens(cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine, or respiratory secre-tions). However, many pathogens grow slowly orrequire complex media [46]. A significant number of clinically important microbial pathogens remain unrec-ognized because they are resistant to cultivation in the laboratory [47]. Furthermore, 90% of all blood cultures do not grow any organism; and of the approximately 10% that do grow organisms, only half represent truebacteremia (ie, true positives) and half representcontaminants (ie, false positives). The issue of falsepositives (contaminants) cannot be overemphasizedbecause they lead to further testing, use of antibiotics,hospitalization, and iatrogenic complications [48]. All 4 studies in the post-PCV7 era had a higher false-positive blood culture rate than true positives. In fact,the analysis of Herz et al [24] revealed that more than 70% of all blood cultures were contaminants in thepost-PCV7 population and the rate increased withdecreasing age. The 8-year study of Sard et al [25] an 80% false-positive rate; and they identified alow WBC count, lower presenting temperature, and a longer time to culture positivity as predictors for contaminants. They estimated that the cost of reevalu-ating a febrile child with a false-positive blood culturewould be $12 340 for every true-positive blood culturegiven that the rate of false-positive blood cultures hasincreased from 4 times to 7.2 times compared with true-positive cultures [25]. Given the declining rate of OB, it may be no longer cost effective to perform routine screening and treatyoung children with FWS with empiric antibiotics. Lee et al [3] conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis and concluded that if the rate of OB falls below 0.5% withwidespread use of the PCV7, then strategies that useempiric testing and treatment should be eliminated.Yamamoto [49] conducted a decision analysis for febrile children at risk for OB in the post-PCV7 population andconcluded that observing these children without routineblood tests or antibiotics may be the superior manage- ment strategy.225 Fever in the toddler-aged childBecause most children with FWS are likely to have viral etiologies for fever, advances in rapid viral detection technologies have led to increasing use of these assays forevaluation of young febrile infants; and their use is changing management strategies [50-52]. Sharma et al [50] and Bonner et al [51] in their respective studies on febrile children noted that the practitioner's awareness of influenza positivity affected ancillary testing as well asantibiotic use. Febrile children with documented viralinfections had a lower prevalence of SBI, and the authorsrecommend that blood cultures may not be necessary intheir evaluation [52]. Summary The epidemiology of SBI (mainly OB) continues to evolve; and the impact of the 2 conjugate vaccines, Hib and PCV7, has been substantial. The overall prevalence of OB is likelywell below 1%; and routine screening with blood testsshould no longer be recommended because ( a) they are not cost effective, ( b) there is an unacceptably high rate of false- positive blood cultures, ( c) screening tests lack test characteristics that would make them sufficiently discrimi-native, ( d) there is significant practice pattern variation based on age of the child and setting of the practitioner, and(e) advances in rapid viral testing and widespread use of PCV7 are already altering physician behavior. Studies onSBI conducted in the past have used different inclusioncriteria (especially age and temperature), have been retro-spective in nature, have used screening tests inconsistently,and have often been conducted in single or small numbersof academic centers. It is highly unlikely in this age of effective Hib and PCV7 vaccination that a prospective multicenter study that enrolls and consistently evaluates(to eliminate selection and verification bias) febrile childrenwith a battery of comprehensive screening tests will beundertaken. It is our opinion that, as of yet, no singlepublished algorithm in the evaluation of FWS can berecommended. Present evidence suggests that screening forurinary tract infection must be done in well-appearing febrile children (based on age, sex, and circumcision status). Given the prior discussion, the best managementstrategy for well-appearing children with FWS may beobservation without screening tests as long as appropriatefollow-up can be ensured. Age-appropriate immunizationstatus should be an important consideration in the decisionto obtain screening blood tests. The impact of nonvaccineserotypes causing invasive disease is still unclear, but continued surveillance is important. In conclusion, we suggest that a multidisciplinary panel of experts inpediatrics, pediatric emergency medicine, and infectiousdiseases be formed to develop a consensus guideline thattakes the impact of conjugate vaccine, physician and parentpreferences, and evolving epidemiology of SBI into accountand provide recommendations for the evaluation of thewell-appearing child with FWS.Acknowledgment The authors thank Catriona Macardle.
