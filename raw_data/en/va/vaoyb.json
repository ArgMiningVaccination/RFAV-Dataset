In higher education, age stratification is often reinforced in how faculty and staff view traditional vs. nontraditional students. Unfortunately, this reduces the ability of trainees to prepare to work with older adults upon graduation. Age inclusivity has positive outcomes for learning, including improving health, reducing social isolation, and decreasing ageism. The College of Nursing (CON) is an important setting to innovate age inclusivity because of longstanding collaborations across nursing and gerontology and the strong commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion. The team will enhance educational excellence in the College by 1) conducting a needs assessment of age inclusivity, 2) developing training opportunities to improve age inclusivity, and 3) applying for Gerontology Interdisciplinary Program accreditation.

Faculty: [Linda Edelman](https://faculty.utah.edu/u0030842-Linda_S._Edelman_PhD,_MPhil,_RN/hm/index.hml) Dates: 7/1/2019 - 6/30/2024 Utah has one of the fastest growing aging populations. Its 85-years and older population is projected to increase 8-fold between 2006 and 2050. As a result, the use of long-term services and supports (LTSS) is increasing and the capacity and competencies of the interprofessional (IP) LTSS workforce, families, and caregivers will need to be expanded to provide value-based, person-centered care. The purpose of the Utah Geriatric Education Consortium is to enhance healthcare provider workforce capacity to integrate geriatrics and primary care outcomes of older adults utilizing LTSS, and to increase patient, family, and caregiver engagement across rural and urban Utah. To achieve this purpose, we will expand on our successes over the past 4 years in building sustainable partnerships with HealthInsight, our quality improvement organization, and add new long-term care (LTC) and LTSS primary care partners, including home health/hospice and assisted living.

Respite (defined as \"time away from caregiving\") is the most often requested service by caregivers. Our project uses a community-engaged design process and a scientifically-rigorous pilot study to evaluate an intervention to coach caregivers on how to maximize the benefits associated with respite time. This type of online-delivered intervention is inherently scalable to real world practice and is expected to help caregivers maintain their overall wellbeing over time, so they can continue providing the estimated 18.4 billion hours of unpaid care with an annual economic value of $232 billion.

Evidence shows that delay in HF symptom recognition and poor self-management are associated with unplanned emergency department visits and rehospitalizations. Clinical trials aimed at preventing rehospitalization using telemonitoring have shown limited utility suggesting that monitoring physical changes alone may not be sufficient to maintain stability of HF patients at home. A recent cancer study has demonstrated that patients receiving cancer chemotherapy achieved a 40% reduction in symptoms using Symptom Care at Home (SCH), a computer-interface telephonic interactive voice response system pairing patient-reported symptoms with automated real-time, self-management coaching. While a few HF studies have used interventions that monitored symptoms, no studies have tested a system that monitors and provides real-time, self-management coaching tailored to specific patient-reported outcomes(PRO). The objective of this study is to pilot an adaption of the SCH system to HF resulting in preliminary data to support a fully-powered randomized control trial to test an adapted SCH-HF system that could be widely disseminated. Specific Aims over two-parts are: Aim 1] Tailor the real-time self-management coaching system to integrate HF symptom monitoring and self-management coaching into the SCH-HF system; and Aim 2] Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the SCH-HF system. This study is significant because it expands our understanding into HF symptom monitoring and management using PRO in the home setting. The proposal is innovative because it integrates HF clinician and patient perspectives to develop a daily home monitoring and real-time self-management coaching system.
