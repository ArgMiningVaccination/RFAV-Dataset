Satisfaction with the outcome was limited. The use of alternatives was associated with higher general practice consultation rates, especially among women. Qualitative interviews with users suggested that rapid cures for chronic conditions were rarely expected; rather, an alternative explanation for health problems was sought and a greater sense of autonomy in dealing with them. Negative attitudes towards modern medicine arose from perceptions of excessive technological intervention and iatrogenic disorders arising from long term drug treatment.
