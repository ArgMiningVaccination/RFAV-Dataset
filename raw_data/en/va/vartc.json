Ronninger, Roche, 2004Risks in Practice The following slides are based on the experiences of a QCTN member, Q-Gen Pty Ltd, a company established in 2002 as a cGMP manufacturing unit of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research Q-Gen was licensed by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration in May 2003 for the Production of Sterile Human TherapeuticsBiologics from Bench to Bedside fail fast and fail cheaply \"easy to say harder to do\" the difference between what we know and what we know we don't know and can't afford to find out .... yetProduct Knowledge What the regulators would like to believe Product development to enable clin ical studiesProduct development to enable Registration and commercialization Development TimeRegistration Reproduced from Jeffery Blumenstein Pfizer Global research & Development Slides - A New CMC Paradigm for Product QualityProduct Knowledge The reality Product development to enable clin ical studies Development TimeRegistration Reproduced from Jeffery Blumenstein Pfizer Global research & Development Slides - A New CMC Paradigm for Product QualityProduct development to enable registration& commercialisationBiologics from Bench to Bedside fail fast and fail cheaply \"easy to say harder to do\" The Application of Risk ManagementCautious & Calculated Risks How the ICH Q9, fits in Design Process Materials Facilities PatientDistributionManufacturing Q8 Q10Q9 risk consideration throughout design and quality management Reproduced from Jeffery Blumenstein Pfizer Global research & Development Slides - A New CMC Paradigm for Product QualityRisk in Practice Contract Scoping Consideration of the ProductAssay Qualification Analytical Assays Consideration of the ProcessCCPdata mining & comparability Consideration for ReleaseOOS Non Conforming ProductsContract Scoping Assessment of technology Assessment of processes and changes required Assessment of the character of the product and what changes may occur during development Alignment of Clients Budget with expectations Consideration of the risks to our business Ability to deliver Product liability Regulatory compliance Errors and omissions Reputation and track record Consideration of the Product Safety, Potency, Purity, Identity Identification of assays - risk tolerance Assay qualification Minimum usually more then clients expectations and clients budget Standards Stability Risk tolerance Consideration of the Process Scale up- start where you mean to end up! Process optimisation Lack of data and cost of collection Consideration for release Pre-emptive acceptance criteria Out of Specification Results and Quality Review Failed batch vs Clinical need Acceptable Risk Essential to predetermine the companies tolerance for risk Risk provides framework for building quality systems Q10, developing processes and compliance with regulatory guidelines Q9.Documenting Risk Strategy It is as important if not more important to document what you decide to do as what you decide not to do. A thoroughly documented choice is a defendable position an undocumented one is just something you forgot to do!!Example 1 Decision to release contaminated material into a dendritic cell vaccine Patient derived raw material contamination rate 50% Rejection of material doubling th e cost of the trial, halving the recruitment rate Concern over improper handling of material vs intrinsic contamination (dissection of lymph node). Risk acceptable Documentation - investigation report, hypothesis, risk assessment, risk minimisation of improper handling concerns, change control, bioburden testing, changes to procedures and specifications, notification to regulator.Example 2 Decision not to do viral evaluation on cellular product for patient group with clinical life expectancy of < 6 months Consideration of clinical need vs risk Risk assessment Risk tolerance decision Risk minimisation strategies Full risk strategy documented as part of technical masterfile. Benefits to a Quality Ri sk Management System Supports a science based decision making process Focuses resources based on risks to patients Avoids restrictive and unnecessary requirements and costs associated with unrealistic expectations on early phase development. Recognisable process and documentation format for both industry and regulatorsAcknowledgment The assistance of Ms Allison McLean, CEO of Q-Gen Pty Ltd, in the preparation of this presentation and provision of the two \"Case Studies\", drawn from company records, is gratefully acknowledged.
