Amy Derksen, ND www.holistichealingarts.orgSupporting the Kidneys This organ is an absolute must to support if you are chelating metals!!! Water/hydration Homeopathic Drainage blends Neural therapy or acupuncture Electrolytes added to all fluids Tapping on K27 whenever taking supplements Cilantro rubbed topically over the kidneys (metals) Ion Cleanse foot baths Amy Derksen, ND www.holistichealingarts.orgLiver Support (Suspect this with sluggish bowels and in general overly sensitive to any treatments) Homeopathic drainage blends Milk thistle Castor oil packs over the liver with heat for up to 50 min daily NAC Phosphatidyl Choline (oral or IV) Glutathione (start slow ideally 1 hour from meds Chlorella -bigger doses are more binding. Typically 1000 mg or more per 50 lbs body weight Chia seeds -1 Tbls soaked in water for 30-60 min daily Acacia Fiber -has almost no taste or texture Bentonite liquid -1 Tbls in large glass of water up to 2x/day Charcoal -this is the # 1 suggestion when people call the office in crisis. If it constipates, chase it 30 min later with magnesium citrate Zeolite Powders -1 IMD are very useful especially when the person has a high metal load Amy Derksen, ND www.holistichealingarts.orgHerx Support (die off management) Epsom salt baths -2 cups in the tub or 1 cup in a leg soak. Good source of magnesium. Baking soda baths with up to 8 cups VitCin frequent doses -with each meal and at bedtime, natural anti - histamine Anti -inflammatories or anti -histamines Glutathione IV or large oral liposomal doses Homeopathic drainage : Pekana detox water magnesium citrate or oxide Aloe gel or capsules (good if inflamed) Address dysbiosis castor oil packs over abdomen Colonics orenemas High doses of probiotics or saccharomyces Rule out food allergies (especially dairy) Digestive enzymes Amy Derksen, ND www.holistichealingarts.orgDetox Therapies My Patients Love Ozone sauna to move water soluble toxins Ionic foot baths -typically 2 days on, 1 day off lymph drainage Dry skin brushing castor oil packs Colonics Coffee enemas Neural therapy Far IR Sauna fatty acid balance, anti-inflammatories, anti-oxidants, homeopathy, LDN, transfer factors Boosting the immune system VitD-doses up to 20,000IU daily may be needed in climates like Seattle. Per DrMercola's latest research typical dose needed is 35 IU/ lband I find serum level goal is 60 -80 for best effect. Average adult needs are around 8000IU daily and kids 50IU/ lb(good idea to lab test regularly to get a good sense of proper dose) -balance this with at least 1mg of K2 for best tolerance and effect. Daily lower doses are found to be more beneficial in some cancer studies than single large doses for long -term health. Bruce W. Hollis, PhD, Medical University of South Carolina shares the results of a recent trial including identifying the vitamin D level needed to protect the prostate gland. Series: \"Vitamin D for Public Health - Integrating Sunshine, Supplements and Measurement for Optimal Health 2014\" [Health and Medicine] Amy Derksen, ND www.holistichealingarts.orgTransfer Factors Transfer Factor products can be produced to help promote healthy natural killer cells, macrophage, T -cells, and cell division Transfer Factors work on the cellular (TH 1) immunity level and they are often used to promote a balanced immune system (Th1/Th2). This results in overall less inflammation and symptoms and more immune system resilience. Different formulations can be made to target specific organisms like Lyme, EBV, Strep, Mycoplasma, Bartonella .... We have found them particularly helpful for patients trying to get off antibiotics or who are having mild symptoms and want to avoid antibiotics in the first placeBoosting the immune system High dose vitA-100,000 IU daily for 7 days or up to 400,000IU daily for 2 days repeated no more than once a month BIG anti -viral boost!!!!! * Be CAREFUL, since prolonged dosing like this is toxic to the liver.... \"Children with Starving Brains: A Medical Treatment Guide forAutism , MD www.holistichealingarts.orgBoosting the immune system Mushroom extracts -more exotic mushrooms tend to be better.

Used for 6-12 months to help heal leaky gut. Start with 1mg at bedtime and slowly work up to a max of 2mg QID before meals and at bedtime. LDN Low Dose Naltrexone -www.lowdosenaltrexone.org - www.LDNScience.org -In low doses of 4.5 mg or less this acts as an immune modulator to reduce auto -immunity and inflammation, help energy and boost immune function like natural killer cells. For sensitive individuals or known auto - immunity, start with 1.5 mg each night at bedtime and increase by 1.5mg increments monthly up to 4.5 mg. Some patients are needing as much as 12 or 25mg for effect. Low-dose Naltrexone for Disease Prevention and Quality of Life. Med Hypotheses. 2009 Mar; 72(3): 333 -7. Amy Derksen, ND www.holistichealingarts.orgLDA/LDI LDA is low dose antigen therapy used to calm and stabilize the immune system in response to allergic and auto -immune reactions triggered by foods, environmental inhalants and chemicals. -Re-trains the T -reglymphocytes to promote immune tolerance -Repeated as injections or sublingual drops every 7 -8 weeks LDI is a similar low dose immunotherapy used in a similar way to promote immune tolerance and a healthier overall response to organisms like Lyme, Bartonella , Babesia , Viruses, gut pathogens, parasites and even your own body secretions.

Autism Science Digest, Rossignol and Frye, 2011. Amy Derksen, ND www.holistichealingarts.orgStarting labs I find most diff, chem panel, RBC zinc and magnesium Stool testing Urine organic acid testing (OAT) Metal testing (provoked urine)What you can learn from a CBC high WBC's -points toward an acute response or inflammation Low WBC's chronic point toward KPU concerns (upper 2's, low 3's)-think needs for zinc and B6 Eosinophils -elevation points to allergies and/or parasites Monocytes -elevation points to chronic immune activation and possibly parasites Lymphocytes -elevation points toward viral infections Neutrophils -elevation points toward bacterial concerns MCV (size of RBC's) -if they are large in size then you suspect low B12 or folate . If they are small in size you suspect low iron and/or copper.What you can learn from a chem panel: Low alkaline phos under 50 -big sign of zinc deficiency ALT and AST show signs of liver stress (is your patient tolerating meds ok?) Albumin and protein are good indicators of protein absorption (especially if low, thinking malabsorption ) Low normal CRT is common in kids on the spectrum and adults who are more metal and chemically sensitive -could be an indicator of mitochondrial needs or concerns with how well they can clear metals/chemicalsWhat you learn from an OAT test: B vitamin and folate needs Glutathione status Bacterial/yeast/clostridia overgrowth Neurotransmitter balance (dopamine, serotonin) Quinolinic acid elevation is a marker of brain inflammation Mitochondrial needs Oxalate concerns Ammonia concerns ( orotic from a stool test: Fat absorption/ malabsorption Digestion of proteins and foods Bacterial balance Butyrate levels Propensity toward strep overgrowth Amounts of probiotics thriving or not Markers of inflammation Yeast growth If abnormal bacteria or yeast are found, sensitivity testing is done to see what treatments could be effective Parasites are screened for, but are difficult to find For parasites: -Metemetrix uses a DNA probe in GI Effects test -Diagnostechs uses IgA responses to identify parasites the immune system is responding toAddressing Methylation Defects -Main protocol Folic form of folate that crosses the BBB and concentrated 2 -4 times higher, binds to a folate receptor in the choroid plexus and then is delivered to CSF (ATP dependent) -Folinic -can also cross the BBB (most current research using this form) B12 -Methyl B12 -acts as a methyl donor and has been the form most used over the last few years. Best clinical response has been with nasal or injections. Sublingual next best option. -Hydroxy B12-this is becoming more available and seems to complement the higher doses of 5 -MTHF better -Adenosyl B12-available as lozenges and compounded injections. Good for more sensitive patients with mitochondrial needs. Amy Derksen, ND as P5P (can be added to injections) SamE Taurine (has a very calming effect) when you get methylation working, patients may start to dump toxins. Binders and support of elimination is useful.
