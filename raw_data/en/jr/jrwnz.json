Version 1.0", "date": "2021-06-08", "cleaned_text": "Description This protocol specifically addresses grid connected wind and solar generation projects with a rated electrical capacity of less than 1 MW located at the consumer end of the electric distribution system. Individual projects will yield small volume emissions reductions that cannot be processed as stand-alone offset projects in the Alberta Offset System. The methodology provided in this protocol is for aggregated, distributed renewable electricity projects. Familiarity with and general understanding of distributed energy system operations is required.
