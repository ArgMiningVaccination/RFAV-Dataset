Both practices have roots in vitalism: homeopathy was influenced by Swedenborgianism, while chiropractic has ties to New Thought. They each have elective affinities to esotericism and new age spirituality. Unlike homeopathy, for some chiropractors their practice represents a full religion. Metaphysical ideas are contested in both systems and have caused friction with regular medicine. The practices have had different patterns of international reception. Chiropractic is mainly popular in the English-speaking world, especially the United States. In contrast, homeopathy has fused with healing traditions in many countries. In India, homeopathy was incorporated into Ayurvedic medicine, and in Brazil it became part of several spirit possession religions. In Europe, neither homeopathy nor chiropractic are usually seen as spiritual. "}
