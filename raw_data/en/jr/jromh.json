Accreditation is valuable for Indian hospitals competing for patients who have already decided to travel abroad, but accreditation status probably does not influence a person's initial ch oice to leave the United States. For that decision, the price of medical treatment controls. After a brief introduction to India's medical tourism industry in Part II, Part III of this Article focuses on a notable trend that has emerged in India concurrent with the growth of the medical tourism industry: the increase in public and private efforts to accredit medical facilities on international, national, and even local levels and In dia's use of accredited status as a means of promoting the legitimacy of its medical facilities to foreign consumers. This trend, and the emergence of a \"one-stop shopping\" approach to medical tourism combining Western medicine and India's traditional healing arts, 22 appears to be driven by India's efforts to develop a distinctive brand of medical touris m in the face of stiff regional competition.23 II.

These Medical, or \"M Visas,\" are valid after issuance for the shorter period of one year or the length of treatment. 84 This initial period may be extended further by state governments upon producing a medical certificate or advice by \"reputed/rec ognized/specialized hospitals in the country\" about a particular patient's needs.85 After the first extension, any additional visa extensions require the involvement of the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs.86 In these situations, extensions can only be granted where state governments have made a recommendation and the appropriate supporting medical documentation has been presented.87 If such conditions are satisfied, the patient's M Visa \"will be valid for [a] maximum [of] three entries [into India] during one 80.

It should define the minimum standards of infrastructure (e.g., basic medical equipment), manpower (e .g., minimum staffing levels of qualified doctors, nurses and other manpower) and information (e.g., patient records, display of services and tariffs) required at all types of facilities, whether public or private.

Patient rights must be protected, including confidentiality and privacy. When a patient prepares to leave the hospital and return home to his country, we require that the hospital transfer information to the patient and provide recommendations for follow-up care at home.

[t]hat's always the best alternative. Other than that, there are also hospitals that are ISO certified, as well as certif ied in their own countries. Although many of the doctors overseas are trai ned in either the U.S., the U.K. or Australia, they tend to go back home to work in their respective countries . . . [s]o it's a great situation for them to come here for the training. With that being said, also, many of the hospitals we work with have affiliations here in the U.S. - hospitals such as Johns Hopkins, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic - and these hospitals have associations overseas where they cross-train with the doctors and they share their procedures. And it's a very good way for them to make this global health care issue actually a good alternative for Americans to go abroad. 221 Yet, despite the diverse efforts to allay medical tourists' fears surrounding the quality of medical care in India, the sparse legal remedies for medical malpractice may impede the country's ability to attract American medical tourists in the future.222 One of the primary reasons medical tourists travel to India is the low cost of medical services. This low cost results from Indian doctors having lower labor costs due, in large part, to an almost non-existent malpractice bar.223 Thus, if the incidence of malpractice increased coexistent with the demands of medical tourists to have legal recourse, one of India's main draws for medical tourists, low cost, could be adversely affected. The \"Legal Issues\" link on India's official medical tourism Web site provides limited information on the subject, stating only that \"India meditourism believes in buliding [sic] last ing relations. Unfortunately if any legal disputes come up they shall be subject to Delhi (India) jurisdiction.\" 224 Currently, the only venue for patient complaints for both medical tourists and Indian patients is India's Stat e and National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions, which already has a large backlog of cases.225 The CII, however, is developing a standard contract for medical tourism facilities 221.

Due to legal liabilit y, among other reasons, doctors are generally not eager to inherit problems created by other doctors.230 Medical tourism organizations are working to el iminate post-operative care concerns by establishing pre- and post-operative care networks in the United States for surgeries that are actually perfor med in foreign hospitals. One such program, \"Best of Both Worlds,\" is offered by California-based PlanetHospital.231 This approach has several benefits, including the \"proprietary offering that delivers s avings to PPOs, empl patients,\" to PlanetHospital's Ch ief Executive Officer Rudy Rupak, \"'[p]atients receive care from a world cl ass surgeon from start to finish, only the geography of their surgery changes.'\"233 Consumers have direct access to this program through an employer 's cafeteria plan or through PPOs.234 226.

Several factors will likely influence the indust ry's continued viability. In general, \"[m]ost analyses of India's future see im pediments to future growth that arise from important physical and human constraints: these include poor infrastructure (roads, airports, seapo rts, and power supply), archaic labor laws, the need to privatize its colossa lly unprofitable large public sector firms, and the challenges associated with energy security.\" 235 Kamal Nath, India's Union Commerce and Industry Mi nister, explains that there is \"no shortage of funds,\" as \"many global in vestors were waiting to invest in the country,\" but that further development requires \"a platform or a forum to channelise [sic] these investments.\"236 Despite the costs and benefits of Americans traveling to India for medical care, the trend highlights the complicated current state of healthcare in the United States. 237 Some believe that medical tourism \"'has the potential of doing to the U.S. heal th care system what the Japanese auto industry did to American carmakers.'\"238 Whether the number of American medical tourists will increase in the future will likely be influenced by domestic healthcare reform. Despite the uncertainties about the qual ity of care available in India, at the end of the day, many Americans face the difficult decision of forgoing medical care that is too expensive in the United States or getting treatment in India and accepting whatever risks ma y lurk in India's healthcare system. Nevertheless, those who do go to In dia will likely be looking at quality measures when choosing a hospital. Thus, as Karen Timmons the Chief Executive Officer of JCI said, \"I think it's safe to say that some sort of accreditation is better than none.\"239 ELIZABETH GLUCK* 235. Sumit Ganguly & Manjeet S.
