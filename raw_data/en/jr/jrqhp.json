Before vaccines, many children died from diseases like [measles](/immunization/measles.htm), [pertussis (whooping cough),](/immunization/pertussis.htm) and [Haemophilus influenzae.](/immunization/hib.htm) Vaccines now prevent those diseases and many others. The viruses and bacteria that cause these diseases still exist. Some of these diseases make children very sick. Some are deadly, especially for young children. That's why it's important that every child gets the vaccines they need [on time.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/schedules/reasons-follow-schedule.html) No matter the age of your children, vaccines are one of the best ways you can protect them. Vaccines protect individuals and communities Vaccines give us immunity, or protection, against diseases. When most people are immune, the disease has less chance to spread. This is called community immunity, or herd immunity. The more people who are immune, the better the protection. That's why your child's vaccine can help protect others in the community. Vaccine schedules Vaccine schedules show when and how often we should get vaccines for the best protection. The country's top doctors, public health professionals, and scientists design a vaccine schedule to ensure it is safe and effective. It's based on: - How your child's immune system responds to vaccines at different ages. - How likely your child is to be exposed to a particular disease. Your child should receive vaccines during six different appointments in the first year of life! They need several vaccines between ages 1 and 2. Then your child needs to see the doctor at least once a year between ages two and 19. This ensures your little one is protected from 14 serious diseases at exactly the right time.

Or look up the records yourself on the [Wisconsin Immunization Registry](https://www.dhfswir.org/PR/clientSearch.do?language=en). If your child has missed any vaccines, schedule an appointment to get them caught up. Children's immunity fades over time. They need extra doses of some vaccines. These vaccine boosters ensure the best protection for your child. [Find your child's vaccine record on the Wisconsin Immunization Registry](/immunization/wir.htm) Your baby's immune system isn't fully developed at birth. This puts your baby at risk for infection. Children are exposed to thousands of germs every day. Without vaccines, your child is at risk for serious illness, even death, from diseases caused by these germs. Children need vaccines to strengthen their immune systems (the body's way of fighting germs and preventing disease). Vaccines work with the body's natural defenses to help safely protect us.
