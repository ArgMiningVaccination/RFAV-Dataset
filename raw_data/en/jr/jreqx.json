There is so much information on what to eat, but not so much about how to eat. This is a little guide that covers a bit of both. We are practitioners of Chinese medicine, so we work from a Chinese medical perspective with a lot of alternative Western views thrown in. These words are meant to be informative, encouraging and empowering, not overwhelming and guilt-inspiring. Ideas of what foods are healthy and which are best avoided become like passing fads, there is research to back one way of thinking and then research to back the opposite view a few months later. One of the problems with the research out there is the incentive for doing the research in the first place. In other words, who paid for it? And what do they have to gain if the outcome goes their way? If you trace the financial backing of a study, many times it was paid for by those who stand to benefit the most when the study turns out the way it happens to turn out (i.e. manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and corporations). A little suspicious? The best way to eat, and the best foods, are going to differ greatly from person to person, climate to climate and season to season. Most of these guidelines will be beneficial to anyone who tries them, which is why we talk about the how and not the what. Within these suggestions there is a lot of room to play around. We have given \"basic\" and \"advanced\" tips for any and all who would like to take the information a step further into 1 44 I.

Moderate exercise, ample water and sufficient sleep are other excellent pillars of health. For people who already feel their health is compromised, eliminating certain foods can greatly reduce symptoms and even \"cure\" serious health conditions. This goes much farther than just disease and discomfort in the digestive system. What we eat becomes the very cells that comprise us, so all systems benefit from healthy eating. Because every body is different, you are the expert on your body and what it likes and needs. Many of us have learned to tune out our bodies when they communicate with us. \"Trust your gut\" is an old saying, but made newly relevant in a world of eating fads and nutrition-compromised foods. Tuning back in to the body, paying attention to food and lifestyle reactions will be your best guide to healthy eating and living. Here are some tips and suggestions to get you started. !!! How to Chew Chewing may be the number one most important thing for digestion! Digestion starts in the mouth with enzymes in the saliva breaking down food particles. Food should ideally be chewed and mixed with saliva until it reaches a unified texture in your mouth. Remember your stomach doesn't have teeth! When food isn't broken down properly in the mouth, the Stomach has to do that much more work to extract nutrients out of the food. This is especially important if you have digestive problems. Example: A teacher of ours had an overweight patient who lost 50lbs just by chewing her food well! She didn't change the contents or amount of her diet at all. How Much to Eat It is important to stop eating before you are full in order to not overwhelm the stomach. Filling the stomach 80% is recommended. Eating slowly and chewing well ensures that you will know how full you are before it's too late. Smaller portions and thoroughly chewed food consumed more times throughout the day is the ideal way to get enough nutrients without overwhelming the system. When going out to eat, consider sharing meals or taking half the food home for later, as restaurants in the US generally serve twice the amount of food the stomach can handle. Consider that the empty stomach is about the size of your fist. Not so big! How to Eat Mindfully In Chinese medicine, emotions are a common etiology of disease. Eating while angry, sad, anxious/stressed, distracted or on-the-go can lead to many digestive issues. Mindfulness while eating is a key factor in healthy digestion.

Foods are used as trends, and information is always changing about what you should eat more of and what you should avoid. It is difficult to just feel good about what you eat. But it is so important! Feeling guilty about food can make it more toxic in the body than it naturally would be. Basic Tip: Be easy on yourself. If you have chosen to eat something, feel good or at least neutral about that choice. Advanced Tip: If choosing to eliminate or cut back on certain foods, have a plan before you begin. Try it for a week, two weeks, a month or six weeks and see how you feel at the end of that time. If you slip up and have that food or find you are eating too much of something you are trying to cut back on, think about why before you criticize yourself for it. In fact don't criticize yourself at all, but give it another try or revise your strategy. Extra Advanced Tip: Come up with a little ritual of gratitude to do before eating. This can be a prayer, a moment of mental silence, or thinking about all the people and resources that went in to providing the food. Then try to stay present throughout the eating process. Really taste and feel the texture of your food. For more ideas on mindful eating: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/meditation-in-action-mindful-eating_n_3518612.html !!!

The brain and heart are composed of 73% water, and the lungs are about 83% water. The skin contains 64% water, muscles and kidneys are 79%, and even the bones are made up of 31% water. Those numbers give a new meaning to the systemic effects of dehydration. None of those organs are able to function as well if their water content is low. You can also see why the quality of the water you drink is so important. Water that has been chemically should be filtered. Temperature Drinking cold water requires energy from the body to heat that water to 98.5 degrees. Drinking hot, warm or room temperature water reduces the amount of energy or qi the body has to spend to absorb. Drinking herbal tea, juice, sparking water or the like is not the same as drinking water, but it can help hydrate the body. Caffeine is a diuretic, sparkling water can be acidic to the body and juice has a high sugar content (even if it is natural sugar). Make sure you drink plain water each day. You can add lemon or mint leaves for taste. Drinking Enough Water There's a lot of debate about how much water is enough. It varies depending on your body type, activity of lifestyle, the season and the food you eat. The more you sweat, the more you should drink. A rough guideline follows, but remember, it's pretty difficult to drink too much water and most Americans don't drink anywhere near enough. A formula for deciding how much is enough water is to half your body weight and drink that many ounces a day (example: If you weigh 180 pounds, drink 90 ounces of water a day). A glass of water first thing in the morning helps the colon descend bowel movements. 6 39 Book Recommendations Digestive Health: Gut and Psychology Syndrome: Natural Treatment for Autism, Dyspraxia, ADD, Dyslexia, Depression, Schizophrenia, Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride (also has recipes) Digestive Wellness, Liz Lipsky fourth addition.

At the same time, small sips of warm water or tea can assist with the manual breakdown of food (chewing) and the mobility of food through the esophagus. But make sure the water isn't cold! It is best to drink water 30 minutes before or after a meal. Basic Tip: Drink eight 8 ounce glasses of water throughout the day. Filtered or mineral/spring water is best (A couple good water filters, if you are in the market, are the Berkey filter and the Aqua Rain filter). Advanced Tip: Shoot for a gallon of water a day. Get a gallon jug or a couple of half gallon jars and fill them with filtered or spring/mineral water. Your goal will be to drink that much water in a day. It's a good way to gauge how much water you have had and how you pace your consumption of an adequate day's worth of water. !!! Instructions (cont'd) 8. Line an 8- or 9-inch cake pan with parchment paper. (I just place the cake pan on top of the parchment paper, draw an outline of it, cut it out, and place it into the cake pan.) 9. Pour the oil into the pan atop the parchment paper. 10. Pour the batter into the cake pan atop the oil, smoothing it out evenly. 11. Bake the crust for 15 minutes. 12. Carefully flip the crust over, and bake it for another five minutes. 13. Top the pizza as desired. 14. Bake the pizza for another 5-10 minutes until your toppings have cooked through. 15. Cool, cut, and serve! Cooked Food versus Raw Food The stomach is like a cooking pot. If the body has to warm food up to 98.5 degrees, it is doing that much more work to extract nutrients. Cold and raw food requires more fire from the stomach to break down the nutritive elements. If the stomach is weak, this process can be very taxing. There is great debate over the nutritive value of raw versus cooked food. Raw food contains more nutrients and enzymes, however if it is harder to absorb, the body may excrete foods without absorbing those nutrients at all. For some body types and conditions, raw food is healthy, but from a Chinese medical perspective, raw foods should be kept to a minimum, consumed at room temperature, eaten mostly in the warm months, and eaten fresh/in season. Soaking Seeds, Nuts, Grains and Legumes Many seeds, nuts and oils go rancid or become oxidized, leading to a severe compromise in their nutritive qualities. Rancidity can take place in seeds, nuts and oils before you even purchase them, so it is important to check the quality and date of your product. Stale and expired foods with an oil base shouldn't be used. Soaking seeds, nuts, grains, and legumes deactivates the enzyme inhibitors in dormant grains, making them easier on the digestive system and the nutrients more accessible. The plant makes 8 37 Super Easy Quinoa Pizza Crust This is a delicious way to enjoy pizza and feel great afterwards. You will be surprised by how easy it is to make. Just be sure to follow ALL of the directions, and it will turn out wonderful! Ingredients ! c. quinoa, rinsed and drained \" c. water # t. sea salt 1 t. baking powder 1 T. oil Instructions 1. Rinse the quinoa VERY WELL. 2. Place the rinsed quinoa in a bowl and cover it with water (about one inch above where the quinoa sits). 3. Let the quinoa soak overnight (at least eight hours). 4. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. 5. Drain and RINSE the quinoa VERY WELL again. 6. Place the drained and rinsed quinoa into a food processor along with the water, salt, and baking powder. 7. Process the mix for about two minutes until it is smooth in consistency. (Continued on next page) Beef Jerky Choose a lean cut of meat: sirlon, flank steak, top round, or eye round. Freeze the meat for around 3 hours to make slicing easier Choose thickness of cut based on preference for your jerky, anywhere from 1/20\" to \"\". Trim off extra fat to avoid spoilage and slice the meat. Marinate slices for 10-24 hours in any of the following spices: soy sauce, garlic, hot sauce, ginger, maple syrup, lime, juice, curry. Preheat oven or dehydrator to 165 degrees. Place meat on wire rack or cookie sheet. Cook for 1-3 hours, checking meat every 90 minutes. Flip it over once during cooking. Store in dry, airtight containers in fridge up to 2 weeks. enzyme inhibitors in grains and nuts so that they don't germinate under conditions that don't favor growth. When a seed/grain is soaked in water it senses that it will be able to grow, the enzyme inhibitors are deactivated, and then the enzymes catalyze chemical reactions that promote cell division and sprouting. Enzyme inhibitors will also inhibit our digestive enzymes to some extent, this is why they interfere with digestion, so soaking to disable them will directly benefit digestion. Basic Tip: First purchase fresh, raw, unsalted nuts and seeds for soaking. Put the seeds, nuts, legumes or grains in a bowl or pot and cover with purified water. Additionally, salt, apple cider vinegar or lemon can be added to help break down the husk. Allow to soak for several hours or overnight. If you are going to soak for more than 12 hours, be sure to rinse and add new water. Rinse thoroughly after soaking and cook grains and legumes immediately. For nuts and seeds, lay the drained nuts or seeds out on a tray or baking sheet and put them in a food dehydrator or oven at a very low temperature (as low as your oven will go, 150 degrees is ideal) for several hours, until seeds begin to pop, or nuts feel light and dry. Alternately you can dry-roast (in a cast-iron pan or skillet with no oil) seeds on the stovetop until they become light brown and make little popping sounds. Store them in an airtight container. 36 9 Advanced Tip: For specifics on salt, ACV and lemon and soaking specific grains, legumes, seeds and nuts, and more reasons why to soak, see: http://www.thenourishinggourmet.com/2008/07/soaking-nuts.html http://nourishedkitchen.com/soaking-grains-nuts-legumes/ or Sally Fallon's book Nourishing Traditions Grinding Seeds If seed husks are not broken open by toasting, roasting or soaking, they must be ground slightly. Because the body cannot break down the husks of seeds, they will come out whole in your poop, having passed through without adsorption of nutrients. Using a coffee grinder, blender or food processor for a few seconds to a minute is an easy, quick way to break down the husk (if you keep blending, you can make nut and seed butters or meal to use in baking). Sprouting Grains, Nuts and Seeds Sprouting these foods makes them even more nutritious and they can be used in all the same ways. Sprouting involves soaking overnight and then draining the seeds/nuts/legumes but allowing them to stay wet. Rinse and drain every 8-12 hours for approximately 24 hours.

Buckwheat, hemp and chia are all seeds, which provide morning protein without the heaviness and fatigue that can come for some people after a breakfast of grains. Combine: \" cup chia seeds \" cup hemp seeds # cup buckwheat Soak the seeds in water overnight. Rinse the seeds in the morning and combine with 2-4 cups of water, depending on how thick you like your cereal. Simmer on the stove for 20-30 minutes. You can add fruit, nuts, cinnamon, ginger, sweet potato, almond milk, and/or honey, or you can make it a savory cereal and add miso and veggies or meat. Experiment and enjoy! Bone Broth A highly nourishing, protein and mineral rich food, excellent for intestinal health and rebuilding of the gut lining. A great item to have in the fridge and freezer for easy reheating. You can sip on the broth by itself or add veggies (and meat) to make a quick soup. You can use the broth instead of water for steaming and boiling other foods (adds great flavor and nutrient value). Soup bones can be purchased from most butcheries and grocery stores. The marrow bones are best, where the bone has been cut so you have access to the inside of the bone. Any bones will work. Suggestions are: buffalo, beef, chicken, lamb, turkey, pork. You can crack poultry bones with a hammer before boiling to get to the marrow. Put bones and joints (they can contain meat as well) into a large pot or slow cooker. Cover with water and add salt to taste. Cook on low for 3-24 hours. The longer you cook the bones, the more they will yield. Adding a couple tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to the water and soaking the bones for 30 minutes before turning on the heat will help extract minerals. Add peppercorns to the broth if you wish. Store in the fridge and/or freezer. To use medicinally as a healer of the gut lining, or to rebuild resources post-partum, reheat and drink with every meal. Seeds and nuts are excellent sources of protein and an easy snack. Seeds contain less fat and more protein than nuts, and add fiber into the diet. Fiber is good for many stages of the digestive process, namely helping foods through the digestive tract and facilitating easy and complete bowel movements. !!! When to Eat Eating Breakfast According to Chinese Medicine, each organ system has a time of day when it is strongest. The Spleen and Stomach, responsible for intake of food, extraction of nourishment and the use of nourishment to make blood, fluids and qi, are strongest between 7am and 11am. Many people do not feel hungry in the morning, however from a CM perspective, those are the best hours to eat your protein-rich meal, when the digestive system is strong and ready to process food. If you don't feel hungry in the morning, here are some foods to stimulate the appetite: ginger and other acrid (spicy) herbs, long grain rice, quinoa, chickpeas, hazelnuts. Basic Tip: Morning congee recipe to stimulate the appetite: combine ! cup long grain rice (white, brown or both), # cup quinoa, millet, oat groats, or other whole grains and 10 cups of water in a pot. Add in other ingredients. Ideas: ginger, cinnamon, nuts, seeds, fruit, meats, fennel, fenugreek seed, spices, vegetables, legumes, pretty much anything you like! 34 11 Cook on low for 6-8 hours, until a porridge-like consistency is reached. Advanced Tip: Put all ingredients and water in a crockpot on low before bed and wake up to hot cereal for breakfast. Eat this 5 days a week to stimulate digestion. Add Chinese herbs like Huang Qi (Astragalus), Da Zao (Chinese dates), Gou Qi Zi (Goji berries), Long Yan Rou (Longan fruit), He Zhi Ma (Black sesame seeds),and He Tao Ren (walnuts) to the congee with other ingredients to boost qi and blood. Another Approach: For some people, grains are too heavy in the morning. You will know this if you feel tired or foggy headed or have trouble concentrating after eating, or if your digestion feels sluggish. For people like this, or people with diabetic tendencies, proteins and vegetables are best in the morning. Greens and eggs, sausage and sweet potato (not so good for diabetics) or squash, or veggie and meat soups are examples. One idea is to put sweet potatoes or squash in the slow cooker on low overnight and wake up to a steamy and succulent addition to your protein. Poaching eggs keeps the grease down for those who feel weighted down by too much oil in the morning and you can boil your greens in bone broth. Leftovers It is tempting to cook a large amount of food at one time and then eat it over a few days. This is, in fact, an excellent way to plan for busy days. But food Squash Pancakes A simple and easy breakfast or snack. Grate 1-2 summer squashes into a bowl Add a healthy scoop of almond butter (or sunflower/peanut/cashew/pumpkin seed butter) Add 1-2 eggs Salt and pepper to taste I like to add walnuts, but you can vary it with many ingredients and spices Stir the ingredients into a batter. Heat a skillet on the stove and add butter, ghee or olive/coconut/sesame oil. When the skillet is hot, fry up the batter like pancakes. You can top them with butter, maple syrup, jam, yogurt or eat them plain! 12 33 Seed balls This is a delicious recipe model to which you can add your own ingredients. Makes a fun and easy, protein-rich snack. Ingredients (with their Chinese medical contributions attached): Sesame seed: nourish Liver blood and Kidney jing Flax seed: nourish Liver blood Walnuts: have a warming effect on Kidney, nourish brain Pecans: nourish Kidney yin Honey: assimilates into blood quickly, tonifies yin Brown rice syrup: to help hold it together Cinnamon: for flavor, circulation, fights off colds Goji berries: berries associated with Liver, enriches Kidney yin, nourishes Liver blood Dates: Nourish blood Almond butter In a food processor, combine equal portions of the seeds with enough nut butter, dates honey and/or brown rice syrup to create a thick, doughy texture. Roll the dough into balls. At this stage you can dust the balls with unsweetened cocoa powder or cinnamon so they don't stick together and look like truffles. Variations: Any dried fruit, nut or seed can be added to these to create different flavors. You can also try different kinds of nut and seed butter. Get creative with it. It's hard to go wrong! 32 13 begins to lose its nutrient value and grow invisible mold after 24 hours in the refrigerator, so consider freezing portions of food for future use if you want it to last more than a day or so. Eating Late The last meal of the day should be 2-3 hours before bed at the latest. Eating late at night can interfere with sleep. The body is not able to rest when it has to continue processing food. Snacking Snacking can be the downfall of a healthy diet. Especially for busy people, it is hard to find easy, portable snacks that are good for you. At the end of this guide you will find some recipes for healthy snacks. Here are a few suggestions: ! trail mix that you make yourself with nuts, seeds and dried fruit without sugar added ! vegetable chips made in the dehydrator ! beef jerky made in the dehydrator without sugar or preservatives ! hummus and lightly steamed veggies ! apple slices with almond butter ! lightly salted seaweed ! miso soup ! hard boiled eggs ! baked sweet potatoes, winter squash with cinnamon How to Balance Flavors In Chinese Medicine the twelve internal organs correspond to the five elements and each element has a flavor association. The flavor can tonify the associated organs, but too much of that flavor harms those organs. For example, sour flavored things are associated with the wood element and the Gall Bladder and Liver. Sour foods resonate with those organs, but too much of them can damage the Liver or Gall Bladder. Balancing the flavors within a meal and throughout the day assists all the organs without taxing any of them. Another good example is sugar cravings. The Stomach and Spleen are associated with the earth element and the sweet flavor. A weakness in the Spleen and/or Stomach can result in sugar cravings, but sugar is very dampening in the system and when overused actually makes the Spleen and Stomach struggle to digest. Good examples of sweet foods that nourish the Spleen and Stomach are sweet potatoes, squash and grains. These foods might satisfy a craving for sugar without damaging the Spleen and Stomach the way sugar-filled foods can. Sweet: Earth; Spleen and Stomach. Sweet foods: grains, legumes, most meats and dairy products, most fruit Sour (astringent): Wood; Gall Bladder and Liver. Sour foods include lemon, lime, sauerkraut, hawthorn, vinegars, leeks (sour and pungent) sour and sweet: olives, aduki beans, raspberries 14 31 Recipes Cooking Oil Blend This is a simple oil bend that is well balanced, has a neutral flavor and can be cooked at high temperatures or be used uncooked in salads. The coconut oil helps with metabolism and immunity and will stay liquid when mixed with the other oils. 1 cup of coconut oil, gently melted 1 cup of expeller-expressed or cold-pressed sesame oil 1 cup of extra-virgin olive oil Bitter: Fire; Small Intestine and Heart. Bitter foods: lettuce, rye, coffee, chocolate, dandelion leaf and root, burdock leaf and amaranth, papaya Salty: Water; Kidney and Bladder. Salt foods include seaweeds, millet, barley, soy sauce, miso, salt pickles Spicy (pungent): Metal; Lungs and Large Intestines; there are warm and cool pungents, here are some examples of both. Warm: rosemary, garlic, onion, ginger, black pepper, cinnamon. Cool: Mint, radish, marjoram !!! Sugar (Imbalance of the sweet flavor) Many prepared and preserved foods contain high amounts of sugar, because it is addictive and food companies know it. Crackers, dressings, sauces and mixes often have sugar added when it is unnecessary. Check ingredients/labels for sugar - it's in everything! Other names for sugar: Brown sugar, Cane crystals, Cane sugar, Corn sweetener, Corn syrup, Crystalline fructose, Dextrose, Evaporated cane juice, Organic evaporated cane juice, Fructose, Fruit juice concentrates, Glucose, High-fructose corn syrup, Honey, Agave nectar, Invert sugar, Lactose, Maltose, Malt syrup, Molasses, Raw sugar, Sucrose, Sugar, Syrup see the 50 names for sugar at... http://www.wellnessroadtrip.com/information-stops/50-names-for-sugar/ 15 30 Insulin Resistance/Metabolic Syndrome/Type II Diabetes/Obesity: Insulin resistance and diabetes is at epidemic proportions worldwide. It is no longer just a problem of industrialized nations, but as our way of eating (sugar and carb-heavy meals) and living (stress and pollution) spreads to the far corners of the world, so do our diseases. There is a lot of information out there about diabetes and if you suspect you may be pre-diabetic, consult a health practitioner. Preventing diabetes is much easier than treating it once you have it. Adherence to a low carbohydrate, low sugar diet, with regular exercise and the inclusion of supplements has been shown to lower blood sugar levels exponentially. This is just a brief description of some of the more common digestive complications out there. We could write a whole zine on each, including more comprehensive descriptions of symptoms and treatments, so please do your own research, see your acupuncturist, naturopath, integrative medicine doctor or nutritionist if you think you have one of these conditions. !!! Some products like nut butter and dried fruits have two options on the grocery store shelf, one with and one without sugar added. Opt for the one without the extra sugar. Many of these foods are sweet on their own. Naturally Occurring Sugar Versus Added Sugar Sugars that are naturally occurring are balanced within a food. Examples are fruits, juices, some vegetables and grains. \"Added\" sugars can be any form of sweetener that does not occur naturally within the food and alters its digestibility. Sugar Substitutes Some sugar substitutes are natural (stevia) and some are formaldehyde-based (aspartame). The less a sweetener is processed, the easier it is for the body to absorb. Sugar alcohols (erythritol, glycerol- also known often used in low carbohydrate/low sugar foods. They can have a laxative effect and cause other digestive problems. More importantly, the body does not recognize these substances as food and so they can contribute to multiple physical and mental illnesses. They contain fewer calories/less sugar, but taste less sweet and so often more is used, defeating the purpose of the substitution. Be sure to read labeling to check calorie, carbohydrate and sugar amounts and avoid sugar alcohols when possible. 16 29 IgG Food Allergies: Very common and shifting all the time, thought to be caused by leaky gut, responsible for minor to major allergic reaction in many forms. Fructose Malabsorption: Some people are unable to absorb free fructose and chains of fructose (called fructans) in the small intestine unless they are balanced with glucose molecules. The fructose is left to ferment in the intestines causing gas, bloating and a prime environment for candida. For more info: http://sacfs.asn.au/download/SueShepherd_sarticle.pdf Low Hydrochloric acid: HCl is the stomach's natural acid, needed for the breakdown of food into molecules. As people age their bodies make less HCl, so many people over the age of 50 are deficient and have trouble digesting as a result. For more info: http://empoweredsustenance.com/heal-low-stomach-acid-naturally/ Gut and Psychology Syndrome: Many links have been made between the neurons in the brain and the neurons in the gut lining. Kids with autism almost always have accompanying digestive problems. Often for issues like ADD, ADHD, depression and even schizophrenia, a GAPS diet can reduce symptoms significantly. For more info: www.gaps.me, Gut and Psychology Syndrome: Natural Treatment for A.D.D., Dyslexia, A.D.H.D., Depression, Schizophrenia by Natasha Campbell-McBride 17 28 Natural sugars found in the context of whole foods are easiest on the system. Sugar found in fruit, honey, grains and plants is more digestible for most people. For example maple syrup, honey and molasses contain minerals that help the body digest sugar. Combining sugars and starches (which immediately become sugar in the body) with fiber and/or protein slows down the absorption of sugar so blood sugar doesn't spike the same way. Key cultural examples of such combinations are baked potato with sour cream or butter, apples with cheese or nut butter, and wine and cheese. *High fructose corn syrup is actually made in a lab and is much sweeter than real sugar or corn syrup. It spikes blood sugar and insulin levels to give a much higher risk for people with diabetes and hyperlipidemia. It is highly recommended to avoid foods with high fructose corn syrup. Many autoimmune symptoms can be greatly reduced or cured simply by treating a leaky gut. The intro GAPS diet, mentioned below, is excellent for healing leaky gut. Parasites: Generally from consuming unclean food and/or water. Can go undetected but proliferate in the GI tract for years, weakening the system. IBS: Irritable Bowel Syndrome, basically a blanket diagnosis for digestive irregularity existing for more than 3 months, often brought on by stress and poor eating habits. IBD: Inflammatory Bowel Disease Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis- Autoimmune in nature, ulcers and polyps and bleeding in the digestive tract. This usually presents as severe digestive upset with cramping, bleeding and food intolerance. Celiac Disease: An autoimmune condition in which exposure to gluten causes an inflammatory reaction in the small intestine with interferes with the absorption of nutrients and causes mild to severe symptoms in the digestive tract, skin and other systems. Lactose Intolerance: Lactose is a type of sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Lactose intolerance develops when the small intestine does not make enough of an enzyme called lactase. The body needs this enzyme to digest lactose. 18 27 9 Reasons to Avoid Sugar 1) Sugar consumption has a strong negative impact on the immune system. At a blood sugar level of 120 and above, the body's ability to destroy viruses and bacteria is reduced by up to 75%. As little as 20 grams of sugar has the capacity to compromise immune function for the 4-6 hours following ingestion. Recent studies have shown that long-term daily ingestion of sugar raises the risk of developing cancer by as much as 60%. 2) Sugar consumption depletes minerals from the body tissues, skeleton, and teeth. Mineral depletion occurs from sugar consumption in several ways. Most obviously, sugar represents \"empty\" calories in the diet thereby reducing daily nutrient intake. In addition, sugar upsets absorption of nutrients that we do eat by compromising the integrity of our digestive tract. Finally, a high sugar diet promotes inflammation and oxidative stress that out body has to counteract by pulling neutralizing minerals out of our bony stores and teeth. 3) Sugar consumption leads to weight gain and cardiovascular disease. Unless the fructose from sugar consumption is immediately used as fuel, the liver stores it as fat. Fat is transported away from the liver into peripheral fat stores by LDL and VLDL (types of cholesterol), raising the risk for cardiovascular disease. Oxidative stress from high blood-glucose compounds this problem by creating inflammation along the walls of the arteries. respiratory issues can be signs that something is off in the gut. When the digestive tract is inflamed, ulcerated, overburdened or weak, it cannot absorb the nutrients, proteins, minerals, vitamins and amino acids it needs to thrive. Here is a brief blurb on some of the more common digestive complications that often go undiagnosed. Candida: Candida is yeast-like fungus that grows naturally in the GI tract. A healthy system, full of its own positive gut bacteria can keep candida in balance. But if antibiotics that kill off the body's bacteria are taken or a sugar and carb-heavy diet (candida's favorite foods) is consumed, the balance is thrown off and candida proliferates and takes over. It can even spread to the genitourinary system (\"yeast\" infections), the skin, lungs, mouth and anus. It weakens the immune system and can lead to autoimmune disease. Leaky Gut: When the intestinal lining is weak or crippled with candida, the connection between epithelial cells that line the intestinal walls can separate, allowing undigested foods into the bloodstream. The body detects these cells and attacks them as foreign objects. Some of those cells are proteins and the body can confuse its own proteins for those undigested food cells, attacking them and creating an autoimmune response. 26 19 4) Sugar is addictive. Sugar consumption stimulates the \"reward\" centers of the brain by initiating a surge of dopamine release. This effect is also seen with the ingestion of cocaine, opiates, alcohol, amphetamine, and nicotine. In addition, sugar promotes the release of endorphins, which create a sense of euphoria and increase the likelihood of addiction. 5) Sugar causes depression. Because the brain relies on a stable supply of glucose for normal functioning, rapidly rising and falling blood glucose significantly undermine its functioning. Depression, anxiety, aggression, and fatigue are all side effects of sugar consumption because the brain struggles to adapt to the highs and lows in blood sugar provoked by rapid absorption of glucose from the gut. 6) Sugar consumption leads to insulin resistance and can pave the way for gestational or type 2 diabetes. The accumulation of fat in the liver following excess sugar consumption is a trigger for the body to begin \"ignoring\" insulin, the hormone that drives sugar into our cells. As insulin resistance worsens over time, type 2 diabetes develops. Complications of diabetes are systemic and can include cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, poor wound healing, and neuropathy. Examples might be miso, kale, seaweed, soup bones for bone broth and hormone and antibiotic free meat. Advanced Tip: Take the advice from the Basic Tip. Also avoid impulse buys, processed snack foods and desserts. Avoid the foods you are trying to cut out of your diet. If they are not in your home, they are much harder to eat! Check ingredients on all the things you buy until you know which products contain the foods you want to be putting in your body. Label Reading Tips: http://drhyman.com/downloads/ReadingLabels.pdf !!! Some Digestive Complications For some people, just eating well and cutting back on sugar and carbohydrates isn't enough. Because of the way food and our environment have changed in the last fifty years, digestive complications are becoming more common. Very common, in fact. Food allergies, autoimmune disease and symptoms, arthritic conditions, mood, energy, neurological, immunological, cardiovascular, adrenal and hormonal issues can all stem from the way we eat. Just because a person doesn't have digestive symptoms doesn't mean they are free from these conditions. Even contracting common colds frequently, having tooth decay, skin problems or 25 20 7) Sugar strongly interferes with digestive health by favoring the growth of intestinal yeast and slowing the passage of food through the intestine. Overgrowth of yeast leads to permeability of the gut wall and undigested proteins can \"leak\" into the blood stream. The immune system reacts to foreign protein in the blood, leading to food allergies and setting the stage for auto-immune diseases. 8) Sugar consumption by children is associated with learning disabilities, anxiety, attention deficit disorder, allergies, obesity, tooth decay and eczema. 9) Sugar consumption during pregnancy can lead to gestational diabetes, toxemia, and premature labor. Children born to mothers who consumed high sugar diets during pregnancy are more likely to be obese and struggle with insulin resistance and diabetes during their life. Summary: Because of its strongly addictive quality, sugar represents an increasingly prevalent portion of the American diet. Although sugar consumption has become mainstream, it is important to remember that sugar is a highly processed plant derivative that is challenging for the body to process on a daily basis. Sugar consumption taxes every system in the body including the digestive system, immune system, cardiovascular system, and skeletal system. ! If you don't recognize the name of something, it might be a tricky way the manufacturer is covering up for inclusion of something highly processed, sugary or just bad ! Whole, fresh foods grown in the same climate as the eater are always the best. Pesticide free and organic foods are less toxic for the body and the planet. Hormone and antibiotic-free meat! Farmers markets, local butcheries, small farms and natural food stores offer alternative meats. Americans consume more meat than they should on average, so if you imagine eating less meat but making sure it is good quality, the price difference is not much, if anything. Plus it is fresher, tastes better and generally involves better conditions for the animals. People don't need hormones from the animals they eat to throw off their own delicate hormone balance! And that way you are supporting the farms that choose not to inject hormones and antibiotics into their animals, which inevitably get into our soil and water. Grass-fed beef and other red meat is far preferable. Grain-fed animals are often raised on GMO corn and soy, proven to cause health problems in humans. Basic Tip: Don't shop while hungry! Make a list of foods you want to start including in your diet that you haven't been eating aka, healthy alternatives. 24 21 Diets that are high in sugar have been associated with high rates of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, autoimmune disease, allergies, attention deficit disorder, depression, and cancer. Consider this: it is believed that in 1822 the average American consumed 45g of sugar every 5 days and in 2012 the average American consumed 765g of sugar every 5 days. That's about 130 pounds of sugar a year. And most people don't know half the time that they are even eating sugar because it is hidden away in supposedly savory, store-bought foods. Until the government acknowledges the link between the spike in American sugar consumption and serious illness and puts restrictions on the \"sugar-marketing\" that has become so prevalent, it is up to us to regulate our own sugar intake. For more info on sugar and what it does in the body: http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2013/06/17/everything-you-need-to-know-about-sugar/ Basic Tip: Cut out all artificial sweeteners. This avoiding high-fructose corn syrup and all it's evil siblings listed above. Moderate Tip: Try cutting back on sugar by consuming only less processed and refined sugars (for 2 weeks, a month, 6 weeks, or forever, whatever you decide). Those would be things like honey, fruit juice, maple syrup, brown rice syrup and molasses. Try not to just replace all the sugary things you've been eating with these better alternatives, but actually cut back on sweet foods. Basic Tip: Start assembling recipes that are more in alignment with the way you want to be eating. Include foods that may be new. When you are ready, plan and shop for a day or two of healthy meals. Advanced Tip: Do a one-week meal plan, shop once or twice for the foods you will need and stick to it for the week to see if that method works for you. Remember sometimes it takes a little while to get into the habit of planning and following through, so don't get frustrated if there is a transition time. For some ideas: www.100daysofrealfood.com A good resource/example for meal planning: http://thenourishinghome.com/meal-planning/ How to Shop for Healthy Food Here are some basic rules for how to shop for healthy food: ! The fewer ingredients the better. Preservatives, additives and processed ingredients with long names are difficult for the body to digest and have other negative health impacts. The more complicated (and numerous) the ingredients, the more work your body has to do to break them down. Ingredients are listed in order of how much the product contains. This is how companies get sneaky, including sugar by several names so they can be further down on the list. In general, the top three ingredients make up most of what you are eating. 22 23 Extra Advanced Tip: Take the approach from the Advanced Tip, but also reduce fruit in the diet for 2 weeks to a month. Fruits with a high glycemic index (in general, the bigger the fruit, the higher the glycemic index, i.e. watermelon= very high and blueberry= quite low) and dried fruits have a lot of sugar in them and eating a diet high in fruit can throw the body into a similar state as consuming a lot of sugar. Fruit, however, provides vitamins, mineral and fibers that the body needs, while sugar does not, so there's no need to cut out fruit forever, but cutting back on it can benefit the system and influence dietary habits. !!! Meal planning All of this shifting of how and what to eat can feel intimidating, and it can be a slow process. One of the easiest ways to ensure you have the foods you would like to be eating around and in abundance so you don't resort to snacking on foods you are trying to avoid is to plan ahead. Take an hour once or twice a week and think about what meals you want to eat for the week and what snacks you would like to have around. Make a list of meals and the ingredients you need before you go shopping. Consult recipes if you like to do that and make sure you'll have what you need. There are lots of resources for healthy recipe ideas, whatever you are trying to eliminate or add to your diet. See our list of resources for suggestions. It's helpful for some people to have a chart to fill in for the week (see back pages). "}
