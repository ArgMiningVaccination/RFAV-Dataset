People who have little or no reaction (or less than 3 millimeters of induration) to all skin tests are considered anergic antigen - protein substances that can produce an immune response (such as CFP-10, ESAT-6, or those in PPD ) antiretroviral therapy (ARV) - a lifelong combination drug treatment to improve the quality and length of life for a person living with HIV/AIDS bacteriologic examination - tests done in a mycobacteriology laboratory to diagnose TB disease; includes examining a specimen under a microscope, culturing the specimen, and testing for drug susceptibility baseline skin test - a TST given to employees or residents in certain facilities when they start their job or enter the facility (see TB screening program and two-step testing ) BCG - bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), a vaccine for TB disease that is used in many countries but rarely used in the United States; may cause a false-positive reaction to the TST but does not affect QFT-G results boosted reaction - a positive reaction to a TST, due to a boosted immune response from a skin test given up to a year earlier; occurs in people who were infected a long time ago and whose ability to react to tuberculin had lessened. Two-step testing is used in TB screening programs to tell the difference between boosted reac tions and reactions caused by recent infection (see booster phenomenon and two-step testing ) booster phenomenon - a phenomenon in which people (especially older adults) who are skin tested many years after becoming infected with M. tuberculosis may have a negative reaction to an initial TST, foll owed by a positive reaction to a TST given up to a year later; this happens because the first TST boosts the immune response. Two-step testing is used in TB screening programs to tell the difference between boosted reactions and reactions caused by recent infection (see two-step testing ) bronchoscopy - a procedure used to obtain pulmonary secretions or lung tissue with an instrument called a bronchoscope; used only when patients cannot cough up sputum on their own and an induced specimen cannot be obtained case management - a system in which a specific health department employee is assigned primary responsibility for the patient, systematic regular review of patient progress is conducted, and plans are made to address any barriers to adherence case rate - the number of cases that occur during a certain time period, divided by the size of the population during that time period; the case rate is often expressed in terms of a population size of 100,000 persons SOUTHEASTERN NATIONAL TUBERCULOSIS CENTER (SNTC) \u0090 HTTP://SNTC.MEDICINE.UFL.EDU \u0090 PAGE 3 OF 7 case reporting - informing the state or local health department when a new case (an occurrence) of TB disease has been diagnosed or is suspected cavity - a hollow space within the lung, visible on a chest x- ray, that may contain many tubercle bacilli; often occurs in people with severe pulmonary TB disease CFP-10 - one of the antigens used in the QFT-G that is found in M. tuberculosis strains civil surgeons - domestic healthcare providers who screen immigrants living in the United States and applying for a permanent residence visa or citizenship clinical evaluation - an evaluation done to find out whether a patient has symptoms of TB disease or is responding to treatment; also done to check for adverse reaction to TB medications clinician - a physician, physician assistant, or nurse close contact - a person who has shared the same air space in a household or other enclosed environment for a prolonged period of time (days or weeks, not minutes or hours) with a person with suspected or confirmed TB disease colonies - groups of mycobacteria that have grown in a culture congregate setting - a setting in which a group of usually unrelated persons reside in close physical proximity. These settings may include hospitals, long term care facilities, assisted living facilities, corr ectional facilities, or homeless shelters (see residential facilities) contact investigation - a procedure for interviewing a person who has TB disease to determine who may have been exposed to TB.
