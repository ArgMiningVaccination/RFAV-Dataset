Whether it's from running between parties, traveling, or added stress at this office, this time of year can be tough! Many people spend their days tired and rundown and simply don't have enough energy. If you are looking for an energy boost, chiropractic might be the solution. CAN CHIROPRACTIC CARE HELP WITH SLEEP? You know chiropractors are being back doctors, but did you know chiropractic care may actually help you get more sleep? And more sleep means more energy! As chiropractors, we remove subluxations (or interferences) from the vertebrae of the spine. For some patients, these subluxations cause insomnia. By removing these restrictions, we also may the body feel more comfortable as flexibility is restored and pain is removed. When the body is able to remain in a comfortable state. it has an easier time falling and staying asleep. DOES CHIROPRACTIC IMPROVE BASIC BODY FUNCTION? People that make regular chiropractic care a part of their life also enjoy a boosted central nervous system. The most important part of the central nervous system (CNS) is the spine, and when it is healthy, so is the rest of the CNS. Because the CNS is the body's communication system, a healthy CNS means the rest of the body benefits, including the immune, digestive, and circulatory systems. When the body works efficiently, it wastes less energy, so you have more energy to use as you like. WHAT ABOUT ACHES AND PAINS? Some things, like pain and stiffness, simply exhaust the body. These issues can lead to you feeling rundown and fatigued. As you treat your body with chiropractic care and get rid of these issues, you may find your energy levels go up, which will leave you feeling great. Energy may be hard to come by, but chiropractic care can help.
