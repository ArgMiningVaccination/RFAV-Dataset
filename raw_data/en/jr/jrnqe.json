COLUMNS118 AACAP NEWSDIVERSITY AND CULTURE COLUMN The Importance of Addressing Perinatal Mental Health in Unaccompanied Immigrant Youth At 15-years-old, Yahaira did not expect to be a mother, but she became pregnant after being raped during her journey to the United States. The young mother-to-be was among the nearly 70,000 unaccompa-nied minors who made the long journey to the United States, seeking asylum from the rampant violence of Central America's Northern Triangle. Once in the United States, she needed access to adequate shelter, education, prenatal healthcare, and mental health services for her depression and posttraumatic stress problems. She faced significant barriers for accessing any of it. Her well-being and that of her child were in jeopardy. Unaccompanied minors have been migrating to the United States for decades. Recent media and socio-political attention have brought this concern to the surface once again, with reports of increased numbers of unac-companied minors crossing the border in the past decade. Most recently, the immigration policy resulting in fam-ily separation of children from their caregivers once again raised concerns about the treatment of minor immigrants seeking asylum. A subset of this popula-tion that has received very little attention includes those immigrants experiencing a pregnancy around the time of their migratory journey. It is known that mental health disorders are poorly recognized and treated in our country, particularly in this popula-tion. Our colleagues from the American Academy of Pediatrics have recently published a policy statement asking for pediatricians and obstetricians to increase their rates of screening for peri-natal depression and to improve their coordination of care to provide adequate referrals to mental health treatment. They note that perinatal depression is the most common obstetric complica-tion in the United States. 1 In their report, they cite recent data published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatr y which demonstrated that maternal perinatal depression predicted early-childhood psychiatric disorders in their children. 2 Given the limited access to services that undocumented immigrants have, along with the many cultural barriers that prevent those who do have access to actually obtain that care, there is high concern for the lack of proper screening, evaluation, and treatment of perina-tal mental health disorders in recent immigrants. In our country, Medicaid provides coverage for almost half of all pregnancies. For undocumented immigrants, care is only covered for emergencies; therefore, they are not able to obtain pre- or post-natal care. After the passage of a Medicaid expansion program which allowed non-citizens to be beneficiaries in order to access pre- and post-natal care in some states, such as Oregon, researchers used the opportunity to look at data from this quasi natural experiment. They found a positive effect on access to adequate prenatal care, rates of diabetes screen-ing, and fetal ultrasounds. Equally important, improved access of mater-nal prenatal care was associated with increased number of well child visits, improved rates of recommended screen-ings and vaccines, and reduced infant mortality. 3 Access to care is one of many barriers that undocumented immigrants may face when accessing perinatal care. Latina immigrants and their children have high rates of low educational attainment, housing insecurity, poverty, and interpersonal violence. Specific to undocumented immigrants, particularly unaccompanied minors, is the fact that these young mothers are arriving in a new country where they must learn a new language and a new way of living, often with very little social support. These mothers may become highly dependent on their romantic partners, which places them at risk for exploita-tion and interpersonal violence. In turn, interpersonal violence may affect the mother-child attachment, diminishing the mother's ability to properly care and nurture her child. Additionally, due to their undocumented status and fear of deportation, these mothers are often dis-couraged to report these incidents to the authorities, exacerbating the mother's dependency on their partner and the child's helplessness and view of the mother as unable to keep them safe. Another issue that must be taken into consideration is the possibility that the pregnancy occurred as a result from rape, as in Yahaira's experience. In our clinical experience, as well as reports Barbara Robles-Ramamurthy, MD, and Lisa R. Fotuna, MDCOLUMNS MAY/JUNE 2019 119COLUMNS from the media, stories have surfaced of young girls and women fleeing their countries after being raped and threat-ened, experiencing rape during their migratory journey, or experiencing it after their arrival to the United States. Pregnancy and motherhood are a transformative experience, even when the pregnancy is planned. As can be expected, the journey to motherhood after an incident of rape can be a dif-ficult one. These mothers require tactful care and support. Pregnant immigrant unaccompanied minors will often be placed in foster care homes if a suitable caregiver cannot be found or is not available. It is unclear what the guidelines and requirements for medical care are for pregnant unac-companied minors who are under government custody, whether in a deten-tion facility or a foster home. Media attention was recently given to stories related to mothers being separated from their breastfeeding infants after the implementation of the family separa-tion policy. Perinatal mental health, even under these violent circumstances around their journey, is not prioritized in this population of young women as they enter the United States. All of these issues decrease the likeli- hood that these mothers will seek help when experiencing psychiatric symp - toms in the perinatal period. Increased attention thus must be paid by child and adolescent psychiatrists to the perinatal mental health needs of immigrant youth, due to the twofold significance - the immigrant youth themselves as well as their offspring. m References 1.

She has performed and functioned well in school with supports; however, since transitioning from a small middle school to a much larger high school, she has had behavioral outbursts that led to referral to a local emergency room. Upon arrival to the emergency room, her parents informed the staff that she has a diagnosis of ASD. However, no one assessed her specific needs and was therefore unaware of her sensory sensitivities to loud noises and bright lights. They were also unaware that A.B. struggles with transitions and needs advance notice prior to starting a new task. As a result, when leaving triage to enter into the main emergency room, A.B. became agitated and required PO Haldol with Benadryl. As discussed in this article, patients with ASD have unique needs, particularly in the fast-paced environment of the emer-gency room. As health care providers, it is important to appropriately assess, understand, and manage these needs to improve the delivery of care for this patient population. Background ASD is a neurodevelopmental disor-der characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction in addition to restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. 1 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of ASD has risen in the last decade from 1 in 88 to 1 in 59. 2 Research shows that a greater proportion of youth with ASD utilize the emergency department (ED) in comparison to youth in the general population. 3-6 While youth with ASD have higher rates of medical and psychiatric co-morbidities, research suggests that this does not fully explain the increased rates of ED utilization. 6 There are a number of factors that account for these increased rates of utilization. 6 First, community-based outpatient psychiatrists often feel uncomfortable or ill-prepared to treat patients with ASD. 7 Second, there is a lack of capacity and access to less inten-sive levels of care for youth with ASD and behavioral challenges. When these factors are combined, families have few options besides the ED during a time of crisis. Factors Affecting Care Once the decision is made to go to the ED, delivery of care can be challenging due to patient, provider, and environ-mental factors. For individuals with ASD, challenges include communication deficits, sensory sensitivities, complex behaviors, and difficulty with transi-tions. Therefore, it is not surprising that the ED environment can be filled with triggers due to the intense noise and movements, bright lighting, crowded environment, and unpredictable sched-ule. 5,6 For ED staff, lack of training on the unique needs of this population, in combination with everyday work demands and pressures, make provid - ing quality care for patients with ASD a significant challenge. Interventions Given the increased number of youth diagnosed with ASD, and the rise in ED utilization by this population, it is impor-tant for health care providers in acute care settings to recognize and appropri-ately manage their unique care needs with an understanding of the varied fac-tors affecting delivery of care. Currently, there are three interventions that can be implemented in EDs to improve the patient care experience for youth with ASD and their families: training front-line staff, using structured assessment tools with youth and families to better understand behaviors and triggers, and ED modifications.

As health care providers, it is important to appropriately assess, understand, and manage these needs to improve the delivery of care for this patient population.COLUMNS MAY/JUNE 2019 121continued on page 122Conclusions In order to improve ED care for youth with ASD, a collaborative approach involving youth and families, clinicians, and educators from multiple disciplines is needed. There are a number of system challenges, including lack of a full-spectrum of effective community-based services for youth with ASD as well as a scarcity of psychiatric and pediatric primary care providers comfortable managing the unique needs of this popu-lation. Despite a continued need for a more comprehensive array of services, a three-pronged approach that focuses on training front-line staff, assessing the patient's acute needs with a structured questionnaire, and ED environmental modifications has been successful when trying to improve the delivery of care to youth with ASD. mAcknowledgements Roma Vasa, MDDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral SciencesJohns Hopkins Universityand Center for Autism and Related DisordersKennedy Krieger InstituteBaltimore, MD Jennifer Kuou, PhD Department of Special EducationCollege of Education, Towson UniversityTowson, MD References 1.

AACAP Psychopharmacology Committee Statement on Ketamine May 2019 AACAP's Psychopharmacology Committee monitors closely the availability of antidepressants for children and adolescents. At this time, there are only two FDA-approved medications for adolescents with depression and one for children. There have been a lot of questions by clinicians regarding referring patients for ketamine infusions (which are not approved to treat depres-sion in any age group adult or child) or prescribing esketamine. However, there are a lack of controlled studies in children and adolescents for ketamine or esketamine so clinicians should use extreme caution when prescribing either formulation. Additionally, as in any prescribing of off-label medications, the physician has more responsibility to look at available safety data, or the lack thereof. Therefore, esketamine is not proven to be safe or indicated in children and adolescents, and AACAP's Psychopharmacology Committee does not currently recommend its use in this population. For your reference, highlights of FDA's recent decision regarding esketamine fol-lows. To view full prescribing please see: http://www.janssenlabels.com/package-insert/product-monograph/prescribing-information/SPRAVATO-pi.pdf . FDA has approved intranasal esketamine for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in adults (18 and older). TRD is defined as failure of at least two previous antidepressants given at adequate doses and for adequate duration. It is approved for use in conjunction with an oral antidepressant (in clinical trials, a new oral antidepressant was initiated at the same time as double-blind intranasal esketamine or intranasal placebo). Dissociation and sedation are common adverse reactions. Given the risks associated with dissociation and sedation, as well as the risks of abuse and misuse, esketamine is only available through a restricted distribution system under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS). Esketamine can only be dispensed from a certified pharmacy, administered in a certified healthcare facility, and provided to patients who are enrolled in a patient registry. Patients must be monitored for two hours after administration until symptoms of sedation and dissociation resolve. Dose-dependent increases in blood pressure were also observed in clinical trials in adults. Blood pressure should be assessed prior to administering esketamine, about 40 minutes after administration (to coincide with Tmax), and before dis-charging the patient from clinic. The dosing schedule for esketamine is as follows: twice/week for first 4 weeks, once per week for the next 4 weeks, then once per week or every other week thereafter. Patients should be re-evaluated after the first 4 weeks to determine the need for continued treatment. Esketamine is not indicated for pediatric patients. A study of esketamine for rapid reduction of symptoms of depression, including suicidal ideation, in adolescents assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide is ongoing. Therefore, esketamine should not be used in this population outside of current research protocols.

He came into the session with his mother and was quiet as she angrily explained all the issues he had with her and at school. She made it clear that she had had enough and that his behaviors needed to stop. She yelled at him to talk with me. He responded by quietly leaning over in his chair and pretending he was asleep. I tried to engage him but was not successful. I left him slumped over and looking miserably depressed. As I continued my evaluation, I started asking the mom routine assessment questions. At times, I would ask Andr\u00e9 for his response. He did not respond. I even told him that his not talking meant that his mom got to tell his story for him. He did not respond. I wondered aloud if that was what he wanted. No response. I continued to ask questions about Andr\u00e9's past and present history. Andr\u00e9 continued his silence. I then asked about school. Mom said that he was repeat-ing a grade. I asked why. Mom said it was due to days lost to suspensions for fighting. I asked the mom whether he had learning problems. The moment after I asked this, Andr\u00e9 bolted out of his chair and in rapid succession threw a trash can at me, which missed, and a stuffed animal that did not. As he did this, he called me \"a white n_ _ _ _ _ and looked like he was going to rush me. I responded by getting up from my chair and calling for security. The guard arrived and suggested Andr\u00e9 go for a walk with her. As he had already calmed, I suggested the guard leave and wait outside. I told Andr\u00e9 that I would rather we talk. \"Did you think I was calling you stupid?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" he responded.\"I could see how that would make you angry, but I really didn't say that. I asked if you had learning problems. I was just doing my job, which in part is to find out why you are having troubles at school. Can you sit down so we can talk about your anger?\" He agreed and sat down after which we talked about his anger, which he said he could not control. \"It just comes,\" he stated.I argued that this was what he thought, but I suspected there were usually reasons, like thinking I thought he was stupid. I asked him if he would like help with his anger. He said yes. I agreed to see him the next week and gave him a short, user-friendly manual on anger control. After I gently asked him if he could read, which he said he could. I then told him to look it over and went over the basics of the manual includ-ing the identification of feelings, anger triggers, and new ways of dealing with them. I suggested that we could go over the details during our next sessions. He agreed. We left on better terms than we had begun. At the next session, Andr\u00e9 came in with his older female cousin. He was hopping mad and explained how he had had a rip-roaring fight with his mom the night before that had led to her slamming him against the wall. \"I didn't hit her back,\" he said with some pride. \"And I then ran to my cousin's and stayed the night with her. She drove me here this morning, as mom was still angry at me.\" \"I'm proud that you didn't hit your mom and that you were able to control your anger. And you figured out that leaving might help, which was a way of not mak-ing things worse.\" He smiled and acknowledged what he had done. I then asked where his mom was and what his plans were for today. He said that his mom was at home and that he would stay with his cousin until she calmed down. \"So you're safe.\"\"Yes.\"\"And did you have a chance to go over the anger management book?\" \"No.\"\"Did you bring it? I asked.\"No,\" he responded sheepishly\"What's your look about?\" I asked.\"I had been told by a past counselor that it helps if you tear up papers when you're angry, so I tore up the anger man-agement book.\" \"Did it help?\"\"Yes.\"\"Well, that's a start, I guess. Next time, why not tear up a magazine instead?\" \"There aren't any magazines at my house.\" \"Well, take one from the waiting room before you leave and tear that up instead.\" \"Ok.\" CLINICAL CASE REPORTS AND VIGNETTES COLUMN Trash Talking and Tearing into Manualized Treatment for a Rip-Roaring Anger Problem continued on page 124COLUMNS124 AACAP NEWS\"Would you like another copy of the manual to read?\" I asked. \"No, I'd rather we did it together in the session next time.\" \"That's a deal!\"I then spent most of the rest of the ses- sion on the phone with mom talking to her about what happened. She pretty much verified Andr\u00e9's story. I then told her that I needed to report what had happened to Child Protective Services (CPS). Mom said that she understood. After further discussion, I got her to report herself, which she said she would do. I had the nurse call to verify that she had the next day. As Andr\u00e9 left, I chuckled to myself about my work on anger management with him and Xeroxed another copy of the manual for the next session. I wondered what the next session would bring. It came, and they \"no showed.\" I would note that if attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the \"bread and butter\" of child psychiatrists, then so is its co-morbid cousins, opposi-tional defiant disorder (ODD) and \"anger management.\" I and many others have been struggling with what to do with anger issues in children for decades. My first \"academic\" pursuits were triggered by how to deal with temper tantrums in toddlers. The scholarly ques-tion I set before myself was why some cases did not respond to well-designed behavior modification programs deliv-ered by really competent practitioners. The answer for me turned out to be that unresolved conflicts in the caregiver's lives (n.b., ghosts in the nursery) made it so they could not properly execute the behavioral modification programs. I have staged and integrated behavioral modification, psychodynamic, and fam-ily therapy strategies. I continue to read about and experi- ment with strategies for treating anger problems. I have created a list of articles that have helped me over the years, including many \"oldies but goodies,\" psychodynamic and psychosocial articles, especially those that focus on the concept of acting out and milieu management in children. My strategy of having the mother report herself to child protective services has also evolved over the years to deal with several realities regarding the reporting of abuse cases. These realities include the fact:1. Th at one is a legally mandated reporter and therefore obligated to report 2. Th at reporting a case does not guarantee the case will be accepted, especially in cases of neglect or when there are no bruises, cuts, welts, or broken bones 3. Th at the reporting often comes as part of the initial assessment or during emergencies when a treat-ment relationship has not been fully established between the clinician and the caregivers 4. Th at the act of reporting, even when you discuss this with the caregiver(s), often blows apart the treatment rela-tionship or chances of nurturing one 5. Th at organizations often have poli- cies that allow for the delegation of reporting to others, often a nurse or a social worker, rather than the actual mandated reporter These perceived realities should lead all clinicians to a legal and ethical debate with themselves during which they should try to clarify and balance the best interests of the child, the caregivers, their institutions, the law, and their own pro-fessional standards. This review should definitely also include a check of the reporting laws in your state and a discus-sion with your institution to see if they are comfortable with your approach. I would certainly understand if your own legal and ethical debate comes up with a differing strategy. My own debate has led me to, in certain cases, especially where the chil - dren seem safe and without observable physical harm, to have the caregiv - ers report themselves. It has been my experience that to do so allows for a less adversarial stance towards the care - givers by CPS which allows for more support and clinical involvement. This \"kinder and gentler\" approach reduces the chances of precipitous actions with unintended consequences such as when children are separated from their caregivers. I always discuss my con - cerns with the caregiver and make clear my obligation to report. If they refuse my suggestion to self-report, I report. If they say they will report themselves, I follow up to make sure that they have. As Reagan said \"trust, but verify.\" In most cases, the caregiver calls from my office. In this case, the caregiver was not at the session and was called at home. It is my experience that such handling can often lead to a continu - ance of the treatment process. m References 1.

Kishore, MD On February 9, 2019, 120 medical students and their faculty mentors, from every corner of our country, gathered at the center of Stanford's campus for the 13th annual Klingenstein-sponsored celebra - tion of child psychiatry. I first became acquainted with the Klingenstein Medical Student Mentorship program and the tradition of the Klingenstein Conference in 2005 when I started at the Yale Child Study Center as a first-year child and adolescent psychia - try fellow. Back then, it was called the Harvard-Yale Games, a riff, of course, on the iconic football rivalry. However, in my first year of participation, I was struck by the ethos of anti-rivalry. The camara - derie, esprit de corps, and mentorship cut across every divide. Then and now, the mentorship gurus Andr\u00e9s Martin, MD, MPH , and Jim Leckman, MD , taught by example. Back then I was mostly an observer, but I soaked it all in, and what I witnessed were faculty who took mentorship seriously - really seriously. It was not a spectator sport - watching your mentee from the sidelines, wish - ing them well; it was rugby, a contact sport, metaphorically of course. It was not just showing up at the tournaments but showing up for the practices, and scrimmages, to coach, to cajole, and most importantly, I came to realize, to believe in the participants. I learned to be a men - tor by watching really good mentors and by witnessing the impact that they had on medical students' careers, trajectories, and choices. Many of the professional successes that I take the greatest pride in touch on our Klingenstein Medical Student Mentorship Program in some way. Stanford Klingenstein students are an absolute powerhouse of enthusiasm and chutzpah, and it is an honor to be a part of their team. The genius of the Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation (KTGF) is the community, the collabora - tion, the network. It's the mentorship between peers, from faculty to students, from senior faculty to junior faculty, and across institutions. Children and fami - lies need child psychiatrists, sometimes desperately. Child psychiatrists are born of, and grow through, mentorship, and KTGF is our fertilizer. The Klingenstein Conference always has been far and away my favorite conference of the year. When my turn came to host this confer - ence, the trepidation was real. I worried about the large shoes that I had to fill. How could I live up to the conference's storied past? Stanford was following in the footsteps of many other fantastic conferences. I had been there and borne witness. Each conference built on the last, surpassing the last. In the end, born of unbridled enthusiasm and passion for the mission, with some hard work and Type A organizing skill thrown in - Stanford students and faculty partnered to host what many described as an epic confer - ence. The students' presentations alone would have made for a phenomenal day. They were the best I had ever seen. Though truth be told I say that every year, because every year, it is true. The Break the Stigma bike ride was a newcomer to the Klingenstein Conference and helped carry the day by reminding us that we can advocate for children and families by doing what we love, with purpose. The student-led karaoke was the cherry on top, with laughter highlighting the warmth amongst conference participants. While each component of the confer - ence was amazing in its own right, none felt like the embodiment of our Stanford legacy. The element about which I feel most proud in retrospect was the one I felt fairly anxious about while it was happening. My daughter, 7, with as much spunk as any, was a partial fixture throughout the conference weekend. Not present for the talks but she was there for much of the rest of it. Flitting about, fairy or elf-like, prone to fits of giggles, acting for all intents like she owned the place. After all, as she was overheard saying, \"My mommy is in charge.\" After I had recovered from the flaming hot cheeks and elevated heartrate that embarrass - ment sometimes brings, I watched. What I observed was that she was a magnet. When we took group photos and she wanted to be in them, I heard my own mentors say, \"Of course she can be in the picture - we're here for the kids.\" It was a helpful reminder. Not just our patients' kids and families, we are here for all kids and families, including our own. For the first time ever, this year our conference had a research mission and an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved pre- and post-conference survey, overlapping other conference missions, to assess outcomes and efficacy. The Klingenstein Conference's express mission is to increase positive percep - tions and understanding of the field. Child psychiatry is sorely underserved and the Klingenstein family has had the foresight to understand that in order to adequately increase the pipeline of child psychiatrists, we have to appeal to medical students. As program directors we all sense that the Klingenstein Conference works; it inspires students to consider child psychiatry. Preliminary survey results also now sug - gest that the conference works. Positive MAY/JUNE 2019 129 FEATURESperceptions of child psychiatry and desire to enter the field increase after 48 intense hours of science, mentorship, and merri - ment. But I was still curious. How? What worked? What was the single most impor - tant factor? What made the difference? I don't pretend to be able to answer that question after a few conversations with students, but what they said surprised me. My students told me in deeper dives into their post-conference perceptions that they were struck by the humanity of the field, the way faculty interacted and treated one another, the fact that we felt comfortable bringing our families to such a gathering. Each of those elements struck a positive chord. Our medical students, wisely, care about entering specialties where they, and their families, will be cared for, as well they should. I hope that our students' wisdom will push all medical specialties in that much needed direction. For now, though, I get to feel proud to be a child psychia - trist, where we already do a remarkable job of putting children and families at the center, even our own. I think part of the reason that the Klingenstein Conferences work to increase child psychiatry's appeal is that our students have the opportunity to witness their faculty living a balanced life, riding their bikes, going to an art museum, enjoying a campus walk, conversing with their spouses, and playing with their kids. Mentorship sometimes means being yourself with your students - letting them watch you live. I was trained by the mentorship legends. With their blessings, I have found my own voice. My students get to watch me try to persuade my daugh - ter to eat her veggies. Was it handled in textbook child psychiatrist fashion? Hardly but she did eat a couple pieces of arugula and a single cherry tomato. Mom win? Unclear. I have decided that it was a win that our students witnessed that struggle. Our child psychiatry family believes in taking care of families, including our own. It was not a crafted message. It could not have been because I did not even understand the message until my students helped me see it, weeks later. It just is who we are. I felt proud of my co-direc - tor, Shashank Joshi, MD , and I, and the unspoken message that we sent. His son, Sanjan, brought the house down with his dance troupe's choreographed moves to the music from Fortnite. My daughter, Shanti, helped unfold and lay out linen on all the tables, hung a Break the Stigma sign on our podium, and ran around like she owned the place. What our students saw was a medical specialty that prac - tices what it preaches, a specialty imbued with humanism and humanity. We inspire medical students to be child psychiatrists by being our best selves; by caring for ourselves, each other, and our families; by allowing them to see us in living color; by teaching them that all children and families matter, including our own. m Dr. Kishore is a Clinical Associate Professor at Stanford University School of Medicine in the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

I saw students from different medical schools sitting together, with faculty interspersed among the tables. I started wondering - if medical trainees everywhere were afforded supportive mentorship and a warm peer community to realize their professional goals, would it resemble this precious annual gather-ing of child psychiatrists and medical students from around the country? As student helpers of the 2019 Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation (KTGF) National Medical Student Conference at Stanford, John Cannon and I designed and hosted the activities, known as the \"Games.\" Throughout the day, I saw both diversity and collabora - tion in thought and execution. In one of the Games, mentors and mentees had twenty minutes to build a diorama representing \"peer review,\" \"therapeutic alliance,\" or \"resilience.\" Working with a dearth of materials\u2014modeling clay, glitter glue, construction paper, and slime\u2014the teams managed to produce stunningly unique dioramas of mermaids and scuba divers, white coat figurines, monsters from under the bed, and toilets. These were metaphorical evocations of patient care and research that left us all gasping in wonder and crying with laughter. In his opening remarks, Thomas Anders, MD, exhorted us to \"remember the kids.\" Students responded to his call, giving incisive, child and adolescent-related presentations. We heard about\u2014among many topics\u2014structural violence against DREAMers, online child groom - ing, pediatric psycho-oncology, and creative writing interventions for hos - pitalized adolescents. Learning about my peers' research projects and clinical experiences, I witnessed a professional community begin to take form, and I was proud to count myself as a part of it. I heard the word \"mentorship\" many times through the course of the day, but the idea only really clicked when I heard Klingenstein Fellow and current Stanford psychiatry resident Desiree Li declare, \"Mentors should believe in you.\" As I reflected on my past and current men - tors in child and adolescent psychiatry, I was overcome with emotion, hit by an immense force of gratitude that was both humbling and empowering. I felt all my mentors' hope and care for me riding within their belief in me. At the end of the conference, Anita R. Kishore, MD , emailed all of us our con - ference group photo. She titled it \"Our Future\u2014it looks like a pretty spectacular one!\" I agree with her. I cannot wait to see what our community of peers will do for the field of child and adolescent psychiatry. m Kevin Sun is a second-year medical student at Stanford.

MAY/JUNE 2019 131 FEATURESKlingenstein Thirteenth Annual Conference: A Medial Student-Writer Perspective Natalia Birgisson My family thought I was drop- ping out of medical school when I took two years off to write a novel. My friends thought I was wasting precious time that could have been spent doing research that would help me land a competitive residency. Famous physician-authors counseled me to focus on my medical education. Academic advisors gave me a polite smile and wished me luck. Altogether, I felt rather alone during medical school in my calling to be a serious writer. And even if I didn't think my interests in writing and in child and adolescent psychiatry were related, I did notice that I felt at home with the people in that field of medicine. I helped organize the Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation's 13th Annual National Medical Student Conference at Stanford in February. When my mentor, Anita R. Kishore, MD , invited me to read from my novel as a stand-alone oral presentation, I was surprised. I should have understood it was because psy-chiatrists, perhaps more than any other doctors, understand the importance of exploring the human condition. But it was not until that moment that I thought about how fiction teaches us to put ourselves into other people's shoes, a skill required in order for psychotherapy to be effective. I was flattered that what for so long had been my \"odd hobby\" was being recognized and valued at a medical conference. My parents hap-pen to live locally, and I invited them to my presentation. During the conference itself, I was sur- prised by how many of my peers wanted to tell me about their own writing lives, about their own creative endeavors. Another student gave an oral presenta-tion about using creative writing with pediatric patients at the Mayo Clinic, and how it helped patients feel more comfortable. At the table I was assigned to sit, I met another student who is starting a medical humanities club at her school. During lunch, Dr. Kishore's former mentor\u2014who had only just met me\u2014went out of his way to connect me with another medical student writing a novel. The moment we started talking, I knew I had found a lifelong friend, someone who understood both of my careers and who walked that path as well. I have stayed in touch with all of these students, and we have become a part of each other's writing community. What was so reassuring to me about the Klingenstein Conference was that I finally understood why psychiatry and writing both call to me ('appeal' seems to miss the mark here), why I so enjoy spend-ing time with the residents and faculty in psychiatry. It is a field that forces us to live in uncertainty with our patients, just like writing forces me to contend with the skewed perspectives of my fictional characters. Child and adoles-cent psychiatry is a field that forces us to recognize that our expertise is only one piece among so many influencing a child's life, which we often do not have control over. When my parents joined the conference and saw over a hundred students and faculty members valuing the work I was doing with my novel, something magical happened. When Shashank Joshi, MD , and Dr. Kishore, the two faculty hosts of the conference, introduced themselves to my parents and spoke highly of my writing, it gave them a new perspective. They were proud; they were glow-ing. It was the best kind of scene that I could have written. For me, writing is about exploring the difficulties of the world and of finding a happy ending. The Klingenstein Conference felt like a happy ending for me\u2014rather, a happy b eginning. m Natalia Birgisson is a fourth-year medical student at Stanford. She received the Stanford Medical Scholars Grant to take time off to write her debut novel, which is now under consideration with multiple agents. Her interest in child psychiatry stems from her years volunteering with foster children as a Court Appointed Special Advocate. 132 AACAP NEWS FEATURESPOETRY SPEAKS - WILL YOU LISTEN?

One approach to decreasing the physi- cian shortage is to increase the number of medical student and residency posi-tions. There have been efforts to increase the number of medical schools and graduating medical school class size. Historically, with the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, the fed-eral government began funding physician residency programs. However, despite reports of physician shortages, the 1997 Budget Reconciliation Act froze funding for physician residency positions. Although there are many laudable components of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), it failed to increase funding for physician residency programs. Instead, the ACA funded \"residency programs\" and loan repayment for nurse practi-tioners (NPs). While NPs may be a part of the solution for meeting the health needs of our population, there is growing concern about impendent practice laws, patient safety, and the financial factors driving increased number of nurse prac-titioner graduates from online programs. NPs have a small fraction of medi- cal training compared to practicing physicians, generously calculated at approximately 3%. In fact, when the Flexner Report was published in 1910, recommendations were made for more training, not less. In January 2018, 100 child and ado- lescent psychiatry fellowship spots remained open. A few months later during the 2018 residency \"Match Day,\" 34,140 U.S. citizens applied for 30,232 available residency positions. In March 2019, there were 1,740 general psychia-try positions, with an overall fill rate of 98.9%. There are not enough residency positions available to graduating medi-cal students. 8,9 There are also a variable number of general psychiatry residents interested in pursuing an extra one to two years of additional training in child and adolescent psychiatry. Student loan debt likely influences an early career psychiatrist's decision to subspecial - ize. In fact, the American Academy of Medical Colleges (AAMC) reported that in 2018, the median medical school debt was $195,000, with over 45.7% of those in debt seeking loan forgiveness programs. 10 We need to support our medical stu-dents by decreasing the cost of medical school education, increasing funding for residency positions and fellowships, and providing more opportunities for loan forgiveness. This would encourage physi-cians to pursue specialties, like child and adolescent psychiatry, that are not as high paying as more procedural-based specialties. This would increase the num - ber of practicing physicians and improve patients' access to care. With a growing influx of newly gradu- ated NPs with little clinical experience, there is an increased risk to patient safety and quality of care in child and ado-lescent mental health. There are few, if any, systematic studies looking at quality of care outcomes between physicians and nurse practitioners in community settings. 11,12 Furthermore, there are currently no studies looking at longitu-dinal quality of care outcomes and cost between psychiatric nurse practitioners and psychiatrists. If we plan to influence the future of medicine, as physicians we need to educate the public and our state and national representatives about these issues. NPs wishing to treat children and adolescents with psychiatric conditions should go through a standardized spe-cialty training program or residency with guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders, and be expected to take standardized board exams periodi-cally. NPs should not be given licenses to practice independently. Psychiatrists should not be forced to supervise NPs they do not believe are capable of managing children and adolescents. For those NPs that psychiatrists are will-ing to supervise, the number of NPs they are supervising should be limited in order to optimize safety for patients and providers. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) should provide funding for longitudinal research on quality of care outcomes for NPs and physicians in both academic and community settings. Psychiatrists should be involved in creat-ing practice parameters for NP scope of practice to suit their level of training and expertise. It is imperative that we as physicians should take leadership in setting the standard of care for the safety and protection of our country's most vulnerable populations. m References 1.

Choose Behavioral Health MAY/JUNE 2019 145 FOR YOUR INFORMATIONHonor Your Mentor Follow-Up Clarice Kestenbaum, MD Submitted by Scott M. Palyo, MD In honor of Dr. Kestenbaum's 90th year and over 60 years as a physician and psychothera- pist, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate all that she has done for me, our patients, and our child and adolescent psychiatry community. Her kindness, patience, and talents have inspired so many to be dedicated, thoughtful healers. No one I have encountered has the grasp on development, psychoanalysis, medicine, literature, culture, and general knowledge and knows how to weave a story around this like Dr. K does. For someone who is embark-ing on her ninth decade in life, she is, and remains, so youthful, interested in life and people, and passionate about her work. Dr. K. continues to teach so many of us, but more impor-tantly, she continues to learn for herself. That is something we all should strive for. Clarice Kestenbaum, MD Submitted by Virginia Q. Anthony A wonderful mentor in child psychiatry, who has nurtured and encouraged so many, is Dr. Kestenbaum. Dr. Kestenbaum served as Chair of the Training and Education Committee, Program Committee, and President, among other things. She is a model therapist and became the \"go to\" clinician/analyst for Columbia Trustees. David Shaffer, MD, her Chairman, and a tenacious researcher, decried that although he carefully selected his residents for research potential, they would take one class with Dr. K and be hooked. He said she was like a Pied Piper. As President she had many strengths, but one stood out for me. She could capture the pain of patients and their families and eloquently share the possibilities of therapy and healing. She is the best. Helen and Jack (J. Sanford) Davis, PhD Submitted by Virginia Q. Anthony I write to recognize Helen and Dr. Davis as heroes both for me and AACAP. Helen and Jack created the outstanding residential care facility The Grove School, in Madison, Connecticut. I became friends with them in 1974, through AACAP President Joseph Noshpitz. I cherish them as role models for their generosity, positivity, and humanitarian actions, embracing people and their cul-tures and educating me about the possibilities. Jack and Helen were my go-to philanthropists, especially when there was an expense/need that could not be supported by dues. They supported our travel scholarships, including funding the participation of an Iraqi child psychiatrist in our meeting as well as Russian and Cuban colleagues. Jack was particularly involved in the selection and purchase of our building, always encouraging us to go further. Helen and Jack, you are my heroes. 146 AACAP NEWS FOR YOUR INFORMATIONWelcome New AACAP Lake City, UT Betsega Awelachew , Los Angeles, CA Janet J. , San Mateo, CA Kayla Balaj, MD , , Hopkinton, Jeffrey D.
