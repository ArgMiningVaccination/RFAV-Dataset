Please note, the U.S. Embassy does not set travel policies for lawful permanent residents (LPRs). [U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS)](https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/contact-us) retains jurisdiction over the status of LPRs and any request for official guidance should be directed to them. Unfortunately, USCIS does not have an office in Bangladesh. As an LPR, how long can you stay outside of the U.S. without potentially losing residency? Generally, you can stay outside the U.S. for up to one year. If you have been issued a Re-Entry Permit, which applicants must apply for while in the U.S., you can stay outside the United States as long as your Re-Entry Permit has not expired. Please note, per USCIS, the abandonment of residency may be found to have occurred on trips of less than a year outside of the United States if is determined you did not intend to make the U.S. your permanent residence. For further information, please see the [USCIS website here](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-we-grant-your-green-card/international-travel-as-a-permanent-resident). Can you apply for a Re-Entry Permit now that you are outside of the U.S. and cannot return? Pursuant to USCIS policy, you cannot apply for Re-Entry Permit when you are outside of the United States. You must apply for one before you depart the United States. Also, an expired Re-Entry Permit cannot be extended. Will USCIS consider the current COVID-19 situation as an exceptional circumstance and allow affected LPRs presently outside of the U.S. to retain their LPR status? There has not been an announcement or policy exception issued by USCIS regarding this issue. LPRs who have stayed outside of the United States for more than one year, or longer than the validity of their Re-Entry Permits, are generally considered to have abandoned their LPR status.
