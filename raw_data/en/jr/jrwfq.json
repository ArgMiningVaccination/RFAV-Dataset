Here are five top tips for a healthy detox, by Naturopath and CNM lecturer Rebecca Edwards: Post-Christmas is a great time to have a 'detox' - assisting your body to cleanse itself of metabolic by-products and toxins which have accumulated over the festive season. 1. Avoid 'toxic' food The first step is to avoid taking in any substances which will contribute to the body's toxic load. This means staying away from alcohol, sugar, dairy and processed foods in general. Try to eat as 'naturally' as possible, consuming foods in as close to their natural state as you can. 2. Drink water Consume at least two litres of filtered water throughout the day. Avoid caffeine - rather than coffee, experiment with herbal teas. Nettle and dandelion are particularly good for de-toxing. Rooibos has a stronger taste and is full of antioxidants. 3. Look after your liver - try some Milk Thistle Focusing on the liver is an important part of a detox. The liver is the organ which acts as a filter, trapping and processing any ingested toxins. Increase the amount of liver-friendly foods consumed - dark green leafy vegetables, seeds, nuts and eggs. Supplements can be very beneficial to boost and support liver function. A herb called Silybum Marianum (Milk Thistle) has been clinically proven to increase liver detoxification pathways and protect the health of the liver. B vitamins are also crucial to liver health, and taking a high-dose multivitamin can help detox. Look for one with about 50mg of each of the B vitamins. 4. Sleep well Getting enough sleep is also key to good health and healing. When you are at rest, your body is doing its regeneration and repair work. Make sure you are getting at least 8 hours sleep a night. 5. Exercise Don't forget that exercise is important to boost metabolism and release mood-lifting endorphins.
