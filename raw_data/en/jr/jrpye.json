People who are traveling across time zones may take melatonin on the day or night of departure and for 2 to 4 nights after arrival. People who rotate work shifts may take melatonin before going to bed. Research is being conducted in using melatonin to resynchronize the sleep-wake cycle for people in the early phases of Alzheimer disease, as well as for seasonal affective disorder (feeling depressed during winter months). Does melatonin work? Evidence suggests that melatonin supplements can affect the sleep-wake cycle. Thus, melatonin supplements may help certain people with symptoms of jet lag or temporary insomnia and has been used for as long as 6 months. However, there is little evidence that melatonin effectively treats chronic insomnia. What are the possible side effects of melatonin? Headache and transient depression may occur. Melatonin may increase existing depression. Whether melatonin is safe when used long-term is unknown. Melatonin is best taken under medical supervision. If animal sources are used, infections may occur, caused by animal tissue contamination.

Also, melatonin may decrease fertility, and whether melatonin is safe in pregnancy or while breastfeeding is unknown. What drug interactions occur with melatonin? Melatonin may increase effects of warfarin, increasing risk of bleeding. Melatonin may enhance the sedative effects of certain drugs such as benzodiazepines. Some drugs may affect melatonin levels. For example, fluvoxamine, estrogens, and quinolone antibiotics may increase melatonin levels. Conversely, some drugs (for example, the antiseizure drug carbamazepine and the antibiotic rifampin) may decrease melatonin levels. Recommendations People with problems sleeping or who want to treat or prevent jet lag can try melatonin, but most, particularly those considering taking melatonin repeatedly, should consult with their doctor first. Melatonin should not be taken by people with epilepsy or autoimmune diseases, women trying to become pregnant, or those taking warfarin.
