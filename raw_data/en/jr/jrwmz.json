Most of what I was learning revolved around clean eating and food choices but we also learned a lot about the importance of non-toxic household and beauty products. I'm almostttt there with the beauty side of things, but we've pretty much got the house stuff down. This is such an important piece of the healthy lifestyle puzzle you guys. If you are trying to clean up your diet, you have to take this next step. Why spend money on organic foods and drinks if you're spraying your house with chemicals? To me, that defeats the purpose. Before I switched to non-toxic products, I was very prone to migraines, and after the switch headaches are very rare for me. Cleaning up my diet helped lessen the headaches IMMENSELY, but I know cleaning up the chemicals and toxins in our household products played a huge role too. It's also imperative you make the non-toxic switch if you are trying to balance hormones! Our liver is responsible for eliminating excess estrogen from the body, but it's also responsible for eliminating other wastes, like chemicals and pesticides. If we expect our liver to clear out excess hormones and keep us hormonally balanced, let's help our body out and lessen the toxic load. Fertility tidbit! Chemicals and fragrances found in household products have been shown to be endocrine disruptors. This means they can negatively affect the way our hormones behave and interact with one another. This [can affect male and female fertility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3845732/), so if you're of child-bearing age, this is especially important for you. In their book, [Green Fertility](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615393519/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0615393519&linkCode=as2&tag=healwholnutr-20&linkId=45aec0d4bf67880124f4b035f7dabf52), Lauersen and Bouchez write \"Chemicals lurking in a wide variety of household products caused a 33% decrease in the ability to conceive,\" citing a study from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Australia. 33%, guys. This is important stuff. Products I Use & Recommend A note on the EWG Rating: The EWG or Environmental Working Group is a Website I use all the time. They are the people who come out with the Dirty Dozen and Clean Fifteen lists each year, and they do amazing work rating different products on their 1-10 and A-F scale. This is directly from their FAQ page - An \"A\" indicates very low toxicity to health and the environment and extensive ingredient disclosure. An \"F\" means the product is highly toxic or makes little to no ingredient disclosure. A \"C\" indicates an average cleaner that poses no overt hazards and provides some disclosure of ingredients.
