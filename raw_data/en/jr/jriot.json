Finally, Hua Tuo developed Doa Yin Qigong exercises that focused on the holistic nature of the human body and the link to mind, body and the environment in achieving wellness. The exercises involve carefully crafted physical movement, regulated breathing and mental awareness with the aim of promoting the free flow of energy in the body (Ye et al., 2015). The use of acupuncture in medicine has also been used particularly in addressing pain in a number of conditions such as a variety of cancers. According to Wang and Litscher (2015) acupuncture is used to address symptoms particularly in regards to cancer as nausea, fatigue and vomiting. It is always important to respect patient's choices of alternative care but as advocates our responsibility is to educate the patient that a treatment may not be covered by their medical insurance and can be very expensive for the patient. We want to prevent any additional economic distress added to their physical problems. \"Holistic health care is an important foundational concept in nursing and medicine\" (Conroy & Taggart, 2016). Chinese patients classify medication and food as \"Yin/cold\" or \"Yang/hot\". Yin is the female, negative Accordingly, when providing care for KAs, healthcare providers must take the patient's cultural values into consideration. Maintaining a healthy body, is associated with being harmonious, or balanced, with the body and soul. Therefore, when a person is sick, it is attributed to misfortune or bad luck (Children's Mercy, 2010, p. 25). As a result, alternative medicine, also termed Chinese medicine, is widely used in the Korean culture. Chinese medicine can be traced back to traditional healing from Korea, China, Japan, and other parts of Southeast Asia. In addition, \"traditional Chinese medicine is said to rest on several pillars, the important parts of maintaining and restoring health: acupuncture, traditional Chinese herbs, diet and nutrition, exercise, stress reduction, Connor Jackson Integrative Medicine 8 May 2017 Final Paper This class has been vital in providing me with a new perspective on different types of alternative medicine and practices. Although there were some lectures which came across to me as a bit hard to believe, such as Scott Roos's Ayurveda lecture, in the end all of these different methods of healing and self-betterment gave me a new understanding of the importance of alternative types of medicine. And even with the rather far-fetch topics, if they ultimately have worked for people, even without scientific backing, then who are we to judge what is the right or wrong way. For the most part, my knowledge of medicine was backed mainly by the western medicine I was exposed to growing up, We went to Chinatown herb shop as a group two weeks ago. The experience was very interesting to me because it helped me know more about Chinese medicines. Traditional Chinese medicine is not new to me. I was born and lived with it because of my family background. Whenever my family has minor issues such as cold and cough, our first choice always goes to Chinese herbal medicine. I remembered the time when I was young and sick, my mom will bring me to the doctors and they would prescribed me herbals to treat my condition. I was always confused about why the herbalist would never use single herbs to treat the condition and always use multiple herbs; the trip to Chinatown herb shop helped me solve this problem. \"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) remain the most ancient yet living traditions. There has been increased global interest in traditional medicine (Hindawi)\". Chinese medicine focuses on finding the exact cause of illness instead of just offering a solution. Traditional Chinese medical practices forces on the balance of yin and yang within a person and the five elements ( water, wood, fire, metal, and earth). Metal corresponds to the lungs, wood to the liver, fire to the heart, water to the kidneys and earth to the spleen. Among some of these healing practices, there The topic in class for this week was herbs and herbal therapy, and guided imagery/visualization. In the textbook on chapter 16, there are so many common herbs and dietary supplements listed. I am familiar with some of the herbs and supplements, such as acai, ginger, lavender, saw palmetto, clover, noni, ginseng, chamomile, garlic, aloe vera, turmeric, fish oil, green tea, cranberry, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, kelp, soy, and cinnamon. However, there are many that I have never even heard about. It was so interesting knowing that there are so many alternative remedies available to us other than the chemical ones. In this regard, medicinal and aromatic plants are being employed, and they can be said to belong to the Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) category under the biologically-based treatments subcategory (Mohsen et al. 785). Mohsen et al. point out that the industrial utilizations of MAPs include herbal teas, galenicals, health, pharmaceutical/industrial auxiliary, traditional medicines, new drugs, and intermediates for the manufacture of drugs (786). As Mohsen et al. further observe, MAPs serve to provide the raw materials required in the pharmaceutical industry where drugs are extracted through the isolation of active chemicals, which is succeeded by decocting them to medication (787). Further, the scholars fittingly observe that over 85% of the general population in the U.S., Africa, and developing countries make use of the complimentary medicines and nonconventional practices adjunctive to typical medical care (Mohsen et al One important aspect of Chinese culture is Traditional Chinese Medicine, also known as TCM. Chinese medicine has been around for quite awhile, and is still around today. In the United States, we see it as acupuncture and massage. TCM is still widely popular in its home country where it is still practiced as it was a few centuries ago. Chinese medicine is evolving to our modern day times, but it is keeping close ties to its roots. Chinese medicine is also becoming more affluent in different parts of the globe. It is a major part of Chinese history and culture, and the people who participate in it do so with great respect. With Chinese medicine, there is great history, procedures, risks, and how it lives in the modern world. Both Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal medicine have long roots in American history as alternatives to the Biomedical practice, albeit with Herbal medicine gaining greater early popularity due to it's similarities to alternative medicines in American cultural traditions. The fulfillment of needs not adequately addressed by biomedicine, whether it be the basic lack of healthcare of any sort in early Western America in which the first Chinese American arrived, or the lack of preventative care in the modern day United States, is a defining thread in the practice of TCM in the US, of which Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture served as vanguards. Another defining thread in these practices history and future in the US is the influences of cultural adaption, KEEPING WITH TRADITION In traditional Chinese medicine, the human body is healthy only when its internal state is in harmony and balance. The disruption of this internal balance, however, causes for disease and illnesses. According to Dillman and Thomas, \"The body is understood as a wholly interactive, interrelated, and integrated organism. The health of each part of the body depends on the wellness of the whole\" (Advanced 34). Due to the holistic view of the body, only one diseased part of the whole organism can disrupt balance and affect other internal parts of the body as well. Subsequently, balance within the whole body is promoted within Chinese medicinal beliefs. Blackman 2 Eastern Medicine is a healing system that has been carefully developed all throughout China over the course of thousands of years, resulting in various forms of therapy. There are many focuses and principles in these methods, such as enhancing the body's capacities and bolstering the body's immunities for restoring and sustaining health. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a great emphasis on natural remedies; staying grounded to earth by exploring the body 's interactions with all aspects pertaining to life; involving the composition of earthly elements such as seasons, colors, water, wood, fire, music, and many more. They have systemically discovered that health is the balance of harmony and function within the mind, body, and spirit, creating forms of treatment to minimize the obstruction of flow within ones health. Alternative medicine is effective through numerous complex diseases, chronic pains, and emotional pains. Unorthodox means of treatment comes in several, diverse treatments that all differ, yet prove to be effectual and offer a distinctive experience and outcome from the familiar modern medicine and healing. Eastern and Western Medicine The complex structure and foreign nature of Tibetan medicine makes it difficult to relate its practices to Western medicine, making it difficult to determine the clinical efficacy of Eastern medical practice. Several clinical analysis studies have recently been performed in order to determine the efficacy of the \"holistic\" practices of Eastern cultures. Whether the studies show Eastern or Western practices to be more effective, I believe that the most effective treatment should be a combination of both practices. Tailored According to the Needs Unlike modern medicine, herbal drugs can be adjusted according to the condition of each patient. The diagnostic approach depends on the tailored requirements according to the Traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM, is one of the oldest systems of medicine to exist among humans, and it is extremely prominent to this day. According to legend, the system has been in use since the third millennium BCE. The views of such an old system differ greatly from those These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
