All scientists have a responsibility to ensure that they conduct their work with honesty and integrity; to ensure that methods and results are reported in an accurate, orderly, timely and open fashion. ... International Council for Science. Freedom, Responsibility and Universality of Science. 2008 Research article Research article is ' end product ' of one process ... 4 Design Conduct Publication Primary research Research article Research article is ' end product ' of one process ... ...and ' raw material ' of other processes 5 Design Conduct Publication Informs further research Clinical practice guideline Systematic review Publication Primary research Informs health policies and clinical practice 6 Research article Scientific manuscripts should present sufficient data so that the reader can fully evaluate the information and reach his or her own conclusions about results -to assess reliability and relevance Readers need a clear understanding of exactly what was done -Clinicians, Researchers, Systematic reviewers, Policy makers, ... The goal should be transparency -Should not mislead -Should allow replication (in principle) -Can be included in systematic review and meta -analysis 7 Taxonomy of poor reporting Non-reporting (or delayed reporting) of whole studies (even when some results have been presented in public) Misrepresentation of study design -e.g. study claiming is an RCT when is not Selective reporting -patient outcomes -analyses, e.g. subgroups , alternative analyses Incomplete publication -Omission of crucial aspects of research methods, e.g. interventions -Incomplete results: data cannot be included in meta -analysis Misleading interpretation (spin) -e.g. post hoc change of focus, Inconsistencies between sources -e.g. publication conflicts with protocol All are very common 8 In simple terms... Non-reporting Selective reporting Poor reporting All are very common 9 Consequences of inadequate reporting Assessing the reliability of published articles is seriously impeded by inadequate reporting -Clinicians cannot judge whether to use a treatment -Data cannot be included in a systematic review Serious consequences for clinical practice, research, policy making, and ultimately for patients 10 Incomplete reporting of research is very common Hundreds of published reviews show that key elements of trial methods and findings are commonly missing from journal reports We often cannot tell exactly how the research was done These problems are generic -not specific to randomised trials -not specific to studies of medicines -not specific to commercially sponsored research 11 Incomplete reporting of research is very common \"In 37% of papers patient numbers were inadequately reported; 20% of papers introduced new statistical methods in the 'results' section not previously reported in the 'methods' section, and 23% of papers reported no measurement of error with the main outcome measure.\" [Parsons et al, J Bone Joint Surg Br 2011] 12 Case -control studies Bias in psychiatric case -control studies: literature survey. [Lee et al, Br J Psychiatry 2007] RESULTS \"The reporting of methods in the 408 identified papers was generally poor, with basic information about recruitment of participants often absent ...\" CONCLUSIONS \"Poor reporting of recruitment strategies threatens the validity of reported results and reduces the generalisability of studies.\" 13 \"Spin\" Review of breast cancer trials \"... spin was used frequently to influence, positively, the interpretation of negative trials, by emphasizing the apparent benefit of a secondary end point. We found bias in reporting efficacy and toxicity in 32.9% and 67.1% of trials, respectively, with spin and bias used to suggest efficacy in 59% of the trials that had no significant difference in their primary endpoint.\" [Vera-Badillo et al, Ann Oncol 2013] 14 Among 67 studies: 87% did not adequately describe the questionnaires 75% did not address handling of missing data 95% did not disclose before -and-after results as means of overall scores and each dimension Le Cleach et al, Dermatology 2008 15 The quality of reporting of RCTs is generally poor in public health dentistry journals. Overall, the quality of reporting has not substantially improved since the publication of CONSORT guidelines. The reporting of RCTs of vaccines is incomplete, with important methodological details missing from most reports. 16 Poor reporting is a serious problem for systematic reviews and clinical guidelines \"Risk of bias assessment was hampered by poor reporting of trial methods .\" [Meuffels et al. Computer assisted surgery for knee ligament reconstruction, CDSR 2011] \"Poor reporting of interventions impeded replication \" [Gordon and Findlay. Educational interventions to improve handover in health care: a systematic review. Med Educ 2011] \"15 trials met the inclusion criteria for this review but only 4 could be included as data were impossible to use in the other 11.\" [Nolte et al. Amphetamines for schizophrenia. CDSR 2004] \"Poor reporting of data meant that individual effect size could not be calculated for any of these studies .\" Bleakley et al.

Aust J Physiother 2008. 17 Consequences of inadequate reporting Assessing the reliability of published articles is seriously impeded by inadequate reporting -Clinicians cannot judge whether to use a treatment -Data cannot be included in a systematic review Serious consequences for clinical practice, research, policy making, and ultimately for patients 18 Maximising the value of research Research is done to generate new knowledge A research article is for communicating that new knowledge Published research articles should be fit for multiple readerships with multiple purposes There are ethical, moral, scientific and financial reasons for maximising the value of research 19 What is needed? Authors should be aware of ethical/moral responsibility to publish their findings -Honestly and transparently Authors, editors and peer reviewers should be aware of the needs of readers -Principle of reproducibility -Should be includable in a future systematic review Be aware of, and follow, major reporting guidelines "}
