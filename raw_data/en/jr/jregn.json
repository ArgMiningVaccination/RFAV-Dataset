Each dose may contain traces of ovalbumin. Antibiotics and thimerosal are not used in the manufacture of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent. Packaging FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose in single dose prefilled syringes. The syringes are made of Type 1 glass. The container closure system for FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent does not contain latex (natural rubber). FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent is considered safe for use in pers ons with latex allergies. FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent is available in packages of: 5 x 0.7 mL (single dose) syringes without attached needle . 10 x 0.7 mL (single dose) syringes without attached needle. Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS General Before administration of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent, health -care providers should inform the recipient or guardian of the recipient of the benefits and risks of immunization, inquire about the recent health status of the recipient, review the recipient's history concerning possible hypersensitivity to the vaccine or similar vaccines, previous immunization history, the presence of any contraindications to immunization and comply with any local requirements regarding information to be provided to the recipient/guardian before immunization. Syncope can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. Procedures should be in place to prevent falling and injury and to manage syncope. As w ith any vaccine, vaccination with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent may not protect 100% of recipients against influenza illness. Influenza virus is unpredictable in that significant antigenic changes may occur from time to time. At this time, current influe nza virus vaccines are not effective against all possible influenza strains. Protection is highest against those strains of virus from which the vaccine is prepared or against closely related strains. Febrile or Acute Disease: Vaccination should be postpon ed in case of a moderate or severe acute disease with or without fever; however, a mild disease should not usually be a reason to postpone vaccination. Sanofi Pasteur Product Monograph Vaccine - Types A and B (Split Virion)) Page 8 of 26 Hematologic Because any intramuscular injection can cause an injection site hematoma in persons with an y bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia or thrombocytopenia, or in persons on anticoagulant therapy, intramuscular injections with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent should not be administered to such persons unless the potential benefits outweigh the risk of administration. If the decision is made to administer any product by intramuscular injection to such persons, it should be given with caution, with steps taken to avoid the risk of hematoma formation following injection. The Canadian Immunization Guide has recommendations for giving vaccinations to persons with bleeding disorders. Immune Prior to any vaccination, all known precautions should be taken to prevent hypersensitivity reactions. Epinephrine hydrochloride solution (1:1,000) and other appropriat e agents used for the control of immediate allergic reactions must be available to treat unexpected reactions, such as anaphylaxis. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. H ealth -care providers should be familiar with current recommendations for the initial management of anaphylaxis in non -hospital settings including proper airway management. For instruction s on recognition and treatment of anaphylactic reactions see the current edition of the Canadian Immunization Guide or visit the Health Canada website. As each dose may contain traces of formaldehyde, ovalbumin and octylphenol ethoxylate , which are used d uring vaccine production, caution should be exercised when the vaccine is administered to persons with hypersensitivity to one of these substances. See 2 CONTRAINDICATIONS . The immunogenicity of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent may be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or in individuals with immune deficiency syndromes. In such cases it is recommended to postpone the vaccination until after the immunosuppressive treatmen t or resolution of the immunosuppressive condition, if feasible. Nevertheless, as recommended by NACI, the possibility of lower efficacy should not prevent immunization in those at high risk of influenza -associated morbidity, since some protection is still likely to occur. Neurologic If Guillain -Barr \u00e9 syndrome (GBS) has occurred within 6 weeks of any previous influenza vaccination, the decision to give FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and ri sks. See 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS . Skin Local reactions at injection site such as pain, erythema, s welling, induration and bruising may occur. See 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS . 7.1 Special Populations 7.1.1 Pregnant Women Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent. It is also Vaccine - Types A and B (Split Virion)) Page 9 of 26 not known whether FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent is indicated for persons 65 years of age a nd older. 7.1.2 Breast -feeding It is not known whether FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent is excreted in human milk. FLUZONE\u00ae High - Dose Quadrivalent is indicated for persons 65 years of age and older. 7.1.3 Pediatrics Pediatrics (<18 years of age): Based on the data subm itted and reviewed by Health Canada, the safety and efficacy of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent administration in children less than 18 years of age have not been established; therefore, Health Canada has not authorized an indication for paediatric use. 7.1.4 Geriatrics Geriatrics (65 years of age): FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent is indicated for persons 65 years of age and older. 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS 8.1 Adverse Reaction Overview Adverse event information is derived from one clinical trial with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Qu adrivalent and from worldwide post -marketing experience with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose. 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions Clinical trials are conducted under very specific conditions . The adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials ; therefore, may not reflect the rates observed in practice and should not be compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug . Adverse reaction inf ormation from clinical trials may be useful in identifying and approximating rates of adverse drug reactions in real -world use. The safety of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent was assessed in one randomized, active -controlled, modified double -blind Phase III clinical trial conducted in the United States which enrolled 2,670 adults 65 years of age and older. The study compa red the safety and immunogenicity of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent to those of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose, which is a trivalent influenza vaccine indicated for adults 65 years of age and older and which also contains 60 g of hemagglutinin for each strain. The safety analysis set included 1,777 FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent recipients, 443 FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose recipients, and 450 recipients of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose containing the alternate B influenza strain. Safety results for the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose and investigational FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose containing the alternate B influenza strain recipients were pooled for the analysis. Safety evaluations were performed during the first 28 days following vaccination. Serious adverse reactio ns were collected during six months of follow -up. The overall safety profile of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent was comparable to FLUZONE\u00ae Vaccine - Types A and B (Split Virion)) Page 10 of 26 Dose. The most common reactions occurring after FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent administration were injection si te pain (41%), myalgia (23%), headache (14%) and malaise (13%). Onset usually occurred within the first 3 days after vaccination. The majority of solicited reactions resolved within three days of vaccination. Table 2 displays t he frequency of the solicited injection site and systemic reactions for FLUZONE\u00ae High - Dose Quadrivalent compared to FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose reported within 7 days post -vaccination and collected using standardized diary cards .

Based on data from FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose , solicited injection site reactions and systemic adverse reactions were slightly more frequent after vaccination with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose compared to a standard dose vaccine. Unsolicited adverse reactions for FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent compared to FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose reported within 28 days after vaccination, respectively, were low with rates of less than one percent for all unsolic ited adverse reactions: Vaccine - Types A and B (Split Virion)) Page 11 of 26 Within 180 days post -vaccination, 80 (4.5%) FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent recipients and 48 (5.4%) FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose recipients experienced a serious adverse event (SA E). None of the SAEs were assessed as related to the study vaccines. 8.5 Post -Market Adverse Reactions No post -marketing data is currently available for FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent. The following additional adverse events have been spontaneously reported d uring the post -marketing use of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose and may occur in people receiving FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent.

Sanofi Vaccine - Types A and B (Split Virion)) Page 12 of 26 9 DRUG INTERACTIONS 9.2 Drug Interactions Overview Immunosuppressive treatments may interfere with the development of the expect ed immune response. See 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS . 9.4 Drug -Drug Interactions FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent should not be mixed with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial. There are no data to assess the concomitant administration of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent with other vaccines . If FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent needs to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), immunization should always be carried out on separate limbs. 9.7 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions Interference of F LUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent with laboratory and/or diagnostic tests has not been studied. Following influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests usin g the ELISA method to detect antibodies against HIV1, hepatitis C, and especially HTLV1 have been reported. An appropriate Western Blot test should be used to confirm or disprove the results of the ELISA test. The transient false positive reactions could b e due to a non -specific IgM response induced by influenza vaccine. 10 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 10.1 Mechanism of Action The inoculation with antigen prepared from inactivated influenza virus stimulates the production of specific antibodies. Protection is highest agai nst those strains of virus from which the vaccine is prepared or closely related strains. Immunization against influenza reduces the risk of influenza illness and complications caused by infection with the strains contained in the vaccine. Global surveilla nce of influenza identifies yearly antigenic variants. For example, since 1977, antigenic variants of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. Specific levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titre post -vaccination with inactivated influenza virus vaccines have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus infection. Antibodies against one influenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virological basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual change of one or more strains in each year's influenza vaccine. Therefore, influenza vaccines are standardized to contain the hemagglutinins of influenza virus strains representing the influenza viruses likely to be circulating in the upcoming season. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended because immunity during the year after vaccination Sanofi Pasteur Product Monograph Vaccine - Types A and B (Split Virion)) Page 13 of 26 declines and because circulating strains of influenza virus change from year to year. 10.2 Pharmacodynamics Seroprotection is generally obtained wi thin 4 weeks. Adults 65 years and older generally have a heightened susceptibility to influenza -related complications due to natural and progressive weakening of the immune system over time known as immunosenescence. Immunosenescence can also render senior s less responsive to standard dose influenza vaccine. In clinical trials of adults 65 years of age and older, immunization with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose (Trivalent) induced a higher immune response to the A -strains contained in the vaccine than did immunization with a standard -dose influenza vaccine. Immune responses to FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent were shown to be non -inferior to those obtained with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose (Trivalent) in adults 65 years of age and older and statistically higher for the B strain n ot contained in FLUZONE\u00ae High Dose. See PART II: SCIE NTIFIC INFORMATION for further detail regarding clinical trials 10.3 Pharmacokinetics Duration of Effect : Protection against influenza post -vaccination is expected to persist throughout the influenza season for which the vaccine is indicated. 11 STORAGE , STABILITY AND DISPOSAL Store at 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (i.e. in a refrigerator).

In a multi -centre, double -blind efficacy study (FIM12) conducted in the United States and Canada, adults 65 years of age and older were randomized (1:1) to receive either FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose or stand ard-dose FLUZONE\u00ae vaccine. The study was conducted over two influenza seasons (2011 -2012 and 2012 -2013). The per -protocol analysis set for efficacy assessments included 15,892 FLUZONE\u00ae High - Dose recipients and 15,911 FLUZONE\u00ae recipients. The majority (67%) of participants in the per -protocol analysis set for efficacy had one or more high -risk chronic comorbid conditions. The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of laboratory -confirmed influenza (as determined by culture or polymerase chain react ion) caused by any influenza viral type/subtype in association with influenza -like illness (ILI), defined as a new onset (or exacerbation) of at least one of the following respiratory symptoms: sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing, or difficulty breathing; concurrent with at least one of the following systemic signs or symptoms: temperature >37.2\u00b0C, chills, tiredness, headaches or myalgia. Vaccine - Types A and B (Split Virion)) Page 17 of 26 Participants were monitored for the occurrence of a respiratory illness by both active and passive surveill ance, starting 2 weeks post -vaccination for approximately 7 months. After an episode of respiratory illness, nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for analysis; attack rates and vaccine efficacy were calculated. As shown in Table 5 , FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose vaccine demonstrated superior efficacy compared to FLUZONE\u00ae in preventing laboratory -confirmed ILI (p -value against H 0:VE 9.1% = 0.022 one -sided).

The objective was to demonstrate the non -inferiority of the immune response to FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent as compared to FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose in adults 65 years of age and older, as assessed by HAI (hemagglutinin inhibition) Geometric mean antibo dy titres (GMTs) at Day 28 and seroconversion rates. A total of 2,670 adults 65 years of age or older were randomized to receive either one dose of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent [QIV -HD] or one dose of High of two formulations of or TIV -HD2]); each TIV -HD formulation contained a B strain that corresponds to one of the two B strains in FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent (either a B strain of the Yamagata lineage or a B strain of the Victoria lineage). The mean ag e was 72.9 years in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent group (ranged from 65 through 100 years) and the mean age was 73.0 in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose group (ranged from 65 through 95 years). 35.4% of participants in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent grou p and 35.8% of participants in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose group were 75 years of age or older. The immunogenicity results of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent in the QHD00013 study are summarized Table 6 a and Table 6b .

Therefore, the Type I error was not inflated and the adjustment for alpha was not needed for multiple sta tistical testing. Sanofi Pasteur Product Vaccine - Types A and B (Split Virion)) Page 20 of 26 Immunogenicity of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent was found to be non -inferior to FLUZONE\u00ae High - Dose. The pre -defined non -inferiority immunogenicity criteria for FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose met for both GMTs and seroconversion r ates for all four of the influenza strains common between the two vaccines. Additionally, FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent induced a higher immune response, as measured by GMTs and seroconversion rates, with respect to the additional B strain than the immun e response induced by FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose that does not contain the corresponding B. The efficacy results of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose are thus inferred to FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent given the demonstration of non -inferiority FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose immunogenicity FLUZONE\u00ae High formulation) is relevant to FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent since both vaccines are manufactured according to similar pro cesses and have overlapping compositions. In a multi -centre, double -blind controlled study (FIM05) conducted in the United States, adults 65 years of age and older were randomized to receive either FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose or the standard -dose FLUZONE\u00ae vaccine ( 2006 -2007 formulation). The objective was to demonstrate superiority of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose over a standard dose inactivated influenza vaccine containing 15 micrograms of each strains (2 A strains and 1 B strain), as assessed by seroconversion rates and GMT s. A total of 3,851 participants were included in immunogenicity assessments; of these, 2,576 randomized 1,275 were randomized to FLUZONE\u00ae. Females accounted for 51.3% of participants in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose group and 54.7% of participants in the FLUZONE\u00ae group. In both groups, the mean age was 72.9 years (ranged from 65 through 97 years in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose group and 65 through 94 years in the FLUZONE\u00ae group); 35% of participants in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose group and 36% of participants in the FLUZONE\u00ae group were 75 years of age or older. The primary endpoints of the study were hemagglutination inhibition (HI) GMTs and seroconversion rates 28 days after vaccination. Pre -specified statistical superiority criteria required that the lower limit (LL) of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the GMT ratio (FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose divided by FLUZONE\u00ae) be greater than 1.50 for at least two of the strains, and if one strain failed, non -inferiority of that strain must be demonstrated (LL>0.67), and th at the lower limit of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the seroconversion rate difference (FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose minus FLUZONE\u00ae) be greater than 10% for at least two of the strains, and if one strain failed, non -inferiority of that strain must be demonstrated (LL> -10%). As shown in Table 7 statistically superior HI GMTs and seroconversion rates after vaccination with FLUZONE\u00ae High - Dose compared to FLUZONE\u00ae were demonstrated for influenza A subtypes, A (H1N1) and A (H3N2), but not for in fluenza type B. For strain B, non -inferiority of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose compared to FLUZONE\u00ae was demonstrated for both the HI GMTs and seroconversion rates.

Predefined superiority criterion for seroconversion: the lower limit of the two -sided 95% CI of the difference of the seroconversion rates (FLUZONE\u00ae High - Dose minus FLUZONE\u00ae) is >10%. The adjustment for alpha was not needed for statistical multiple testing as the overall Type I error was no higher than 0.05 under the most conservative statistical as sumptions to demonstrate at least 2 strains being superior for FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose to FLUZONE\u00ae given that at most 1 strain was superior when one -sided alpha 0.025 for superiority was used. According to the criteria set in the protocol, FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose e licited a superior immune response compared to a standard dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine for both A -strains as measured by seroconversion rates and GMTs.

This leaflet is a summary and will not tell you everything about this drug . Talk to your healthcare professional about your medical condition and treatment and ask if there is any new in formation about FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent . What is ? FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent is a vaccine used to prevent influenza in adults 65 years of age and older to protect against four d ifferent types of influenza viruses (two A strains and two B strains) contained in the vaccine. You cannot catch influenza from this vaccine as the virus has been killed and split into small particles that are not infectious. The National Advisory Committ ee on Immunization (NACI) advises yearly influenza vaccination for all Canadians who are able to have the vaccine. For more information about influenza and the vaccine, see the NACI Statement on Seasonal Influenza Vaccines for this year. (https://www.can -health/services/immunization/national High -Dose Quadrivalent causes your body to produce its own protection against four different types of influenza virus (2 A strains and 2 B strains). After you get a flu shot, your immune system produces antibodies against the strains of virus that are in the vaccine. Your body takes up to 4 weeks after vaccination to produce antibodies. The antibodies a re effective for the duration of the flu season. When you are exposed to the virus, the antibodies will help to keep you from getting sick. If you do get the flu, you may not be as sick. FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent contains four times the amount of kil led, split virus particles for each type compared to standard -dose influenza vaccines. The higher dose is intended to give people 65 years and older a better immune response and, therefore, better protection against the flu. As with all vaccines, FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent does not protect 100% of people immunized. What are the ingredients in FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent ? This vaccine complies with the WHO (World Health Organization) recommendation (Northern hemisphere) for the 2022 -2023 season. Med icinal ingredients: Each 0.7 mL dose of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Quadrivalent contains 60 mcg of killed split viruses from each of the four strains of influenza virus for the 2022 -2023 season. The viruses Vaccine - Types A and B (Split Virion)) Page 24 of 26 - A/Victoria/2570/ 2019 (H1N1)pdm09 -like strain - B/Phuket/3073/2013 -like strain.

Talk about any health conditions or problems you may have, including if you: Have any diseases of the immune system or are having treatment that affects the immune system. The vaccine may provide you with a lower level of protection than it does for people with healthy immune systems. Have a bleeding disorder or are taking blood -thinning medications. Tell the person giving you the injection about your condition. There is a risk of excessive bleeding at the injection site if the vaccine is not given carefully. Have an allergy to egg protein or any component of the vaccine. Have a fever or serious illness. Wait until you are better before receiving the flu shot. A person who ha s a mild illness (such as a mild cold) may have the flu shot. Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. Have a history of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks after a previous influenza vaccination. Have fainted with a previous injection. Fainting can occur after, or even before, any vaccination. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent falling injury.
